(the company at that time having the Boston bus contract), to terminate the employment of thirty-seven drivers, among whom was Carl Poekel. Two and one-half years later, an arbitrator decided that the committee acted without sufficient cause with regard to Poekel and that he should be reinstated with full back pay. The committee, which had agreed with the defendant (the union) to be bound by the arbitration, brought suit to vacate the award, and the union sought to confirm the award. The judge confirmed the award insofar as it ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>back pay, and vacated that portion of the award calling for reinstatement of Poekel. Both the committee and the union have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">There is a threshold difficulty. The committee\u2019s complaint filed February 3, 1988, recites that its action is brought under authority of G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11. However, on August 2, 1989, more than one year later, the Supreme Judicial Court announced in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Regents of Higher Educ., </em>405 Mass. 475 (1989), that the word \u201cparty\u201d in G. L. c. 150C refers only to the parties to a collective bargaining agreement, that is to say, a labor organization and an employer, <em>id. </em>at 480, and therefore an individual member of the union had no standing to maintain an action against the employer under the provisions of c. 150C, \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The committee, like the union member in Miller, has no standing to maintain an action brought under c. 150C, \u00a7 11; it is not a labor organization, it is not the employer of the bus drivers represented by the union, and it was not a party to the collective bargaining agreement between the union and the National School Bus Service, Inc., the successor to ARA Services, Inc. (the employer). The committee was a party, however, along with the union as the other party, to an arbitration agreement dated June, 1987.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There the committee and the union agreed to be bound by the decision of an arbitrator in respect of \u201call outstanding claims and grievances\u201d arising out of the termination of the employment of Poekel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>That arbitration agreement, though not derived from any collective bargaining agreement, is sufficient to permit the committee to maintain this action against the union as the other party to the arbitration agreement, under G. L. c. 251, \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq., and this discussion proceeds on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">We note also that the union acted outside the scope of its collective bargaining agreement with the employer and entered into the arbitration agreement with the committee to whom it owed neither contractual nor statutory obligations, see G. L. c. 150A, \u00a7 4B, omitting, meanwhile, the real parties in interest, Carl Poekel, and Poekel\u2019s employer. Poekel, as the intended beneficiary of the arbitration agreement, had, and continues to have, the right to enforce the terms of the arbitration agreement as well as the award that emerged from the arbitration process. See <em>Rae </em>v. <em>Air-Speed, Inc., </em>386 Mass. 187, 193-196 (1982). Similarly the committee entered into an arbitration agreement in respect of a grievance of a person who was not its employee.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Both parties, in any event, agreed to be bound by the decision of the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Additional facts are these. On October 19, 1987, a little more than one month after the decision of the court referred to in note 3, <em>supra, </em>and only four days before the scheduled beginning of the arbitration proceedings on October 23, 1987, counsel for the committee notified the employer\u2019s counsel that, notwithstanding the employer\u2019s contract with the committee giving the committee the right to control arbitration proceedings,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the committee would not participate in the arbitration hearings and would not assume control of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>case. The proffered explanation was the decision of this court holding that bus drivers were not employees of the committee, see note 3, <em>supra. </em>Evidently the committee expected, in this fashion, to extricate itself from the arbitration agreement. But the committee seems to have misunderstood its position. The arbitration hearings referred to in the committee\u2019s contract with the employer meant, no doubt,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> arbitration proceedings between the union and the employer arising under the collective bargaining agreement, and not those arising as a result of the arbitration agreement signed by the committee and the union and to which the committee expressly had bound itself. Without the consent of the union, the committee\u2019s belated attempt to be free of its arbitration agreement with the union was obviously futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Thus it was, in any event, that the committee did not appear at, or participate in, the arbitration hearings. The employer did appear, however, in spite of the fact that it was not a party to the arbitration agreement and it could easily have avoided the entire arbitration proceedings merely by being absent. Instead it elected to appear at the hearings and there announced, according to the arbitrator\u2019s report, that it was not present as a representative of the committee. It would seem, then, that the employer was there on its own behalf to protect its own interests as Poekel\u2019s employer. So far as appears from the record before us, neither the union nor the arbitrator objected to the de facto intervention of the employer, or suggested that the employer formally be made a party to the proceedings. The employer offered no witnesses but, according to the arbitrator\u2019s report, it cross-examined the union\u2019s witnesses, argued the merits and filed a brief in support of its position.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>One additional fact that was before the arbitrator must be recited. The arbitration agreement covered not only Poekel but also one Jose Herrera, another bus driver who had been discharged at the direction of the committee. The arbitrator recited in her report that the committee decided that Herrera should be reinstated, and he was reinstated by the employer with full back pay.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The arbitrator concluded that the committee \u201cdoes have the ability to remedy employee problems by getting the company to hire people at the [committee\u2019s] instigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">Following the arbitration hearings, the arbitrator filed her report. She found that the committee did not have sufficient cause to direct the termination of Poekel, that the committee \u201cshall reinstate Carl Poekel,\u201d and Poekel shall be made whole for any wages lost, less unemployment compensation and other income received that he would not have earned if driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The employer, though it participated in the hearings as fully as though it were a party, has taken no further action. The committee, which up to that point had declined to participate in the arbitration hearings (except for a brief appearance at a supplemental hearing on remedy), then filed a complaint in the Superior Court to vacate the award of the arbitrator. The union\u2019s counterclaim sought to confirm the award. The judge confirmed the award insofar as it awarded back pay and vacated the award insofar as it ordered reinstatement. Judgment was entered on January 17, 1989, four months before the Supreme Judicial Court issued its opinion in <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>J. Farmer &amp; Co., </em>407 Mass. 1006 (1990). That case, where the relevant authorities are collected, reaffirms earlier authority and controls the outcome of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>The <em>J. Farmer &amp; Co. </em>case held that mere ambiguity in an arbitrator\u2019s award is not an adequate reason for refusing to enforce the award, \u201c \u2018even when it permits the inference of a want of authority.\u2019 \u201d 407 Mass. at 1007, quoting from <em>Morceau </em>v. <em>Gould-National Batteries, Inc., </em>344 Mass. 120, 124 (1962). On its face, the arbitrator\u2019s award in <em>J. Farmer &amp; Co. </em>violated a clause in the contract, but the court held that the arbitrator \u201ccould have found that that clause was modified or waived. ...\u201d 407 Mass. at 1007-1008.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Assuming, but not deciding, that the committee is correct that the arbitrator exceeded her authority by ordering the committee to \u201creinstate\u201d \u2014 that is, hire \u2014 a person who was not ever the committee\u2019s employee,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the arbitrator may have intended something.quite different. As noted earlier, the arbitrator expressly found that the committee in another case decided that the discharged driver, Herrera, should be reinstated, and that the employer thereupon reinstated him. With that as undisputed background, the arbitrator could be understood to have meant that the committee is required to instruct the employer to reinstate Poekel. The committee\u2019s brief offers no answer to this interpretation of the award which was put forward by the union in its brief. As in <em>J. Farmer &amp; Co., </em>the arbitrator could have found, as the predicate to her award, that the arbitration agreement between the committee and the union had been modified and expanded by the conduct of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">By arguments that come perilously close to being unconscionable, the committee seeks to avoid entirely the foreseeable consequences of its arbitration agreement, voluntarily undertaken, to resolve \u201call outstanding claims and grievances between the United Steelworkers of America . . . and the Boston School Dept, relating to the suspension and dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>charges of Carl Pokel <em>[sic]. </em>. . .\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The arbitrator, in direct response to the principal question put to her \u2014 \u201cDid the School Department have sufficient cause to direct the termination of the grievant . . .?\u201d \u2014 found that Poekel had been wronged by the committee without justification and as a result had been damaged. That wrong requires a remedy \u2014 a principle which in this country is at least as old as <em>Marbury </em>v. <em>Madison, </em>1 Cranch 137, 163 (1803). See <em>Normand </em>v. <em>Barkei, </em>385 Mass. 851, 852 n.1 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">There is no genuine issue with regard to the back pay order. At a second hearing before the arbitrator, the union and the committee (which, after filing suit in the Superior Court, had decided to participate in the hearings on remedy) agreed on a formula for determining the amount due Poekel in the event the award is confirmed. That stipulation is now to be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The union presses for attorney\u2019s fees, but neither Federal law nor policy is involved as was the case in <em>International Assn. of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Wkrs. </em>v. <em>Texas Steel Co., </em>538 F.2d 1116, 1121 (5th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1095 (1977). The arbitrator made no such award; there is nothing in G. L. c. 251 that suggests the appropriateness of such an award, contrast G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 6(2)(B) (injunctions in labor disputes); the common law of the Commonwealth is to the contrary, <em>Fuss </em>v. <em>Fuss (No. 1), </em>372 Mass. 64, 70-71 (1977); and proceedings under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, not having been initiated, are not before us for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">The judgment is vacated and a new judgment is to be entered confirming the award of the arbitrator in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b78-7\">There are three agreements involved in this controversy, (i) the collective bargaining agreement between the union and the bus company, (ii) the arbitration agreement between the committee and the union with regard to Poekel\u2019s claim that he was discharged without sufficient cause, and (iii) the agreement between the committee and the bus company which sets the contractual terms of their relationship. The first is referred to as the \u201ccollective bargaining agreement,\u201d the second as the \u201carbitration agreement\u201d and the third as the \u201ccontract.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b78-8\">The question put to the arbitrator was, \u201cDid the School Department have sufficient cause to direct the termination of the grievant?\u201d Under its contract with the bus company, the committee had the right to call for the termination of the employment of any \u201cunfit\u201d bus driver.

App. Ct. 721, 723, 725 n.8 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b79-7\">The arbitration agreement was signed in June, 1987.

App. Ct. 721 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b79-8\">The right to control all grievance proceedings, including arbitration hearings, was no doubt based on the fact that the contract between the parties was essentially a \u201ccost-plus\u201d contract; since the committee picked up the charges, it evidently insisted on controlling expenses. See <em>School Comm. of Boston </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Commn., </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 721, 726-727 (1987).
