L. c. 119. Approximately one year later, the department filed a petition under G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3, to dispense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>with parental consent to adoption. On nine occasions, a District Court reviewed and renewed the original temporary custody order. When Seth was two and one-half years old, a Probate Court judge, acting under special assignment, heard both the care and protection and the G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3, petitions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After a four-day trial, the judge filed comprehensive findings of fact and conclusions of law. Among the latter were his conclusions that Seth\u2019s mother and father were unfit to care and provide for their son and that it was in the child\u2019s best interests that the G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3, petition be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Neither of Seth\u2019s parents appeals the award of permanent custody to the department pursuant to G. L. c. 119, and only the mother<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appeals from the decree entered under G. L. c. 210, \u00a7 3, dispensing with parental consent to adoption. The mother claims that the judge \u201cstepped entirely out of the role of neutral arbiter and became an advocate for the [department],\u201d thereby violating her right to due process. She also argues that she was substantially prejudiced by the erroneous admission in evidence of communications between her and her psychotherapist, contrary to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We find neither prejudice nor due process violation and, therefore, affirm the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">At the time of the trial, the mother was a patient at a mental health facility. Counsel for the department, in her opening statement, referred to the mother as suffering from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>\u201cmental disorders\u201d and to her long history of hospitalizations. There followed the testimony of a department social worker who made repeated reference to the mother\u2019s involvement with mental health treatment. The judge, reasonably assuming that the department\u2019s case was grounded principally on evidence of specific mental illness, interrupted this testimony to inquire of department\u2019s counsel, who apparently was inexperienced in these matters,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cAre you going to have a psychiatrist testify as to her diagnosis and prognosis?\u201d The response was \u201c[N]o .... We will go with the [guardian ad litem\u2019s] report, the records, the [social] workers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Repeated judicial suggestions that a \u201cmental health person\u201d ought to testify prompted department\u2019s counsel to state that she was prepared to argue the admissibility of the records of the mother\u2019s psychiatric treatment. Noting that the records consisted of sixteen envelopes standing two feet high, the judge stated: \u201c[TJhat\u2019s not how these things are supposed to be done.\u201d Counsel for the department did not press further to have the records admitted directly in evidence. Instead, during the testimony of the guardian ad litem, she offered to introduce his entire report, appended to which were the same records of psychiatric treatment. When counsel for the mother objected, on hearsay grounds, to the admission of the appended records, the judge sustained the objection and allowed only the report to be admitted. The apparent reliance by department\u2019s counsel on the contents of the records of the mother\u2019s treatment caused the judge to make several further suggestions that the testimony of a psychiatrist be offered. Eventually, he unequivocally ordered.her to have a psychiatrist in court \u201cright away\u201d and refused a request for a continuance, noting that it would result in the loss of court time which had been set aside for the case. The next day, counsel for the department offered the testimony of a psychiatrist who had never treated or seen the mother. After the psychiatrist testified to her qualifications, she requested an opportunity to review the mother\u2019s treatment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>records. The judge suspended the hearing for that day, describing \u201c[wjhat would be helpful, what I think I would like from [the psychiatrist].\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">On the following day, the psychiatrist testified on the basis of her review of the report of the guardian ad litem, the notes of a department social worker, and the records of some of the mother\u2019s hospitalizations. After sustaining objections to several questions put to the psychiatrist by the department\u2019s counsel, the judge made suggestions as to the form of questions to be asked and finally posed questions directly to the witness. The psychiatrist testified to the mother\u2019s history and psychiatric diagnoses as contained in the hospital records. She also described the behavioral manifestations of such diagnoses and opined as to the mother\u2019s current parental fitness and prognosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">During the first day of the psychiatrist\u2019s testimony, counsel for the mother indicated that she might have some problem with \u201cprivileged information\u201d contained in the records reviewed by the psychiatrist and with \u201chearsay ... as the basis of the expert\u2019s opinion,\u201d but made no objection to the forced production of the witness.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thereafter, counsel for the mother successfully objected to certain preliminary questions put to the psychiatrist by the department\u2019s counsel but, somewhat understandably, fell silent when the judge took over the questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Prior to the psychiatrist\u2019s testimony, the judge peppered the proceedings with commentary on the evidence. His effu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>sions ranged from references to psychiatric evidence as \u201cthe essential element of the case\u201d to a statement that \u201cI don\u2019t think the case is going to turn on it.\u201d On one occasion, he intimated that he was left to decide \u201con surmise.\u201d On another, he stated that \u201cprobably the facts are not close.\u201d He also expressed concern over how an appellate court would view the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Notwithstanding the judge\u2019s insistence upon the department offering psychiatric testimony and his involvement in the examination of the psychiatrist, his findings, for the most part, were not dependent on that testimony. Fifty of fifty-one of his subsidiary findings were based on the evidence introduced through the social workers and the guardian ad litem. We summarize those findings. The mother was thirty years old and unmarried when Seth was born. The father, who never married the mother, was in prison both at the time of the child\u2019s birth and at the time of the trial. The mother had first been a patient at a mental health facility when she was fourteen years old. As of the time of the trial, she had a nineteen-year history of psychiatric intervention, had experienced lengthy hospitalizations, both voluntary and involuntary, and had been an inpatient at a mental health facility for the last nine months. The judge found that the care and protection petition had been filed as a result of the department having received reports of the mother experiencing psychological problems and that \u201c[s]he became extremely stressed while caring for [Seth].\u201d When the department first acquired legal custody of Seth, he was placed in the physical custody of the mother\u2019s parents. After two weeks of this arrangement, Seth\u2019s grandmother notified the department that she was unable to care for such a young child and requested that he be removed from her home. For approximately two years thereafter, Seth resided with foster parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The mother\u2019s contact with Seth for the two-year period following his removal from her custody consisted of weekly visits of no more than two and one-half hours duration. All but three of the visits were supervised by department personnel. The judge found that the unsupervised visits were termi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>noted by the department due to the mother\u2019s inability to care for Seth by herself. For approximately a year and one-half, the visits generally took place at the mother\u2019s apartment. Thereafter, they took place at the mental health center at which she was a patient. All visitation arrangements were made by the department. At no time did the mother attempt to increase the frequency or time of visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">During Seth\u2019s placement in foster care, the department attempted to teach the mother how properly to care for him. Department personnel provided homemaker services to the mother and demonstrated parental skills during the visitations. The department also attempted to implement several service plans directed at assisting the mother in acquiring such skills. The judge found that she was \u201cextremely resistant to the services provided for her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The mother never learned to diaper or feed Seth properly. During visits she was unable to focus her attention on her child. She spent much of her visitation time discussing with her social worker the problems she had experienced with various support agencies and professionals. During such discussions she ignored the child\u2019s presence. As a result of the mother\u2019s inattention during various visits, Seth endangered himself on several occasions. During one of the three unsupervised visits, the mother locked herself out of her apartment with the child inside. The judge found that \u201c[s]he panicked at not being able to solve this problem and relied on the social worker to gain access to the apartment.\u201d He also found that \u201c[h]cr actions during visits demonstrated that she did not have any insight into the care of her minor child\u201d and that she was generally unaware of safety hazards. The judge further found that the mother had alienated herself from her family and from much of the community support which had been available to her. Some of this alienation was the result of her penchant for making repeated and harassing telephone calls to persons attempting to help her.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">After Seth had been in foster care for two years, the department shifted its focus from attempting reunification of Seth with his mother to planning for his adoption. As a re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>suit, visits were reduced in frequency to once a month. During the nine months before trial, the visits with his mother at the mental health center were extremely stressful to Seth and often caused him to vomit and sob prior to, during, and after the visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The mother admitted to her social worker that she was unable to care for her child or tolerate him for any period longer than a few hours. As of the time of the trial, the mother had given up the lease on her apartment and did not have a place to live aside from the mental health facility in which she was a patient. The judge found that, despite the efforts of both the mother and the department, she never learned to care for her child adequately. He also found that she was unable to provide a safe and stable environment for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The judge, in findings which specifically were supported by the unobjected-to report and testimony of the guardian ad litem, detailed various mental disorders suffered by the mother and described how these disorders manifested themselves in \u201cmood fluctuations, impulsive self-destructive behavior, suicidal threats and antisocial behavior.\u201d He concluded that the mother was \u201cincapable of dealing with everyday problems that arise while parenting\u201d and did not have \u201cthe ability or capacity to assume parental responsibility for [Seth].\u201d He further found that there was \u201cno projected time when the mother will be able to assume parental responsibility.\u201d In a paragraph entitled \u201cDiscussion,\u201d the judge stated that the mother\u2019s \u201cmental disorder prevents her from effectively parenting [Seth].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">As of the time of trial, Seth was in good health and had been living with his proposed adoptive parents for over four months. He had been accepted by them as a member of their family and was interacting well with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">The finding which relied primarily on the testimony of the psychiatrist specifically described various diagnoses of the mother\u2019s mental state which had been made over the years and included a brief description of the behavioral characteristics of those disorders. It also contained the conclusion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>\u201c[t]he mother\u2019s prognosis is poor\u201d and that she was \u201cunlikely to develop the skills necessary to parent [Seth].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\"><em>Judicial conduct. </em>Article 29 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights guarantees to every citizen the right \u201cto be tried by judges as . . . impartial ... as the lot of humanity will admit.\u201d The mother argues essentially that the judge, by his words and actions during the trial, betrayed a bias in favor of the department and denied her the impartial justice to which she was entitled. The mother confuses the judge\u2019s extraordinary, and perhaps inappropriate, involvement and commentary with a lack of impartiality. A close reading of the transcript of the trial indicates no violation of the \u201cstrict and lofty standard\u201d of art. 29. <em>King </em>v. <em>Grace, </em>293 Mass. 244, 247 (1936). Contrary to the perceptions of some,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> a judge is \u201cnot a mere functionary to preserve order and lend ceremonial dignity to the proceedings\u201d but rather \u201cthe directing and controlling mind at the trial.\u201d <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Wellesley &amp; Boston St. Ry., </em>197 Mass. 495, 502 (1908). A judge is expected to be more than a referee. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hanscomb, </em>367 Mass. 726, 732 (1975) (Hennessey, J., concurring). He \u201cneed take no vow of silence,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haley, </em>363 Mass. 513, 519 (1973), quoting Lummus, The Trial Judge 19 (1937).. Today, when judges are expected to be docket managers, the interests of efficiency often impel them to become more openly involved in avoiding unnecessary continuation and retrial of their cases than in more leisurely times.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The judge did not assume an active role in this action until the second day of trial. By then, he had heard the testimony of two social workers which, for the most part, established the department\u2019s case. It was only then that he began to suggest that a psychiatrist be called to testify. Whether that involvement was spurred by a mistaken notion of the dependence of the department\u2019s case on psychiatric evidence or by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>an understandable desire to avoid retrial is immaterial. What is significant is that his suggestions, orders, and comments were based on impressions formed from participation in the case and not from prejudicial information gleaned from an extrajudicial source. An opinion, developed from information acquired in the course of presiding over a case, does not disqualify a judge from rendering a decision in that matter. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Grinnell Corp., </em>384 U.S. 563, 583 (1966). <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Justice of the Dist. Ct., </em>356 Mass. 367, 379 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">A judge has the right and, in some circumstances, the duty to participate in the examination of a witness. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Festa, </em>369 Mass. 419, 422 (1976). The participation of the judge in the questioning of the psychiatrist was primarily a reflection of impatience with the inability of department\u2019s counsel to pose proper questions. If he was overzealous in becoming so involved, the error was harmless in view of our conclusion, set forth below, that no prejudice resulted from the testimony of the psychiatrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">The mother, by selective focus on some of the judge\u2019s remarks, argues they are proof of his reliance, in his findings, on erroneously admitted psychiatric evidence. Selective focus on other of his remarks, however, supports the opposite conclusion. In any event, such random comments during this trial, while better unspoken, at most reflect initial impressions and should not be permitted to restrict or color the judge\u2019s ultimate written findings,- entered after all the evidence had been considered. \u201cThe essentials of sound judicial character lie far deeper than superficial deportment.\u201d <em>Harrington </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry., </em>229 Mass. 421, 433 (1918).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\"><em>Psychiatric evidence. </em>That portion of the psychiatrist\u2019s testimony which described and depended upon the diagnoses of the mother\u2019s mental condition appearing in various hospital records should not have been permitted. The mother\u2019s counsel sufficiently objected to such testimony on both hearsay and privilege grounds. An out-of-court diagnosis is inadmissible in the absence, of an exception to the hearsay rule. <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Lewis/Boyle, Inc., </em>408 Mass. 269, 274 (1990). Liacos, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Massachusetts Evidence 112-113 (5th ed. 1981). General Laws c. 233, \u00a7 79G, does not supply such an exception absent a pretrial notice of intention to offer a report containing a physician\u2019s diagnosis. <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Lewis/Boyle, Inc., supra. </em>In any event, it is doubtful that the provision for the admission in evidence of an out-of-court diagnosis of a physician pursuant to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79G, would apply to a psychiatric diagnosis protected by G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The department argues that the opinion testimony of the psychiatrist was properly admitted since it was based upon admissible information contained in out-of-court reports of the mother\u2019s treatment. It is established that an expert may \u201cbase an opinion on facts or data not in evidence if the facts or data are independently admissible and are a permissible basis for an expert to consider in formulating an opinion.\u201d <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>398 Mass. 516, 531 (1986). The mother does not contend that the information relied upon by the psychiatrist is not \u201cof the sort that experts in that specialty reasonably rely on in forming their opinions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 532. The issue raised, therefore, is whether that information is independently admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Although the hospital records upon which the psychiatrist based her testimony are not before us, even as identification exhibits,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> one reasonably may infer from that testimony that they include \u201ccommunications\u201d of the mother to a \u201cpsychotherapist\u201d as those terms are defined by G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B, and, therefore, are generally subject to the privilege established by that statute. That fact alone may not render such records wholly inadmissible. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kobrin, </em>395 Mass. 284, 294-295 (1985). <em>Petitions of the Dept. of Social Servs. to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>399 Mass. 279, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>287 (1987).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The exercise of the privilege established by G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B, does not preclude admission of such parts of a psychiatric record as are \u201cconclusions based on objective indicia rather than on communications from the mother.\u201d <em>Adoption of Abigail, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 191, 198-199 (1986). The extent to which the psychiatrist based her testimony on objective facts or data as distinguished from communications by the mother to a treating psychotherapist is not clear. To the extent that the psychiatrist\u2019s opinions may have been grounded on such a mixed foundation, the recommended approach would be for the mother\u2019s counsel to request a voir dire to determine the basis of the expert opinion. See <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, supra </em>at 532. Such assertiveness is perhaps more than should be expected from an attorney, in a nonjury trial, confronted with a judge posing questions to a witness whose presence had been commanded by the judge. In these circumstances, it behooved the judge to make certain that the witness\u2019s testimony was based upon admissible information. His failure to do so is rendered harmless, however, by the absence of substantial prejudice to the mother. <em>Adoption of Christine, </em>405 Mass. 602, 606 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\"><em>Absence of substantial prejudice. </em>The mother has not shown that the erroneous admission of the psychiatrist\u2019s testimony has \u201cinjuriously affected\u201d her \u201csubstantial rights\u201d. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7\u00a7 119 and 132. The evidence introduced by the department, independent of the testimony of the psychiatrist, was uncontroverted and unchallenged.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The judge\u2019s subsidiary findings are specific and detailed and demonstrate close attention to that evidence and sensitivity to the gravity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>of the issues presented.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Custody of Two Minors, </em>396 Mass. 610, 619 (1986). To the extent that the judge\u2019s unfitness conclusion was based on the mother\u2019s mental illness, the necessary nexus was supplied by evidence introduced through the guardian ad litem and the social workers. <em>Custody of a Minor (No. 2), </em>378 Mass. 712, 722 (1979). See also <em>Care &amp; Protection of Stephen, </em>401 Mass. 144, 152 (1987). Those findings which are grounded on nonprivileged evidence overwhelmingly support the judge\u2019s conclusions. Compare <em>Adoption of Christine, </em>supra; <em>Adoption of Adam, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 922, 925 (1986). They amply fulfil the requirement that evidence supporting the termination of parental rights be clear and convincing. <em>Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer, </em>455 U.S. 745, 769-770 (1982).
