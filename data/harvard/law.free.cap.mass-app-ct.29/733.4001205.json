The findings of the Probate Court judge are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">On December 16, 1971, Sartain Smith, a resident of the District of Columbia and owner of a cottage on Nantucket, \u201cAuld Lang Syne\u201d (the property), died. He left a \u201cwill\u201d naming his companion, Mishi Kamiya, executrix and sole heir of his estate, which included the Nantucket property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the will lacked the necessary signature of a witness to Smith\u2019s signature, the Probate Division of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia disallowed it and ruled that Smith died intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">On or about June 22, 1972, Audrey Maum, Smith\u2019s sister and legal heir, signed and filed a \u201cWaiver of Next of Kin,\u201d approving the appointment of Kamiya as administratrix of Smith\u2019s estate, and a \u201cWaiver of Interest in Estate.\u201d The latter, which is the fulcrum of the present dispute, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-9\">\u201cI, Audrey Maum, a resident of the state of Alabama, and an adult, and the sole heir at law and next of kin of Sartain Smith, deceased, out of consideration of my love and affection for my late departed brother, Sartain Smith, and acknowledging his wishes although not set forth in such form as to be granted probate within the District of Columbia, do hereby transfer, assign and convey all my right, title and interest as an intestate beneficiary of my late brother\u2019s estate to Mishi Kamiya of Washington, D.C.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7z\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>Each waiver was signed by two witnesses. Pursuant to the \u201cWaiver of Next of Kin,\u201d the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (acting in its capacity as a Probate Court) named Kamiya administratrix of Smith\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Kamiya subsequently sought and received appointment as administratrix of Smith\u2019s Massachusetts estate on September 14, 1972. On October 10, 1974, Kamiya recorded a deed to the property from herself as administratrix to herself as an individual. Until her death in 1984, Kamiya paid taxes on the property, maintained and repaired it, and resided there in the summer.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">When Kamiya died on March 1, 1984, she left the property to her sister, Suga, in her will. Suga continued to pay the taxes and to maintain the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">Suga attempted to sell the property in 1986,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but she was unable to consummate the transaction due to defects in the chain of title, viz., the lack of acknowledgment of Maum\u2019s waiver of interest and Kamiya\u2019s failure to obtain a license to sell prior to transferring the property to herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">In order to clear the title to the property, Suga requested, on numerous occasions, a confirmatory deed from Maum. Maum initially \u201cdeclined to execute the deed and upon ascertaining the current value of the property has refused to do so.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After Maum\u2019s refusal to execute a confirmatory deed, Suga filed a complaint in the Nantucket Probate and Family Court on May 23, 1988, seeking an order to remove the cloud on her title and to require Maum to execute the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">The probate judge denied Maum\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. By agreement of the parties, the judge decided the case solely on the basis of the trial briefs and documentary evidence, which included the affidavit of Maum.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The probate judge entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>judgment in favor of Suga and ordered Maum to execute a confirmatory deed relative to the subject property. Maum raises three issues on appeal. We treat them seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">1. <em>The jurisdiction of the Probate Court. </em>Maum claims that the Probate Court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over this dispute and that the judge should have transferred th\u00e9 matter to the Land Court for determination. We disagree. Under' G. L. c. 185, \u00a7 1 <em>(k), </em>as amended by St. 1987, c. 421, \u00a7 2, the Land Court has concurrent jurisdiction with the Probate Court over \u201c[a] 11 cases and matters cognizable under the general principles of equity jurisprudence where any right, title or interest in land is involved, ... except actions for specific performance of contracts.\u201d See <em>Te-trault </em>v. <em>Bruscoe, </em>398 Mass. 454, 458 (1986). As this case involves removal of a cloud on title, a matter \u201ccognizable under the general principles of equity jurisprudence\u201d (G. L. c. 215, \u00a7 6, as amended by St. 1981, c. 616), the Probate Court properly exercised jurisdiction. See <em>Lagasse </em>v. <em>La-gasse, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 911, 912-913 (1985); <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Anci-porch, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 975, 976 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">2. <em>The waiver of interest. </em>The probate judge found that by its terms the \u201cwaiver of interest\u201d was actually a deed validly conveying the property from Maum to Kamiya in fee simple. Maum attacks the judge\u2019s conclusion on two grounds, the second of which we need not address.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">Maum\u2019s argument against the waiver of interest effecting a conveyance centers on procedural irregularities attending its drafting and execution. But see Swaim, Crocker\u2019s Notes on Common Forms \u00a7 407, at 224 (7th ed. 1955). Because the \u201cwaiver\u201d does not lay out the metes and bounds or even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>explicitly denote the specific parcel as the subject of the conveyance, Maum argues that it fails as a deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">The probate judge correctly ruled that despite the questionable form of the \u201cwaiver,\u201d it was sufficient to pass title from Maum to Kamiya. All that is required of a description in a deed is that it adequately identify what is being conveyed. <em>McHale </em>v. <em>Treworgy, </em>325 Mass. 381, 385 (1950). The description may be complete in itself, or it may incorporate other documents by reference. See 6A Powell &amp; Rohan, Real Property \u00a7 899[1] (1990 ed.). In her \u201cwaiver,\u201d Maum explicitly cited her brother\u2019s disallowed will and his wishes contained therein.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Smith\u2019s specific designation of the property in his will and Maum\u2019s incorporation of that document into her \u201cwaiver\u201d amply described what was being conveyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">Even if we were to find the description in the \u201cwaiver\u201d to be inadequate, this deficiency alone would not render it invalid as a deed. The general intent to convey overrides the use of an ineffective form. <em>Kaufman </em>v. <em>Federal Natl. Bank, </em>287 Mass. 97, 101 (1934). See G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 6A. Conveyances should be \u201cconstrued as to give effect to the intent of the parties\u201d as may be gleaned from \u201cthe words used, interpreted in the light of the material circumstances and pertinent facts known to them at the time\u201d of the transfer. <em>Commercial Wharf East Condominium Assn. </em>v. <em>Waterfront Parking Corp., </em>407 Mass. 123, 131 (1990) (citations omitted). See <em>Hillman </em>v. <em>Roman Catholic Bishop of Fall River, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 241, 243 (1987) (instrument of conveyance is properly construed \u201cby considering its language as illuminated by the circumstances attendant upon its drafting and delivery\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">Maum\u2019s \u201cwaiver\u201d purports to transfer to Kamiya all \u201cright, title, and interest\u201d in Smith\u2019s estate. Those particular \u201cwords have acquired in deeds a certain and definite meaning. They convey whatever title the grantor has.\u201d <em>Baker </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number><em>Davie, </em>211 Mass. 429, 439 (1912). Maum\u2019s \u201cwaiver\u201d passed to Kamiya all her interest as \u201csole heir at law and next of kin\u201d and as an \u201cintestate beneficiary of [her] late brother\u2019s estate.\u201d Maum also clearly spells out her desire that the provisions of Smith\u2019s disallowed will be effectuated through the \u201cwaiver,\u201d \u201cacknowledging his wishes although not set forth in such form as to be granted probate within the District of Columbia.\u201d This elaborate recounting of the nature of Maum\u2019s interest and her pointed reference to Smith\u2019s wishes demonstrate that she intended to convey the property to Kamiya without limitation. Compare <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>150 Mass. 168, 170-171 (1889); <em>Russo </em>v. <em>Inzirillo, </em>360 Mass. 862, 863 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Finally, to the extent any doubt remains, the actions of the parties support th.e construction the probate judge gave the waiver of interest. \u201c[W]here the language of an instrument is doubtful, evidence of the practical construction by the parties is admissible to explain and remove the doubt.\u201d <em>Commercial Wharf East Condominium Assn., </em>407 Mass. at 132, quoting from <em>Oldfield </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>304 Mass. 590, 600 (1939). After receiving the \u201cwaiver\u201d from Maum, Kamiya repaired the property, paid taxes on it, and resided there each summer. Further, since Kamiya\u2019s death and her devise to Suga of the property in 1984, Suga alone has maintained the property and paid the taxes on it. Maum evinced no interest whatsoever in the property until the receipt of Suga\u2019s request for a confirmatory deed caused her to become aware that she might still have a stake in the proceedings and to discover the dramatic escalation in the value of the property. Certainly, Maum\u2019s long-standing disinterest in the property undercuts her interpretation of the effect of the \u201cwaiver.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">3. <em>The retroactive license to sell. </em>Kamiya apparently concluded that her title would be deemed more efficacious if she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>perfected it by transferring the property from herself as ad-ministratrix of Smith\u2019s estate to herself individually. Kamiya ostensibly accomplished this on October 10, 1974, when she recorded a deed to herself in the Nantucket County registry of deeds. Although Kamiya\u2019s transfer of the property to herself was not necessarily an invalid transaction, see, e.g., <em>Dodge </em>v. <em>Lunt, </em>181 Mass. 320, 322 (1902); <em>Potter </em>v. <em>Lembo, </em>363 Mass. 881, 882 (1973), generally an administrator requires a license to sell before conveying estate property. G. L. c. 202, \u00a7\u00a7 1-20. <em>Roper </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>317 Mass. 176, 178 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Pursuant to G. L. c. 204, \u00a7 24,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the Probate Court, in 1989, properly could issue a retroactive license to sell, and confirm the deed, if the Probate Court had the power to vest title in Kamiya at the time she recorded the deed to herself in 1974. Under G. L. c. 204, \u00a7 24, \u201cno act or proceeding shall be ratified or confirmed which the [probate] court might not have passed or authorized in the first instance upon due proceedings.\u201d See <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Keyes, </em>195 Mass. 184, 187 (1907); <em>W.M. Gullicksen Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>MacNeil, </em>347 Mass. 568, 574 (1964). We think that the Probate Court would have been empowered to effect a proper transfer to Kamiya of the subject property in 1974. Pursuant to the \u201cWaiver of Next of Kin\u201d Kamiya had already received appointment as administratrix of Smith\u2019s estate in Massachusetts. As the court in 1974 would have had before it Maum\u2019s unacknowledged \u201cWaiver of Interest in Estate,\u201d it would have had the power to vest title in Kamiya at that time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>through a decree requiring Maum to acknowledge and confirm the deed. G. L. c. 204, \u00a7 24. See also G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">In addition, Kamiya was the largest creditor of the estate and personally settled the estate debts. As the amount owed to her as creditor was larger than the value of the estate (see note 1, <em>supra), </em>she would have been entitled under G. L. c. 202 as administratrix to a license to sell the property<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and thereby distribute the assets of the estate. See G. L. c. 202, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2; <em>Dudley </em>v. <em>Dudley, </em>300 Mass. 270, 275-276 (1938); <em>Lagasse </em>v. <em>Lagasse, </em>20 Mass. App.Ct. at 914.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b758-10\">In addition to the property, the decedent\u2019s estate consisted of $650 in personalty, $300 of which was located in Massachusetts, and $350 in Washington, D.C. The real property was valued at $20,000. However, the debts of the estate included $32,319.75 owed to Kamiya for money that she had lent to Smith \u201cfor the purpose of purchasing and repairing\u201d the subject property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b759-10\">The probate judge found that the purchase and sale agreement was dated October 24, 1986.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b759-12\">The value of the property has escalated significantly in the years following Maum\u2019s waiver of interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b759-13\">Because the conveyance at issue took place some sixteen years prior to the dispute and because the witnesses to the contested waivers are now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>deceased, it was not error for the judge to have decided the case without benefit of a hearing. See <em>Markell </em>v. <em>Sidney B. Pfeifer Foundation, Inc., </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 412, 429-430 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b760-9\">In the statement of facts in her brief, Maum asserts, contrary to the judge\u2019s finding, that she did not intend \u201cto permanently convey the property.\u201d This brief contention, without any authority save reference to Maum\u2019s affidavit, does not rise to the level of appellate argument, and we do not consider it. See Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975); <em>Penta </em>v. <em>Concord Auto Auction, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 635, 642 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b761-8\">In his will, Smith left to Kamiya his \u201ccottage on Nantucket Island, Mass. known as \u2018Auld Lang Syne\u2019 together with its contents,\u201d as well as \u201call the rest of [his] property including all works, books, etc. and residue of [his] property after payment of the debts &amp; expenses.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b762-7\">Because we determine the waiver of interest in the estate to be a valid conveyance, we need not reach the issue of the validity of the \u201cwaiver\u201d as a mere disclaimer of intestacy rights. It is true, as Maum points out in her brief, that a waiver or disclaimer is the legal act by which an individual abandons a right and does not normally transfer it to another. See, in this regard, <em>Chase </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 280 (1973). In her \u201cwaiver,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>however, Maum expressly \u201ctransfer [s]\u201d her interest in Smith\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"AUXQ\">For that reason we also need not reach Maum\u2019s argument, based on G. L. c. 191A, \u00a7 5, that the document fails as a waiver because it was not acknowledged. We do, however, note in passing that c. 191A did not become effective until October 29, 1975, well after the date of execution of the \u201cwaiver.\u201d See St. 1975, c. 573, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b763-12\">That provision in relevant part reads: \u201c[T]he probate court ... by reason of an alleged irregularity, . . . may hear and determine the matter and confirm the act . . . and may authorize and empower the . . . administrator ... to ratify and confirm such act or proceeding and to execute and deliver such deeds, releases, conveyances and other instruments as may be found necessary therefor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b764-7\">In due course, she might have effected a sale to herself in partial satisfaction of the debt owed her.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
