Edmonds having received a certificate of election as Superior Judge of San Francisco, his election was contested by C., and upon a recount in the Superior Court, the Court held that the former had a majority of eight votes. Upon appeal the contestant relied upon the following grounds of objection: 1. Five ballots were counted for Edmonds which read \u201cFor Judge of the Superior Court, M. A. Edwards. \u201d 2. That one ballot counted for E. was composed of a half of each of two tickets; the entire ticket of the Republican party, \u25a0 except the vignette, being attached to the vignette of the Democratic party. 3. Another ballot had the words \u201cFor President, Hancock and English\u201d written in lead pencil upon its face under the words, at the top of the names, \u201cEleventh Senatorial District.\u201d A On another ballot the contestant claimed that the name M. A. Edmonds had been erased by a pencil line drawn through it\u2014the respondent claiming that it appeared from the ballot that the pencil line had been rubbed off so as to cancel the erasure. 5. When a package of ballots from one precinct was brought into Court by a deputy clerk to be examined and counted in its turn, the seal was found broken and the strings loose, but there was no evidence that any ballot had been tampered with, and when the package came into the custody of the Court it was properly sealed. 6. Forty-two ballots of the National Greenback Labor party were counted for respondent which differed from the regular ticket of the party in the following particulars, viz.: in the vignette of the ticket were the words \u201cNinth District,\u201d instead of \u201cNinth Senatorial District;\u201d and below, the words \u201cFor Assemblyman\u201d instead of the words \u201cFor Member of the Assembly,\u201d and the words for \u201cSuperior Judge,\u201d instead of the words \u201cFor Judge of the Superior Court.\u201d 7. From one ballot of the Democratic party as originally printed the name was erased and the name of \u201c Edmundson\u201d written in its place. Upon the 1st, 2d, and 7th points the Court not being fully in accord expressed no opinion. Upon the other points <em>held </em>as follows, viz.: Upon the 3d, that the ballot was good; upon the 4th, that the question whether or not the attempted erasure had been canceled was a question for the Court below to find, and that, upon an inspection of the ballot, the question was so far doubtful that this Court was not inclined to interfere; upon the 5th, that when the package came to the Court properly sealed, the object of the law requiring it to be sealed was accomplished, and that while in the custody of its officers, in the absence of any proof, the law would not presume an act of bad faith on their part; upon the 6th, that the ballots were good. Judgment was accordingly affirmed.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-7\">Appeal from a judgment against the contestant, and from an order denying a motion for a new trial in the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco.

(Pol. Code, \u00a7 1201.) It is not contended that the names are <em>idem sonans, </em>nor that one is an abbreviation for the other. There is no likeness in the sound. (Cooley\u2019s Const. Lim., 608, 610-611; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mayworm, </em>5 Mich. 146; <em>Attorney-General </em>v. <em>Ely, </em>4 Wis. 430; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>8 Cow. 102; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>14 Barb. 259; <em>People </em>v. <em>Tisdale, </em>1 Doug. 65; <em>People </em>v. <em>Saxton, </em>22 N.

Y. 84; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cicott, 16 </em>Mich. 283; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>88 Ill. 498.) The ballot, composed the one half of the Republican ticket, and the other half of a Democratic ticket, should clearly have been rejected under sections 1206 and 1207 of the Political Code, for it is impossible to attach two pieces of different ballots together so that the device is not visible from either side when unfolded. Such a ballot is also obnoxious to sections 1196 and 1197 of the Political Code, and is really a paster; so with a ballot which has the words \u201c for Hancock and English\u201d written under the vignette. Each of these ballots, in addition to being marked ballots, are evidently calculated to and were used to deceive the voter. Ballot one hundred and twenty-three, from the same precinct, has the name scratched off, and its validity must be determined from an examination of the ballot itself. <em>(Kirk </em>v. <em>Rhoads, </em>46 Cal. 398.) The Court erred in receiving the envelope and the ballots therein contained, returned from the sixth precinct of the Eleventh Ward. When thiEi package first came to the Court it was well sealed, and when it was brought into the Court for the purpose of evidence it had been broken open; the seal was broken and the string hanging out several feet. (Pol. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1257-1266.) The party offering this envelope or package, or relying upon it as evidence, must account for its appearance or condition. (1 Greenl. Ev., \u00a7\u00a7 564-568; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1982.) The primary evidence being destroyed, the next best, the official <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>acts of the Precinct Board of Election, their tally-lists and returns must be taken under the presumption that official duty is correctly performed. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1963, Subd. 15 ; McCrary on Elections, par. 78; <em>People </em>v. <em>Halden, </em>Brightley\u2019s Election Cases, 483; <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Lehman, </em>1 Bart. 324; <em>Kline </em>v. <em>Verru, </em>1 Bart. 281; <em>Archer </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>id. 169.) The Court erred in counting for the respondent the forty-two votes of the \u201cNational Greenback Labor Party,\u201d which were printed with a device whereby each of them could be known or distinguished from all other tickets or ballots. (Pol. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1191, 1197, 1206, 1207; Statutes, March 18th, 1878, p. 180; <em>Kirk </em>v. <em>Rhoads, </em>46 Cal. 398; Cooley\u2019s Const. Lim., 605, 614; Code Civ.

On five Democratic tickets the names of all the Democratic candidates for Judges of the Superior Court were erased, and opposite the erasures was a clear attempt to write the names of the Republican candidates. Whether the voter succeeded or not was the question before the Court below. What he did was to write opposite the names of the erased Democratic candidates the names: J. F. Finn, T. K. Wilson, M. A. Edwards, J. C. Cary. On a sixth ballot Edmundson was written, instead of Edmonds. The first object in construing a ballot, as in construing any other written instrument, is to arrive at the intention of the party\u2014the voter. What that intention was must be ascertained from the ballot, it is true, but the same rule applies here that applies to other instruments, and that is, that the ballot must be construed in view of all the surrounding circumstances, and for the purpose of showing what those circumstances were, parol testimony is received. (Cooley on Const. Lim. 611; <em>Attorney-General </em>v. <em>Ely, </em>4 Wis. 429; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>88 Ill. 508; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>8 N. Y. 67, and note to above case, in Cooley on Const. Lim., 4th ed. 611; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cicott, </em>16 Mich. 317. 2. With re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>gard to the broken package, all the evidence tends to show that the seals were broken by accident in the handling of the packages, while in the custody of the Court, as many others were.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b548-5\">The Court:</author>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">At the election held November 2d, 1880, in the City and and County of San Francisco, for Judge of the Superior Court, James V. Coffey, the contestant, and M. A. Edmonds, the respondent, were voted for. The Board of Election Commissioners declared and certified the result of the election to be that M. A. Edmonds received 20,476 votes, and James V. Coffey 20,474 votes, and declared Edmonds to be elected. Thereupon Coffey contested the election of Edmonds, and after due proceedings had thereto, a recount was had in the Court below. Upon such recount the Court below held that Edmonds had received 20,491 votes, and Coffey 20,483 votes, showing a majority of eight votes for Edmonds, and adjudged that Edmonds was duly elected. From that judgment and the order denying his motion for a new trial, Coffey, the contestant, appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">1. Among the ballots were five, reading thus: \u201cFor Judge of the Superior Court, M. A. Edwards.\u201d Evidence was offered and received that there was no person by the name of Edwards who was a candidate for any office at the election; that there was no attorney residing in the City and County of San Francisco of the name of M. A. Edwards; and that Edmonds had by some persons been known as and called Edwards, on account of the similarity of pronunciation, and had paid bills of personal expenditure made out and presented to him as M. A. Edwards. The court below, against the objection of Coffey, ordered these ballots to be counted for Edmonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">2. One ballot was composed of a half of each of two tickets, thus: The vignette of a ticket of the Democratic party was taken, and attached to it, with paste or mucilage, was an entire ticket of the Republican party, except the vignette. Each of the political parties had filed a vignette, according to the provisions of-the act of March 7th, 1878, Stat. 1877-8, p. 180. No name of any of the Democratic candidates was upon the ballot in question, nor was the vignette of the Republican party upon it. Coffey was a candidate of the Dem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>ocratic party, and Edmonds of the Republican party. This ballot was, by order of the Court below, counted for Edmonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">3. A ballot had the words, \u201c For President\u2014Hancock and English,\u201d written in lead pencil, upon its face, under the words, at the top of the names, \u201c Eleventh Senatorial District.\u201d This ballot had also on its face, \u201c For Judge of the Superior Court \u2014M. A. Edmonds,\u201d and was, by order of the Court below, counted for Edmonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">4. A ballot had on its face the words, \u201c For Judge of the Superior Court\u2014M. A. Edmonds.\u201d The contestant claimed that the name, M. A. Edmonds, had been erased by a pencil line drawn through it; the respondent claimed that it appeared from the ballot that the pencil line had been rubbed off so as to cancel the erasure. This ballot also was counted for Edmonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">5. Objection was made by the contestant to the counting of the ballots coming from the sixth precinct of the Eleventh Ward. When the package came to the Court, it was properly sealed. Many days had been occupied by the Court in counting the ballots from the various precincts; and during that time the packages not in use on a particular day were kept in the safe of the clerk of the Court. It was the custom of the Judge of the Court below, upon adjourning for the day, to go to the safe with the packages, see them placed therein, and put upon the safe his private seal, and in the morning to go and break his seal and direct the package to be used that day to be taken to the court-room. When this package was brought by the deputy clerk to be examined and counted in its turn, the seal was found broken and the strings loose. There was no evidence that any ballot had been tampered with. The Judge held that the breaking of the seal on the package and the loosening of the string had occurred accidentally in the handling, while the same was in the custody of the Court and its officers, and ordered the ballots to be counted. By this count Edmonds gained five votes.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">6. The National Greenback Labor Party had a ticket and vignette. Objection was made to forty-two ballots of that party, on the ground that each of said ballots differed from the regular ticket of the party, in the following particulars: The word \u201c Senatorial\u201d was omitted from the designation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>the Senatorial District in the vignette of the ticket; thus: \u201cNinth District\u201d instead of \u201c Ninth Senatorial Districteach of said ballots contained \u201cFor Assemblyman\u201d instead of \u201cFor Members of the Assemblyand each of the ballots contained the words \u201cFor Snperior Judge\u201d instead of \u201cFor Judge of Superior Court;\u201d and it was claimed by contestant that those were distinguishing marks on said ballots, and marked them from other ballots, in violation of section 1197 of the Political Code. The Court below overruled the objection, and ordered them to be counted.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">7. From one ballot of the Democratic party, as originally printed, a name was erased, and the name of \u201c Edmundson\u201d written in its stead. This ballot was, by order of the Court below, counted for respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">According to the recount in the Court below, and the judgment of the Court thereon, the respondent, Edmonds, had a majority of eight votes; therefore it must appear that errors were committed by the Court below affecting eight ballots, or the judgment must stand. We, therefore, consider the points made by the contestant in the order as above stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-7\">1. As to the five votes cast for \u201c M. A. Edwards.\u201d We are not fully in accord as to the legality of counting these ballots for M. A. Edmonds; therefore, as our judgment in the case would not be affected thereby, we express no opinion in regard to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-8\">2. As to the ballot with the names of the candidates of the Republican party pasted to the vignette of the Democratic party. For the reason above given as to No. 1 we express no opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-9\">8. The words, \u201cFor President\u2014Hancock and English,\u201d written on the ballot did not vitiate it. It had no \u201c mark or thing thereon by or from which it could be ascertained what persons or what class of persons used or voted it.\u201d (Pol. Code, \u00a7 1197.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-10\">4. Whether or not the attempted erasure.had been canceled, so as to let the ballot stand and be intended as a vote for Edmonds, was a question for the Court below to find, and with the finding upon that subject this Court is not inclined to interfere. We can also add, from an inspection of the ballot we can not say that there is an erasure of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>name \u201cM. A. Edmonds.\u201d If it were so intended by the voter, it was so obscurely done that we feel bound to solve the doubt by holding the vote to be good for the name so plainly written.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-4\">5. In regard to the package of ballots, coming from the sixth precinct of the Eleventh Ward, we think the ruling of the Court below was correct. When the package came to the Court, properly sealed, the object of the law requiring it to be sealed was accomplished. After that time it was under the direction of the Court, in the custody of its officers\u2014and in the absence of any proof, the law will not presume an act of bad faith on their part. It is not contended that there was any such act of bad faith; the contestant contended merely that the package should have remained unbroken, even by accident, until called for to be counted. This is going too far. We think the cause of the breaking of the seal was accounted for; the Court committed no error in directing the ballots to be counted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-5\">6. The objection to the counting of the forty-two ballots of the National Greenback Labor party is untenable. What we have said, above, as to objection No. 3, will apply here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-6\">7. As to the vote for \u201c Edmundson,\u201d we say the same as above said in regard to the votes for \u201c M. A. Edwards.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">These views leave the result as giving at least one majority for M. A. Edmonds. The judgment and order of the Court below are therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
