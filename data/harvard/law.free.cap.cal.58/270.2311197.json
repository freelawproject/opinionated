Montgomery.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-10\">The complaint then alleges that on the 31st day of July, 1879, the plaintiff executed and tendered to the defendant a sufficient deed conveying one undivided half of his right, title, and interest in. said lands, and conveying all the estate previously acquired by the plaintiff, and demanded payment of the sum of seven hundred dollars and seventy-three cents, being the amount remaining unpaid on said agreement. And judgment is prayed for said sum.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-11\">The defendant pleaded the pendency of a former action for the same cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-12\">It appeared on the trial that entries had been made of the lands mentioned in the complaint, but that the entries had afterwards been canceled in the General Land Office; and that at the time that the plaintiff tendered his deed he had no interest or title in the lands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-13\">It also appeared that prior to the commencement of this action, and prior to the tender of said deed, the plaintiff brought, and there was still pending, an action against the defendant, setting up the same facts except the tender of the deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b297-14\">The plaintiff had judgment, and the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b297-15\">P. <em>Van Clief, </em>for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b297-16\"><em>Goad, Albery &amp; Goad, </em>and <em>Richard Bayne, </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Sharpstein, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">If the delivery or tender of a deed by the plaintiff to the defendant of land to which the plaintiff had no right, title, or claim, either in law or equity, was not a condition precedent to his right to maintain this action, the pendency of another suit between the same parties for the same cause of action was well pleaded and proven by the defendant. If the plaintiff\u2019s right of action had depended upon his delivery or tender to the defendant of a deed of the land described in the complaint, the fact of the plaintiff\u2019s having no right, title, dr claim to the land either in law or equity would have rendered such delivery or tender wholly ineffectual. A deed in form which conveyed no title or interest whatever in the land was utterly void, and of less value than a sheet of blank paper. The allegation therefore in respect to the delivery or tender of a deed was wholly immaterial, and being so the complaint in the latter action is essentially the same as that in the former action. If the evidence is sufficient to support the judgment in the present action, it would have authorized a judgment for the plaintiff in the former action; and that is the test for determining whether the cause of action is the same in both cases. <em>(Taylor </em>v. Castle, 42 Cal. 367.)</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The defendant was entitled to a judgment in his favor upon his plea of a former suit pending for the same cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Judgment and order, reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">Ross, J., McKinstry, J., Thornton, J., and Morrison, C.
