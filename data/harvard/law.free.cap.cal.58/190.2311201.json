B. 738; <em>Rowbotham </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>8 E. &amp; B. 123; S. C., E. C.

St. 81; <em>Gregory </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>41 Cal. 278.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b215-8\"><em>Belcher &amp; Belcher, </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-9\">The miner who selects a piece of ground to work must take it as he finds it, subject to prior rights which have an equal equity. <em>(Irwin </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>5 Cal. 147; <em>Logan </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em>19 id. 625; <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Bumpus, </em>46 id. 218.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-10\">The rule of lateral support invoked by the plaintiff has no application to cases like this. The general rule that a party in possession of the surface of land is entitled to the lateral support which the adjacent soil affords, was adopted and has been used for the protection of land which is held and cherished by the owner for <em>itself, </em>and not merely put to use for an ulterior object. The ground in question here is mining ground. It was taken up for mining purposes. Its only value is found in the gold it contains. It was located that it might be torn down and washed away. If the rule of lateral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>support should be applied to mining claims, adjacent claims, made up of deep banks of earth, could never be worked out, for neither owner could work to the line without causing the other\u2019s claim to cave. If applied here it must effectually prevent the ground being mined by either party. The true rule, when applied to the working of mining claims, is found in <em>Esmond </em>v. Chew, 15 Cal. 143, and <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Willett, </em>35 id. 549.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b216-4\">Ross, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Plaintiff and defendant owned adjoining mining claims. Which was the prior location does not appear. The claims were what are known as \u201c deep diggings,\u201d and such as are worked by the hydraulic process. In mining its own ground the defendant washed away the gravel to a point distant, in one place, seventy feet, and at other places from one hundred to one hundred and fifty feet from the plaintiff\u2019s claim. At these points the bank was deep, and the result was that it caved; and in doing so, a portion of the surface of the plaintiff\u2019s claim gave way and fell on the ground of the defendant. This portion contained a small amount of gold-bearing gravel, a part of which the defendant washed away, but the value of the gold extracted therefrom was much less than the necessary cost of extracting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Some time after the defendant ceased to work its ground near the plaintiff\u2019s line, large portions of the surface of the plaintiff\u2019s claim caved and fell upon the adjoining ground of the defendant, where it still remains. All of the caving was caused by the mining done by the defendant, but it is not claimed that the defendant\u2019s work was performed in a careless or improper manner. The question in the case is, whether the doctrine of lateral support applies to cases like the present. We think not. The very purpose of locating the ground, both on the part of the plaintiff and the defendant, was to tear it down and wash it away. Its only value consisted in the gold it contained. To apply the doctrine contended for by the appellant to ground of this character, would, therefore, to a great extent defeat the very purpose for which it was located.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Defendant would be liable for the amount of gold taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>from the gravel that fell from the plaintiff\u2019s claim, but for the fact that its value was less than the necessary cost of extracting it. <em>(Maye </em>v. <em>Tappan, </em>23 Cal. 306; <em>Goller </em>v. <em>Fett, </em>30 id. 481.)</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">McKinstry, J., and McKee, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
