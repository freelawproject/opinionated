Fairbanks the sum of five hundred and twenty-six dollars and thirty-eight cents as wages and traveling expenses in aiding the plaintiff in procuring the restoration of the possession of said property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">It may be admitted (but is not here decided), that the record before us shows which of the articles of property alleged to have been detained, were personal property; and that such articles were converted.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Section 3333 of the Civil Code authorizes- a jury to find damages for the detriment proximately caused, and is, so far, declaratory of the common law. It leaves the question as to what are proximate damages where it was. The second subdivision of \u00a7 3336 of the same code permits a plaintiff in an action for the wrongful conversion of personal property to recover \u201ca fair compensation for the time and money properly expended in the pursuit of the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">So far as the case shows, the property attached in <em>Williams </em>v. <em>The Loyal Lead Company </em>was released by the plaintiff in that action (defendant in this) voluntarily. The only evidence bearing in any degree upon the question of release is found in the testimony of the present plaintiff, who says: <em>\u201cA </em>few days after the present attachment I referred all my evidence of title to Mhoon (attorney for plaintiff in the attachment suit), who seemed to be satisfied, and said he would order the attachment released.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">The same witness further says: \u201cI forget how much I paid Frank (Frank J. Fairbanks), and I think I paid Lynch about two hundred and seventy dollarq for expenses in getting the property released.\u201d It is true he adds: \u201c The amounts stated in the complaint are correct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">The complaint alleges that \u201cMorgan, as agent of-defendant, demanded that plaintiff should make due and lawful proof of his ownership of the property, and that plaintiff was compelled to retain counsel and pay said counsel two hundred and eighty-five dollars as fees and necessary traveling expenses for advising the plaintiff in the premises and conducting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>proceedings necessary on plaintiff\u2019s part in proving his ownership and possession of the property; and that plaintiff was compelled to employ Frank J. Fairbanks, whose knowledge, testimony, and services were absolutely necessary to plaintiff in procuring such restoration, and was obliged to pay said Frank J. five hundred and twenty-six dollars as wages and traveling expenses, and money laid out in aiding plaintiff as aforesaid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">The foregoing averments of the complaint are specifically denied by the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">The Court below failed to find on the issues thus joined.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">.The statement of the plaintiff, as a witrless, that \u201cthe <em>wmov/nts </em>stated in the complaint are correct,\u201d taken in connection with what precedes it, is, giving the words their broadest signification, only a declaration that he had actually paid such amounts. They do not purport to be an avowal that the amounts paid were just and reasonable for the services preformed, or that the money was \u201cproperly expended.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc. 3336.) The witness could not determine the question of the propriety or necessity of the expenditure. That was a matter for the Court to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">The Court did determine it in findings seven and eight, above quoted. But there is no evidence in the transcript to sustain the findings, that plaintiff necessarily paid two hundred and eighty-five dollars to counsel or five hundred and twenty-six dollars and thirty-eight cents to Frank J. Fair-bank. Assuming for the purposes of this appeal, that \u00a7 3336 of the Civil Code is applicable, the plaintiff could only recover \u201c a <em>fair </em>compensation for the time and money <em>properly expended </em>in <em>purswit </em>of the property \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">We are of opinion that the interests of justice will be subserved by a new trial of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
