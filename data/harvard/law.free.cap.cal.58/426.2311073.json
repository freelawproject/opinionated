As such, it is governed by the law of the owner\u2019s domicile. By such law it passed upon the owner\u2019s death to his executor. The executor has transferred the stock in accordance with the forms prescribed by both the <em>lex domicilii </em>and the <em>lex rei sitos. </em>Has such transferee the right to have the stock transferred to his name upon the books of the defendant corporation, or in default thereof to maintain an action for damages ? The disability of a foreign executor to sue in the Courts of this State is a personal one, and does not pass to his vendee or assignee. <em>(Harper </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>2 Pet. 239; <em>Grace </em>v. <em>Hannah, </em>6 Jones\u2019 Law, N.

By his will he nominated Mary Bird executrix and Edward O. Bird executor thereof. In the will was a clause \u201c that my said executrix and executor, and the survivor of them, shall have, and I hereby give to them, and the survivor of them, full power and lawful authority to sell and convey all or any part of my real or personal estate if they shall think proper and necessary to do so at any time after my decease.\u201d The will was duly admitted to probate in Hew York, and letters testamentary issued to said Edward 0. Bird, who alone appeared and qualified. At the time of his death Mathew Bird was the owner of two hundred and fifty shares of the capital stock of the defendant corporation, standing in his name, and the certificates therefor were in his possession. After the issuance of letters, Edward 0. Bird, as such executor, sold the stock to plaintiff and assigned the certificates by indorsement and delivery. The plaintiff presented to defendant proof of the foregoing facts and demanded the transfer of the stock on the books of defendant, which was refused. The Court below rendered judgment for plaintiff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>directing the defendant to transfer the stock.' The judgment is correct. An executor or administrator in another jurisdiction, with power to sell, and having property of his testator or intestate, may sell the same, and vest the title in the purchaser. The title of the purchaser was complete as between the p\u00e1rties when the certificates had been indorsed and delivered ; it was not necessary to have letters of administration issued in this State in order to obtain a transfer on- the books of the corporation. (\u00a7 324, Civ. Code.) The bond provided for in \u00a7 326 was not required by defendant. After the transfer had been made, what was there remaining in the estate to be administered upon in this State ?</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">In the absence of any statement to the contrary, we presume that the law of New York in regard to the issuance of letters to the executor alone, and his power to act as sole executor, is the same as in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Thornton, J., and Sharpstein, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
