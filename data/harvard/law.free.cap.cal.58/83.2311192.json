Code, 2607, 2611, 2612.) Under the stipulations of the policy, the answer of James M. Coburn to question Ho. 10 of the application was an express warranty. It was intentionally false, and therefore fraudulent. (Civ.

Is there any incendiary danger apprehended or threatened? Ho.\u201d The demurrer to defendant\u2019s answer (the answer setting forth that the reply to question 10 \u201c was false and fraudulent at the time of making it, in this, that incendiary danger was then apprehended by the said James M. Coburn, as he then well knew, and he, the said James M. Coburn, did. in the aforesaid answer, falsely and fraudulently represent to the defendant that such danger was not apprehended, and he so represented with intention to deceive and defraud the defendant\u201d), was properly overruled. When the policy refers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>to the. application, and makes it part of the policy, any breach of the conditions or representations which are <em>warranties, </em>avoids it.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Though a circumstance in itself of trifling import, we are not prepared to say that the testimony of the witness Brunn that the premises were partly burned \u201clast summer,\u201d in the absence of the assignor of plaintiff, in no degree tended to show that he had apprehension of incendiarism.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">The policy and application were set forth in the complaint and the defendant in his answer alleged a fact which, if true, constituted breach of a warranty. The instruction complained of was not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
