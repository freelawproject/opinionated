He entered upon the discharge of the duties of the office on the 16th of October follovfing, and remained in office until May\u201810th, 1880, when he departed this life. Thereupon the defendant was duly appointed to fill the vacancy thus caused, and qualified as School Director. At the election held on the 2d of November, 1880, the relator, Danielwitz, was, among other persons, voted for, to fill the unexpired term of Galloway, and, having received a majority of the votes cast for that office, was declared elected, and instituted this action to establish his right to the office. In the Court below judgment was given in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">It will be readily seen that the disposition of the case depends on the question whether the election held on the 2d of November, 1880, was the \u201cmunicipal election next ensuing\u201d the vacancy caused by the death of Galloway. This question admits of but one answer, and that in the negative. <em>(Barton </em>v.
