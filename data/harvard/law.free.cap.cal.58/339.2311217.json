That the objection that the trustee was not present at the sale\u2014in the absence of a specification calling in question a finding to that effect\u2014could not be considered; that it was permissible for the trustee to avail herself of the services of an auctioneer in making the sale. 3. That in view of the fact that the trustee was one of the <em>cestuis que trustent, </em>who were authorized by the deed to purchase, it was no objection that the sale was made to her attorney for the benefit of the <em>cestuis que trustent. 4. </em>That the evidence sustained the finding that the plaintiff was not misled or deceived by the trustee as to the time of sale. 5.

The Court also found that the sale was for three hundred and fifty dollars, and that the value of the property sold was one thousand five hundred dollars.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b363-10\"><em>W.

First, it is claimed .that no sufficient notice of the sale was given; second, that the trustee was not present at the sale; third, that the trustee bought at the sale; fourth, that the plaintiff was misled and deceived by the trustee as to the time of the sale; and fifth and lastly, that the property was sold at a grossly inadequate price.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Looking at the record, we do not find any of the points made, there sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">1. It appears that the notice of sale conformed to the requirements of the power, and was duly given. This was sufficient. (2 Perry on Trusts, \u00a7 602, q and r; Civ. Code, \u00a7 2258; Perry on Trusts, \u00a7\u00a7 780-2; Jones on Mortgages, vol. ii, \u00a7 1854; <em>Model Lodging House Assoc, </em>v. <em>City of Boston, </em>114 Mass. 133.)</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">2. The Court expressly finds that the trustee <em>was </em>present at. the sale, and there is no specification calling in question that finding. It was permissible for the trustee to avail herself of the services of an auctioneer in making the sale. <em>(Fogarty </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>23 Cal. 570; <em>Gillespie </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>29 Ill. 473; <em>Hawley </em>v. <em>James, </em>5 Paige, 478; <em>Cranston </em>v. <em>Crane, </em>97 Mass. 459.)</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">3. The trustee was also one of the <em>cestwis que trustent. </em>The record shows that the trustee sold to one Malone for the benefit of the <em>cestuis que trustent, </em>which the deed itself expressly authorized. (2 Perry on Trusts, \u00a7 6022; 2 Jones on Mortgages, \u00a7 1892; <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Marine Company, </em>52 Ill. 130.)</p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">4. The Court found, from evidence which sustained the finding, that the plaintiff was not misled or deceived by the trustee as to the time of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-12\">5. It is a familiar rule that inadequacy of price alone will not vitiate a sale. And if it would, it would not lie in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>mouth of one whose willful and wrongful act causes the inadequacy, to complain of it. The Court below found that \u201cat the time of the sale Edward Kennedy, who was then present and who was acting as the representative of plaintiff, forbade the sale, announced that the trust deed was invalid and worthless, and that any party purchasing would take nothing by the sale.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-3\">We remark, in conclusion, that the circumstances detailed in the findings, and elsewhere appearing in the record, do not appeal very strongly to the conscience of the chancellor in favor of the <em>plaintiff.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">. Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">McKinstry, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">McKee, J., concurred in the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
