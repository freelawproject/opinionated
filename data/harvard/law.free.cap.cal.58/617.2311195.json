If the law imposed the duty upon him of certifying to the identity of such papers, his certificate would be conclusive evidence of the fact in it recited. But as the law does not impose that duty upon him, his certificate that certain papers were used on the hearing, inadvertently made, can not be held to be determinative of the fact, as against his subsequent statement that he signed the certificate by mistake, and that he did not know, and had no means of knowing, whether the affidavits were or were not used at the hearing of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">As the affidavits found in the transcript are not identified as having been used on the hearing of the motion to set aside the judgment of dismissal,</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
