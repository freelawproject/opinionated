The statute prohibits an insurer from turning down any claim for disability (as defined in the policy), starting after two years from the policy\u2019s inception, on the grounds that a disease or physical condition existed prior to the policy\u2019s inception. The provisions of the policy at issue here define \u201cdisability\u201d in terms of the insured having a sickness or disease that first manifests itself while the policy is in force. Appellee (cross-appellant), the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York (\u201cMONY\u201d), filed a cross-appeal challenging the Circuit Court for Baltimore City\u2019s affirmance of appellant\u2019s (cross-appellee), the Insurance Commissioner of the State of Maryland (\u201cthe Commissioner\u201d), interpretation of Md. Ann.Code art. 48A \u00a7 441 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>(1957, 1994 Repl.Yol.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in a manner that refused to recognize an \u201cexist/manifest\u201d distinction. The Commissioner appeals from the portion of the circuit court\u2019s judgment that, based in part upon its finding that MONY did not violate the insurance code in maintaining its erroneous interpretation of the statute, reversed the Commissioner\u2019s order requiring MONY to pay its insured all benefits due under her disability insurance policy. As we shall explain, we conclude that the circuit court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 441, which did not recognize an \u201cexist/manifest\u201d distinction, was legally correct. Therefore, we shall affirm this portion of the lower court\u2019s judgment. As to MONY\u2019s obligation to pay benefits to its insured consonant with its statutory and contractual obligation, having interpreted \u00a7 441 against MONY\u2019s position, we conclude that by virtue of a stipulation entered below by MONY and the Maryland Insurance Administration (\u201cMIA\u201d), MONY cannot now refuse the claim of its insured/Mary L. Holland, on the ground that her condition manifested itself before the issuance of her policy. Because that was the only apparent ground revealed by the record in this case upon which MONY denied the claim, it must now pay Ms. Holland\u2019s claim in accordance with the terms of her policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\n<em>ISSUES</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">MONY, as cross-appellant, raises the following issues, which have been rephrased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-7\">I. Assuming that MONY was in full compliance with Article 48A, did the circuit court err in choosing to decide the merits of the underlying contractual issue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-8\">II. Did the circuit court err in disagreeing with MONY\u2019s interpretation of the policy definitions at issue as they relate to the incontestability clause?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">The Commissioner raises the following questions for our consideration, which we have slightly rephrased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>III. Did the Commissioner have the authority to order MONY to pay its insured\u2019s disability claim, where MONY denied the claim based on an erroneous interpretation of \u00a7 441?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-4\">IV. Assuming it is finally determined that MONY\u2019s interpretation and application of \u00a7 441 to its insured\u2019s claim was contrary to Maryland law, is MONY obligated to pay this claim pursuant to the stipulation agreed upon by the parties?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The facts before us are essentially undisputed and are for the most part contained in a stipulation that was agreed upon by the MIA and MONY before the Commissioner for the express purpose of attaining a formal interpretation of \u00a7 441.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On 27 November 1985, Ms. Holland (or \u201cthe insured\u201d) executed an application for a disability income insurance policy to be issued by MONY. In this application, Ms. Holland denied, among other illnesses, any previous history of mental or nervous disorder during the past ten years. She did indicate that she had been treated for an ulcer. Based on this application, MONY issued Ms. Holland a disability income insurance policy. MONY expressly agreed not to contest the accuracy of the answers provided in Ms. Holland\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Ms. Holland\u2019s policy, by its terms, generally covered disabilities that \u201cstart[ed] while th[e] Policy ... [was] in force.\u201d \u201cDisability\u201d was defined as \u201ceither a Total Disability or a Partial Disability, provided that in either case the Disability starts while this Policy is in force.\u201d Both total and partial disability were defined in terms of the insured not being able to work \u201cbecause of injury[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] or sickness.\u201d \u201cSickness\u201d was defined as a \u201csickness or disease which first manifests itself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>while this Policy is in force.\u201d In conformance with \u00a7 441,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the policy also contained the following provisions, under the heading \u201cIncontestable\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\">After this policy has been in force for 2 years during your lifetime, we may not contest any statements in the application. (We will not count as part of the 2 years any period when you are disabled.)[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\">We may not reduce or turn down any claim for loss incurred [or] Disability [as defined in the policy] starting after two years from the Policy Date on the grounds that a disease or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>physical condition existed prior to the Policy Date, unless that disease or physical condition is excluded from coverage by name or specific condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">The policy also included a rider that expressly excluded loss for gastro-intestinal disease. It is undisputed that the form and content of Ms. Holland\u2019s policy were filed with the MIA, where the policy received approval prior to MONY\u2019s use of it in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Almost four years after the issuance of this policy, on 6 June 1989, Ms. Holland filed a claim for disability resulting from a condition diagnosed as acute and chronic anxiety with panic attacks.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The parties have stipulated that \u201cMs. Holland\u2019s claim for a loss incurred or disability commenced after two years\u201d from the policy\u2019s inception. The parties have agreed further that the policy did not contain a rider excluding this disease or physical condition from coverage by name or specific description. On 1 October 1991, MONY denied Ms. Holland\u2019s claim<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> on the ground that her condition first manifested itself prior to the effective date of her policy and thereby did not meet the policy\u2019s definition of sickness.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>parties have stipulated that the sickness which caused Ms. Holland\u2019s disability, in fact, manifested itself prior to the effective date of the policy.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In denying Ms. Holland\u2019s claim, MONY relied in part upon <em>Massachusetts Casualty Ins. Co. v. Forman, </em>516 F.2d 425 (5th Cir.1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 U.S. 914, 96 S.Ct. 1114, 47 L.Ed.2d 319 (1976), in which a similarly worded incontestability clause and definition of sickness were at issue. There, an insurer filed suit in part for the return of benefits paid pursuant to a disability insurance policy, on the ground that the insured had a pre-manifested, but undisclosed, condition of diabetes. The Fifth Circuit, finding for the insurer, held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-4\">[Where] the condition for which [the insured] claimed benefits had \u2018first manifested\u2019 itself almost a year before the policy became effective ... [the] disability ... was never within the scope of coverage, and [the insured] cannot now [relying on the incontestability clause] claim ... disability benefits [because] ... the incontestability provisions of the policy [do not cause] ... this prior existing illness to be covered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 428. MONY\u2019s reliance was based further on other cases that also interpreted incontestability clauses containing language similar to \u00a7 441 in a manner such that the clause did \u201cnot cut off defenses to coverage, and that a condition that actually manifests itself prior to the issuance of coverage falls outside of the policy\u2019s coverage because of the policy\u2019s definition of \u2018sickness.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Ms. Holland apparently filed a complaint with the MIA, where her claim was investigated. On 14 December 1993, the MIA issued a notice and order, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>1. MONY [is ordered to] refrain from denying Ms. Holland\u2019s claim on the ground that the disease or physical condition of Acute and Chronic Anxiety with Panic Attacks may have manifested or did manifest itself prior to the effective date of the Policy; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-4\">2. MONY [is ordered to] pay the claim of Ms. Holland that is the subject of this Notice and Order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">In support, the MIA reasoned that the plain meaning of \u00a7 441, which prohibited MONY from denying a disability claim commencing two years after the date of the issuance of the policy, on the ground that a disease or physical condition, not excluded from coverage by name or specific description, existed prior to the policy\u2019s effective date, \u201cinelude[d] both those [preexisting diseases and conditions] ... which have and have not manifested themselves.\u201d Accordingly, the MIA reasoned that MONY\u2019s denial of Ms. Holland\u2019s claim on the ground that her condition first manifested itself prior to the effective date of the policy was in violation of \u00a7 441. The MIA found further that MONY\u2019s denial of Ms. Holland\u2019s claim was \u201cin contravention of State law ... [and] prohibited by Md.Code Ann. Art. 48A, \u00a7\u00a7 55(2)(i) and (iv),[ <footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] and 230A(c)(2)[ <footnotemark>11</footnotemark>]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">MONY appealed the MIA\u2019s order to the Maryland Insurance Commissioner where, in lieu of an evidentiary hearing, the parties agreed to a stipulation of facts for the purpose of the hearing before the Commissioner and any further \u201cappeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>by either Party arising therefrom.\u201d In addition to stating the facts that we have set forth,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> this stipulation indicated that the parties \u201cdesire[d] a statutory interpretation of MD. ANN. CODE art. 48A, \u00a7 441.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The stipulation provided further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-5\">[It] does not bind Mary L. Holland ... nor does it prejudice her right to pursue a claim in any court of competent jurisdiction or to file future complaints with the Maryland Insurance Administration. Should [Ms. Holland] proceed with a claim, MONY similarly is not bound by this Stipulation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-6\">The Maryland Insurance Administration, formerly the Insurance Division of the Department of Licensing and Regulation, has historically interpreted MD. ANN. CODE, art. 48A, \u00a7 441 to prohibit an insurance company from denying or reducing a claim after two years from the effective date of the policy because the sickness causing the loss or claim manifested itself prior to the effective date of the policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-7\">Written guidelines issued by the MIA, entitled \u2018Underwriting of Health Insurance Policies\u2019, which were effective as of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>August 1, 1970, (\u201cGuidelines\u201d) and are published in the National Insurance Law Service, are attached as Exhibit G.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">Additionally, stipulation no. 25 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">In the event the Insurance Commissioner affirms the December 14, 1993, Notice and Order, MONY agrees not to deny payment for the claim at issue on the ground that the Insured\u2019s condition- of Acute and Chronic Anxiety with Panic Attacks first manifested itself prior to the effective date of the Policy, and, the MIA agrees not to hold that MONY\u2019s initial declination was a \u00a7 230A(c)(2) violation. This agreement, however, will in no way impede either Party\u2019s right to an appeal nor MONY\u2019s right to request a Stay from the court on the disability payments pending the outcome of the appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">On 19 July 1994, the Commissioner issued a memorandum and order finding that, although MONY did include in its policy an incontestability clause in accordance with \u00a7 441, it \u201cviolated Art. 48A, \u00a7\u00a7 55(2)(i) and 55(2)(iv) ... when it denied Mary Holland\u2019s claim for disability benefits [based on a preexisting condition] in contravention of Art. 48A, \u00a7 441,\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and, accordingly, ordering MONY to \u201cpay Ms. Holland all benefits due under her policy [as restitution pursuant to \u00a7 55A,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> in lieu of revocation of suspension, for any violation of the Code].\u201d In reaching its decision, the Commissioner initially rejected MONY\u2019s attempt to refuse benefits based on the fact that Ms. Holland\u2019s underlying disease manifested itself prior to the issuance of her policy. In support, the Commissioner explained in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>The whole purpose of ... [\u00a7 441] ... is to achieve certainty as to the coverage provided and to avoid litigation. The company is free to seek medical information before issuing the policy and can exclude specific illnesses. The company may also conduct a further investigation if it deems appropriate. However, under Art. 48A, \u00a7 441, once the policy has been issued, the [insurance] company may not, in the absence of fraud, go back and deny coverage for pre-existing conditions. Otherwise, \u00a7 441 would be meaningless.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-4\">MONY seeks to avoid this common sense result by defining disability as including only a sickness or disease which \u2018manifests itself after the policy was issued. According to this argument, an insurer could define disability or illness to exclude any pre-existing condition of any type, irrespective of how long ago the condition started. I find this argument to be contrary to both the language and purpose of the statute, and, I therefore, reject this argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-5\">The language of the statute provides simply and directly that \u2018No claim ... for disability commencing after two years from the date ... of this policy shall be denied on the ground that a disease or physical condition ... had existed prior to the ... date of this policy.\u2019 Clearly, a disease or condition exists whether it manifests itself or not. The distinction MONY makes between pre-existing conditions which are not manifest and those which are, simply is not a distinction which is found in the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-6\">Moreover, MONY\u2019s attempt to exclude an illness which \u2018manifested itself prior to the policy date runs directly counter to the purpose of incontestability clauses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">As to stipulation no. 25, the Commissioner noted in a footnote that MONY agreed to pay Ms. Holland\u2019s claim if it was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">determined that the claim was legitimate.... In exchange for this agreement, the Maryland Insurance Administration agreed not to pursue the claim that MONY acted in an arbitrary and capricious fashion in violation of ... \u00a7 230A(c)(2). In light of these agreements, it is difficult to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>understand why MONY now argues that the denial of benefits was not arbitrary and capricious. Pursuant to the stipulation, I will not resolve this issue and will instead assume MONY will honor the claim as agreed in \u00b6 25 of the stipulation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">MONY appealed the Commissioner\u2019s decision to the circuit court, where the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 441 was affirmed. The circuit court also rejected MONY\u2019s attempt to distinguish between pre-existing conditions that have and have not manifested themselves when determining the applicability of an incontestability clause, noting in its 27 June 1995 Memorandum Opinion and Order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">It is apparent that the terms of the disability insurance policy, absent the incontestability clause, would eliminate coverage for a disease that manifests itself prior to the effective date of the policy. It is the inability to disregard the incontestability clause that clouds that result. As urged by MONY, a disease can exist whether or not it manifests itself. MONY wishes this court further to conclude that the term \u2018existed prior,\u2019 as used in the policy, refers only to those diseases or physical conditions that, although in existence, did not manifest themselves. The MIA, in contrast, asserts that such an exist-manifest distinction would nullify the intent of the incontestability clause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">After indicating that the cases from other jurisdictions addressing this question have resulted in \u201cantithetical responses,\u201d the circuit court considered some of these cases, the terms of \u00a7 441, the MIA\u2019s historical interpretation of \u00a7 441, and ultimately concluded that MONY\u2019s position, if adopted, would</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">effectively expand the ability of the insurer <em>to </em>bar insureds from benefits well after the incontestability clause has taken effect. Well after the contestability period, insurers would be able to search any and all records regarding an insured\u2019s appointments with physicians for some hint of a manifestation prior to the effective date of the policy. The time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>limitations of the incontestability clause would be rendered inoperative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">(Emphasis in original). The circuit court, however, reversed that portion of the Commissioner\u2019s decision that ordered MONY to pay to Ms. Holland disability benefits, finding that because there were \u201cno technical violations of the Insurance Code by MONY,\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the penalty provisions of \u00a7 55A were inapplicable. As to \u00a7 441, the circuit court concluded that there was no violation because \u201cMONY merely sought a different interpretation of that statute ... [and] MONY\u2019s policy was filed with the MIA and received approval as to the form from the MIA prior to MONY\u2019s use of the policy in Maryland.\u201d Turning to \u00a7\u00a7 55(2)(i) and (iv) the circuit court found that these sections were also not violated, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APT\">MONY\u2019s interpretation of Section 441 was not unreasonable considering the support its position has received in sister states. Thus, Section 55(2)(iv) has not been violated. Further, since Sections 441 and 55(2)(iv) have not been contravened, there is no violation of Section 55(2)(i) as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALS\">The circuit court then effectively determined that MONY did not have to pay Ms. Holland\u2019s claim by virtue of stipulation no. 25, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-6\">This stipulation is an example of poor drafting. By its terms it states that MONY could not deny the insured her disability benefits based on an argument of the disability first manifesting itself prior to the effective date of the policy should the Commissioner affirm the decision of the Associate Commissioner. As is evident, the earlier decision was indeed affirmed by the Commissioner. However, the stipulation further read that neither party\u2019s right to an appeal nor MONYs right to request a Stay from the court on the disability payments pending the outcome of the appeal would be hindered. If the stipulation had ended with the first sentence, MONY would be required to pay on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>the claim due to the fact that its main point of contention would no longer be viable. However, the stipulation muddled that result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-4\">The second sentence of stipulation #25 ... allows either party the right to appeal the decision of the Commissioner to the court as well as MONY\u2019s right to request a stay from the court on the disability payments pending the outcome of the appeal. Furthermore, both parties are entitled through this stipulation to appeal this court\u2019s decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The circuit court reached its conclusion in spite of its earlier observation, in a footnote, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-6\">by virtue of Stipulation # 25, it appears that, if MONY is ultimately unsuccessful in its appeal, the language of the stipulation would require it to pay the disability benefits to the insured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">Before reaching the merits of this appeal, we note briefly the standard of review that we shall apply. On appeal from the Commissioner, a reviewing court may reverse or modify the agency\u2019s decision under the following circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-9\">[I]f the substantial rights of the petitioners may have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-10\">(i) In violation of constitutional provisions; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-11\">(ii) In excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the Commissioner; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-12\">(iii) Made upon unlawful procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-13\">(iv) Affected by other error of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-14\">(v) Unsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in view of the entire record as submitted;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-15\">(vi) Arbitrary or capricious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-16\">\u00a7 40(4), (6). Because the parties have stipulated to the facts, our review will be limited to matters of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Logic dictates that our review begin with MONY\u2019s threshold issue concerning our ability to decide the central issue in the case relating to the proper interpretation of \u00a7 441. MONY argues, without reference to any authority whatsoever, that because \u201cthe Insurance Commissioner had no jurisdiction to interpret MONY\u2019s insurance policy, no court (including this one) on appeal from the Commissioner\u2019s ruling has the jurisdiction to interpret the policy.\u201d MONY states further that our review is \u201cnarrowly restricted to those issues that were properly before the administrative agency.\u201d In light of the parties\u2019 express agreement in their stipulation before the Commissioner, which by its terms was made binding on the parties in any petition for judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision, that they \u201cdesire[d] a statutory interpretation of ... \u00a7 441,\u201d we do not see how MONY can now argue that the correct statutory interpretation of \u00a7 441 is not properly before this Court.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We therefore reject MONY\u2019s attempt to question our ability to reach the merits of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Next, we must conduct an analysis of the proper interpretation of \u00a7 441(2), which requires health insurance policies issued in this State, including disability policies, to contain the portion of the incontestability clause that prevents an insurer from denying a claim for disability, as defined in the policy, commencing two years after the policy\u2019s effective date, on the ground that the disease or condition causing the disability existed prior to the issuance of the policy. Under the undisputed facts of this case, there is no doubt that, but for MONY\u2019s inclusion of this mandatory part of the incontestability provision, it could have denied Ms. Holland\u2019s claim based on the scope of the policy\u2019s coverage, which was limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>to a sickness first manifesting itself while the policy was in force. The circuit court correctly noted, however, that the incontestability clause \u201cclouds that result,\u201d and it ultimately agreed with the Commissioner\u2019s finding that \u00a7 441 prohibited MONY from denying a disability claim that commenced after the expiration of the contestability period based on a preexisting condition, regardless of whether the condition manifested itself prior to the effective date of the policy. MONY now strenuously argues, as it did below, that under the circumstances of this case, in which the policy coverage was expressly limited to covering disabilities that first manifested themselves while the policy was in force, we should adopt the position taken by a majority of other states and federal venues that recognizes an \u201cexist/manifest\u201d distinction when applying an incontestability clause so that it is allowed to limit coverage in a manner that excludes pre-manifested conditions. MONY states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-5\">[Its] position was, and is, that the definition of \u2018sickness,\u2019 which requires that in order to be covered a condition must first manifest itself while the policy is in force, is a reasonable and appropriate definition relating to \u2018disability,\u2019 a definition that is consistent with Section 441(2), namely, that, after two years, a sickness that exists but did not manifest prior to the effective date of the policy is covered, but that a premanifest condition is not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">In support of its position, MONY relies on the language of \u00a7 441 that permits it to define \u201cdisability\u201d in terms of when a sickness first manifests itself, cases from other jurisdictions holding that incontestability clauses do not prevent an insurer from defending on the ground that the particular disability was not within policy coverage, as well as the MIA Guidelines.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As we shall explain, <em>infra, </em>particularly under the circumstances of this case, in which MONY has stipulated that the MIA has historically interpreted \u00a7 441 against MONY\u2019s position, we decline MONY\u2019s invitation to recognize such a distinction, and hold that MONY\u2019s incontestability clause pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>vented it, after the contestability period had expired, from denying Ms. Holland\u2019s claim for her disability, which commenced after two years from the policy\u2019s inception, on the ground that her condition first manifested itself prior to the issuance of her policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">We will begin our discussion by briefly exploring the history and purpose of incontestability clauses.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> These clauses are typically composed of provisions that act to limit \u201cthe amount of time in which an insurer can contest the policy!,] ...

In <em>Wischmeyer v. Paul Revere Life Ins.

The statutory scheme gives the insurer two years to conduct an investigation of facts relevant to determining its risks; having failed to investigate, the insurer cannot be heard to complain now. After two years the insurer may not litigate what illnesses are or are not covered by the policy, because the purpose of the incontestability provision is to put an end to such litigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-7\"><em>White v.

As one commentary has noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-7\">The courts have uniformly construed incontestability clauses as barring a defense based upon fraud in the application for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>insurance, after the specified period has passed. There is somewhat less uniformity on the question whether the claim may be resisted on the ground that the disability antedated the issuance of the policy, however. While most courts take the view that pre-existing disability is a defense to coverage rather than a \u2018contest,\u2019 and is thus not negated by the incontestability clause, there is authority to the contrary, even in situations where the clause expressly negates the contestability of the insured\u2019s prior condition of health.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aij\">13 A.L.R.3d at 1385. Indeed, a substantial minority of the courts faced with this question have rejected the insurer\u2019s attempt to exclude coverage for pre-manifesting illnesses in circumstances similar to those of the instant case. As one federal court recently explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-4\">A growing minority of courts have rejected ... [the majori- \u25a0 ty approach] by favoring a plain meaning approach to the statutory and policy language. These cases uniformly hold that \u2018if an insured is not disabled for two years after issuance of the policy, then his claim for benefits cannot be denied on the grounds he had a pre-existing condition.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZ0\"><em>Oglesby v.

As noted by the <em>Oglesby </em>court, these cases often reach this result on the basis of principles of statutory and insurance policy construction. For instance, in <em>Equitable Life Assurance Soc\u2019y of the United States v.

In rejecting the insurer\u2019s position, the <em>Bell </em>court noted that although this question \u201chas sharply divided the courts,\u201d the cases finding for the insurer uniformly emphasize that the first portion of the incontestability clause, dealing with the insurer\u2019s ability to contest a statement in the insured\u2019s application, \u201crelates solely to the validity of the policy and does not preclude the insurer from limiting what is covered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After indicating that it agreed with this interpretation of the \u201cinitial provision of the incontestability clause,\u201d the Seventh Circuit stressed that few of the cases finding for the insurer have addressed the second portion of the incontestability clause, \u201cwhich bars the denial of coverage on the ground of pre-existence.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1281.

In explaining its decision, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-6\">[BJreaking this [incontestability] clause down into its sequential steps reveals the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-7\">1.

As one federal district court has noted, clauses in policies that seek to exclude pre-existing conditions attempt \u2018to nullify the protection of the incontestable clause by excluding from coverage illness which manifests itself before the policy is issued.\u2019 <em>Fischer v. Massachusetts Casualty Ins. Co., </em>458 F.Supp. 939, 945 (D. D.C. [sic] 1978).

The <em>Oglesby </em>court began its analysis by broadly discussing incontestability clauses, noting that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-7\">provisions relating to misrepresentations by the insured only prohibit contests as to the validity of the policy; they \u2018do not prohibit contests which seek to establish that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>event which has occurred was outside the risk assumed by the policy.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 775 (citations omitted). After surveying the conflicting cases regarding whether an insurer is able to exclude coverage for pre-manifesting illnesses, despite the statutorily required provision prohibiting a denial of coverage for pre-existing illnesses after two years, the <em>Oglesby </em>court focused upon relevant Delaware principles of statutory and contractual interpretation, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-5\">Delaware law mandates that clear language in an insurance policy should be given its ordinary and usual meaning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">The ... [policy at issue] clearly establishes its contractual boundaries by defining coverage for \u2018any sickness that first makes itself known while the policy is in force.\u2019 Pursuant to legislative mandate, the policy also sets forth what the policy does <em>not </em>cover, by way of an incontestability provision relating to what is excluded under the policy. The provision distinguishes between disabilities starting <em>within </em>two years of the issuance of the policy, and <em>after </em>two years from issuance of the policy.... [I]f, after more than two years after the policy issued, a disability arises from a pre-existing condition not specifically excluded, then it is covered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">This \u2018plain meaning\u2019 interpretation of the policy is supported by examination of the corresponding statutory language in the Delaware Code, which provides in relevant part that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-9\">\u2018No claim for loss incurred as disability .. . commencing 2 years from the date of issue of this policy shall be ... denied on the ground that a disease or physical condition not excluded from coverage by name or specific description ... had existed prior to the effective date of coverage of this policy.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">18 <em>DelC. </em>\u00a7 3306(a)(2). The clear import of both the statutory and policy provisions [which clearly establish contractual boundaries by defining coverage for \u201cany sickness that first makes itself known while the policy is in force\u201d] is that \u2018if an insured is not disabled for two years after issuance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>the policy, then his claim for benefits cannot be denied on the grounds that he had a pre-existing condition.\u2019 <em>Wischmeyer v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., </em>725 F.Supp. 995, 1001 (S.D.Ind.1989). The statute requires an unequivocal promise by the insurer that that after two years, \u2018no disability claim shall be denied on the ground that the underlying disease or condition \u2018existed\u2019 before the policy became effective.\u2019 <em>See Equitable Life Assurance Soc\u2019y v.

The statute speaks plainly in terms of \u2018existing,\u2019 not \u2018manifesting\u2019 (or first making itself known); the term \u2018exist\u2019 ordinarily refers to a state of being, -without qualification as to other qualities, such as manifestation. <em>Id. </em>Consequently, in the absence of such a distinction by the legislature, one must conclude that the Delaware legislature intended that a pre-existing condition includes those both known and unknown to the insured prior to the policy date. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">889 F.Supp. at 777-78 (other citations omitted) (Emphasis in original).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">We find the reasoning set forth by the Seventh Circuit, as well as the federal district courts in Delaware and Indiana, persuasive and consistent with Maryland\u2019s well-settled rules concerning the construction of insurance policies and statutes. As we recognized in <em>Progressive Cas. Ins. Co. v. Dunn, </em>106 Md.App. 520, 665 A.2d 322 (1995), the rules governing the construction of insurance policies are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">In the interpretation of the meaning of an insurance contract, we accord a word its usual, ordinary and accepted meaning unless there is evidence that the parties intended to employ it in a special or technical sense. (Citation omitted.) Maryland does not follow the rule, adopted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>many jurisdictions, that an insurance policy is to be construed most strongly against the insurer. Rather, following the rule applicable to the construction of contracts generally, we hold that the intention of the parties is to be ascertained if reasonably possible from the policy as a whole. In the event of an ambiguity, however, extrinsic and parol evidence may be considered. If no extrinsic or parol evidence is introduced, or if the ambiguity remains after consideration of extrinsic or parol evidence that is introduced, it will be construed against the insurer as drafter of the instrument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 528-29, 665 A.2d 322 (quoting <em>Cheney v. Bell National Life, </em>315 Md. 761, 766-67, 556 A.2d 1135 (1989)). The Court of Appeals has explained that the determination of \u201cthe intention of the parties to the insurance contract ... is the point of the whole analysis.\u201d <em>Pacific Indemnity Co. v. Interstate Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>302 Md. 383, 388, <em>488 </em>A.2d 486 (1985) (citations omitted). To this effect, Chief Judge Wilner noted in <em>Dunn, </em>that the first directive under the analysis of an insurance policy \u201cis to give words their usual, ordinary, and accepted meaning ... the test for doing so is to determine \u2018what meaning a reasonably prudent layperson would attach to the term\u2019 ... [and in doing so] resort to dictionary definitions is appropriate.\u201d 106 Md.App. at 529, 665 A.2d 322 (quoting <em>Pacific Indemnity Co. v. Interstate Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>302 Md. at 388, 488 A.2d 486).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Applying these principles, we look first to the language of the clause at issue, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-6\">We may not reduce or turn down any claim for loss incurred [or] Disability [as defined in the policy] starting after two years from the Policy Date on the grounds that a disease or physical condition <em>existed prior to </em>the Policy Date, unless that disease or physical condition is excluded from coverage by name or specific condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">(Emphasis added). This clause is phrased in terms of whether a disease or physical condition \u201cexisted prior to\u201d the inception of the policy, with no reference to conditions that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>merely manifested themselves. Webster\u2019s Dictionary defines the primary sense of the term \u201cexist\u201d broadly in terms of \u201cto have real being.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Tenth New Collegiate Dictionary </em>407 (1993). Other courts have recognized that, in the absence of clarification, the ordinary meaning of \u201cexist\u201d refers broadly to a state of being, without reservation as to other qualities, including manifestation. <em>See Bell, </em>27 F.3d at 1281; <em>Oglesby, </em>889 F.Supp. at 777; <em>Monarch Life Ins. Co. v. Brown, </em>125 A.D.2d 75, 512 N.Y.S.2d 99, 103 (N.Y.App.Div.1987). With these definitions in mind, we feel that a reasonable person reading this clause, or its equivalent in \u00a7 441(2),<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and giving the terms their ordinary meanings would conclude that, after the expiration of the incontestability period, no disability claim that was not specifically excluded by name or specific description, commencing two years after the policy\u2019s inception could be denied on the ground that the underlying disease or condition existed before the policy became effective, regardless of whether it manifested itself prior to the policy date.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Because our analysis concerns a statutorily required provision, rules of statutory construction must also be referenced. Under these principles, \u201c[w]hen construing a statute, our governing principle must be the Legislature\u2019s intent because, as [the Court of Appeals has] ... consistently stated, the cardinal rule in statutory construction is to effectuate the Legislature\u2019s broad goal or purpose.\u201d <em>Armstead v. State, </em>342 Md. 38, 56, 673 A.2d 221 (1996) (citing <em>Gargliano v. State, </em>334 Md. 428, 435, 639 A.2d 675 (1994)). \u201cIn our quest to discern legislative intent, we construe the statute as a whole and interpret the words of the statute according to their natural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>and commonly understood meaning.\u201d <em>Parrison v. State, </em>335 Md. 554, 559, 644 A.2d 537 (1994) (citations omitted). In doing so, \u201ceach word ... [is] given its ordinary and popularly understood meaning.\u201d <em>Fish Market Nominee Corp. v. G.A.A., Inc., </em>337 Md. 1, 8, 650 A.2d 705 (1994) (citation omitted). If the \u201clanguage is clearly consistent with the apparent purpose of the statute and the result is not absurd, no further research is required.\u201d <em>Lincoln Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co. v. Insurance Commissioner, </em>328 Md. 65, 82, 612 A.2d 1301 (1992) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">As the cases make clear, the purpose behind this statutorily mandated incontestability clause is to prevent a claimant, after the passage of two years following the inception of an insurance policy, from the possibility of facing expensive litigation concerning his or her claim for benefits on the grounds of a pre-existing condition. In apparent agreement with this purpose, Section 441(2) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-5\">No claim for loss incurred or disability (as defined in the policy) commencing after two years from the date of issue of this policy shall be reduced or denied on the ground that a disease or physical condition not excluded from coverage by name or specific description effective on the date of loss had existed prior to the effective date of coverage of this policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aog\">As we concluded, <em>supra, </em>a reasonable reading of these words would result in the conclusion that, after the incontestability period expired, the insurer could not deny a claim for a disability that commenced two years after the policy\u2019s inception, irrespective of whether the condition manifested itself before the inception of the policy. Because this interpretation of the statutory language is clearly consistent with the apparent purpose of the statute, we are satisfied that the legislature did not intend that an \u201cexist/manifest\u201d distinction, enabling an insurer to institute litigation concerning coverage of preexisting conditions after the expiration of the two year con-testability period, be read into the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">We cannot agree with MONY\u2019s suggestion that because \u00a7 441(2) expressly allowed it to define the term \u201cdisability\u201d it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>should be permitted to define the term in a manner that effectively renders the clause meaningless. As recognized by the Seventh Circuit,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-4\">[b]y ... pointing out the definitional differences between terms that are statutorily required [by the incontestability clause], and terms which are inserted into the contract at the behest of the insurer, [the insurer] \u2018attempts to nullify the protection of the incontestable clause by excluding from coverage illness which manifests itself before the policy is issued.\u2019 <em>Fischer v. Massachusetts Cas. Ins. Co., </em>458 F.Supp. 939, 945 (S.D.N.Y.1978). Such an interpretation would controvert the statutorily imposed incontestability clause, and reduce its protection below that which was mandated by the legislature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-5\"><em>Bell, </em>27 F.3d at 1282 (other citations omitted). <em>See also Oglesby, </em>889 F.Supp. at 778; <em>Wischmeyer, </em>725 F.Supp. at 1003-04. Following this rationale, we will not allow MONY to rewrite \u00a7 441(2), which is clearly phrased in terms of \u201cexisting,\u201d not \u201cmanifested,\u201d in a manner that, after the expiration of the incontestability clause, limits the statute\u2019s force to diseases or conditions that exist but did not manifest themselves before the inception of the policy in direct contravention of the purpose of the clause.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Bolstering our conclusion that Maryland should not, in the instant case, adopt an \u201cexist/manifest\u201d distinction is the stipulation reached by the parties. Specifically, the parties stipulated that the MIA has historically interpreted \u00a7 441 against MONY\u2019s position, agreeing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>The Maryland Insurance Administration ... has historically interpreted MD. ANN. CODE, art. 48A, \u00a7 441 to prohibit an insurance company from denying or reducing a claim after two years from the effective date of the policy because the sickness causing the loss or claim manifested itself prior to the effective date of the policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Although the basis for this stipulation is not as clear as it could be in the record, there is some support for it in the Maryland Insurance Guidelines (\u201cthe Guidelines\u201d), which were attached to the stipulation.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The comment to Guideline 4 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">4.3.1 <em>Comment </em>Many health insurance policies exclude liability which arises from a condition first manifesting itself prior to the effective date of coverage. The insurer\u2019s right to deny liability on the ground of prior origin is limited by law to the first one, two or three policy years, depending on applicable law or the provisions of the contract if more favorable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Guideline 5.3 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\">5.3 <em>Prior Origin Defense Limited. </em>Information revealed on the application may cause the policy to be ridered or endorsed to exclude liability for a preexisting condition. Otherwise, the insurer may not use the defense of prior origin in connection with a claim based on such preexisting condition unless there are other unadmitted details which clearly make the condition of materially greater underwriting significance than is shown in the application or than which [sic] reasonable evaluation would have suggested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">Finding that these particular guidelines could provide sufficient support for the parties\u2019 stipulation regarding the histori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>cal interpretation of \u00a7 441,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> we will not how question the substance of this agreement that was expressly made applicable to this appeal.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">As to the appropriate weight that we should now give to the parties\u2019 express agreement that the MIA has historically interpreted \u00a7 441 against MONY\u2019s position, we look to <em>Magan v. Medical Mutual Liability Ins. Soc\u2019y of Maryland, </em>381 Md. 535, 629 A.2d 626 (1993), for guidance, wherein the Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-5\">[W]here the words of a statute leave room for interpretation as to its meaning, we will ordinarily give some weight to the construction given the statute by the agency responsible for administering it. The degree of weight to be given an administrative interpretation varies according to a number of factors, including whether the interpretation has resulted in a contested adversary proceeding or rule-making process, whether the interpretation has been publicly established, and the consistency and length of the administrative interpretation or practice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 546, 629 A.2d 626 (citations omitted). Although the first factor regarding whether the MIA\u2019s interpretation has resulted in a contested adversary proceeding or rule-making process is apparently not satisfied in this case, a reading of the stipulation reveals that the MIA\u2019s interpretation appears to be publicly established, long-standing, and well known in the insurance industry (at least among those insurers electing legitimately to do business in Maryland), and is therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>entitled to receive some weight. Accordingly, we will utilize this portion of the stipulation, which is consistent with our rationale, as further support for our conclusion that in the present case, once the contestability period expired, \u00a7 441(2) barred MONY from attempting to exclude coverage for losses attributed to pre-manifesting diseases and conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">III. &amp; IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Having determined that, under the proper interpretation of \u00a7 441, MONY could not deny Ms. Holland\u2019s claim for her disability that commenced after the contestability period expired, on the ground that her condition manifested itself prior to the inception of the policy, we must determine whether the lower court correctly found that MONY was not required to pay Ms. Holland benefits under her policy. The Commissioner contends that MONY is obligated to pay Ms. Holland\u2019s claim by virtue of the stipulation entered into at the administrative proceeding. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Stipulation no. 25 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">In the event the Insurance Commissioner affirms the December 14, 1993, Notice and Order, MONY agrees not to deny payment for the claim at issue on the ground that the Insured\u2019s condition of Acute and Chronic Anxiety with Panic Attacks first manifested itself prior to the effective date of the Policy, and, the MIA agrees not to hold that MONY\u2019s initial declination was a \u00a7 230A(c)(2) violation. This agreement, however, will in no way impede either Party\u2019s right to an appeal nor MONY\u2019s right to request a Stay from the court on the disability payments pending the outcome of the appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">As indicated, <em>supra, </em>MONY and the MIA entered into the stipulation before the Commissioner in order to obtain a \u201cstatutory interpretation of ... \u00a7 441,\u201d and agreed that this purpose would remain in effect during any appeal arising from the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation. In stipulation no. 25, the parties agreed further that if the Commissioner affirmed the MIA\u2019s order interpreting \u00a7 441 against MONY\u2019s position that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>MONY would not deny payment for the claim at issue on the ground that Ms. Holland\u2019s disability manifested itself prior to the effective date of the policy. In fact, the parties agreed that the only ground that MONY gave Ms. Holland in support of its denial of her claim was based on its interpretation of \u00a7 441.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> From this, we believe that it logically follows that, under the stipulation, MONY effectively agreed to pay Ms. Holland\u2019s claim in accordance with the terms of her policy if the Associate Commissioner\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 441 against MONY\u2019s position was affirmed.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Accordingly, the circuit court was correct in its preliminary finding that, once the interpretation of \u00a7 441 against MONY\u2019s position was affirmed, the first sentence of stipulation no. 25 would have required MONY to pay Ms. Holland\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The circuit court then went on to find that the second sentence of stipulation no. 25, which gave either party the right to appeal any decision of the Commissioner, as well as giving MONY the right to request a stay from the court on the disability payments pending the outcome of the appeal, \u201cmuddled\u201d the otherwise clear result. Our reading of the stipulation as a whole, however, yields a different interpretation of this sentence. Given that the purpose behind the stipulation was to determine the correct interpretation of \u00a7 441, and, as we concluded, <em>supra, </em>MONY effectively agreed to pay Ms. Holland\u2019s claim if the Associate Commissioner\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 441 against its position was affirmed, we feel that the language of the second sentence merely gave MONY the limited right to refuse payment of the claim if the interpretation of \u00a7 441 was overturned in the course of any judicial review of the Associate Commissioner\u2019s decision. As a result, as long as our interpretation of \u00a7 441 stands, MONY <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>cannot under its agreement refuse to pay Ms. Holland\u2019s claim on the ground that her condition manifested itself prior to the issuance of her policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">Based on our conclusion, <em>supra, </em>that subject to any further review on the limited issue of the correct interpretation of \u00a7 441, MONY must pay Ms. Holland\u2019s claim in accordance with the terms of her policy, it is not necessary to address the merits of whether there were any technical violations of the insurance code committed by MONY.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE (CROSS-APPELLANT).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b185-10\">.

Moreover, because this was the only ground that MONY relied upon in denying the claim, an interpretation of \u00a7 441, contrary to MONY\u2019s position, would compel MONY to pay the claim in accordance with the terms of the policy, subject only to possible further discretionary review on the limited issue concerning the correct interpretation of \u00a7 441.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b192-7\">.

The <em>Bell </em>court acknowledged that the Fifth Circuit in <em>Forman </em>did address this portion of the incontestability clause, reasoning that, when other terms in the policy exclude coverage for pre-manifesting conditions, the provisions barring denials for pre-existing conditions are rendered a nullity. The <em>Bell </em>court, however, concluded that this rationale was not persuasive, instead opting to give weight to the plain and ordinary meaning of this portion of the incontestability clause. <em>Bell, </em>27 F.3d at 1281.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b207-12\">. As MONY points out, in <em>Bell, </em>unlike the present situation, the insurer failed to obtain the required approval from the Indiana Commissioner of Insurance to modify its policy to conform to the statute. 27 F.3d at 1282-83. We do not, however, see how this distinction diminishes the value of the <em>Bell </em>decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b207-13\">. The incontestability clause, as well as the definitions of disability and sickness, at issue in <em>Wischmeyer, </em>contained almost identical language as is present in the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b208-8\">. The policy at issue was subject to Delaware law which required such policies to contain a similarly worded incontestability clause as is contained in Ms. Holland's policy. The policy also defined disability in terms of when a sickness \"which first makes itself known while th[e] policy was in force.\u201d 889 F.Supp. at 773.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b210-7\">.

Because the language of \u00a7 441(2) is almost identical to the disputed language in Ms. Holland's incontestability clause, our interpretation of this clause is also applicable to the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b212-7\">. Both parties cite to <em>Mutual of Omaha v. Goldfinger, </em>254 Md. 272, 254 A.2d 683 (1969) to support their respective positions regarding the merits of recognizing an \u201cexist/manifest\u201d distinction when interpreting an incontestability clause. Because this case did not involve an incontestability clause, we do not feel that it affects our limited holding in this case pertaining to the recognition of an \"exist/manifest\u201d distinction under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b214-7\">. In reaching this conclusion, we are cognizant of the \"recognized rule of construction that a contract must be construed in its entirety and, if reasonably possible, effect must be given to each clause or phrase so that a court does not cast out or disregard a meaningful part of the writing.\u201d <em>Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc. v.

Glenangus Farms, </em>234 Md. 156, 167, 198 A.2d 277 (1964)). We feel, however, that the clear meaning of the statutorily imposed language of \u00a7 441(2), as well as the purpose of the statute, make it impossible to give full effect to MONY's definitions of disability and sickness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b215-10\">. These Guidelines, entitled \u201cUnderwriting of Health Insurance Policies,\u201d were \"issued in accordance with Sections 374 and 26 of Article 48A of the Annotated Code of Maryland and are designed for the protection of the public in the purchase of health insurance policies.\u201d They were made applicable to all health insurers, effective 1 August 1970.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b216-7\">. As MONY points out, there are sections found in the Guidelines that could be construed to support its position.

At oral argument before this Court, MONY\u2019s counsel argued for the first time, without any support whatsoever, that the stipulation concerning the historical interpretation of \u00a7 441 was wrong, and asserted that MONY was misled into agreeing to it. Because such a contention, having been raised for the first time on appeal, was not properly preserved for appellate review, it will not be addressed. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8\u2014131 (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b218-6\">.

We note that we do not see any merit in MONY's claim that there is a dispute concerning the full meaning of the stipulation.
