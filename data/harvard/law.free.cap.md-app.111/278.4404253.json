The trial court found that appellee, Roberta Shaffer, was in fact entitled to receive a share of those disability benefits, despite the claim by her former husband, appellant, Douglas Fultz, that the settlement agreement did not encompass them. He appealed the trial court\u2019s judgment, asking:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-12\">Whether the Trial Court erroneously awarded the former wife a marital share of the former husband\u2019s disability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>benefits paid as a result of injury and total disability occurring after the divorce.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">We are advised that, subsequent to taking this appeal, Douglas Fultz died; we are told that a suggestion of death has been, or will be, filed with this Court. We note that, because the underlying case involves the classification of significant property rights, our disposition of this appeal will not abate as a result of Mr. Fultz\u2019s death. <em>See Goldman v. Walker, </em>260 Md. 222, 224-25, 271 A.2d 639 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Also at issue on appeal is a provision in the parties\u2019 settlement agreement that required Mr. Fultz to elect a 100% joint and survivor annuity in favor of Ms. Shaffer. Ms. Shaffer asked the trial court to order her former husband to make that election. Montgomery County, which administers the retirement system at issue, disputed Mr. Fultz\u2019s ability to do so more than six years after the divorce. The County, also an appellant in the instant appeal, is aggrieved by the trial court\u2019s order that the election be made and asks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">A. Was the [trial] court authorized to award a 100% joint and survivor benefit to the former spouse?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-8\">B. Did the [trial] court have a legal basis for overruling the administrative order below that the former spouse was ineligible for designation as a 100% joint and survivor beneficiary?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">We shall address each appellant\u2019s concerns in turn, following a recitation of the relevant facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">CHRONOLOGY OF THE CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b307-11\">The parties were married in August of 1977, approximately three months after Mr. Fultz commenced employment as a Montgomery County police officer. He remained so employed throughout the marriage. His status as a Montgomery County employee entitled him to membership in the Montgomery County Employees\u2019 Retirement System (ERS), which was established \u201cto maintain a system of retirement pay and benefits for [Montgomery County\u2019s] employees which is adequately funded and insures employees sufficient income to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>enjoy during their retirement years.\u201d Montgomery County Code \u00a7 33-34 (1994); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 SS-SGOb).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 1988, the parties separated and, on February 14,1990, they entered into a Voluntary Separation and Property Settlement Agreement (the Separation Agreement), whereby various personal and property issues were resolved, including Ms. Shaffer\u2019s entitlement to a portion of Mr. Fultz\u2019s accrued pension benefits upon retirement and a 100% joint and survivor annuity. Specifically, they agreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-5\">9. <em>DIVISION OF PENSION AND RETIREMENT BENEFITS</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-6\"><em>... </em>The parties acknowledge that the husband\u2019s pension and retirement benefits earned during the marriage are marital property, and as such, are to be divided equally between [them].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-7\">Therefore, if, as and when the husband retires, or is eligible for retirement, the wife shall receive, by direct payment from Montgomery County, one-half of the monthly pension and retirement benefits, specifically including all Cost of Living Adjustments (COLAS) thereon, earned during the marriage, to be calculated as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-8\">Wife\u2019s monthly = ** X Husband\u2019s monthly</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-9\">pension benefit 2 pension benefits</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-10\">** = Number of years of marriage</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-11\">Number of years of service</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-12\">The husband further agrees to select a 100% joint and survivor pension, and shall irrevocably designate the wife as a survivor and lifetime beneficiary of the pension and retirement benefits acquired through his employment with Montgomery County. The wife shall be entitled to the benefits payable to the surviving spouse based upon the above formula. In the event that the husband fails to comply with the requirements of this Article, and fails to designate the wife as the surviving spouse and beneficiary of death bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>fits payable under the Employees\u2019 Retirement System of Montgomery County, his estate shall be liable to the wife for the full amount of the husband\u2019s death benefits to which she would be entitled, pursuant to this paragraph.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">10. <em>QUALIFIED DOMESTIC RELATIONS ORDER</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay5\">The husband specifically agrees to cooperate with the wife, to perform any acts, and to execute any documents, necessary to enable the wife to prepare obtain [sic] a Qualified Domestic Relations Order, to effectuate the provisions of Article [9] above. The Qualified Domestic Relations Order shall designate the wife as the alternate payee/surviving spouse under the Employees\u2019 Retirement System of Montgomery County, and shall recognize her right to receive her designated portion of the husband\u2019s retirement benefits as a division of marital property. The husband further agrees ... in the event that any Qualified Domestic Relations Order is rejected by the retirement system administrators, for any reason, to cooperate fully with the wife and modify any such 0[r]der, to obtain its approval and acceptance by the administrators. The parties agree that the Court shall retain continuing jurisdiction over the Order until it has been approved and accepted by Montgomery County, and/or the plan administrators.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">On February 23, 1990, the parties were divorced by decree entered in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. The Separation Agreement was incorporated, but not merged, into the final decree. Pursuant thereto, the court retained continuing jurisdiction over the case, pending final approval of the Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Thereafter, Mr. Fultz was found to have sustained a service-connected disability and was placed on disability retirement on February 19,1992. In conjunction therewith, he began receiving disability benefits.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thereafter, in February of 1993, Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Shaffer\u2019s attorney contacted the County Attorney for Montgomery County, confirming an earlier discussion that concerned the effect of Mr. Fultz\u2019s disability upon Ms. Shaffer\u2019s rights to her former husband\u2019s retirement benefits under the Separation Agreement and whether Ms. Shaffer was entitled either to share in the disability benefits then being received by Mr. Fultz or begin receiving payment of her share of the accrued retirement benefits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Ms. Shaffer\u2019s attorney reiterated the County\u2019s position that disability benefits are not divisible. in divorce, <em>see </em>\u00a7 33-54, and stated her understanding that Ms. Shaffer\u2019s share of the retirement benefits under the Separation Agreement remained unchanged by Mr. Fultz\u2019s disability: \u201cShe has the same options with respect to the receipt of her portion of the marital retirement benefits as if [Mr. Fultz] had not retired on disability.\u201d The County Attorney agreed with Ms. Shaffer\u2019s summary of their discussion, adding, \u201cThe fact that [Mr. Fultz] has already retired on a disability retirement has no [e]ffect on the amount which [Ms. Shaffer] receives ..., nor does it affect the dates on which the benefits could commence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Mr. Fultz\u2019s Petition</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Prompted by Ms. Shaffer\u2019s attempts to ascertain her right, if any, to the disability benefits under the terms of the Separation Agreement, Mr. Fultz sought, on March 25, 1993, a formal determination of the issue by the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) of the ERS.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specifically, he posed the following question to the CAO for resolution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>When a police officer/pensioner separates from his wife and they sign a Separation Agreement in which she is entitled to a marital share of his pension \u201cif, as, and when he receives it,\u201d and they are divorced, and the husband/pensioner thereafter <em>retires on disability retirement, </em>what, if any, is the wife\u2019s entitlement to any kind of pension benefit?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">He then restated Ms. Shaffer\u2019s position as seeking a reduction in Mr. Fultz\u2019s disability benefits \u201cby the marital portion of the vested accrued benefit, <em>even though (apparently) he will not be receiving his share of the vested accrued pension. </em>\u201d His argument to the CAO was predicated upon his belief that \u201cthe disability retirement fund exists independent of the vested accrued benefit pension system and it is, in effect, an insurance policy against service related injuries and resulting incapacity.\u201d Thus, he argued, his former wife was not entitled to any part thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The CAO issued his ruling on May 21, 1993, flatly rejecting Mr. Fultz\u2019s characterization of the nature of his disability benefits and stating that a \u201cservice connected retirement disability benefit is a special form of retirement benefit.\u201d The CAO continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">I have interpreted the term marital property to be no more then the vested accrued benefit as of the date of the divorce. That vested accrued benefit can be split in whatever percentage the parties agree....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">If the former spouse has an entitlement to 50% of the vested accrued benefit, the member of the ERS will have his or her benefit reduced by that amount.... [0]ur form agreement ... states, among other things, that if a member becomes entitled to the ... disability benefit, that member\u2019s benefit is reduced by 50% of the vested accrued benefit that pertains to the former spouse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-8\">... The determination of Mr. Fultz\u2019s disability occurred after the divorce, and accordingly, it will not affect the amount of the former spouse\u2019s benefit. By the same reasoning, Mr. Fultz\u2019s benefit will be subject to the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>reduction, as a result of the former spouse\u2019s share, after his disability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The CAO also ruled that Ms. Shaffer had no present right to participate in the disbursement of Mr. Fultz\u2019s disability benefits then being received, but stated that the earliest date upon which Ms. Shaffer could begin receiving any payments under the Separation Agreement was 1997, the first date upon which Mr. Fultz could have retired.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Mr. Fultz filed an appeal from the CAO\u2019s ruling with the Merit System Protection Board (MSPB), claiming that the CAO \u201cmisinterpreted\u201d the \u201cif, as and when\u201d language of the Separation Agreement, mischaracterized the nature of his disability benefits, and erred in finding Ms. Shaffer entitled to any part thereof. He sought thereby \u201c[a] ruling stating that the former Mrs. Fultz will not receive a marital portion of [his] accrued vested benefit unless and until [he] actually receives it.\u201d In the alternative, he requested that there be a recalculation of that portion to which she would be entitled. Emphasizing the \u201cif\u2019 in the \u201cif, as and when\u201d language of the parties\u2019 agreement, he further stated that he \u201cmay never actually receive his vested accrued retirement benefit and the extent of his entitlement depends on when payments begin.\u201d In essence, he was arguing that, as long as he was receiving disability payments, he would never achieve retirement status and, thus, his ability to receive the accrued pension benefits would never mature. <em>See Lookingbill v. Lookingbill, </em>301 Md. 283, 285, 483 A.2d 1 (1984) (Maturity connotes the time at which a pension becomes due and payable.). Until maturity, he maintained, his former wife would not be entitled to begin receiving her share of the retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Montgomery County submitted its own letter to the MSPB, setting forth its position in the matter. It began by agreeing with Ms. Shaffer that her share of Mr. Fultz\u2019s retirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>benefits remained unchanged by his disability retirement\u2014 that is, in either 1997 or 2002, her fifty percent share was to become due and payable, at which point Mr. Fultz\u2019s benefits were to be appropriately reduced, whether he chose to begin receiving his accrued pension benefit or continued to receive a disability retirement benefit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The County further rejected Mr. Fultz\u2019s argument that, as long as he continued receiving disability benefits, his retirement date would never arrive and there would be no occasion to pay Ms. Shaffer her share of the accrued benefits. Citing the Montgomery County Code, the County contended that Mr. Fultz had the option to receive a retirement pension benefit at either his early or normal retirement date, whether he chose to accept it or not, and any benefits that would have been received thereafter, whether in the form of continued disability payments or accrued pension benefits, would have been divided between him and his former wife. Seeking affirmance of the CAO\u2019s ruling, the County concluded that any method of disbursement other than that suggested by the CAO would create a payment of benefits exceeding the amount payable to both Mr. Fultz and Ms. Shaffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">On October 23,1993, the MSPB issued its decision affirming the CAO\u2019s ruling. The MSPB found Mr. Fultz\u2019s contention that his retirement date would never arrive so long as he was on disability to be \u201ccontrary to applicable law and the separation agreement which establish that [Ms. Shafferj\u2019s pension benefit became fully vested and determined at the time of the parties\u2019 divorce in February 1990.\u201d The MSPB further found that, \u201c[sjince the disability events occurred after the separation and final divorce of the parties, those events do not cancel the former spouses [sic] pension benefit. However,\u201d the MSPB continued, \u201cthe former spouses [sic] benefit would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>reduce depending on whichever benefit is payable to [Mr. Fultz],\u201d pursuant to his election at the time of his scheduled retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Aggrieved by the MSPB\u2019s affirmance, Mr. Fultz appealed the matter to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, on November 24, 1993. In his memorandum to the court, Mr. Fultz, again emphasizing the \u201cif\u2019 in the \u201cif, as and when\u201d language of the Separation Agreement, stated that, \u201cunless he recovers and returns to work[, he] will never actually receive the vested benefit which he accrued during the marriage.\u201d Thus, he maintained, \u201cthe real issue of the case is whether the former wife/non-pensioner spouse is entitled to any payment of purported marital property.\u201d He contended that the ERS, MSPB, and the County Attorney\u2019s Office \u201cfailed to apply the correct decisional law and, in effect, re-wrote the parties\u2019 agreement.\u201d He began by attacking the time frame within which the CAO calculated Ms. Shaffer\u2019s benefit, stating that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-6\">[t]he <em>Bangs[</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>formula obviously contemplates a fraction which constantly changes, whereas the MC-ERS interpretation fixed the former spouse\u2019s entitlement at a specific dollar amount of the vested accrued benefit, <em>as of the date of divorce </em>(contrary to the plain language of the agreement) <em>regardless of any subsequent events. </em>This is clearly a rewriting of the agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>He then claimed that \u201cthe faulty interpretation of the [Separation Ajgreement led the MC-ERS and the MSPB to avoid analyzing the nature of the retirement benefits\u201d that he was then receiving. He argued that a disability retirement fund is unlike a \u201c \u2018regular\u2019 pension\u201d because it is not funded by income earned by the pensioner during the marriage, thereby insulating it from classification as marital property upon divorce. Instead, he reasoned, the payments he was receiving as a result of his disability were akin to payments made pursuant to a personal injury or workers\u2019 compensation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Ms. Shaffer\u2019s Petition</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">At the same time as Mr. Fultz\u2019s appeal to the circuit court, Ms. Shaffer sought a two-pronged ruling by the CAO that confirmed her entitlement to a portion of her former husband\u2019s disability benefits, then being received solely by him and, under <em>Bangs, </em>that calculated the payment of any benefits to be received by her according to the terms of the Separation Agreement, which refers to Mr. Fultz\u2019s retirement date, rather than the date of divorce, as the dispositive date. Ms. Shaffer also claimed entitlement, under the Separation Agreement, to \u201cthe entire 100% survivor annuity based on Mr. Fultz\u2019s benefits,\u201d and asked the CAO to order Mr. Fultz to elect said annuity in her favor, the payments therefor to be deducted from his share of benefits only.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">As a result of the pendency of the parties\u2019 cases in separate venues, Montgomery County moved the circuit court, on February 7,1994, to remand Mr. Fultz\u2019s case to the MSPB or stay its proceedings to await the ruling of the CAO on Ms. Shaffer\u2019s petition. Contemporaneously therewith, Ms. Shaffer, in two motions, moved the court for leave to intervene in her former husband\u2019s case and to consolidate his appeal with their divorce case, over which the court had continuing jurisdiction because no QDRO had yet been submitted and approved. In her motions, Ms. Shaffer claimed that her position was not being adequately represented because the County, although believing her to be entitled to benefits, believed the maturity date to be that of Mr. Fultz\u2019s scheduled retirement, rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>than February 19, 1992, the date of his disability retirement. She also claimed that, by his actions, Mr. Fultz had breached their Separation Agreement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On March 11, 1994, the circuit court permitted Ms. Shaffer\u2019s intervention and ordered that her Motion to Enforce and Mr. Fultz\u2019s appeal from the MSPB be consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">When the CAO issued his ruling, on April 8, 1994, his decision mirrored the ruling rendered by the CAO previously in respect to Mr. Fultz\u2019s petition: Ms. Shaffer was not entitled to receive any portion of Mr. Fultz\u2019s disability benefits; her right to receive any retirement benefits was to become due and payable in 1997 or 2002. The CAO further found that, \u201c[u]nder the terms of the ERS, Mr. Fultz cannot elect a 100% survivor annuity with respect to a former spouse.\u201d He did note that, had such an election been possible, the cost therefor would have been borne by both parties, rather than solely Mr. Fultz.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">In analyzing the issues Ms. Shaffer raised for his consideration, the CAO. began by noting that, although the Separation Agreement memorialized the parties\u2019 accord, his interpretation and application thereof would necessarily be \u201cwithin the constraints of the ERS\u201d regulations. Turning to the matter of the time at which the division of retirement benefits is to be made, the CAO found that \u201cthe formula used in the Separation Agreement could result in post-divorce property being transferred to the former spouse,\u201d and concluded that \u201cthe retirement plan property to be transferred pursuant to the divorce must be that property calculated as of the date of the divorce.\u201d He found support for this in the Separation Agreement\u2019s reference to the division of pension and retirement benefits <em>earned during the marriage </em>and, thus, \u201cinterpreted the term marital property to be no more than the vested accrued benefit as of the date of the divorce.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Regarding Ms. Shaffer\u2019s claim of present entitlement to a portion of Mr. Fultz\u2019s then disability benefits, the CAO distinguished the <em>Bangs </em>case, stating that the parties\u2019 agreement \u201cdoes not entitle the former spouse to receive a portion of <em>each </em>payment made from the ERS,\u201d but rather a portion of the \u201c \u2018monthly ... benefits [ ... ] earned during the marriage.\u2019 \u201d Because Mr. Fultz became disabled after the parties\u2019 divorce, he reasoned, Ms. Shaffer \u201cis not entitled to any portion of the payments made from the ERS which result <em>solely </em>from his disability.\u201d The CAO further stated that Ms. Shaffer could not commence receiving any portion of the accrued pension benefits prior to Mr. Fultz\u2019s then scheduled retirement date; his receipt of disability payments did not entitle her to receive an early distribution of her benefits.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Relying upon ERS regulations and restrictions, the CAO then declined to order Mr. Fultz to elect a 100% survivor annuity in her favor, citing \u00a7 33-44(a)(3), which limits this election to a spouse or child; because the parties were divorced, they were, necessarily, no longer spouses. In an attempt to reconcile what he perceived to be the parties\u2019 intent and the ERS\u2019s regulations, however, the CAO did state that Ms. Shaffer would \u201creceive her portion of the retirement benefits, in the form of a ten-year certain and continuous annuity, subject to the appropriate actuarial reductions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Aggrieved by the CAO\u2019s ruling, Ms. Shaffer appealed the matter to the MSPB. In her memorandum to the MSPB, she challenged, <em>inter alia, </em>the CAO\u2019s decision that her benefits were to be valued as of the date of the parties\u2019 divorce; the <em>Bangs </em>Formula \u201capplies to the <em>monthly pension benefits to be paid at the time of actual retirement.\u201d </em>She argued that \u201c[t]he formula is not applied to the value of the benefits as of the date of divorce since to do so would deprive the former spouse of any increase in her value of benefits from date of divorce to date of retirement.\u201d Such a deprivation, she maintained, \u201chas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>a substantial impact on the amount of money ... and ... the value of the property right she received in the divorce settlement,\u201d and \u201cmakes a mockery of the requirement of Maryland law that a former spouse is entitled to a share of the \u2018marital property\u2019 portion of a participant\u2019s retirement benefits.\u201d Addressing her bid for a share of Mr. Fultz\u2019s disability benefits, Ms. Shaffer began by looking to the \u201cwhen\u201d in the \u201cif, as and when\u201d language of the Separation Agreement in stating that the parties agreed that- she would share in Mr. Fultz\u2019s benefits <em>when </em>he received them; since he began receiving benefits in 1992, she became entitled, under the Separation Agreement to share therein at that time. Drawing upon the Court of Appeals\u2019 language in <em>Lookingbill, supra, </em>301 Md. at 288, 483 A.2d 1, she further predicated her claim to her former husband\u2019s disability benefits upon the fact that his entitlement to these payments in the first instance arose by virtue of his employment and, therefore, constituted a form of marital property. Ms. Shaffer then attacked the CAO\u2019s provision for a ten-year certain and continuous annuity, stating that her share thereof would only be guaranteed for ten years and the length of Mr. Fultz\u2019s life thereafter. The only way her benefits would be protected, she argued, would be by an award of the 100% survivor annuity upon which the parties agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The County filed its own memorandum in Ms. Shaffer\u2019s appeal to the MSPB. In it, the County stated that the CAO\u2019s decision respecting the pension benefits was \u201cfair, rational, and in accordance with the Separation Agreement,\u201d and reiterated that ERS regulations did not permit Mr. Fultz to purchase the annuity Ms. Shaffer was demanding. It averred that, in using the phrase, \u201cpension and retirement benefits,\u201d in the Separation Agreement, the parties did not \u201cconsider[ ] the possibility that [Mr.] Fultz would \u2018retire\u2019 on disability two years after execution of the separation agreement.\u201d Rather, the County reasoned, \u201cit appears that the parties intended to divide those benefits payable when [Mr.] Fultz retired in the normal way, after 20 or 25 years\u2019 service.\u201d The County stated further that the parties had adopted the traditional concept of marital property in their agreement and, because Mr. Fultz\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>disability occurred after the divorce, Ms. Shaffer\u2019s lack of entitlement thereto was without question.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The County also rejected Ms. Shaffer\u2019s contention that her share of benefits, in accord with the <em>Bangs </em>Formula, should be calculated as of the date Mr. Fultz retired, rather than the date of the divorce, stating that, despite her importuning, such a conclusion \u201cis not supported by the facts, the language of the agreement, the <em>Bangs </em>decision, or elementary considerations of fairness.\u201d It contended that the parties\u2019 Separation Agreement was meant to divide the rights, obligations, and property they owned at the time of the divorce and not some later time. In respect to the annuity, the County simply reiterated that Ms. Shaffer\u2019s status as a former spouse precluded Mr. Fultz from electing her as a beneficiary of a 100% survivor annuity; the ERS could not be forced to accept such a late designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The MSPB rendered its decision on July 25, 1994, affirming the CAO\u2019s ruling. In it, the Chairman stated that the CAO was \u201ccorrect in ... conclu[ding] that the disability benefits which Mr. Fultz received approximately two years after the divorce were outside the contemplation of the separation agreement and, thus, outside the benefits which had already vested during the marriage.\u201d He further stated that, despite the Separation Agreement, Ms. Shaffer did not qualify for a survivor annuity under the Montgomery County Code. That is to say, she was not a spouse or child. <em>See </em>\u00a7 33-44(a)(3). The MSPB concluded that Ms. Shaffer\u2019s entitlement to any benefits would mature upon Mr. Fultz\u2019s scheduled retirement date, to be calculated by a formula taking into account only \u201cthose benefits earned during the marriage and fixed and vested as of the date of the divorce.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">The Consolidated Case</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">A hearing on all matters was thereafter held in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County on November 23, 1994.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Fultz argued that the \u201cpension and retirement benefits\u201d contemplated by the Separation Agreement were those that succeeded completion of \u201cordinary uninterrupted service\u201d of employment. He distinguished disability retirement payments therefrom, based upon the fact that deductions therefor were not taken from his salary as is generally the case with pension benefits. He further stated that payments stemming from a disability that occurs after a divorce should not be exposed to classification as marital property and, thus, Ms. Shaffer should not participate in the distribution of those benefits at any time. Indeed, he contended, if <em>any </em>kind of retirement benefit had been intended when the parties executed the agreement, they would have expressly provided therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Ms. Shaffer proffered a converse position, alleging that the parties had indeed intended that \u201cpension and retirement benefits\u201d include disability benefits. She then challenged the finding that, because use of the <em>Bangs </em>Formula would transfer to her money Mr. Fultz had earned following the divorce, her benefits should be determined as of the date of the divorce. She stated that this concern had been addressed in <em>Bangs </em>and, \u201calthough the former spouse does in fact get some of the benefit of the post-divorce earnings, ... it ... is offset by the percentage [resulting from the <em>Bangs </em>Formula] going down.\u201d Furthermore, she argued, the method of calculation advocated by the County to adjust for this anomaly, <em>ie., </em>the determination of her benefits as of the time of divorce, was contrary to \u2022 the Separation Agreement\u2019s provision for payment of a percentage of Mr. Fultz\u2019s <em>monthly </em>benefits, and \u201cfreez[es] her share\u201d as of 1990. She went on to claim that, once Maryland law permitted the division of pension benefits between former spouses, a procedure otherwise prohibited under ERS regulations, the requirement that the <em>Bangs </em>Formula be used when such a division is effected should be similarly permitted, despite ERS regulations to the contrary. She proffered the same argument against selective application of Maryland law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>in respect to the 100% survivor annuity, and made a claim for attorney\u2019s fees, citing a provision in the Separation Agreement providing for same in the event of a breach of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">While the County agreed with Mr. Fultz that the Separation Agreement had not contemplated division of any disability retirement benefits but, rather, encompassed benefits arising solely out of a \u201ccustomary type of retirement,\u201d it stated that Ms. Shaffer did have a right to receive retirement benefits, a right that would have matured in 1997 or 2002 when, under the Separation Agreement, Mr. Fultz was scheduled to \u201cretire[ ], or be eligible for retirement.\u201d It then added: It \u201cis ... rational and very reasonable ... to apportion the benefits ... as of the time of the divorce ... and to fix the benefits that are then going to be paid out and not to take into account future events.\u201d In respect to the annuity, the County looked to the terms of the parties\u2019 agreement in arguing that they had specifically provided for a remedy in the event that Mr. Fultz, for whatever reason, failed to elect a 100% survivor annuity in her favor. It is to that provision, the County argued, that Ms. Shaffer must look for recourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">In an opinion rendered from the bench on November 23, 1994, the court stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\">[I]t was obviously the intention of the parties to secure Mrs. Fultz\u2019[s] economic interest that she had in the marital relationship while it existed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-8\">Of course, the Court has a limited number of methods in which he can resolve this dispute, but one of them certainly results in essentially the evaporation of her economic interests. That is totally inconsistent with the separation and property settlement agreement executed between the parties. It is also an inappropriate resolution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-9\">Fortunately, principles of equity do somehow permeate the body of law commonly called family law, and more often than not the Court is really oriented toward reaching a real and practical solution, as opposed to something that is impractical and theoretical.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>Essentially I guess, what I am about to do is more in line with reformation than anything else, but obviously the type of retirement contemplated is not the reality of this case. What I am going to do is determine that it is appropriate for the Court to carry out the full intention of the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-5\">With respect to the rights under the disability retirement that now applies to Mr. Fultz, essentially I am going to translate the retirement participation as recited by the parties to his disability pension, and the same percentage, and it shall be paid in the same fashion, if, as and when.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4x\">The court also denied Ms. Shaffer\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees, finding that Mr. Fultz had a \u201cgood faith basis for challenging the position[s] of the competing parties,\u201d and had not acted \u201cwillful[ly]\u201d in failing to comply with the Separation Agreement. The court provided a more detailed ruling in its written Order of January 9, 1995. Specifically, it also found Ms. Shaffer to be entitled to the 100% survivor annuity, in addition to the interest in Mr. Fultz\u2019s retirement benefits, including those received on account of disability. The court further ordered that Mr. Fultz pay Ms. Shaffer an amount equal to her share of disability benefits received through November 30,1994, totalling approximately $44,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Mr. Fultz, on January 17, 1995, filed a Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment, asserting that \u201cthe Court\u2019s January [9], 1995 Order effects a division of non-marital property which is not permitted by the Maryland Marital Property Act and its decisional law.\u201d He stated that the intent of the parties \u201cclearly <em>excluded </em>the possibility that [Ms. Shaffer] would receive the windfall benefit which the Court ... authorized,\u201d and \u201cthat the ... contractual language [was] clear and unambiguous and permitted] only the conclusion that pension benefits earned DURING THE MARRIAGE ... were to be divided equally between the parties \u2018if, as, and when\u2019 Mr. Fultz reached the specified age(s) and [Ms. Shaffer] chose when to receive her share.\u201d He hinged this argument against permitting Ms. Shaffer to share in his disability payments upon the absence of language in the Separation Agreement that provided for the \u201cspeculative possibility\u201d of disability and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>the fact that no amounts were deducted from his salary to fund same. He again likened his disability payments to those resulting from personal injury or workers\u2019 compensation claims and stated, \u201c[I]t is virtually impossible to conclude that either of the parties intended that a post-divorce disability retirement would be subject to equitable division by the Court.\u201d He claimed that, by its Order, the court had, effectively, rewritten the parties\u2019 Separation Agreement to provide Ms. Shaffer with a share of benefits for which she had never bargained, whose source was \u201cunmistakably non-marital funds.\u201d He requested, <em>inter alia, </em>that the court vacate its Order and hold a hearing to ascertain the parties\u2019 intent when executing the Separation Agreement. Both the County and Ms. Shaffer filed motions in response, which restated their respective positions on the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The circuit court denied Mr. Fultz\u2019s motion, following a hearing on May 16, 1995. Mr. Fultz filed the instant appeal from that denial, as well as from the court\u2019s January 9, 1995 Order. The County filed its own notice of appeal in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">THE LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">The Disability Retirement Benefits</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">\u201cMarital property\u201d is merely a term created to describe a status of property acquired during marriage, which, however titled, may give rise to potential inequity upon dissolution of marriage. It is this inequity that is corrected by way of a monetary award. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1984, 1991 Repl.Vol., 1995 Supp.), \u00a7 8-205 of the Family Law Article (FL). Couples seeking to avoid the vagaries attendant upon such an award often enter into agreements whereby these property issues, as well as matters of alimony and child support, are resolved. The right to make these agreements, sometimes termed property settlement agreements, is without question. <em>Schneider v.

Indeed, FL \u00a7 8-105 provides the court with power to enforce the provisions of a settlement agreement; an agreement that has been incorporated, but not merged, into the final decree, may be enforced as a judgment or as an independent contract. FL \u00a7 8-105(a)(2). In the latter instance, a settlement agreement is subject to general contract law; <em>Feick v. Thrutchley, </em>322 Md. 111, 114, 586 A.2d 3 (1991) (quoting <em>Goldberg v.

Particular questions must be resolved by looking first to the particular language of the agreement at issue. <em>Id. </em>If that language is clear as to its meaning, there is no room for construction and it must be presumed that the parties meant what they expressed. <em>Feick, supra, </em>322 Md. at 114, 586 A.2d 3; <em>General Motors Acceptance Corp. v.

The court may not rewrite the terms of the contract or draw a new one when the terms of the disputed contract are clear and unambiguous, merely to avoid hardship or because one party has become dissatisfied with its provisions. <em>See Canaras, </em>272 Md. at 350, 322 A.2d 866; <em>Automatic Retailers of Am., Inc. v.

If, however, a reasonably prudent person would consider the contract susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation, it will be deemed ambiguous. <em>State v. Attman/Glazer P.B.

In that case, the parties to a written contract will not be allowed to place their own interpretation on what it means or was intended to mean; the test is what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have thought that it meant. <em>Satine v.

A contract is not ambiguous merely because the parties thereto cannot agree as to its proper interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Turning to the case <em>sub judice, </em>the parties agreed: \u201c[I]f, as and when the husband retires, <em>or is eligible for retirement, </em>the wife shall receive ... one-half of the monthly pension and retirement benefits, specifically including all Cost of Living Adjustments (COLAS) thereon, earned during the marriage, to be calculated\u201d according to the <em>Bangs </em>Formula. (Emphasis added.) Before we may address the issues raised, we must first determine the scope of the benefits upon which the parties agreed. If the phrase, \u201cpension and retirement benefits,\u201d includes those benefits paid on account of disability, Ms. Shaffer was entitled to participate in their disbursement, if, as and when received, <em>i.e., </em>as of February, 1992. Conversely, if the parties intended that \u201cpension and retirement benefits\u201d only encompass those paid following a lengthy period of service, Ms. Shaffer was not entitled to any benefits received by her former husband until such time as he would have been permitted, under \u00a7 33\u201443(i)(l), to elect to continue receiving disability payments or to receive accrued vested retirement benefits in lieu thereof. In order to ascribe a more precise description to the benefits, we look to several other cases that have addressed the issue.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Pension benefits were first considered marital property, to the extent accumulated during marriage, in <em>Deering v. Deering, </em>292 Md. 115, 128, 437 A.2d 883 (1981). Pension benefits were seen \u201cas an economic resource acquired with the fruits of the wage earner spouse\u2019s labors which would otherwise have been utilized by the parties during the marriage to purchase other deferred income assets.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 124, 437 A.2d 883. While the <em>Deering </em>Court recognized that there existed a \u201cwide variety\u201d of retirement plans, both public and private, contributory and noncontributory, with different vesting rules, it stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-5\">[t]he dominant trend in this area of the law, however, rejects such distinctions between pension benefits when making the threshold determination of whether a retirement plan constitutes marital property and postpones consideration of the possibly contingent nature of such rights until valuing the asset or apportioning the marital property between the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 126-27, 437 A.2d 883 (discussing <em>Weir v. Weir, </em>173 N.J.Super. 130, 413 A.2d 638 (Ch. Div.1980); <em>In re Marriage of Brown, </em>15 Cal.3d 838, 126 Cal.Rptr. 633, 544 P.2d 561 (1976) <em>(en banc)). Deering </em>involved service-related retirement plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">In <em>Lookingbill v. Lookingbill, supra, </em>301 Md. 283, 483 A.2d 1, the Court of Appeals was asked to determine whether a disability retirement plan fell within the holding in <em>Deering. </em>There, the Carroll County Fire Department provided the husband with several pension plans, each available to him under certain circumstances, and two of which had importance to the case. The first, a service retirement plan, was administered according to the employee\u2019s age and length of service. The second, an accidental injury retirement plan, permitted \u201ca fireman ... [to] receive an allowance regardless of age or length of service,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 284, 483 A.2d 1; the dominant factor was a work-related injury. Shortly before the parties were divorced, the husband retired by reason of a work-related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>injury and began receiving <em>an </em>allowance therefor. In making a monetary award to the wife, the trial court determined that the husband\u2019s pension benefits were marital property and, accordingly, ascribed a value thereto for purposes of the award. In its opinion, the Court of Appeals acknowledged that \u201c \u2018pension benefits have become an increasingly important part of an employee\u2019s compensation package which he or she brings to a marriage unit.... [T]he pension right ... may well represent the most valuable asset accumulated by either of the marriage partners.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 287, 483 A.2d 1 (quoting <em>Deering, </em>292 Md. at 122-23, 437 A.2d 883). Echoing its language in <em>Deering, </em>the Court found inapposite the fact that the husband began receiving the disability benefits before his divorce; \u201cneither the fact of vesting nor the fact of maturing is significant to a determination whether a pension is marital property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 288, 483 A.2d 1. Indeed, \u201cthe contingencies to which the payment of [an] allowance may be subject are [also] not significant to a determination whether the pension is marital property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 289, 483 A.2d 1. Viewed in this light, \u201c[p]ension payments are actually partial consideration for past employment whether the maturity of the pension is contingent upon age and service or upon disability.\u201d <em>Id; see also Prince George\u2019s County Police Pension Plan v. Burke, </em>321 Md. 699, 705, 584 A.2d 702 (1991). While <em>\u201cDeering </em>did not speak directly to disability plans,\u201d the Court stated, \u201cits rationale and authorities fully support the conclusion that a disability plan, in appropriate circumstances,[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>] may constitute marital property.\u201d 301 Md. at 289, 483 A.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">One such set of circumstances was presented in our recent case of <em>Lebac v. Lebac, </em>109 Md.App. 396, 675 A.2d 131 (1996). There, in connection with their divorce, the parties had executed a separation agreement, which stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>[W]hen and if the [husband] shall be entitled to receive retirement benefits from his U.S. Secret Service employment, the [wife], as alternative payee, as and for marital property, shall receive a sum equal to twenty percent (20%) of any payment received by [the husband] as a result of his employment by the U.S. Secret Service Uniformed Division ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">109 Md.App. at 399-100, 675 A.2d 131. Thereafter, the husband retired on disability and began receiving monthly payments therefor; the wife received no share of those benefits. Relying upon the agreement, she sought the entry of judgment for her share thereof. In defense, the husband maintained that his disability benefits were in the nature of workers\u2019 compensation and, because received following the divorce, were not subject to equitable distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">We held that the husband\u2019s disability retirement income was a retirement benefit covered by the parties\u2019 separation agreement. Although the pension plan under which the husband had retired was a noncontributory one, <em>i.e., </em>it was funded solely by his employer, <em>id. </em>at 406, 675 A.2d 131, we reiterated our observation in <em>Ohm v. Ohm, </em>49 Md.App. 392, 397, 431 A.2d 1371 (1981) (quoting <em>In re Marriage of Rogers, </em>45 Or.App. 885, 609 P.2d 877, 880, <em>modified, </em>47 Or.App. 963, 615 P.2d 412 (1980)), that, \u201c \u2018[e]ven where contributions have been made entirely by the employer, the courts have concluded that retirement benefits are a mode of employee compensation and as such are an earned property right of the marriage.\u2019 \u201d We then noted that, although the husband\u2019s participation in the pension plan was contingent upon his retirement on disability, contingent interests have long been recognized as property in Maryland. 109 Md.App. at 406, 675 A.2d 131 (citing <em>Lookingbill, supra, </em>301 Md. at 289, 483 A.2d 1). Because \u201chis disability retirement rights were acquired during his marriage,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 407, 675 A.2d 131, the fact that he was actually disabled after the marriage did not bar the wife from sharing therein. Worthy of particular note is our <em>dictum </em>in <em>Lebac: </em>\u201c[W]e think that no matter how [the husband]\u2019s retirement benefits are characterized, [the wife] is entitled to twenty per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>cent of them.... [W]hen <em>the </em>parties [executed their agreement], ... they were agreeing that no matter how characterized, [the husband]\u2019s retirement benefits are \u2018marital property,\u2019 entitling [the wife] to twenty per cent of them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>n. 11 (bracketed material added).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The parties in the case <em>mb judice agreed </em>that Mr. Fultz\u2019s pension and retirement benefits were marital property. We are, thus, guided by that recital and need only determine whether the trial court properly found that Mr. Fultz\u2019s disability payments were a retirement benefit within the scope of their agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The cases we have discussed indicate that disability benefits are in fact a type of retirement benefit subject to equitable distribution, whether the pensioner is disabled before or after the parties\u2019 divorce. Because the parties to the instant matter agreed that Mr. Fultz\u2019s retirement benefits constitute marital property that was to be divided upon receipt, the validity of Ms. Shaffer\u2019s claim to his disability benefits is pellucid. Moreover, by their agreement, the parties contractually fixed their rights and obligations attendant to the divorce, and Mr. Fultz may not now challenge its terms merely because he is dissatisfied with its effects and/or his failure to define more precisely those benefits in which Ms. Shaffer would share. The parties placed their own definition upon the anticipated benefits, and they must abide by that definition. However the payments are characterized, the parties\u2019 Separation Agreement provided that Ms. Shaffer share in any and all allowances paid to Mr. Fultz on account of his retirement. The trial court did not err in finding Ms. Shaffer was entitled to participate in the disbursement of those benefits. We explain further.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Throughout the pendency of this matter, Mr. Fultz argued that, as long as he was receiving a disability allowance, he was not \u201cretired\u201d and Ms. Shaffer was not entitled to participate in any disbursement of benefits. Not only does this position ignore the clear language of the Montgomery County Code, but we also cannot agree that the parties intended that Ms. Shaffer would be completely disenfranchised in the event that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Mr. Fultz\u2019s retirement arose from anything other than a lengthy period of service. Had that been the case, the parties would have included language in the Separation Agreement duly restricting Ms. Shaffer\u2019s right to benefits rendered solely on account of an extended period of service. Moreover, the absence of language specifically excluding disability benefits from the phrase, \u201cpension and retirement benefits,\u201d demonstrates that the parties intended any type of pension and retirement benefit to apply. The contractual language was all-inclusive. By its clear terms, it included any and all pension rights and retirement rights. Therefore, although Mr. Fultz\u2019s right to receive disability payments was contingent upon his retirement on disability, it was still a right that, at least partially, accrued during the marriage by virtue of Mr. Fultz\u2019s employment in the first instance, and Ms. Shaffer was entitled to share therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">We note further that Mr. Fultz labored under a fundamental misconception about the import of the ERS regulations. Section 33\u201443(i)(l) provides that, upon attainment of a member\u2019s scheduled retirement date, a member who is receiving a disability pension is required to make an election in favor of continuation of those benefits in lieu of accrued vested benefits, or in favor of commencing receipt of vested benefits and terminating disability benefits. In either instance, the member may only receive one pension. Therefore, to the extent that Mr. Fultz stated that Ms. Shaffer could not share in <em>any </em>of his disability benefits, he was mistaken. Had he not died and were he to have elected to continue receipt of disability payments, Ms. Shaffer would then necessarily have been entitled to receive a share of those benefits, under the terms of the Separation Agreement. Mr. Fultz could not have unilaterally deprived his former wife of her share of his retirement benefits merely by placing his own characterization upon his disability allowances in order to avoid compliance with their agreement. <em>See Lebac, supra, </em>109 Md.App. at 407, 675 A.2d 131 (The husband\u2019s \u201cperception that the separation agreement provided otherwise is of no consequence____ Were we to adopt [his] position, his election of a disability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>retirement rather than a normal \u2018service\u2019 retirement would leave [the wife] without recourse. We do not believe that such a result was intended.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">Mr. Fultz also looked to correspondence transmitted between counsel during finalization of the terms of the Separation Agreement to support his claim that disability benefits were not intended to be within the scope of \u201cretirement benefits.\u201d Be that as it may, the parties\u2019 final agreement made no such distinction, and we shall not ascribe such an interpretation to it. They agreed that pension and retirement benefits were marital property that would be divided upon receipt. The trial court did not err in so finding. Mr. Fultz\u2019s reliance upon the timing of the receipt of his disability pension in opposing Ms. Shaffer\u2019s claim thereto was similarly misplaced. He stated that \u201cproperty acquired <em>after </em>the divorce is non-marital property.\u201d While he was correct in so stating, he overlooked the fact that he agreed otherwise\u2014he agreed that his pension and retirement benefits were, in fact, marital property. Moreover, to require a disability benefit to mature before divorce for it to be subject to equitable distribution ignores the fact that contingent rights, <em>ie., </em>the possibility of receiving disability benefits, are a property right in Maryland. On this point, we are persuaded by Ms. Shaffer\u2019s argument that \u201c[t]he fact that the right to receive the disability benefits matured following the divorce no more defeats [her] right to her share of the disability benefits than does the fact that Mr. Fultz\u2019[s] right to receive normal retirement benefits would have also matured following the divorce.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">In making our decision, we emphasize that it is based upon the parties\u2019 agreement. As we have indicated, FL \u00a7 8-105 provides the court with the power to enforce that agreement. Actions in derogation thereof shall be considered a breach of the terms of the agreement. In <em>Dexter v. Dexter, </em>105 Md. App. 678, 661 A.2d 171 (1995), we were presented with a similar set of facts. There, we addressed the husband\u2019s breach of a settlement agreement, which provided the wife with a specified percentage of her former husband\u2019s military pension \u201cas, if, and when\u201d paid to him. 105 Md.App. at 679, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>661 A.2d 171. When the husband retired (after the divorce), both he and his former -wife began receiving their respective share of the retirement benefits. Shortly thereafter, the husband voluntarily waived his right to receive those benefits, thereby terminating their disbursement, in order to qualify for greater benefits, based upon disability. By his waiver, however, he had terminated the wife\u2019s benefits; she did not receive any share of the disability benefits, based upon a federal statute prohibiting the division thereof to benefit a former spouse. The wife thereafter requested that the trial court reduce to judgment its monetary award based upon the husband\u2019s pension and order him to pay her sums in the future based upon the percentage upon which they had agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">The trial court, recognizing that the wife was \u201c[b]asically ... seeking to enforce the agreement,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 682, 661 A.2d 171, stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">What I do see, though, is parties ... entering into an agreement in which both of them contemplated ... the husband would retire ... and the wife would receive 47.5 percent of his retirement pay ... and that is what they bargained for, and that is what they intended ... I find as a matter of fact that that is what the parties intended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-7\">... I think implicit in an agreement is that both parties will take any and all reasonable steps to carry out the intentions of the parties as expressed by this agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-8\">... I am sure that it isn\u2019t fair.... It has the clear effect of depriving the ... wife of a substantial portion of the benefits of this agreement....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-9\">... [I]f a reasonable interpretation can be given ... then that interpretation should be given ... although the husband had an absolute right to pursue [disability] benefits ..., he couldn\u2019t do that and at the same time deprive the wife of the benefits that she had bargained for under the agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-10\">So what I find is that ... the implicit terms of the agreement would require the husband to make the wife <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>whole, and by doing that he would have to pay her the amount that they bargained for in order to not be in breach of the agreement, and he hasn\u2019t done that, and so I find that he has breached the agreement....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 683-84, 661 A.2d 171 (footnote and emphasis omitted; some brackets and omissions in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">In affirming the trial court\u2019s judgment, we stated that, under the statute, the wife was not entitled to share in the greater disability benefits, but was entitled to receive that which she would have received under the agreement had the husband not waived his right to the military pension. It is particularly cogent that the agreement specifically referred to the division of the husband\u2019s \u201cmilitary pension\u201d and no other. It is because the husband had hindered his former wife\u2019s right to receive his <em>military pension </em>that we considered him to have breached the agreement and held that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALK\">under Maryland contract law where ... the parties enter into an agreement that one spouse will receive a percentage of [specific] pension benefits, on a periodic basis, when they become payable, and when ... they are already payable and being paid, the pensioned party may not hinder the ability of the party\u2019s spouse to receive the payments she has bargained for.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 686, 661 A.2d 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Mr. Fultz claimed that the trial court \u201cran afoul\u201d of our holding in <em>Dexter </em>and asked us to direct the court to award Ms. Shaffer that for which she bargained, <em>i.e., </em>that amount of vested accrued pension that accumulated during the marriage. Ms. Shaffer finds <em>Dexter </em>inapposite. We are inclined to agree \u25a0with Ms. Shaffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">Although, in effect, Ms. Shaffer is seeking to enforce the agreement, it is an agreement that specifically provides for a division of <em>all </em>retirement benefits, benefits that we have held include disability benefits, unless they are expressly excluded. As we have indicated, the agreement in <em>Dexter </em>specifically provided the wife with a share in her husband\u2019s \u201cmilitary pension,\u201d to the apparent exclusion of all others. She had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>contracted for a right in any other pension plan, or \"in all pension plans available to her former husband. Moreover, in <em>Dexter, </em>there were two separate and distinct pensions at issue\u2014the military pension arid a pension administered by the Veterans\u2019 Administration. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Mr. Fultz\u2019s benefits, service or disability related, emanated from one source\u2014the ERS. He did not need to reapply to another agency or pension plan to continue receiving benefits. The ERS \u201cconstitute^] the only source of [Mr. Fultz]\u2019s retirement income. Therefore, he [was] receiving \u2018retirement benefits\u2019 as a \u2018result of his employment ... \u2019 [as provided for in the agreement]. Consequently, [Ms. Shaffer]\u2019s right to receive [a part] of [his] retirement benefits vested the moment he retired.\u201d <em>See Lebac, supra, </em>109 Md.App. at 407, 675 A.2d 131 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">We hold, therefore, that the court properly enforced the agreement to provide Ms. Shaffer with a share in the disability benefits. The court also properly calculated the amount of the award. Accordingly, we shall therefore affirm that part of the trial court\u2019s January 9,1995 Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">The 100% Joint and Survivor Annuity</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">The County appeals from that portion of the trial court\u2019s ruling that ordered Mr. Fultz to elect a 100% joint and survivor annuity in favor of Ms. Shaffer. Because of Mr. Fultz\u2019s untimely death, this issue may be of significance in the distribution of his estate. If the trial court erred in ordering that the election in Ms. Shaffer\u2019s favor be made, Mr. Fultz\u2019s designation of his widow and two children stands. Otherwise, Ms. Shaffer receives the amount of the survivor benefits to the exclusion of Mrs. Fultz.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">The County maintains that Ms. Shaffer is not now, and has not been since February 21, 1990, eligible for designation as a joint and survivor beneficiary. Section 33^44 provides for elections in favor of spouses and children, see \u00a7 33-44(a)(3), but not former spouses, the County claims. Ms. Shaffer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>argues that \u201c[t]he County\u2019s position is inconsistent and not supported by any reasonable interpretation of applicable law.\u201d She states that, despite a provision in the ERS regulations prohibiting payment to a former spouse of a share of an employee-member\u2019s retirement benefits, such payments are made. By the same token, she continues, the ERS should permit election of annuities and payment thereof to former spouses.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">It has been said that \u201cthe right to a survivor annuity is incident to the marital relationship, and ... such a right, analogous to the right to the pension benefits themselves, falls within the definition of marital property contained in <em>Deering v. Deering, supra, </em>292 Md. at 125, 437 A.2d 883.\u201d <em>Pleasant v. Pleasant, </em>97 Md.App. 711, 725, 632 A.2d 202 (1993). We went on to state in <em>Pleasant </em>that the decision to award a survivor annuity to a former spouse lies within the discretion of the trial court. <em>Id. </em>That case, however, involved a judicial award of retirement benefits, rather than an award pursuant to a settlement agreement. FL \u00a7 8-105 provides the court with the power to enforce a settlement agreement as an independent contract. Therefore, whatever the validity of Ms. Shaffer\u2019s argument in this respect, whenever the parties define the limits of their rights and obligations in a contract, the contract controls, and no discretion is lodged in the court to weigh and apply the equities in conflict with such an agreement. <em>Hospital for the Women of Maryland ex rel. Robert S. Green, Inc. v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., </em>177 Md. 615, 623, 11 A.2d 457 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Under the terms of the Separation Agreement, the parties provided a remedy in the event that Mr. Fultz failed to make the designation. They agreed that \u201chis estate shall be liable to the wife for the full amount of [Mr. FultzJ\u2019s death benefits to which she would be entitled.\u201d Ms. Shaffer may not use the Separation Agreement as a sword to obtain a share of Mr. Fultz\u2019s disability benefits and as a shield to avoid application of the remedy upon which the parties agreed. As was the case with Mr. Fultz, Ms. Shaffer\u2019s dissatisfaction with her contractual decision to accept the alternate remedy is not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>basis upon which to ignore it. The trial court erred in failing to rule that Ms. Shaffer\u2019s only recourse lay with the Separation Agreement. Moreover, with Mr. Fultz\u2019s death, he cannot be ordered to do anything. Events have curtailed the ability of the court to impose orders on Mr. Fultz. Of necessity, Ms. Shaffer must look to the Separation Agreement for relief, if any.</p>\n<p id=\"AK2\">We caution that our holding is limited to circumstances in which an agreement establishing the parties\u2019 rights and obligations attendant to their divorce has been executed. We make no comment upon the effect of a noncontract-based judicial award to an individual of his or her former spouse\u2019s retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">JUDGMENT AS TO DISABILITY BENEFITS AFFIRMED; JUDGMENT AS TO ANNUITY REVERSED; COSTS TO BE PAID ONE-HALF BY APPELLANT FULTZ AND ONE-HALF BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b308-13\">.

The <em>Bangs </em>Formula, as it has come to be known,</p>\n<p id=\"Ad6\">is to be used in situations in which, at the time of the divorce, the employee-spouse has been employed for a period of time greater than the length of the marriage and thus, a portion of the pension was earned outside of the marriage.
