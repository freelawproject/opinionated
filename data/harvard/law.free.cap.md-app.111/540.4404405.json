(Ross) appeals from a judgment of the Circuit Court for Howard County affirming the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>decision of the Board of License Commissioners of Howard County (Board). On appeal, Ross presents us with but one question: whether the circuit court erred in interpreting Rule 6.12 of the Board\u2019s rules and regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Finding no error, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">This appeal springs from the Board\u2019s suspension of Ross\u2019 license<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for selling alcoholic beverages to a minor. We believe a brief review of the relevant procedural history of this case will be helpful. On 15 April 1994, Ross was charged with selling alcoholic beverages to one Tom Leper, a cadet with the Howard County Police Department, who was under 21 years of age. Following a hearing on 16 September 1994, the Board issued its Decision and Order on 5 December, suspending Ross\u2019 license for three days in January of 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">Ross then sought judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision, and stay of enforcing the Board\u2019s decision. Stay was granted pending judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision. According to Ross, the Board violated its own rules and regulations in failing to issue a decision within thirty days of the hearing. In any event, the circuit court issued a Memorandum and Order affirming the Board\u2019s decision, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">Ross contends that the Board\u2019s decision should be reversed because it was not issued within thirty days after the hearing as prescribed by its rules and regulations. Rule 6.12 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-10\">Each case shall be decided and the final decision and order shall be issued no later than 30 days after the end of the hearing. The Board may, however, upon its own motion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>extend the time of decision or time and order for a period not exceeding 90 days from the end of the hearing date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">Since the terminology used in establishing the time for issuing the Board\u2019s decision includes the term \u201cshall\u201d, Ross contends that the provision is mandatory. Consequently, Ross asserts that, as the Board failed to comply with its rules and regulations, its decision should be reversed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">We begin by observing that we are aware of the <em>Accardi </em>doctrine set forth in <em>U.S. ex. rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, </em>347 U.S. 260, 74 S.Ct. 499, 98 L.Ed. 681 (1954). As we opined in <em>Bd. of Education of Anne Arundel County v. Barbano, </em>45 Md.App. 27, 41, 411 A.2d 124 (1980):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-6\">An agency of the government must scrupulously observe rules, regulations, or procedures which it has established. When it fails to do so, its action cannot stand and courts will strike it down.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-7\"><em>Id., </em>quoting <em>U.S. v. Heffner, </em>420 F.2d 809, 811 (4th Cir.1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">We are equally aware that in Maryland use of the word \u201cshall\u201d is ordinarily presumed to be mandatory, <em>Pope v. Secretary of Personnel, </em>46 Md.App. 716, 420 A.2d 1017 (1980), cert. denied, 289 Md. 739 (1981), although use of the word \u201cshall\u201d is, on occasion, \u201cinterpreted as directory and not mandatory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 718, 420 A.2d 1017. In endeavoring to ascertain the intent of the legislature in using the word \u201cshall\u201d, we begin by considering the absence of a sanction in the statute. <em>Maryland State Bar Ass\u2019n. v. Frank, </em>272 Md. 528, 533, 325 A.2d 718 (1974). As we said in <em>Pope, </em>\u201c... one of the contextual factors relied upon, \u2018though not controlling,\u2019 to hold the use of \u201cshall\u201d directory is when a statute provides no penalty for failure to act within a prescribed time.\u201d Pope, 46 Md.App. at 717, 420 A.2d 1017.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-9\">\u201cNotwithstanding the purposeful movement of the Court of Appeals toward holding the statutory use of \u2018shall\u2019 as mandatory\u2014despite the absence of a penalty provision\u2014two instances thus will seemingly stem the tide:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>1. When \u2018shall\u2019 is used in an unsanctioned statute directed toward an arbiter\u2019s time limitations for opining, and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-4\">2. When the broad underlying policy of the law regulating conduct of an officer of the court is for the public protection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 719, 420 A.2d 1017.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Under such circumstances, the word \u201cshall\u201d has been interpreted as merely directory, notwithstanding its traditional statutory meaning. <em>Id. </em>We shall focus on the first of these two instances.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">An attempt to understand and apply the exceptions to doctrine is often challenging. Fortunately, however, there appears to be reasonable continuity in the line of cases dealing with interpretation of the word \u201cshall\u201d directed toward an arbiter\u2019s time constraints for issuing a decision. It is well-settled in Maryland that the use of the word \u201cshall\u201d in Article IV, Section 15 of the Maryland Constitution\u2019s admonition that the Court of Appeals \u201cshall\u201d file its opinions within three months of hearing argument is merely directory. <em>McCalls Ferry Power Co. v. Price, </em>108 Md. 96, 113, 69 A. 832 (1908). A provision similarly admonishing the State\u2019s circuit courts is also directory. <em>Maryland State Bar Ass\u2019n v. Hirsch, </em>274 Md. 368, 374, 335 A.2d 108 (1975); cert. denied, 422 U.S. 1012, 95 S.Ct. 2638, 45 L.Ed.2d 676 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">We believe <em>Pope </em>to be of particular relevance here, however, as the procedure<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> being interpreted in <em>Pope </em>also governed an administrative agency. Notwithstanding the dissimilarity of the arbiters in <em>Pope, </em>the <em>Pope </em>court found <em>McCalls Ferry </em>and <em>Hirsch </em>dispositive in holding the procedure in <em>Pope </em>to be directory.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">A careful reading of these cases leads us to the conclusion that those not interpreting use of the word \u201cshall\u201d as mandatory are those governing an arbiter, whether a court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>or an administrative agency. Thus, if a statute governs the actions of an arbiter, its use of the word \u201cshall\u201d will generally be interpreted as directory, rather than mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">Here, Rule 6.12 governs the Board\u2019s actions. Its purpose is clearly to encourage the Board expeditiously to render its decisions, although a violation of this directive carries no sanction. Moreover, the absence of a sanction for such an inconsequential error leads us to conclude that Rule 6.12 was intended to be directory rather than mandatory. In other words, we decline appellant\u2019s invitation to interpret Rule 6.12\u2019s use of the word \u201cshall\u201d as mandatory and reverse the decision of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">As we see it, imposing such a sanction would be adverse to the purpose of creating the Board to protect the public from the consequences of minors indulging in alcoholic beverages. If we were to reverse the Board\u2019s decision for violating the provisions of Rule 6.12, we would ultimately be punishing the public, not the Board. It seems to us inappropriate for a miscreant to escape punishment because of the Board\u2019s relatively minor procedural error. Consequently, we hold Rule 6.12 to be directory, not mandatory, and affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.
