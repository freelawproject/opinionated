Appellant, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company (\u201cNationwide\u201d), noted an appeal from the entry of a judgment in favor of appellee, Regional Electrical Contractors Inc. (\u201cRegional\u201d) following a non-jury trial in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. On appeal, appellant has presented us with three (3) questions which, for clarity, we have rephrased and reordered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>(1) Does the insurance policy require Nationwide to cover property damages to a third party before Regional has been found to be liable for the claimed damages?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-4\">(2) May Regional file a complaint seeking damages on behalf of a third party whose property was damaged?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-5\">(3) Was there sufficient evidence to support a finding that the \u201cyour work\u201d exclusion in the policy did not apply?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">For reasons explained below, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">Regional purchased a commercial liability insurance policy from Nationwide providing that Nationwide \u201cwill pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or <em>\u2018property damage\u2019 </em>to which this insurance applies.\u201d (Emphasis added). The policy further provides that \u201c[t]his insurance applies to ... property damage only if (1) the ... property damage is caused by an occurrence (\u201can accident\u201d) that takes place in the coverage territory.\u201d The policy defines \u201ccoverage territory\u201d as \u201celectrical work \"within buildings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">The agreement did not, of course, provide protection from all risks. Excluded was property damage to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Al\">[t]hat particular part of real property on which [appellee] or any contractors or subcontractors working directly or indirectly on [Regional\u2019s] behalf are performing operations, if the \u201cproperty damage\u201d arises out of those operations; or [t]hat particular part of any property that must be restored, repaired or replaced because \u201cyour work\u201d was incorrectly performed on it. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">On 19 March 1993, a switchboard<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> exploded while Regional\u2019s employee, Ronald Marceron, was \u201cphasing\u201d or \u201cwringing out\u201d certain pairs of wires leading from the switchboard to a \u201creheat\u201d unit in another room. This was to ensure that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>proper wires were connected to the proper equipment. Only Marceron witnessed the explosion.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">Although injured, Marceron remained conscious throughout the incident. Marceron avers that he has no recollection of the explosion, or of having done anything that would have caused it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nonetheless, Regional\u2019s Vice President/Treasurer, Tony Allen Calloway, initially believed Marceron had \u201cinadvertently touched the wire that he was using to wring them out, the grounded wire, to the hot side of the circuit breaker,\u201d causing the explosion. Nationwide\u2019s initial investigation led it to the same conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">On the day after the accident, Calloway notified Nationwide\u2019s agent, Keith D. Ludka, of the accident. Ludka told him that \u201c[Nationwide] would take care of it.\u201d In fact, Ludka admitted telling Calloway, \u201cthat\u2019s why you have insurance.\u201d Although Regional repaired the damages and submitted an invoice to Nationwide for reimbursement, Nationwide denied the claim on grounds that it was subject to the \u201cyour work\u201d exclusion, despite having covered the damages to a \u201cchiller unit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Predictably, Regional filed a complaint charging Nationwide with breach of contract. At trial, the presiding judge orally converted Regional\u2019s complaint into one seeking declaratory relief. After considering the evidence and argument of counsel, she declared the loss to be covered by the policy and not subject to the \u201cyour work\u201d exclusion. In addition, the presiding judge also declared that Regional was entitled to prejudgment interest. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">Nationwide first contends that the trial judge\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous, and that it denied coverage because \u201cit had not been demonstrated [Regional had] caused the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>occurrence.\u201d Thus, Nationwide believes Regional had \u201cno legal obligation ... to pay for damages, which is a requirement under the policy.\u201d Even had Regional been legally obligated to pay the damages, \u201cthe occurrence was excluded from coverage because of the \u2018your work\u2019 exclusion.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">As we begin, we point out that \u201c[wjhere there is a tort suit against the insured, the damages<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which the insured is \u2018legally obligated to pay,\u2019 within the meaning of the coverage language, are those determined by the judgment in or settlement of the tort action.\u201d <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Atwood, </em>319 Md. 247, 261, 572 A.2d 154 (1990) (footnote added). In other words, \u201ca liability insurer is bound by the finding in a tort action against its insured that the insured was liable due to negligence,\u201d <em>Atwood, </em>319 Md. at 260, 572 A.2d 154 (citations omitted). Accordingly, Nationwide \u201cwould normally be bound by a judgment in a tort case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 261, 572 A.2d 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">In any event, Regional purportedly repaired the damaged switchboard at Ludka\u2019s suggestion, a point discussed more fully <em>infra. </em>The owner of the damaged property neither sued, nor settled with, Regional. Indeed, when the trial judge said, \u201cWell, maybe we ought to just stop this case and wait for the property owner to sue the contractor (Regional) and see if they can prove negligence,\u201d counsel for Nationwide responded, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>\u201cwell, work has already been done and the damage has already been paid for.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">As we see it, that colloquy reveals that Nationwide believed Regional\u2019s repairs had satisfied potential third-party claims. Hence, it was unknown whether Regional was \u201clegally obligated to pay\u201d for the damages, a condition precedent to Nationwide\u2019s liability under the policy. That is, Nationwide\u2019s coverage was not available until it had been determined that Regional was legally obligated to pay. Nonetheless, our inquiry does not end here.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">We first note that \u201c[a]n insurer, prior to trial of a tort suit against its insured [by a third party], ordinarily [can] not obtain a declaratory judgment concerning policy coverage, where the coverage issue was essentially the same as an issue to be decided in the pending tort case.\u201d <em>Atwood, supra, </em>at 249, 572 A.2d 154 (citing <em>Brohawn v. Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>276 Md. 396, 347 A.2d 842 (1975)). As we have said, however, the likelihood of a third party tort action was eliminated by Regional having repaired the damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Relying on <em>Benning v. Allstate, </em>90 Md.App. 592, 602 A.2d 233 (1992), however, Regional contends that we have \u201crecognized the right of an insured under a liability policy to sue her own insurance company after the insurance company wrongfully denied coverage, even before the insured\u2019s liability to the injured party had been determined.\u201d Regional has misread <em>Benning.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">In <em>Benning, </em>we permitted the appellant to proceed with an action for declaratory judgment on a discrete policy issue separate from the underlying tort cases.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We also pointed out in <em>Benning, </em>however, that, under <em>Brohawn </em>and its progeny, \u201cdisputes [relating to policy coverage] that are also at issue and will necessarily be decided in any underlying litigation between the claimant and the insured [as opposed to] those that are entirely independent of that litigation[,] are inappro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>priate for resolution in advance through declaratory judgment proceedings.\u201d <em>Benning, </em>90 Md.App. at 600, 602 A.2d 233.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">We are here presented with a situation somewhat different from those in the cases we have just mentioned. Except for <em>Benning, </em>those cases involved pre-tort-trial declaratory judgment actions by the <em>insurer. </em>Here before us is a pre-tort-trial declaratory judgment action by an insured against its insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Nevertheless, we find the above cited cases to be helpful. As the Court of Appeals said in <em>Allstate, </em>\u201c[i]f the pre-tort-trial declaratory judgment proceeding were allowed, the insured would suffer great prejudice: not only would she have to defend against the plaintiff but also against the insurer.\u201d Hence, the Court went on to say that \u201c[t]he essential unfairness to ... [the plaintiffs] of allowing Transamerica to prosecute their case, and the harsh burden of forcing Ms. Brohawn to defend against a third-plaintiff far outweigh any possible advantages advanced by Transamerica in support of granting declaratory relief.\u201d <em>Allstate, </em>319 Md. at 257, 572 A.2d 154 (quoting <em>Brohawn, </em>276 Md. at 406-07, 347 A.2d 842). The Court then said, \u201c[i]nsuranee company intervention in tort trials would be tantamount to authorizing direct actions by plaintiffs against defendant liability insurers. Maryland law generally precludes such actions.\u201d 319 Md. at 257, 572 A.2d 154. (citing <em>Reese v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins., </em>285 Md. 548, 552, 403 A.2d 1229 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">As we see it, an insured\u2019s paying pre-tort-trial damages and then seeking a declaratory judgment as to the insurer\u2019s obligation under the policy would cause the insurer to \u201csuffer great prejudice.\u201d In other words, the insured would be obligated to prove that it was \u201clegally obligated to pay,\u201d in order to recover from its insurer. Not only would this burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>eliminate the obligation of an insurer to defend its insured, it would eviscerate the insurer\u2019s right to defend claims brought against its insured. Moreover, we also believe that in a situation such as this, there is manifest opportunity for fraud and collusion between the insured and a third party\u2014something for which no insurance company bargains.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Allstate, </em>319 Md. at 263, 572 A.2d 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Further, as the insured essentially stands in the shoes of the injured party in a declaratory judgment proceeding, we have no difficulty in concluding that it constitutes a direct action by the tort plaintiff against the insurer. Maryland law precludes such actions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Consequently, unless the insurer breaches its duty to defend the insured, leaving the latter to defend the claim on its own, until an insured\u2019s obligation to pay has been determined in an underlying tort trial, a pre-tort-trial declaratory judgment proceeding litigating an issue that would otherwise be decided in an underlying tort action is not permitted. As Regional\u2019s obligation to pay damages to a third party had not been determined in a tort trial, the declaratory judgment action should not have gone forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">' Although in Maryland it is beyond cavil that pre-torttrial declaratory judgment proceedings are not ordinarily per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>mitted on issues to be decided in the underlying tort trial, we believe Regional\u2019s prompt repairs<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> were induced by Ludka\u2019s telling Calloway to correct the damage and that Nationwide \u201cwould take care of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">In most jurisdictions, the doctrines of waiver and estoppel do not \u201cbring within the coverage of an insurance policy risks not covered by its terms, or expressly excluded therefrom.\u201d W.C. Crais III, Comment Note: Docteine of Estoppel or Waiver as Available to Bring Within Coverage or Insurance Policy Risks Not Covered by its Terms or Expressly Excluded Therefrom, 1 A.L.R.3d 1139, 1147 (1965, 1995 supp.). With respect -to the doctrine of waiver, Maryland follows the majority rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">Although the doctrine of waiver may deprive an insurer of a right to which it would otherwise be entitled, <em>GEICO v. Group Hosp. Medical Serv. Inc., 322 </em>Md. 645, 650, 589 A.2d 464 (1991), according to the Court of Appeals there is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AO\">a distinction between defenses founded upon lack of basic coverage and those arising from the failure of the claimant to satisfy some \u2018technical\u2019 condition subsequent. The former, it is apparent, may not be waived merely by the company\u2019s failure to specify them in its initial response to the claim, for the effect of that would be to expand the policy to create a risk not intended to be undertaken by the company.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">GEICO<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>, 322 Md. at 651, 589 A.2d 464 (quoting <em>Insurance Co. of N. Amer. v. Coffman, </em>52 Md.App. 732, 742-43, 451 A.2d 952 (1982)); <em>See also Snyder v. Travelers Insurance Company, </em>251 F.Supp. 76, 77-78 (D.Md.1966)(waiver or estoppel are appropriate legal theories only to negate conditions subsequent that defeat coverage, when coverage otherwise exists.).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>In <em>GEICO, </em>the insurer settled a claim against its insured, although \u201cthe facts of the accident suggest that the [claimant\u2019s] right to recover damages might be barred by his contributory negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 653, 589 A.2d 464. The claimant\u2019s agreement with GHI provided that, \u201cin the event he was injured as a result of the negligence of another person, GHI would be subrogated to [his] rights against that person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 648, 589 A.2d 464. GHI had paid substantial medical bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">In endeavoring to recover those sums from GEICO, GHI argued that GEICO had \u201cwaived any right it may have had to plead contributory negligence or otherwise contest its liability for damages caused by the accident.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 649, 589 A.2d 464. The Court of Appeals pointed out that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APR\">[although the automobile insurance policy issued by GEI-CO is not before us, we assume that under its liability coverage, GEICO undertook to pay all sums (within policy limits) which its insured might become legally liable to pay because of bodily injury or property damage caused by accident resulting from the ownership, maintenance, or use of the insured vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-5\">A strong argument may be made that even if the circumstances of this case are sufficient to permit a finding of implied waiver, the waiver cannot be utilized in the manner claimed by GHI because to do so would amount to extending the coverage of the policy. In this action against GEICO, GHI contends that GEICO is obligated to pay GHI\u2019s claim in full, without any proof of liability of GEICO\u2019s insured. GEICO argues that if GHI is correct in its argument concerning waiver, the coverage of GEICO\u2019s policy would be expanded from \u201cpayment of damages the insured may become legally obligated to pay\u201d to \u201cpayment of all damages arising from an accident involving the insured, whether or not the insured is legally liable for those damages,\u201d thus effectively creating a new insurance contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 652, 589 A.2d 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">And the Court continued,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>We need not and do not resolve this question. Even if we were to assume, arguendo, that the use of a waiver to preclude the assumption of a defense to liability does not amount to an expansion of coverage, that would not be of any benefit to GHI, for we conclude that under Maryland law there was no implied waiver under the facts in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 652, 589 A.2d 464.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Likewise, the Nationwide/Regional policy obligated Nationwide to cover only those damages Regional was \u201clegally obligated to pay,\u201d subject to the policy\u2019s exclusions. In other words, Nationwide was not obligated to indemnify Regional simply upon the occurrence of an accident. Were that so, Nationwide would be obligated to indemnify Regional before Regional was found to be \u201clegally obligated to pay,\u201d expanding the policy\u2019s coverage to an extent contemplated neither by Nationwide nor by Regional. Consequently, the doctrine of waiver is of no avail to Regional.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">On the other hand, although in the majority of jurisdictions estoppel may not be used to extend a policy\u2019s coverage, see 1 A.L.R.3d 1139, <em>supra, </em>we believe that the Court of Appeals would apply estoppel given appropriate circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">The trial judge noted in her opinion that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-8\">[t|here was also evidence presented at trial that [Nationwide] approved [Regional\u2019s] plans to go ahead and repair the damage as quickly as possible so as to avoid any additional liability that could result from absence of electrical power in the building which bolsters [Regional\u2019s] claim that the explosion was a covered occurrence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">We believe that the trial judge was referring to the following colloquy between Ludka and counsel for Regional:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-10\">Q: And it\u2019s your testimony under oath here today that at no time did you ever say to Mr. Calloway or to Mr. Brian Smith or anyone else at Regional Electric that Nationwide will pay this claim? Whether or not you were authorized to, your testimony is that you never made any such statements [sic].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>A: I wouldn\u2019t use those words. I had said, Tony [Calloway] that\u2019s why you have insurance. We\u2019ll take care of it. And referring to his man was [sic] injured, we paid for a lot of worker comp damages. And keep in mind, when he talked to me, I had no idea of the severity of the situation. He just said he had a man get injured and there was damage to the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-4\">Q: And do you recall having said to him words such as \u201cwe\u2019ll take care of it?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-5\">A: We\u2019ll take care of what we need to take care of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\">Q: And how many occasions did you say those words or similar words?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-7\">A: Possibly twice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">\u201c \u2018Estoppel\u2019 ... refers to an abatement raised by law of rights and privileges of the insurer when it would be inequitable to permit their assertion. It necessarily implies prejudicial reliance of the insured upon some act, conduct, or nonaction of the insurer.\u201d <em>Beard v. American Agency, </em>314 Md. 235, 258, 550 A.2d 677 (1988) (citations omitted).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The trial judge apparently concluded that Ludka had induced Regional to proceed with the repairs by responding to Regional\u2019s inquiry, \u201cThat\u2019s why you have insurance. We\u2019ll take care of it.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Whether Ludka\u2019s response was authorized by Nationwide is irrelevant. \u201cIn order to bind the principal, ... the agent\u2019s statement ...\u201d must be \u201cmade contemporaneously with the transaction to which it relates.\u201d <em>See Burkowske v. Church </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number><em>Hospital, </em>50 Md.App. 515, 520, 439 A.2d 40 (1982) (and cases cited therein). It is not only clear from the record that Regional promptly repaired the damaged switchboard following Ludka\u2019s response, but that Ludka was Nationwide\u2019s agent and his response was \u201cmade contemporaneously with the transaction to which it relat[ed].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">The Court of Appeals has previously said, <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Urner, </em>264 Md. 660, 668, 287 A.2d 764 (1972). \u201cInsurance coverage cannot be established by waiver. * * * We perceive no conduct on the part of Aetna here which would estop it from denying coverage. The attempt by it to settle with the claimants is not a basis for estoppel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">In applying Maryland law, the Federal District Court for the District of Maryland opined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEv\">waiver or estoppel are appropriate legal theories only to negate conditions subsequent which defeat coverage, where coverage otherwise exists. This ... is unquestionably correct in regard to the doctrine of waiver. (Citations omitted). It may not be correct as to the doctrine of estoppel. This Court does not read <em>Prudential Ins. Co. v. Brookman, </em>167 Md. 616, 175 A. 838 (1934), and <em>Bower &amp; Kaufman v. Bothwell, </em>152 Md. 392, 136 A. 892 (1927), as foreclosing the possibility that estoppel may have the effect of extending coverage in a proper ease.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b119-6\"><em>Snyder, supra, </em>251 F.Supp. at 80 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">We are persuaded that such is a case before us. Under these circumstances, permitting Nationwide to avoid coverage \u201cwould be contrary to equity and good conscience.... \u201d <em>Hamlin Mach. Co. v. Holtite Mfg. Co., </em>197 Md. 148, 158, 78 A.2d 450 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">Although neither of Maryland\u2019s appellate courts has squarely addressed the issue of whether the doctrine of estoppel may be used to extend insurance coverage where none otherwise exists, we believe that the doctrine must be applied on a case-by-case basis. <em>Johns Hopkins Hospital v. Lehninger, </em>48 Md.App. 549, 563, 429 A.2d 538 (1981). Although the trial court founded its decision upon the terms of the policy, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>point out that \u201c[a]n appellate court may, on a direct appeal, affirm a trial court\u2019s decision on any ground adequately shown by the record, even though not relied on by the trial court or the parties.\u201d <em>Offutt v. Montgomery County Bd. of Ed., </em>285 Md. 557, 563 n. 3, 404 A.2d 281 (1979)(citing <em>Robeson v. State, </em>285 Md. 498, 403 A.2d 1221 (1979)). In sum, as Ludka, Nationwide\u2019s agent, induced Regional to repair the damaged switchboard, we believe Nationwide is now estopped from denying coverage, despite the fact that Nationwide\u2019s obligation under the policy did not mature. We shall therefore affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b109-11\">.
