(CSXT), operates Maryland Rail Commuter (MARC) service for the Mass Transit Administration (MTA) under a State procurement contract. The contract requires the MTA (appellee) to indemnify CSXT for any and all claims arising out of \u201cContract Service,\u201d which includes, <em>inter alia, </em>train operation. This case arises out of a claim, submitted to the MTA on October 25, 1993 by CSXT, for indemnification of property damage losses resulting from a December 1992 collision between a MARC train and a backhoe owned by a third party. The claim was denied by the MTA on May 27, 1994. CSXT appealed the MTA\u2019s denial to the Maryland State Board of Contract Appeals (the \u201cBoard\u201d). On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>January 3, 1995, after hearing argument on cross motions for summary disposition, the Board affirmed the MTA\u2019s denial of the claim. CSXT filed a Petition for Judicial Review with the Circuit Court for Howard County, and on September 11, 1995, the court affirmed the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">CSXT filed a timely appeal presenting the following issues, which we have rephrased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-6\">1. Whether the indemnification claim arose out of contract service because the collision involved a MARC train operating pursuant to the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-7\">2. Whether MTA\u2019s promise to indemnify CSXT is rendered unenforceable by section 5-305 of the Maryland Courts and Judicial Proceedings article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">In 1979, the Baltimore <em>&amp; </em>Ohio Railroad Company, predecessor in interest to CSXT, and the State Railroad Administration, predecessor in interest to the MTA, entered into certain leasing and operating agreements which were later superseded by a Commuter Rail Passenger Service Agreement (the \u201ccontract\u201d). Pursuant to the contract, CSXT operates weekday commuter passenger rail service known as MARC between Baltimore and Washington, D.C., and between Washington and Martinsburg, West Virginia, on tracks owned by CSXT and using station facilities owned by CSXT, CSXT and MTA rolling stock, CSXT maintenance facilities, and CSXT employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">CSXT\u2019s primary obligations under the contract are summarized in Article I, section 1(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-11\">SECTION 1. <em>SERVICE OBLIGATION</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APj\">(a) CSXT will provide regularly scheduled daily commuter rail sendee on weekdays (Monday through Friday) on its Capitol Subdivision line between Baltimore, Maryland and Washington, DC, its Metropolitan and Cumberland Subdivision lines between Martinsburg, West Virginia, and Washington, DC, in accordance with Section 2 of this Agreement. <em>This train operation, plus the maintenance of equipment, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number><em>access of and use of facilities, ticket sales, and other activities required to support the operation of the train service as provided in this Article I, shall be called the \u201cContract Service. </em>\u201d CSXT will make available its rail facilities on the above stated lines to provide the Contract Service. CSXT will operate the Contract Service in a safe and efficient manner with use of appropriate facilities and staff for management, train operations, and maintenance....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_h\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Under section 9(b) of the contract, the MTA agreed to indemnify CSXT from loss arising out of the Contract Service:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHM\">SECTION 9. <em>RISK OF LIABILITY, INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Av3\">(b) <em>Indemnification by Administration</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYN\">(1) The Administration agrees to indemnify, save harmless, and defend CSXT <em>from any and all casualty losses, claims, suits, damages or liability of every kind arising out of the Contract Service </em>under this agreement....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">CSXT contracted with Melvin Benhoff Sons, Inc. (Benhoff) to remove and replace four public road crossings over CSXT\u2019s track. One of the crossings was at Hanover Street in Baltimore City. Benhoffs work was part of general track rehabilitation to benefit all traffic, both passenger and freight. The MTA was not notified of the work to be performed by Benhoff or asked to contribute to the cost of the work.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">Benhoff commenced work with a backhoe at the Hanover Street crossing on December 18, 1992. Although a CSXT supervising foreman was present, the central train dispatcher was not informed\u2014as required by CSXT\u2019s operating rules\u2014of Benhoffs work plans on the track. Due to this oversight, no train engineer or dispatcher was notified of the obstruction on the track caused by Benhoffs work.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">On December 18, 1992, a MARC train en route to Baltimore rounded a bend and collided with one of Benhoffs backhoes, which blocked the tracks. It is undisputed that the collision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>was not caused by negligence on the part of personnel on the MARC train. Benhoff made a claim for $40,420.25 against CSXT for the damage to the backhoe. Without conceding liability, CSXT settled the claim for $23,350. Relying on the indemnity agreement in the contract, CSXT made an indemnification claim against the MTA for $23,350 plus attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">After the MTA denied CSXT\u2019s claim, CSXT appealed to the Board. The Board held that CSXT was not entitled to indemnity because the claim did not arise \u201cout of \u2018Contract Service.\u2019 \u201d The Board opined that \u201cthe mere fact that a MARC train was innocently and fortuitously involved in the incident does not bring the incident within the ambit of the definition of \u2018contract service\u2019 under the Contract.\u201d Moreover, the Board ruled that Benhoffs work\u2014repairing the grade crossing\u2014did not constitute Contract Service within the meaning of the contract. The circuit court, affirming the Board, held that 1) the work being performed by Benhoff was not within the scope of the contract service and 2) the \u201cfortuitous\u201d involvement of the MARC train in the accident did not require indemnification by the MTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AyR\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">The Board is an \u201cagency\u201d within the ambit of the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act, which is codified in the Maryland Code, State Government article, \u00a7 10-101 <em>et seq. </em>(1995). <em>Department of General Services v. Harmans Associates Ltd. Partnership, </em>98 Md.App. 535, 542, 633 A.2d 939 (1993). Where an agency\u2019s decision is predicated solely upon an error of law, no deference is appropriate and the reviewing court may substitute its judgment for that of the administrative agency. <em>Washington Nat\u2019l Arena Ltd. Partnership v. Comptroller of Treasury, </em>308 Md. 370, 378-79, 519 A.2d 1277 (1987); <em>Kohli v. LOOC, Inc., </em>103 Md.App. 694, 710-11, 654 A.2d 922 (1995); <em>Gray v. Anne Arundel County, </em>73 Md.App. 301, 307-09, 533 A.2d 1325 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the facts are undisputed. The Board\u2019s decision was a purely legal determination of the meaning of the contractual term \u201carising out of.\u201d Thus, we must determine only whether the Board applied the correct principles of law to the undisputed facts. In making that determination, we accord no deference to the Board\u2019s findings. <em>Kohli, supra, </em>103 Md.App. at 711, 654 A.2d 922.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">CSXT asserts that the December 18, 1992, collision arose out of \u201cContract Service\u201d because the collision involved a MARC train and \u201cContract Service\u201d specifically includes \u201ctrain operations.\u201d CSXT argues that, contrary to the Board\u2019s determination and the MTA\u2019s assertions, questions of legal liability or fault play no role in the determination of whether the claim \u201carises out of\u2019 contract service.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">The MTA argues that the term \u201carising out of\u2019 requires a causal connection \u201cbetween the damage or injury and the activity covered by the provision.\u201d The MTA asserts that although it was \u201cthe impact between the MARC train and the backhoe that eventually led to the payment CSXT made to Benhoff \u2019 the required causal connection is nevertheless lacking. The MTA argues that no causal connection exists because the MARC train did not causally contribute \u201cto the dangerous situation that caused the collision,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>it was not negligent. According to the MTA, \u201c[a]ll that one can say ... is that the MARC train was \u2018there.\u2019 But being there is not sufficient\u201d to require indemnification of CSXT.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">Whether someone or something else other than the MARC train may be legally liable for the damage is immaterial. The issue of negligence is separate from that of causation and it has no role in determining whether the collision \u201carose out of\u2019 Contract Service.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">In construing the phrase \u201carising out of the Contract Service,\u201d we apply the definition set forth in <em>Northern Assurance Co. v. EDP Floors, </em>311 Md. 217, 230, 533 A.2d 682 (1987). In that case, the Court determined that the \u201cwords \u2018arising out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>of must be afforded their common understanding, namely to mean originating from, growing out of, flowing from, or the like.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 230, 533 A.2d 682; <em>see also </em>12 Couch on Insurance 2d \u00a7 45:61 (rev. ed. 1981) (\u201carising out of\u2019 generally means originating from, growing out of, or flowing from); 6B Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice \u00a7 4317, at 360-63 (Buckeley ed. 1979) (in automobile insurance context, words arising out of have \u201cbroader significance than words \u2018caused by\u2019 and are ordinarily understood to mean originating from, incident to, or in connection with the use of the vehicle\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition, in Maryland, it is well established that the words \u201carising out of\u2019 require a showing of a causal relationship, although \u201crecovery is not limited to the strict rules developed in relation to direct and proximate cause.\u201d <em>National Indemnity Co. v. Ewing, </em>235 Md. 145, 149-50, 200 A.2d 680 (1964); <em>see Frazier v. Unsatisfied Claim &amp; Judgment Fund Bd., </em>262 Md. 115, 277 A.2d 57 (1971); <em>McNeill v. Maryland Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019n, </em>48 Md.App. 411, 427 A.2d 1056 (1981); <em>see also </em>1 Rowland H. Long, The Law of Liability Insurance, \u00a7 1.22, at 1-57 (1972) (\u201cThe phrase \u2018arising out of is not to be construed to mean \u2018proximately caused by.\u2019... The words \u2018arising out of mean causally connected with, not \u2018proximately caused by\u2019 use.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">A Minnesota Supreme Court case, <em>Faber v. Roelofs, </em>311 Minn. 428, 250 N.W.2d 817 (1977), cogently discusses the meaning of the term \u201carising out of.\u201d In <em>Faber, </em>an elementa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>ry school student was injured when he ran into the street alongside his school bus and fell under its wheels. A jury found that neither the owner nor the driver of the bus was negligent; but it did find negligence on the part of the school district that hired the bus company. <em>Id. </em>at 819. The bus was insured by Mutual Service Casualty Insurance Company (Mutual) and the school district was an additional insured under the policy. <em>Id. </em>at 819, 822. The policy required Mutual to indemnify the school district if the district became legally obligated to pay damages because of bodily injury \u201carising out of the ... use\u201d of the school bus. <em>Id. </em>at 822.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Mutual argued, however, that the boy\u2019s injuries did not \u201carise out of the use\u201d of the bus because the jury found no negligence by either the driver or owner of the bus. <em>Id. </em>The <em>Faber </em>Court disagreed and held that a sufficient causal relation was present by the mere fact that the boy was run over by the insured vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 823. It reasoned that accepting Mutual\u2019s contention \u201cwould result in rewriting the last phrase of the coverage clause to read \u2018arising out of the <em>negligent ... </em>use of the automobile.\u2019 That is not how the policy reads.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 822.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">We agree with the reasoning in <em>Faber </em>and find it particularly applicable to this case. Accepting the MTA\u2019s argument would result in rewriting the indemnification clause to read that the MTA agrees to indemnify CSXT from \u201cany and all casualty losses, claims ... or liability of every kind arising out of the <em>negligent performance </em>of the Contract Service under this agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The reasoning of the Court in <em>Northern Assurance Co. v. EDP Floors, supra, </em>is also instructive. In <em>EDP Floors, </em>an accident occurred when an intoxicated employee, in the course of unloading EDP\u2019s truck, caused floor tiles to fall on the plaintiff. The plaintiff sued EDP on theories of vicarious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>liability\u2014for the employee\u2019s negligence\u2014and direct liability for negligent hiring and supervision. <em>EDP Floors, supra, </em>311 Md. at 220, 533 A.2d 682. EDP\u2019s insurer refused EDP\u2019s request for a defense based on an exclusion in the policy for injuries \u201carising out of\u201d the unloading of a vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 221, 225, 533 A.2d 682. On appeal, EDP argued that the exclusion did not apply to the direct negligence claim because the alleged negligent hiring was an <em>independent cause </em>of the injury, separate from the employee\u2019s negligence in unloading the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 225, 229-30, 533 A.2d 682. The Court held that, since the negligent unloading of a track by an EDP employee was at least <em>\u201can \u2018arising out of cause </em>\u201d of plaintiffs injury, the exclusion applied regardless of whether the injury may also have arisen from other causes further back in the sequence of events. <em>Id. </em>at 230-32, 533 A.2d 682 (emphasis added). The Court applied the following rationale:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-4\">While these words [\u201carising out of\u2019] plainly import a causal relation of some kind, read in context, they do not require that the unloading of the truck be the sole \u2018arising out of cause of the injury; they require only that the injury arise out of the unloading of the vehicle.... This is so regardless of whether the injury may also be said to have arisen out of other causes further back in the sequence of events, such as the employee\u2019s consumption of alcohol, or the employer\u2019s negligent failure to supervise the employee.... As we see it, the language in the exclusionary clause clearly focuses the \u201carising out of\u201d inquiry on the instrumentality of the injury, i.e., upon the track and its unloading.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 230-31, 533 A.2d 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Applying this rationale to the case <em>sub judice </em>leads to the conclusion that whether the injury may also have arisen out of other causes further back in the sequence of events, such as the alleged negligence of CSXT or Benhoff, is irrele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>vant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For the indemnification provision to apply, it is enough that the MARC train, which was included in the definition of Contract Service, was \u201ca cause\u201d of the injury. The MARC train was \u201ca cause\u201d of the injury since it is undisputed that the damage was caused when the MARC train impacted with Benhoff s backhoe.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">From the broad and comprehensive language used in the provision, we conclude the parties intended to cover all claims \u201carising out of the Contract Service\u201d\u2014not just claims arising out of negligence. Any contrary interpretation, based on theories of negligence or proximate causation, would defeat the intent of the parties. <em>See Aragona v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins., </em>281 Md. 371, 379, 378 A.2d 1346 (1977) (\u201cprinciples of causation will not be applied to defeat the intent of the parties\u201d as manifested in \u201call-encompassing\u201d exclusionary clause of insurance contract); <em>Princemont Constr. Corp. v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio R. Co., </em>131 A.2d 877, 879 (D.C.1957) (when the terms of an indemnity agreement are broad and comprehensive, there is a presumption that \u201cif the parties had intended some limitation of the all-embracing language, they would have expressed such limitation.... If the parties wished to limit the scope of the language they could have easily done so; we are not at liberty to do it for them\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">In its brief, the MTA argues, alternatively, that, even if the damages did arise out of Contract Service, the MTA\u2019s promise to indemnify CSXT is rendered unenforceable by section 5-305, which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-8\">A covenant, promise, agreement or understanding in, or in connection with or collateral to, a contract or agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number><em>relating to the construction, alteration, repair, or maintenance </em>of a building, structure, appurtenance or appliance, including moving, demolition and excavating connected with it, <em>purporting to indemnify the promisee against liability for damages arising out of bodily injury to any person or damage to property caused by or resulting from the sole negligence of the promisee or indemnitee, </em>his agents or employees, <em>is against public policy and is void and unenforceable. </em>This section does not affect the validity of any insurance contract, workmen\u2019s compensation, or any other agreement issued by an insurer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Md.Code Ann., Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-305 (1995) (emphasis added). The MTA maintains that section 5-305 bars recovery because 1) the promise to indemnify is \u201cin connection with or collateral to\u201d the Benhoff agreement, which is a construction or maintenance agreement within the meaning of the statute; and 2) CSXT is seeking indemnity for its own negligence, the sole negligence of Benhoff, or the concurring negligence of Benhoff and CSXT\u2014any of which are precluded under section 5-305.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">CSXT points out that the MTA \u201cquickly glosses over\u201d the fatal flaw of their argument, which is the fact that the indemnification agreement in this case is neither \u201cin, or in connection with, or collateral to, a contract or agreement relating to\u201d construction. We agree. Although the collision may have arisen out of the construction contract between CSXT and Benhoff, CSXT\u2019s right to indemnification does not arise out of a construction contract. Rather, CSXT\u2019s right to indemnification arises out of the indemnification provision contained in the contract between CSXT and the MTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">In an attempt to circumvent this critical issue, the MTA quotes <em>Helm v. Western Md. Ry. Co., </em>838 F.2d 729, 733 (4th Cir.1988), in which the Court observed: \u201cThe language in the Maryland statute is very broad, and we find no indication that the General Assembly tried or intended to limit \u00a7 5-305\u2019s reach to contractors and subcontractors specializing in construction.\u201d Neither this statement nor the holding in <em>Helm </em>provides support for the MTA\u2019s argument. In <em>Helm, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>Western Maryland Railway Company (Railroad) entered into a licensing agreement with Carroll County, in which the County (the licensee) obtained the right to enter a right of way owned by the Railroad in order to install a box culvert in the area. <em>Id. </em>at 730. The licensing agreement contained an indemnity clause under which the County agreed to reimburse the Railroad against all loss \u201cgrowing out of the operation\u201d of the agreement. In addition, the County\u2019s contract with a third party to build the box culvert included a proviso that the railroad, as required, would remove tracks, ties, and signal poles in the area. <em>Id. </em>at 730. When a railroad employee was severely injured by a utility pole, which broke and fell while he was working on it, the Railroad sought indemnification from the County. <em>Id. </em>at 730-31. The <em>Helm </em>Court held that the indemnification provision was void under section 5-305. But, in doing so, the Court relied entirely on the fact that the railroad was actively engaged in construction work pursuant to the contract when the injury occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 732-33.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">In an earlier case, <em>Brown v. Baltimore and Ohio R.R. Co., </em>805 F.2d 1133, 1142-43 (4th Cir.1986), the Fourth Circuit rejected a broad reading of section 5-305 and held that the section was inapplicable. In that case, a railroad employee was injured while a passenger on a train that collided with a piece of equipment belonging to a contractor hired by the county. The agreement under which the railroad allowed the county to work on the tracks provided that the county would indemnify the railroad for any liability \u201carising out of\u2019 the work being done. <em>Id. </em>at 1135-36. In <em>Brown, </em>the Court recognized the distinction between a situation where the indemnification provision is entered into by the parties to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>construction contract and a situation where, as here, the indemnification provision has no connection to any construction contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-4\">[W]hile an expansive interpretation of the statute\u2019s phrase, \u201cin, or in connection with or collateral to, a contract ... relating to ... construction\u201d could be read to reach the railroad indemnity agreement here, we are satisfied that this could not have been the legislative intent---- ... [W]e think the legislation could not have been intended to prevent mere licensors or easement grantors such as the railroad here\u2014as distinguished most readily from the parties to the construction contract\u2014from exacting indemnity from their licensees or easement grantees....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1142.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">The <em>Helm </em>Court concisely explains the distinction between its holding and the holding in <em>Brown </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-9\">To reconcile Brown and the present case it is merely necessary to appreciate that, while both cases involved contracts granting permission to engage in construction on a railroad\u2019s right of way, in <em>Brown </em>the railroad was not engaged in any construction work pursuant to the contract while in the present case the Railroad was engaged in construction work pursuant to (although not required by) the contract when the injury occurred. Thus, only in the present case is it necessary to apply Maryland\u2019s expressed public policy against requiring indemnification for one\u2019s own negligence in performing construction-related work contracted for by the indemnitor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-10\"><em>Helm, supra, </em>838 F.2d at 732.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">We hold that section 5-305 of the Maryland Courts and Judicial Proceedings article is not applicable to the indemnification provision in the contract between the MTA and CSXT.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-12\">JUDGMENT REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR HOWARD COUNTY WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO ENTER AN ORDER REVERSING THE ORDER OF THE MARYLAND BOARD OF CONTRACT APPEALS AND DIRECTING THE BOARD TO <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>ORDER APPELLEE TO PAY $23,350 PLUS COSTS AND ANY ATTORNEYS FEES TO WHICH APPELLANT MAY BE ENTITLED; COST OF THIS APPEAL TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b667-6\">. We note that the Board failed to use this definition of the term \"arising out of' when it concluded that \"[i]t stretches the meaning of the words of \u00a7 1(a) of the contract beyond all reasonable bounds to find that those words were meant to include as an activity encompassed under Contract Service <em>any </em>occurrence involving a MARC train.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b667-7\">. While the aforementioned cases and .treatises interpret the words \u201carising out of\u201d in the context of automobile insurance policies, we see no reason to construe these words differently in this context. <em>See Servants of Paraclete, Inc. v. Great American Insurance Company, </em>857 F.Supp. 822, 837 (D.N.M.1994) (extending interpretation of \"arising out of\u201d in automobile insurance context to policy providing Owner\u2019s, Landlord's and Tenant's (OL &amp; T) coverage and stating that \u201cthe Court finds no reason to define the same words more restrictively in an OL &amp; T policy\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b668-7\">. The indemnification clause reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">To pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury, sickness or disease, including death at any time resulting therefrom, sustained by any person, caused by accident and arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the automobile.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b670-9\">. CSXT also presents the following issue for our determination: Whether the indemnification claim applied because the rehabilitative work and the flagging activity [negligently performed by CSXT| at the site of the collision were in support of contract service and therefore covered by the indemnification clause. In view of our holding, which grants CSXT indemnification, determination of this issue is unnecessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b672-6\">. The Court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">[H]ere, the Railroad was not a passive licensor. Here, the Railroad expressly contracted to do construction work, for which it was directly reimbursed by the County. The parties have not so argued, but it might be most appropriate to view this arrangement as a license to work on the Railroad\u2019s right of way <em>plus </em>a contract (with cost-based reimbursement) for specialized construction services provided by the Railroad and associated with the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 733.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
