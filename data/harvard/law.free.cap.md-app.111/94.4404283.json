(\u201cSherwood\u201d), filed a breach of contract and declaratory judgment action against Hartford Accident and Indemnity Co. and Hartford Fire Insurance Co. (hereinafter referred to collectively as \u201cHartford\u201d) in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County on June 25, 1993. The complaint alleged that Hartford had wrongfully refused to provide a defense for Sherwood when it was sued by Osem Food Industries, Ltd. (\u201cOsem\u201d), in the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, and had refused to indemnify Sherwood under a comprehensive general liability insurance policy (\u201cCGL\u201d policy) issued to Sherwood by Hartford.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-12\">Sherwood\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment was granted by Judge James L. Ryan, who held that Hartford, as a matter of law, had a duty to defend Sherwood under the terms of the CGL policy. At a subsequent hearing on December 15, 1994, Judge William P. Turner held that Hartford had a duty to indemnify Sherwood and to pay legal costs incurred by Sherwood in defense of the Osem litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>The issue of damages was tried before a jury beginning July 26, 1995. The jury found that all attorneys\u2019 fees and defense costs paid by Sherwood, as well as the $100,000 settlement agreed to by Sherwood, were fair and reasonable. Final judgment in favor of Sherwood was entered on August 3, 1995, for the sum of $497,366.22. This timely appeal followed, in which Hartford raises five issues, which have been rephrased for clarity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-4\">I. Was the trial judge legally correct in finding that Hartford had a duty to defend Sherwood under the CGL policy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">II. Was the trial judge legally correct in finding that Sherwood had not made a material misrepresentation of fact at the time the policy was issued?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-6\">III. Was the trial judge legally correct in finding that Sherwood\u2019s two-and-one-half year delay in notifying Hartford of the Osem litigation did not actually prejudice Hartford?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-7\">IV. Was the trial judge legally correct in finding that Hartford was hable for the payment of legal fees and other defense costs incurred by Sherwood prior to notifying Hartford of the Osem litigation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-8\">V. Was the trial judge legally correct in finding that Hartford was liable for the payment of legal fees and other defense costs incurred before the effective date ' of the CGL policy issued to Sherwood?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">Sherwood filed a cross-appeal, which raises an additional issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-10\">VI. Did the trial judge err in failing to award it prejudgment interest?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b126-12\">Sherwood is a North Carolina corporation that markets and distributes food products worldwide. On January 6, 1989, Osem filed suit against Sherwood, alleging that Sherwood was distributing and marketing a soup package virtually identical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>in color, design, and graphics to a soup package used by Osem. Osem claimed that Sherwood\u2019s intent was to confuse the public and profit from the substantial goodwill associated with Osem\u2019s packaging by distributing and marketing the soup package in violation of federal and North Carolina law. Sherwood denied Osem\u2019s claims. Appellee, however, did consent to an order, entered on January 31,1989, in which it agreed to discontinue using the soup package.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">On February 27, 1989, Osem filed a \u201cSupplement to Complaint,\u201d alleging that Sherwood had altered the soup package that had been the subject of the consent order and that the \u201caltered or \u2018new\u2019 soup package is identical or substantially identical to its \u2018old\u2019 package complained of in the original complaint.\u201d Osem alleged that it had first learned of the new package \u201c[wjithin the past several weeks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Osem amended its complaint again on August 14, 1989, alleging that Sherwood had \u201cpublished and disseminated false and misleading statements concerning [Osem] and its \u2018Gourmet Cuisine\u2019 soup products\u201d in a letter dated November 28, 1988. Attached and made a part of the complaint was a copy of the offending letter, which Sherwood had sent to F.W. Woolworth Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Sherwood retained William B. Spry, Jr. to defend Osem\u2019s claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Sherwood also retained Lawrence R. Hefter, a trademark specialist with Finnegan, Henderson, Faraday, Garrett <em>&amp; </em>Dunner, in March 1989. In May 1991, Sherwood replaced Mr. Hefter with Floyd A. Gibson, an experienced trademark litigator with Bell, Selzer <em>&amp; </em>Gibson. Shortly after being hired, Mr. Gibson advised Uziel Frydman, Sherwood\u2019s sole stockholder, that Osem\u2019s claims might be covered by liability insur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>anee. Acting on Mr. Gibson\u2019s advice, Sherwood notified Hartford of the Osem litigation on June 18,1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Hartford advised Sherwood on July 2, 1991 that the \u201clate notice presents a possibility of prejudice of [Hartford\u2019s] rights\u201d and that the policy might not cover the loss. Hartford stated it would research and determine coverage under a reservation of rights. Hartford disclaimed coverage on September 18, 1991, on the ground that \u201call of the allegations occurred prior to the inception date of the Hartford policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">On November 30, 1992, Sherwood agreed to pay $100,-000 to Osem in settlement of Osem\u2019s trade dress infringement <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and unfair and deceptive trade practice claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Sherwood filed this action on June 25, 1993, for indemnification for the $100,000 paid to Osem under the settlement agreement and for attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses incurred in defending against Osem\u2019s claims. On August 31, 1994, Judge Ryan held that Hartford had a duty to defend Sherwood in the Osem litigation under the terms of the insurance policy. A second hearing on partial summary judgment was held on December 15, 1994, at which time Judge Turner ruled that Hartford, having shown no prejudice by the late notice, was responsible for Sherwood\u2019s pre-notice attorneys\u2019 fees and that Hartford had a duty to indemnify Sherwood. The jury was charged with determining the amount of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">The jury found that the following fees and expenses were fair, reasonable and necessary to the defense of Sherwood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>against Osem: $64,960.00 charged by Mr. Hefter;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> $102,-688.98 charged by Mr. Gibson; $61,074.00 charged by Mr. Spry for defense of the trademark claim; and $56,069.26 charged by Mr. Spry for defense of the defamation claim. The jury also found that the $100,000 settlement between Sherwood and Osem had been paid and that the settlement was fair and reasonable. The jury further determined that Sherwood was not entitled to pre-judgment interest. Final judgment was entered on August 3, 1995, and included awards of $23,336.78 in litigation expenses in connection with the Osem litigation and $89,237.20 in attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and expenses in connection with the prosecution of the Montgomery County declaratory judgment action. The judgment totalled $497,366.22, plus post-judgment interest and costs. Additional facts will be added as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">We recently summarized the standard of review applicable to the resolution of issues I through V in <em>General Accident Ins. Co. v. Scott, </em>107 Md.App. 603, 611-12, 669 A.2d 773, <em>cert. denied, </em>342 Md. 115, 673 A.2d 707 (1996):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">Maryland Rule 2-501 provides that a court shall enter summary judgment on the motion of a party where \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and ... the party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d ... [T]he court\u2019s task is not to decide disputed facts. <em>Coffey v. Derby Steel Co., </em>291 Md. 241, 247, 434 A.2d 564 (1981). Rather, it is to determine whether there are disputes as to material facts, <em>Impala Platinum Ltd. v. Impala Sales (U.S.A.), Inc., </em>283 Md. 296, 326, 389 A.2d 887 (1978), whose resolution would somehow affect the outcome of the case. <em>King v. Bankerd, </em>303 Md. 98, 111, 492 A.2d 608 (1985). In reviewing a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, an appellate court must also determine whether the trial court\u2019s ruling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>was legally correct. <em>Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. v. Lane, </em>338 Md. 34, 43, 656 A.2d 307 (1995); <em>Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. v. Scherr, </em>101 Md.App. 690, 694, 647 A.2d 1297 (1994).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-4\">In order to defeat a motion for summary judgment, the opposing party must show with some particularity that there is a genuine dispute as to a material fact. <em>Beatty v. Trailmaster Products, Inc., </em>330 Md. 726, 737, 625 A.2d 1005 (1993). In determining whether there are any material facts in dispute, the trial court must give the non-moving party the benefit of all reasonable inferences and must resolve all inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Id. </em>at 739, 625 A.2d 1005; <em>Clea v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>312 Md. 662, 678, 541 A.2d 1303 (1988). But \u201cgeneral allegations which do not show facts in detail and with precision are insufficient to prevent summary judgment.\u201d <em>Beatty, supra, </em>330 Md. at 738, 625 A.2d 1005. Nor are mere conclusory denials or allegations sufficient to overcome a motion for summary judgment. <em>See Seaboard Surety Co. v. Richard F. Kline, Inc., </em>91 Md.App. 236, 243, 603 A.2d 1357 (1992). As the Court said in <em>Beatty, </em>\u201cthe mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiffs claim is insufficient to preclude the grant of summary judgment.\u201d <em>Beatty, supra, </em>330 Md. at 738, 625 A.2d 1005.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Appellants contend that all of the allegations of wrongful conduct on Sherwood\u2019s part contained in the Osem complaint and its amendments occurred prior to February 23, 1989, the inception date of the CGL policy and, therefore, the trial court erred when it granted summary judgment and ruled that Hartford had a duty to defend Sherwood under the policy. Hartford points out that the original complaint was filed on January 6, 1989, before the Hartford policy was issued to Sherwood. The complaint alleged that packaging developed prior to January 6 was a trade dress infringement and consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>tuted unfair trade practices. The complaint was supplemented on February 27, 1989 to allege that Sherwood\u2019s \u201cnew\u201d soup package, which appellants had become aware of \u201cwithin the past several weeks,\u201d was substantially identical to its \u201cold\u201d package. The August 14, 1989 amendment alleged false and misleading statements made in a letter dated November 28, 1988. Hartford notes that the policy specifically excludes coverage for injury arising \u201cout of oral or written publication of material whose <em>first publication </em>took place before the beginning of the policy period.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Hart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>ford argues it had no duty to defend Sherwood because Osem\u2019s claims were not covered under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">The duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify. 7C John A. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice \u00a7 4684, at 83-85 (Walter F. Berdel rev., 1979). Liability insurance may also be called \u201clitigation insurance.\u201d <em>Brohawn v. Transamerica Ins. Co., </em>276 Md. 396, 410, 347 A.2d 842 (1975). The obligation of an insurer to defend under a CGL policy is determined by the allegations in the complaint. If the plaintiff alleges a claim covered by the policy, the insurer has a duty to defend the insured in that action. <em>Id. </em>at 407, 347 A.2d 842. \u201cEven if a tort plaintiff does not allege facts which clearly bring the claim within or without the policy coverage, the insurer still must defend if there is a <em>potentiality </em>that the claim could be covered by the policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 408, 347 A.2d 842; <em>see also Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc. v. Utica Mut. Ins. Co., </em>330 Md. 758, 625 A.2d 1021 (1993) (insurer must defend insured if it appears from complaint that there is potential for liability under the policy). Further, \u201cany doubt as to whether there is a potentiality of coverage under an insurance policy is to be resolved in favor of the insured.\u201d <em>Chantel Assocs. v. Mount Vernon Fire Ins. Co., </em>338 Md. 131, 145, 656 A.2d 779 (1995). Once Osem alleged a claim potentially covered by the policy, Hartford was obligated to defend the entire suit \u201cuntil such time, if ever, that the claims have been limited to ones outside the policy coverage.\u201d <em>Steyer v. Westvaco Corp., </em>450 F.Supp. 384, 398 (D.Md.1978) (citing <em>Brohawn, supra). See also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number><em>Titan Holdings Syndicate v. Keene, </em>898 F.2d 265, 269 (1st Cir.1990) (\u201cIf some of the claims against the insured fall within the terms of coverage, and some without, the insurer must still defend the entire claim....\u201d); <em>Tews Funeral Home, Inc. v. Ohio Casualty Ins. Co., </em>832 F.2d 1037, 1042 (7th Cir.1987) (\u201cAs long as only one of the many grounds for recovery is potentially covered by the policy, the insurer must provide a defense against the entire complaint, even if one or more theories of recovery are specifically excluded under the policy.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">As previously noted, the CGL policy issued by Hartford to Sherwood went into effect on February 23, 1989. Appellant contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-5\">Under the insuring agreement, ... the policy specifically states that the insurance for personal injury or advertising injury applies, but only if the offense was committed in the \u201ccoverage territory\u201d <em>during the policy period. </em>The exclusions contained ... apply both to \u201cpersonal injury\u201d and to \u201cadvertising injury\u201d and the exclusions -state that the insurance does not apply to oral or written publication of materials whose first publication took place before the beginning of the policy period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">(Emphasis in original.) The supplemental complaint was filed on February 27, 1989, four days after the policy went into effect. It was based on the distribution of a \u201cnew\u201d soup package. Appellee refers to the \u201cold\u201d packaging as the \u201cgreen soup package\u201d and to the \u201cnew\u201d packaging as the \u201cred soup package.\u201d Appellants conceded at oral argument that the \u201cold\u201d and \u201cnew\u201d packages were different colors.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">The red package could not have been \u201cpublished\u201d until it was distributed to the public. One cannot tell by reading the supplemental complaint when the red soup package was first distributed, thereby infringing on Osem\u2019s business. While Osem ambiguously claimed that the new packaging had come to its attention \u201cwithin the past several weeks,\u201d the complaint does not say when Sheiwood first distributed it or how it learned of the red package. Sheiwood could have begun <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>distributing the new soup package two weeks prior to February 27, or it could have begun doing so two days prior to February 27. Under these circumstances, the supplemented complaint on its face alleges an injury that was potentially covered by the Hartford policy. The trial judge was legally correct in granting summary judgment in favor of Sherwood on the issue of Hartford\u2019s duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Appellants contend that whether appellee made a material misrepresentation of fact at the time the policy was issued was a question of fact for the jury and, therefore, should not have been disposed of at summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Hartford alleges that Sherwood\u2019s chief financial officer, Anat Schwartz, first applied for coverage on January 12, 1989, six days after the Osem complaint was filed in North Carolina. A person filling out Hartford\u2019s insurance application form is instructed to \u201center all claims or occurrences that may give rise to claims for the prior 5 years\u201d in a section entitled \u201cLoss History.\u201d No claims were listed under this section, but the section includes a box, beside which is a notation, \u201cCheck here if none.\u201d The box was not checked. William C. Hall, the selling agent, testified at his deposition that he \u201cwould have asked\u201d anyone who applied for insurance coverage about loss history but could not recall what Ms. Schwartz said on that point. The loss history section of Sherwood\u2019s application was left blank. Appellants argue that this would lead \u201cany reasonable underwriter to conclude that there have been no losses, no claims, no suits filed against Sherwood for the past five years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Appellee contends that no material misrepresentation was made. Mr. Hall\u2019s handwritten notes of his initial conversation with Ms. Schwartz, which contain the notation \u201cNo Losses,\u201d indicate that the two spoke on January 4, 1989.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This was two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>days before the Osem complaint was filed. Mr. Hall could not specifically recall whether he spoke with Ms. Schwartz on January 12, 1989, the date he filled out the application, or whether he had spoken with her earlier. He produced no handwritten notes dated January 12, 1989. There was no evidence that Ms. Schwartz saw the application either before or after it was filled out by Mr. Hall. Ms. Schwartz did not sign the application; nor did Mr. Hall. Finally, Hartford did not receive the application until March 3, 1989, over a week after it had issued the CGL policy to Sherwood. There is no evidence that Hartford received, reviewed, or considered the application before issuing the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">Generally, an insurance policy is void <em>ab initio </em>if the insured makes a material misrepresentation of fact in the application. Whether the misrepresentation is material \u201cdepends upon whether the misrepresentation of the true facts would reasonably have affected the determination of the acceptability of the risk.\u201d <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. McBriety, </em>246 Md. 738, 744, 230 A.2d 81 (1967). Unless the parties contract otherwise, no misrepresentation by an insured will affect the validity of a policy unless the insurer relies on the misrepresentation in deciding whether to accept the risk. <em>Erie Ins. Exch. v. Lane, </em>246 Md. 55, 59, 227 A.2d 231 (1967), <em>overruled in part on different grounds by Cohen v. American Home Assurance Co., </em>255 Md. 334, 258 A.2d 225 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\"> The insurer\u2019s burden to establish the insured\u2019s misrepresentation was not met by Hartford. Mr. Hall could not remember whether he had asked Ms. Schwartz about Sherwood\u2019s loss history. The notation \u201cno losses\u201d in Mr. Hall\u2019s notes from January 4, 1989 was not a misrepresentation when made because the Osem complaint was not filed until two days later. Finally, Sherwood produced unrebutted evidence proving Hartford did not rely on the application when it wrote the policy. As we stated in <em>General Accident Ins., supra, </em>107 Md.App. at 612, 669 A.2d 773, mere conclusory allegations are insufficient to prevent summary judgment. Hartford could produce no evidence that a misrepresentation was made. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>Sherwood, on the other hand, produced evidence that none was made. The motions judge was therefore legally correct in granting summary judgment on the ground that there was no genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Sherwood had made a material misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">Further, even if we assumed, <em>arguendo, </em>that Sherwood did make a misrepresentation, Hartford clearly waived its right to object. If Hartford was truly concerned about the change in risk due to the alleged misrepresentation, it should have rescinded the policy and promptly returned all premiums and benefits to Sherwood once it had discovered the misrepresentation. <em>See Bagel Enters., Inc. v. Baskin &amp; Sears, </em>56 Md.App. 184, 200-01, 467 A.2d 533 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>299 Md. 136, 472 A.2d 999 (1984). An insurer that does any act recognizing the continued validity of the policy after it discovers a material misrepresentation waives its right to rescind the policy. <em>See Finch v. Hughes Aircraft Co., </em>57 Md.App. 190, 244, 469 A.2d 867, <em>cert. denied, </em>298 Md. 310, 469 A.2d 864 (1984), <em>and cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1215, 105 S.Ct. 1190, 84 L.Ed.2d 336 (1985). Not only did Hartford fail promptly to take steps showing it wished to rescind the policy, it continued to issue new policies to Sherwood for two years after learning of the Osem complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Hartford argues that the trial judge erred by finding as a matter of law that Sherwood\u2019s two-and-one-half year delay in notifying it of the Osem litigation did not prejudice it, thereby relieving it of its duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">In order for an insurer to disclaim coverage based on late notice, the insurer must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the late notice resulted in actual prejudice to it. Md.Code (1957, 1994 Repl.Vol.), Art. 48A, \u00a7 482.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number><em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. v. House, </em>315 Md. 328, 332, 554 A.2d 404 (1989). The insurer will survive summary judgment only if it raises a genuine dispute as to whether it was prejudiced by the delay in notice. <em>General Accident Ins., supra, </em>107 Md.App. at 613, 669 A.2d 773. Alleging only \u201cpossible, theoretical, conjectural, or hypothetical prejudice\u201d is not enough. <em>Id. </em>at 615, 669 A.2d 773. The prejudice cannot be surmised or presumed from the mere fact of delay. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Sherwood did not notify Hartford of the Osem litigation until June 18, 1991, two-and-one-half years after the original complaint was filed. Hartford produced an affidavit from Joan Warren, a property underwriting supervisor, which stated that, had Hartford been aware of the pendency of the litigation, it would not have accepted Sherwood as a risk in 1989 and would not have rewritten the policy in 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Joseph Jenkins, who works in the claims department at Hartford, was questioned at his deposition about the prejudicial effect of the delayed notice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">Q. ... [A]re you aware of any facts that would support a contention that Hartford Insurance Company suffered any actual prejudice [by reason of the late notification]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">A.

Hartford \u201cfailed to identify any specific, palpable instances to show how its ability to protect its interests was frustrated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It never stated specifically how the delay affected its investigation, other than that the matter was no longer \u201cfresh.\u201d Significantly, appellant does not claim that important information disappeared or that material evidence was no longer available.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">In regard to the affidavit by Ms. Warren, Hartford accepted Sherwood as a risk by underwriting two policies after it was notified of the Osem litigation and knew that Sherwood had delayed notification for over two years. The assertion that Hartford would not have accepted Sherwood as a risk, therefore, was contradicted by Hartford\u2019s own actions. Finally, Hartford was notified one-any-one-half years before the Osem litigation went to trial, giving it plenty of time to investigate.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">We hold that the trial judge was legally correct in finding that Hartford did not show it was actually prejudiced by the late notification, resolving the issue of Hartford\u2019s responsibility to pay Sherwood\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees that were incurred after Hartford was notified of Osem\u2019s claim. We proceed, in the following section, to resolve the separate issue of whether Hartford should be required to reimburse Sherwood for costs and legal fees incurred prior to its receiving notice of the Osem suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">Hartford argues that the trial court erred by holding it responsible for pre-notice litigation costs and attorney\u2019s fees. It maintains that until an insurer\u2019s duty to defend arises, it cannot be held liable for any costs incurred by the insured for its defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>If an insurer refuses to defend on behalf of the insured, the insurer is liable for damages incurred by the insured as a result of the insurer\u2019s breach of its obligation to defend. These damages generally include the amount of judgment or settlement, the costs of litigation, and attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Mount Vernon Fire Ins. Co. v. Scottsdale Ins.

This raises the question: when does the insurer\u2019s duty to defend commence? The United States District Court for the District of Maryland, applying Maryland law, held that an insurer\u2019s obligation to provide a defense and, therefore, to pay attorney\u2019s fees and litigation expenses, only arises upon notice of the suit. <em>Scottsdale Ins.

The policy issued to Sherwood states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AD9\">2.

Hartford does not claim that Sherwood breached the contract. Instead, it claims that Hartford did not breach the duty to defend portion of the CGL policy at any point before it was notified of Osem\u2019s claim and it was, therefore, not liable for attorneys\u2019 fees incurred prior to that point. Section 482 does not create coverage where none previously existed. There is an important distinction between an insurer\u2019s defense based on lack of a contractual duty and those based on the claim that the insurer is not liable because the insured has breached a condition set forth in the policy.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>We hold that section 482 applies only when it is claimed that the insured has breached a condition.

Sherwood was able to outline what fees it had already paid, when it had paid those fees, what fees it had not already paid, and when it had paid the $100,000 settlement. The sums paid in this case seem to fall within the exceptions cited above. When the motion for judgment was first made, however, Hartford had not been given an opportunity to dispute the reasonableness of the attorneys\u2019 fees and whether the settlement had actually been paid. The trial judge was correct in not granting the motion for judgment at the close of plaintiffs case.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Hartford called Robert Alpert as an expert in the field of litigation management to testify as to his- opinion of the reasonableness of the attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by Sherwood. Mr. Alpert did not, however, dispute the fact that Sherwood had made payments to the three law firms it hired to defend it in the Osem litigation, nor did he dispute the dates on which those payments were made. Mr. Alpert merely expressed his opinion that the fees charged were excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">When Hartford rested its case, the record showed the monies Sherwood had paid for post-notice attorneys\u2019 fees, litigation expenses, and settlement costs that Hartford should have paid.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-6\">Hartford, as cross-appellee, contends that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADt\">disputes existed regarding the fair and reasonableness of attorney\u2019s fees being claimed and the question of whether, in fact, the appellant paid $100,000.00 in order to settle the underlying lawsuit.

Several courts have stated that, because there is no duty to defend prior to notice of the suit, the insurer is not liable for pre-notice attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>See Aetna Casualty &amp; Sur. Co. v. Chicago Ins. Co., 782 </em>F.Supp. 71, 73 (N.D.Ill.1991) (holding that insurer is not required to pay cost of defending action it was never afforded an opportunity to defend), <em>aff'd, </em>994 F.2d 1254 (1993); <em>SL Indus., Inc. v. American Motorists Ins. Co., </em>128 N.J. 188, 607 A.2d 1266 (1992) (holding that insured cannot demand reimbursement for defense insurer had no opportunity to control if insured does not promptly notify insurer of facts triggering coverage); <em>Heffernan &amp; Co. v. Hartford Ins. Co. of Am., </em>418 Pa.Super. 326, 614 A.2d 295 (1992) (holding that attorneys\u2019 fees can be awarded only from time duty to defend arose).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b143-6\">. The insurer\u2019s unjustified refusal to defend after notice of a claim would, however, constitute a waiver of the provision insofar as post-notification attorneys' fees are concerned. <em>Cf. United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co. v. National Paving &amp; Contracting Co., </em>228 Md. 40, 178 A.2d 872 (1962) (stating that a denial of liability and refusal to defend releases insured from provision prohibiting settlement of claims without insurer's consent). In other words, when an insurer wrongfully refuses to defend, any attorneys\u2019 fees thereafter incurred by the insured are not incurred voluntarily.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b143-7\">. Courts in other jurisdictions have used an actual prejudice analysis in holding that an insurer is liable for pre-notice defense costs. <em>See TPLC, Inc. v. United Nat\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>44 F.3d 1484, 1493 (10th Cir.1995) (\u201cin the absence of a showing of prejudice, the insurer\u2019s duty to defend includes the duty to reimburse for reasonable costs of defense incurred prior to notice, as well as for subsequent defense costs\u201d); <em>Peavey Co. v. M/V ANPA, </em>971 F.2d 1168, 1178 (5th Cir. 1992) (holding that insurer is liable for pre-notice expenses because it did not show actual prejudice by delay and relied on pre-notice investigation without conducting one of its own); <em>Rovira v. LaGoDa, Inc., </em>551 So.2d 790, 794-95 (La.Ct.App. 1989) (holding that delayed notice relieves insurer of obligation to pay defense costs if it was actually prejudiced by delay).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">The <em>Peavey </em>and <em>Rovira </em>courts agree that the insurer\u2019s duty to defend does not arise until it is notified of the claim or suit. <em>Peavey, supra, </em>971 F.2d at 1178; <em>Rovira, supra, </em>551 So.2d at 794-95. The law on when the duty to defend arises in Pennsylvania (the state law at issue in <em>TPLC, Inc.) </em>is not so clear. The cases cited above are not attempting to interpret a statute such as \u00a7 482; they are based on case law. Unlike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>the precedent relied on in those cases, Maryland precedent unambiguously teaches that an insured seeking reimbursement for a breach of a duty to defend must prove, <em>inter alia, </em>that the attorneys\u2019 fees \"were incurred at a time when the carrier did have a duty to defend.\u201d <em>Mount Vernon Fire Ins., supra, 99 </em>Md.App. at 564, 638 A.2d 1196.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b144-5\">. We conclude that the term \"coverage,\u201d as used in \u00a7 482, includes the duty to defend as well as the duty to indemnify because the duty to defend is found in the insuring agreement. <em>See Washington v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co., </em>629 A.2d 24, 28 (D.C.1993). The cost of defense is a risk against which the CGL policy is designed to protect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b144-6\">. Cases construing \u00a7 482 generally involve the issue of whether the insured has the <em>status </em>of being covered with indemnity protection for past wrongdoing. <em>Accord Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. v. Ex-Cell-O Corp., </em>790 F.Supp. 1318, 1330 (E.D.Mich.1992) (citing to Michigan late notice cases that have established a requirement of showing actual prejudice). Thus, \u00a7 482 controls the circumstances under which an insurer may disclaim coverage it clearly has under the policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b144-7\">. Hartford\u2019s policy, like most CGL policies, contains the following provisions:</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">2. Duties in The Event Of Occurrence, Claim Or Suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">a. You must see to it that we are notified promptly of an \"occurrence\u201d which may result in a claim....</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">b. If a claim is made or \"suit\u201d is brought against any insured, you must see to it that we receive prompt written notice of the claim or \"suit.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b145-6\">. Appellee also argues that an insured\u2019s breach of its promise to give prompt notice is an immaterial breach. Md.Code Art. 48A, \u00a7 482. <em>See House, supra, </em>315 Md. at 332, 554 A.2d 404 (stating that statute measures by standard of actual prejudice materiality of any breach by insured to determine if breach excuses performance by insurer). The remedy for a partial breach is the damages suffered as a result of that breach. <em>Speed v. Bailey, </em>153 Md. 655, 660, 139 A. 534 (1927). Appellee contends that Hartford has the burden of proving its damages as a result of Sherwood\u2019s late notice. <em>Schackow v. Medical-Legal Consulting Serv., Inc., 46 </em>Md.App. 179, 191-92, 416 A.2d 1303 (1980). <em>See also Nortek, Inc. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>858 F.Supp. 1231, 1241-42 (D.R.I. 1994) (stating that party that failed to comply with notice provision is liable for any additional or excessive fees caused as a result). The proper analysis, however, of an insurer\u2019s liability for pre-notice attorneys\u2019 fees must start by examining whether the insurer is denying liability based on some breach on the part of the insured or whether the defense is based on the legal principle that an insurer owes no duty to defend until it has been notified of a breach.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b145-7\">. Flartford sets out in its brief a general breakdown of what fees and expenses were incurred pre-notice. Hartford contends that all fees claimed by Mr. Hefter were incurred prior to June 18, 1991, the date that Hartford received notice of the Osem litigation. Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit 8, which consists of the invoices from Mr. Hefter's firm, Finnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett &amp; Dunner, bears this out. The last invoice is dated May 17, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">Hartford alleges that \u201c[mjost (99%) of the Spry bill for the trademark case\u201d was incurred prior to June 18, 1991, while \"[ajpproximately $25,000.00 of Spry\u2019s bill for services rendered in the defamation\u201d suit was incurred after June 18, 1991. Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibits 2 and 3 consist of the invoices for work done on the trademark case and defamation case, respectively, by Mr. Spry\u2019s firm. Hartford contends that a \"portion\u201d of the fees claimed by Mr. Gibson was incurred prior to June 18, 1991. Plaintiff's Exhibit 21 consists of the invoices from Bell, Seltzer, Park &amp; Gibson. The first three invoices are for work performed before June <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>18, 1991. On remand, Sherwood must demonstrate what was billed for work performed by each law firm after June 18, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">Finally, Hartford argues that \"[alpproximately one-half of the charges for litigation expenses\u201d were incurred prior to June 18, 1991. Hartford cites to Plaintiff's Exhibit 16 in support of this argument. On remand, Sherwood must demonstrate what was billed for work performed after June 18, 1991.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b146-9\">. Hartford does not indicate in its brief the amount of fees and expenses incurred between January 6, 1989, the date the Osem complaint was filed, and February 23, 1989, the date the Hartford policy went into effect. On remand, Sherwood may be able to demonstrate, using Plaintiff's Exhibits 2, 8, and 16, the amount of fees and expenses incurred before the date the policy was issued, and which were incurred afterward.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b146-10\">. Sherwood's trial counsel made a motion for judgment at the close of plaintiff\u2019s case. As part of that motion, he stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">I would ask that Your Honor rule as a matter of law that prejudgment interest is recoverable in this matter on the grounds that the law as set forth in the various cases that I have cited, including those in the proposed jury instruction by the plaintiff, is that if funds have actually been used, then they may be recoverable-pre-judgment interest, rather, is recoverable thereupon, Your Honor, as set forth in cases such as the Distillery case and the I.W. Furman [sic] Properties case and in the cases therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-13\">Counsel for Hartford correctly characterized the motion as \u201cpremature'' and the motion was denied. At the close of all the evidence counsel for Sherwood asked to \"renew the motions I made at the close of the evidence earlier.... I adopt them by reference specifically.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Merely stating that a party \u201crenews\u201d its motion for judgment at the close of all the evidence, after making a motion at the close of the opponent's evidence, usually is not enough to preserve the issue for appellate review. <em>Ford v. Tittsworth, </em>77 Md.App. 770, 773-74, 551 A.2d 945 (1989). Normally, counsel is required to restate with particularity all reasons why the motion should be granted. <em>Id. </em>That general rule does not dispose of the case <em>sub judien, </em>however, because Sherwood originally made a motion for judgment at the close of its own evidence, not at the close of its opponent\u2019s evidence. The rationale for holding that merely \"renewing\u201d a motion for judgment does not preserve the issue for appeal is that the original motion for judgment is withdrawn once the party making the motion presents evidence. <em>Smith v. Carr, </em>189 Md. 338, 56 A.2d 151 (1947); Md. Rule 2-519(c). Because Sherwood had already presented its evidence when it initially moved for judgment, and because it is evident that the reasons for the motion were clear to the trial judge, the issue is preserved. Hartford does not contend otherwise. <em>See Laubach v. Franklin Square Hospital, </em>79 Md. App. 203, 216, 556 A.2d 682 (1989) (holding that reference to memorandum previously submitted to court laying out with particularity arguments in support of motion preserves issue) (citing <em>Sergeant Co. v. Pickett, </em>283 Md. 284, 289-90, 388 A.2d 543 (1978)), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>318 Md. 615, 569 A.2d 693 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b149-7\">. <em>See also Brethren Mut.
