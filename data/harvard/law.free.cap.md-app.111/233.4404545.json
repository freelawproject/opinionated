In 1993, Wallace Newton Edmonds and Amanda Bree Edmonds (the husband and daughter of Ms. Edmonds), and the Estate of Debra Edmonds, all appellants, filed wrongful death and survival claims against Dr. William Jaffurs, Cytology Services of Maryland, Inc. (\u201cCytology\u201d), Dr. Myrna Rivera, and Ivan Mattei, M.D., P.A., appellees, alleging that, in 1983, appellees had negligently failed to diagnose Ms. Edmonds\u2019s cervical cancer. When the matter proceeded to court, appellees moved for summary judgment, contending that appellants\u2019 claims were barred by limitations under C.J. \u00a7 5-109(a). The Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County granted the motion as to all claims. Appellants now present two questions for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-4\">I. Did the lower court err by granting summary judgment against Wallace Newton Edmonds and Amanda Bree Edmonds on the grounds that their wrongful death claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">II. Did the lower court err by granting summary judgment against the Estate of Debra Edmonds on the grounds that the survival claim was barred by the applicable statute of limitations?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">For the reasons stated below, we conclude that the court erred in granting summary judgment. Accordingly, we shall vacate the judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">\n<em>FACTUAL SUMMARY</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">In 1980, Debra Edmonds, who was then twenty-four years old and the mother of a young child, came under the care of Dr. Joseph Murgalo, a gynecologist who is not a party to this litigation. While under Dr. Murgalo\u2019s care, Ms. Edmonds experienced vaginal bleeding, abnormal discharge, and cervical eversion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and erosion. On February 19, 1981, Dr. Murgalo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>performed a cryoconization of Ms. Edmonds\u2019s cervix.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">Ms. Edmonds continued to experience problems associated with cervical eversion. In September 1981 and April 1982, she had abnormal Pap smears.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In October 1982, Dr. Murgalo noted that the cervix needed attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">On July 15, 1983, Dr. Murgalo performed a biopsy on a portion of white epithelium of the cervix.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The biopsy specimen was sent to Cytology, where Dr. Jaffurs, a Cytology employee, examined it. Dr. Jaffurs diagnosed \u201csevere epithelial dysplasia\u2014epidermoid carcinoma-in-situ (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia\u20143).\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In a \u201ccomment\u201d on his written re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>port, Dr. Jaffurs stated: \u201cPatient should be considered for further diagnostic surgery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">On July 28, 1983, Dr. Murgalo ordered an additional biopsy of Ms. Edmonds\u2019s cervix. The specimen was examined by Dr. Rivera, an employee of the laboratory of Ivan R. Mattei, M.D., P.A.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Dr. Rivera diagnosed \u201cfoci of severe epithelial dysplasia\u20145.\u201d Shortly thereafter, Dr. Murgalo performed a cervical conization.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The specimen was sent to the pathology department of Prince George\u2019s Hospital and Medical Center. Dr. Abolghassem Hatef, a pathologist who is not a party to this litigation, examined the specimen and stated in a subsequent report: \u201cCervical cone showing two minute foci of severe dysplasia. All margins are free\u20145.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Following the cervical conization, Ms. Edmonds remained under Dr. Murgalo\u2019s care. Between the evaluation of the conization in 1983 and August 1988, Dr. Murgalo continued to follow Edmonds and took periodic Pap smears that were benign.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> During this period, Ms. Edmonds apparently did not report any symptoms suggestive of cervical cancer, and she did not undergo any further diagnostic procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>In August 1988, Edmonds began to experience pain in her right sacroiliac and low back regions. X-rays taken at that time showed a \u201cdensity\u201d in the right mid-abdomen. That same month, Edmonds was admitted to the hospital for removal of her gallbladder. At that time, she complained of \u201ccontinuous low back pain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">On May 1, 1989, Edmonds returned to Dr. Murgalo for an office visit, complaining of \u201csevere pain\u201d in the right buttocks, radiating down the right thigh. She also indicated that the pain had been \u201coff and on for four months.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> She saw Dr. Murgalo again on June 5, 1989 and complained of pain in the right sacroiliac area, radiating down to the groin and to the interior thigh. Dr. Murgalo referred her to an orthopedist. Despite the orthopedic care, Ms. Edmonds\u2019s back pain persisted.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">On August 28, 1989, an electromyogram and nerve conduction study revealed \u201cprofound denervation of the adductors in the right leg consistent with a severe neuropathy involving the right obdurator nerve.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Ms. Edmonds continued to suffer excruciating pain in her right mid-lumbar spine and low back areas. She also began to lose a significant amount of weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Dr. Guy Gargour examined Ms. Edmonds on October 17, 1989 and performed a CT scan. He discovered a \u201cmass\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>the right pelvic area. On November 5, 1989, Edmonds was admitted to Georgetown University Hospital for a cancer evaluation. She was diagnosed on November 8, 1989 as having \u201csquamous cell cancer of unknown origin.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> She began to receive chemotherapy and radiation treatment. After twenty-five days in the hospital, Edmonds was discharged. She returned to the hospital for cancer treatment on an outpatient basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">On April 5, 1990, Edmonds was re-admitted to the hospital with symptoms of jaundice, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. She died on April 11,1990, at the age of thirty-four.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">On April 9, 1993, Wallace and Amanda Edmonds filed a statement of claim in the Health Claims Arbitration Office.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The claim included both wrongful death and survival actions. They alleged that Dr. Jaffurs, Dr. Rivera, Cytology, and Ivan R. Mattei, M.D., P.A. were negligent. After the parties waived the jurisdiction of the Health Claims Arbitration Office, appellants filed a complaint in the circuit court on June 3, 1994.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> They alleged that appellees (1) failed to diagnose \u201cinvasive cancer\u201d in the cervical specimens that they had analyzed in 1983; (2) failed to advise Dr. Murgalo \u201cof the need for surgical treatment to remove the tumor\u201d; (3) failed \u201cto obtain an adequate history\u201d from Edmonds and Dr. Murgalo; and (4) failed \u201cto consider the diagnosis of invasive cancer and discuss appropriate treatments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Dr. Thomas F. Rocereto, one of appellants\u2019 experts, testified at deposition that Ms. Edmonds had \u201cmicroscopic cervical cancer\u201d at the time the original biopsies were taken in July 1983. He stated that, at that time, she had \u201cat least ... Stage I\u201d cervical cancer, meaning that \u201c[t]he tumor, as far as I could tell from the record, was confined to the cervix.\u201d He added, however, that, with Stage I tumors, there is a \u201cten to fifteen percent chance\u201d that the lymph nodes are also involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Dr. Rocereto also opined that, had Ms. Edmonds been correctly diagnosed, the standard of care for her treatment would have been a radical hysterectomy and lymph node dissection. Moreover, he said that, if she had been treated properly in 1983, she would have had at least a seventy-five to eighty-five percent probability of survival. Dr. Rocereto added that Ms. Edmonds\u2019s chances of survival could have been more than ninety percent if her cervical cancer were truly microscopic in 1983. He also testified that, by 1989, when Ms. Edmonds complained of severe pain, she had no chance of survival. He was unable to identify, however, the point in time when Ms. Edmonds\u2019s cancer became incurable.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Appellees disputed appellants\u2019 contentions and denied all liability. They asserted that the biopsy specimens were correctly analyzed in 1983. They also claimed that Ms. Edmonds did not die from cervical cancer. Appellees based this contention, in part, on the autopsy report from Georgetown University Hospital, which stated in its \u201cHistory\u201d section that \u201cPrimary cervical ... carcinoma[ ] had been previously excluded.\u201d The autopsy report also said, in its \u201cSummary,\u201d that \u201cthe major part of the tumor appeared to be located within the pancreas,\u201d although the pathologist was unable to determine the origin of the cancer. Further, the Summary indicated that \u201c[c]areful gross and microscopic examination did not reveal any other possible site [other than the pancreas] for primary carcinoma.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In addition, Dr. James F. Barter testified at a deposition that \u201cthere was no evidence that [Ms. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Edmonds] had an invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">Notwithstanding these factual disputes, appellees filed motions for summary judgment, asserting that appellants\u2019 claims were time-barred under C.J. \u00a7 5-109(a), which requires that an action be filed within three years of the date on which \u201cthe injury was discovered\u201d (C.J. \u00a7 5-109(a)(2)), or within five years from the time \u201cthe injury was committed\u201d (C.J. \u00a7 5-109(a)(1)), whichever is <em>shorter. </em>In their opposition, appellants contended that there was a genuine dispute of material fact as to when the five year limitations period in C.J. \u00a7 5-109(a)(1) had commenced; they argued that an \u201cinjury\u201d -within the meaning of that provision occurred only when Ms. Edmonds\u2019s cervical cancer metastasized to other parts of her body, and the medical experts were unable to state when that occurred. They also claimed that there was a factual dispute that precluded summary judgment with respect to the three year limitations period in C.J. \u00a7 5-109(a)(2), because \u201c[t]here is absolutely no way that Debra Edmonds, as a person of ordinary prudence, would then suppose that it was necessary to re-examine the original tissue biopsies to be absolutely certain that they were correctly read.\u201d After a hearing, the court granted the motions, although the judge stated that he believed that the result was \u201cextremely unfair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion of the issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Maryland Rule 2-501 governs summary judgment motions. It is well settled that, in resolving a summary judgment motion, the court does not decide disputed facts. Rather, the court must determine whether there are disputes of material fact so as to make a trial on the merits necessary. <em>Maryland Casualty Co. v. Lorkovic, </em>100 Md.App. 333, 353-54, 641 A.2d 924 (1994). \u201cIn order to defeat a motion for summary judgment, the opposing party must show with some particularity that there exists a genuine dispute as to a material fact.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number><em>General Accident Insurance Co. v. Scott, 107 </em>Md.App. 603, 611-12, 669 A.2d 773, <em>cert. denied, </em>342 Md. 115, 673 A.2d 707 (1996). A \u201cmaterial fact\u201d is one whose resolution will somehow affect the outcome of the case. <em>King v. Bankerd, </em>303 Md. 98, 111, 492 A.2d 608 (1985); <em>Seaboard Surety Co. v. Richard F. Kline, Inc., </em>91 Md.App. 236, 242, 603 A.2d 1357 (1992). In ruling upon the motion, the court must view the facts, including all reasonable inferences from those facts, in the light most favorable to the opposing party. <em>Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. v. Lane, </em>338 Md. 34, 43, 656 A.2d 307 (1995). But, \u201c[mjere formal denials or general allegations of a dispute are not sufficient to establish\u201d a material dispute. <em>Bagwell v. Peninsula Regional Medical Center, </em>106 Md.App. 470, 488, 665 A.2d 297 (1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>341 Md. 172, 669 A.2d 1360 (1996); <em>Bond v. NIBCO, Inc., </em>96 Md.App. 127, 135, 623 A.2d 731 (1993). \u201c[Tjhe mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiffs claim is insufficient to preclude the grant of summary judgment.\u201d <em>Beatty v. Trailmaster Products, Inc., </em>330 Md. 726, 738, 625 A.2d 1005 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">In the absence of disputed facts, the court must determine whether a party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Beatty, supra, </em>330 Md. at 737, 625 A.2d 1005. Therefore, the ultimate standard for appellate review is whether the court was \u201clegally correct.\u201d <em>Southland Corp. v. Griffith, </em>332 Md. 704, 712, 633 A.2d 84 (1993); <em>Donovan v. Kirchner, </em>100 Md.App. 409, 416, 641 A.2d 961, <em>cert. denied, </em>336 Md. 299, 648 A.2d 202 (1994). Ordinarily, we will not affirm summary judgment on a ground upon which the trial court did not rely, if the court would have had discretion to deny summary judgment on the alternative ground. <em>Cheney v. Bell National Life Insurance Co., </em>315 Md. 761, 764, 556 A.2d 1135 (1989); <em>Warner v. German, </em>100 Md.App. 512, 517, 642 A.2d 239 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">C.J. \u00a7 5-109(a), the statute of limitations in issue, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>An action for damages for an injury arising out of the rendering of or failure to render professional services by a health care provider, as defined in \u00a7 3-2A-01 of this article, shall be filed within the earlier of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-4\">(1) Five years of the time the injury was committed; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\">(2) Three years of the date the injury was discovered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Statutes of limitation are intended, in part, to ensure fairness by preventing \u201cstale\u201d claims. <em>Feldman v. Granger, </em>255 Md. 288, 296-97, 257 A.2d 421 (1969). <em>See also McMahan v. Dorchester Fertilizer Co., </em>184 Md. 155, 159, 40 A.2d 313 (1944). Limitations periods rest on the notion that a defendant should not be called upon to defend against a claim when \u201cevidence has been lost, memories have faded, and witnesses have disappeared.\u201d <em>Doughty v. Prettyman, </em>219 Md. 83, 92-93, 148 A.2d 438 (1959) (quotation omitted). <em>Accord Bertonazzi v. Hillman, </em>241 Md. 361, 367, 216 A.2d 723 (1966). While C.J. \u00a7 5-109 serves this policy, it was enacted to alleviate a special problem in the context of medical malpractice claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Prior to the enactment of C.J. \u00a7 5-109, medical malpractice claims were governed by the general statute of limitations in C.J. \u00a7 5-101. That section provides, in part, that \u201c[a] civil action at law shall be filed within three years from the date it accrues----\u201d Under this rule, a medical malpractice cause of action was deemed to \u201caccrue\u201d when the claim was discovered, i.e., at the time when the plaintiff either knew of his or her injury or, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have discovered it. <em>See Waldman v. Rohrbaugh, </em>241 Md. 137, 139-45, 215 A.2d 825 (1966); <em>Hahn v. Claybrook, </em>130 Md. 179, 182, 100 A. 83 (1917); <em>Lutheran Hospital of Maryland v. Levy, </em>60 Md.App. 227, 232-33, 482 A.2d 23 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>302 Md. 288, 487 A.2d 292 (1985); <em>Jones v. Sugar, </em>18 Md.App. 99, 102-05, 305 A.2d 219 (1973).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>As the plaintiffs claim did not accrue until it was discovered, there could be a considerable time lag between the date when the physician rendered services and the date on which the cause of action accrued. Such time lags led to a phenomenon known as the \u201clong tail effect\u201d on medical malpractice insurance carriers. Because of the prospect that a physician\u2019s services could result in claims years after the service, insurance companies faced uncertainties in estimating their potential liabilities. The result was an increase in medical malpractice insurance rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">In 1975, in the midst of a perceived crisis in medical malpractice insurance, the General Assembly enacted C.J. \u00a7 5-109. We have interpreted C.J. \u00a7 5-109(a)(2) to provide the plaintiff with three years from the date the wrong was discovered or reasonably should have been discovered. <em>See Russo v. Ascher, </em>76 Md.App. 465, 469-73, 545 A.2d 714 (1988). Nevertheless, C.J. \u00a7 5-109(a)(l) serves as an outer limit on the time period in which the plaintiff may sue. It provides that an action may not be brought more than five years after \u201cthe <em>injury </em>was committed\u201d. (Emphasis supplied.) Moreover, this five year period runs irrespective of whether the injury was discovered or reasonably discoverable during that time. <em>Hill v. Fitzgerald, </em>304 Md. 689, 700, 501 A.2d 27 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">In <em>Hill, </em>the Court described the operation and purpose of C.J. \u00a7 5-109(a)(l):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-6\">[W]e think that the words of \u00a7 5-109 expressly place an absolute five-year period of limitation on the filing of medical malpractice claims calculated on the basis of when the injury was committed, <em>i.e., </em>the date upon which the allegedly negligent act was first coupled with harm. The purpose of the statute, readily evident from its terms, was to contain the \u201clong-tail\u201d effect of the discovery rule in medical malpractice cases by restricting, in absolute terms, the amount of time which could lapse between the allegedly negligent treatment of a patient and the filing of a malpractice claim related to that treatment. The statute is a response to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>so-called crisis in the field of medical malpractice claims ... and contains no room for any implied exceptions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-5\"><em>Id., </em>304 Md. at 699-700, 501 A.2d 27 (citations omitted). Thus, <em>\u201cHill </em>indicates that the primary objective of the legislature was to promote society\u2019s interest in maintaining malpractice insurance coverage and managing the costs of malpractice litigation.\u201d <em>Newell v. Richards, </em>323 Md. 717, 727-28, 594 A.2d 1152 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Appellants assert that the trial court erred in entering summary judgment, because there was a genuine dispute of fact as to when Ms. Edmonds suffered an \u201cinjury\u201d within the meaning of C.J. \u00a7 5-109(a)(l). They claim that the trial court erroneously concluded, as a matter of law, that Ms. Edmonds suffered an injury in 1983, when appellees allegedly misdiagnosed the biopsy specimens. They point out that the decedent did not become ill until August 1988, when she began to experience back pain.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Because of this \u201clack of any discernible effect\u201d on Ms. Edmonds, appellants argue that there was a factual dispute as to when appellees\u2019 negligence harmed or \u201cinjured\u201d the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Appellants further contend that the word \u201cinjury\u201d in C.J. \u00a7 5\u2014109(a)(1) is ambiguous, and that interpreting it in the manner suggested by appellees would produce \u201cabsurd and unjust consequences\u201d; Ms. Edmonds would have been required to file her lawsuit prior to July 1988, a time period in which she was in apparent good health and free from any signs or symptoms of cancer. Appellants assert that the General Assembly could not have intended such \u201cunjust, oppressive or absurd consequences.\u201d Finally, appellants suggest that, if C.J. \u00a7 5\u2014109(a)(1) required Ms. Edmonds to file her claim while she was in apparent good health, then it constitutes an unconstitutional denial of access to the courts, in violation of Article 19 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>In response, appellees vigorously contend that, if appellants\u2019 allegations are accepted as true, then Ms. Edmonds suffered an \u201cinjury\u201d when appellees negligently failed to diagnose her cancer in 1983 or \u201ccertainly soon thereafter.\u201d Thus, they assert that appellants\u2019 claim is time-barred, because it was filed more than five years after the \u201cinjury was committed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">At the outset, we focus on appellants\u2019 contention that there is a factual dispute as to when Ms. Edmonds suffered an \u201cinjury.\u201d Appellants seemingly argue that Ms. Edmonds was injured when she experienced pain and other symptoms in 1988; they assert that \u201c[t]he record is devoid of any evidence that after Dr. Murgalo performed the conization on August 1, 1983[she] had any signs or warnings of cancer, such as bleeding, loss of weight, change in appetite, nausea, pain, or discomfort.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">We have found some authority, not cited by appellants, to support the position that an \u201cinjury\u201d occurs when a person first experiences symptoms. The statute of limitations for medical malpractice actions in California is similar to Maryland\u2019s, <em>see </em>Cal.Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7 340.5 (West 1982),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and the California courts have consistently interpreted the word \u201cinjury\u201d to mean the \u201cdamaging effect\u201d of the negligent act. <em>See Larcher v. Wanless, </em>18 Cal.3d 646, 135 Cal.Rptr. 75, 80, n.11, 557 P.2d 507, 512 n. 11 (1976) (\u201c[T]he word \u2018injury\u2019 ... seems clearly to refer to the damaging effect of the alleged wrongful act and not to the act itself.\u201d); <em>Tresemer v. Barke, </em>86 Cal. App.3d 656, 665, 150 Cal.Rptr. 384, 388-89 (1978) (\u201cinjury\u201d is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>\u201cnot synonymous with \u2018wrongful act,\u2019 but refers to the \u2018damaging effect\u2019 of the wrongful act\u201d); <em>Wells Fargo Bank v. Superior Court for Sacramento County, 74 </em>Cal.App.3d 890, 896, 141 Cal.Rptr. 836, 838 (1977) (to the same effect). The California courts have also stated that a patient does not suffer an \u201cinjury\u201d within the meaning of the statute until he or she has suffered \u201cappreciable harm\u201d as a result of the health care provider\u2019s act or omission. <em>Christ v. Lipsitz, </em>99 Cal.App.3d 894, 897, 160 Cal.Rptr. 498, 500 (1979). <em>See also McNall v. Summers, </em>25 Cal.App.4th 1300, 1307-13, 30 Cal.Rptr.2d 914, 917-20 (1994), <em>rev. denied, </em>(Sept. 7, 1994) (in case alleging negligent performance of electroconvulsive therapy that resulted in a stroke, \u201cinjury\u201d occurred when patient noticed continuous memory loss).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">But California\u2019s \u201cappreciable harm\u201d or \u201cdamaging effect\u201d interpretation could result in a time lag between the date of the wrongful act and the date on which the limitations period would commence. In <em>Larcher v. Wanless, </em>18 Cal.3d 646, 135 Cal.Rptr. 75, 557 P.2d 507, the California Supreme Court held that, in a wrongful death action, the word \u201cinjury\u201d in the statute referred to the death of the patient, and not the patient\u2019s earlier illness. The court recognized that such an interpretation would not eliminate the \u201clong tail effect\u201d on medical malpractice insurers. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-5\">Defendants seem to argue from the premise that the undiluted purpose of section 340.5 was to lower malpractice insurance rates by enabling insurers to reduce the amount of reserves they need maintain to meet potential claims. They urge that because a statute of limitations in wrongful death actions which extinguishes a large number of claims before they accrue might substantially curtail malpractice exposure, the legislation should be construed in conformity with that end.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-6\">But section 340.5 evinces no such single-minded purpose. Instead, as originally worded, <em>the statute appears to have been a compromise between concern over the extended exposure of medical practitioners to malpractice liability and a desire not to bar potentially worthy plaintiffs from court before they have a fair chance to bring suit. </em>The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Legislature declined to adopt other proposals before it which held out the promise of substantially greater reductions in malpractice exposure and necessary insurance reserves. <em>Thus the Legislature did not date the limitation period from the \u201calleged wrongful act, </em>\u201d as provided in one proposal. (Assem. Bill No. 135 (1969 Reg. Sess.).) <em>Instead, the limitation period was tied to \u201cinjury, \u201d a word of art which might refer to an event occurring some time after the commission of a \u201cwrongful act.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><em>Id., </em>135 Cal.Rptr. at 80, 557 P.2d at 512 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">In <em>Steingart v. Oliver, </em>198 Cal.App.3d 406, 243 Cal.Rptr. 678 (1988), California\u2019s intermediate appellate court applied \u00a7 340.5 to a fact pattern quite similar to the one in this case. In 1982, Theresa Steingart, the plaintiff, noticed a lump in her right breast. On February 12, 1982, she went to Dr. John White, a gynecologist, who diagnosed the lump as a group of benign cysts, and told Steingart not to be concerned. Steingart, who was a registered nurse, questioned the doctor\u2019s diagnosis and requested a biopsy. But White told her that she did not need one. He then sent her to another doctor, Joseph Oliver, who confirmed White\u2019s diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Steingart did not notice any change in the lump between 1982 and 1985. In 1985, however, she \u201cnoticed a change in the contour of the upper outer quadrant of her right breast.\u201d 198 Cal.App.3d at 410, 243 Cal.Rptr. at 679. In April of 1985, she was diagnosed with Stage II breast cancer, and had to undergo a radical mastectomy. On March 24, 1986, she filed her complaint against the physicians, alleging negligent misdiagnosis; suit was filed more than four years after White\u2019s examination but less than one year after the diagnosis of breast cancer.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">The lower court held that the claim against White was barred by limitations, but the appellate court reversed. It noted the general rule that \u201c \u2018the event which activates the three-year limitations period is the moment the plaintiff discovers the harm caused by the alleged negligence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>198 Cal.App.3d at 413, 243 Cal.Rptr. at 681 (quoting <em>Hills v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number><em>Aronsohn, </em>152 Cal.App.3d 753, 762, 199 Cal.Rptr. 816, 822 (1984)). Quoting the <em>Hills </em>case, the court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-4\">\u201cWe do not see how the rule can be otherwise. In a medical malpractice action, where an element of the cause of action is damages, a cause of action cannot accrue until the plaintiff has suffered some legally compensable injury. To adopt a rule that the statute begins to run on the date of the alleged negligence would mean that a plaintiff is denied all possibility of recovery simply because the injury did not manifest itself until sometime after three years from the date of the negligent act. Indeed, where the injury does not manifest itself within three years of the negligent act, a plaintiff would have no opportunity whatsoever to recover since the three-year period would effectively bar the action before the cause of action even accrued.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-5\"><em>Steingart, </em>198 Cal.App.3d at 413, 243 Cal.Rptr. at 681 (quoting <em>Hills, </em>152 Cal.App.3d at 762 n. 7, 199 Cal.Rptr. 816, 822 n. 7).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Applying these rules, the court concluded that Steingart\u2019s complaint was timely filed. As for the three year period, the court stated: \u201c[I]t must be concluded [that] Steingart suffered no damaging effect or appreciable harm from White\u2019s asserted neglect until Newman discovered her cancer in April 1985.\u201d <em>Steingart, </em>198 Cal.App.3d at 414, 243 Cal.Rptr. at 682. The court rejected the contention that Steingart suffered an injury when she knew about the lump: \u201c[A]lthough Steingart knew about the lump at the time White examined her, such a condition is not a clear indication of injury, either damaging effect or appreciable harm.\u201d <em>Id., </em>198 Cal.App.3d at 415, 243 Cal.Rptr. at 682. As for the one year \u201cdiscovery\u201d period, the court held that there was \u201cat minimum\u201d a triable issue of fact: \u201cReasonable minds could easily conclude [that] Steingart did everything within her power to ascertain what, if any, illnesses she had after receiving White\u2019s initial diagnosis.\u201d <em>Id., </em>198 Cal.App.3d at 416, 243 Cal.Rptr. at 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">As we see it, the view of the California courts, typified by <em>Steingart </em>and <em>Hills, </em>is essentially that an \u201cinjury\u201d occurs when the patient \u201cdiscovers\u201d the harm caused by the physician\u2019s negligent act. We cannot adopt that view, because it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>effectively re-incorporate into C.J. \u00a7 5-109(a) the same open-ended discovery rule that the General Assembly sought to abolish. Moreover, such an interpretation would render meaningless the dichotomy between C.J. \u00a7 5-109(a)(l) and C.J. \u00a7 5-109(a)(2).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> It would also contradict the Court\u2019s statement in <em>Hill v. Fitzgerald </em>that the five year period in C.J. \u00a7 5\u2014109(a)(1) runs \u201cwithout regard to whether the injury was reasonably discoverable.\u201d <em>Id., </em>304 Md. at 700, 501 A.2d 27. Therefore, appellants\u2019 contention that Ms. Edmonds did not suffer an \u201cinjury\u201d until she began to experience pain or other symptoms from the cancer must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>c.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Appellees argue that, on the facts of this case, the failure to diagnose resulted in an immediate \u201cinjury\u201d to Ms. Edmonds for purposes of C.J. \u00a7 5-109(a). Appellees\u2019 position rests on the premise that, in this case, the \u201cinjury\u201d contemplated by C.J. \u00a7 5-109(a) necessarily occurred at the same time as the negligent act or omission. Our research reveals that Delaware subscribes to the view that the time of \u201cinjury\u201d coincides with the time the negligent act was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Like Maryland\u2019s, Delaware\u2019s statute of limitations in medical malpractice actions includes a discovery provision and focuses on the time of \u201cinjury.\u201d Del.Code Ann. tit. 18, \u00a7 6856 (1989) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\">No action for the recovery of damages upon a claim against a health care provider for personal injury, including personal injury which results in death, arising out of malpractice shall be brought after the expiration of 2 years from the date upon which such <em>injury </em>occurred; provided, however, that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-7\">(1) Solely in the event of personal injury the occurrence of which, during such period of 2 years, was unknown to and could not in the exercise of reasonable diligence have been discovered by the injured person, such action may be brought prior to the expiration of 3 years from the date upon which such <em>injury </em>occurred, and not thereafter____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">The Delaware courts have construed the statutory phrase \u201cinjury occurred\u201d as referring to the date when \u201cthe wrongful act or omission occurred.\u201d <em>Benge v. Davis, </em>553 A.2d 1180, 1183 (Del.1989). The Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Dunn v. Saint Francis Hospital, Inc., </em>401 A.2d 77, 80 (Del.1979), illustrates the application of this rule. The plaintiff, Fred Dunn, had a back operation in 1970. In April 1975, he began to experience leg pain. In January 1977, he discovered that the leg pain might have been caused by the negligence of the doctors who performed the operation in 1970. When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Dunn filed suit in March 1977, the court held that his suit was barred by limitations. It concluded that \u201cthere is no doubt that the phrase \u2018injury occurred\u2019 refers to the date when the wrongful act or omission occurred,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>the 1970 operation. <em>Id., </em>401 A.2d at 80. The court relied heavily on the purpose of the special statute of limitations to contain the \u201clong tail\u201d effect of the discovery rule. <em>Id. </em>at 79-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">The court also rejected Dunn\u2019s contention that limitations did not begin to run until he began to experience pain in 1975. Dunn argued that, in the five preceding years, he had no \u201cdamages\u201d that would be cognizable in a negligence action, and thus no \u201cinjury.\u201d The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\">The answer, however, must be that the statute was a response to a particular issue in a particular context and that to construe it broadly without the bounds of that context, as plaintiff desires, would emasculate its very purpose. Furthermore, if the General Assembly intended there to be a line of demarcation based on the no pain-no injury rationale, it would have said so in some precise manner. We cannot frustrate the clear legislative intent. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-6\"><em>Id., </em>401 A.2d at 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">The Delaware Supreme Court has since applied <em>Dunn's </em>injury-equals-wrongful-act interpretation in cases involving alleged negligent misdiagnoses. <em>See Benge v. Davis, 553 </em>A.2d 1180 (failure to diagnose breast tumor); <em>Reyes v. Kent General Hospital, Inc.., </em>487 A.2d 1142 (Del.1984). <em>Reyes </em>is notable, because it involved alleged negligent misdiagnosis of cervical cancer, and the issue was whether a wrongful death claim was time-barred. The court stated unequivocally: \u201cThe clear language of the statute dictates that whether the action be one for personal injury or personal injury resulting in death, the Statute of Limitations begins to run on the date of the alleged wrongful act or omission.\u201d <em>Id., </em>487 A.2d at 1145-46. <em>But cf. Pearson v. Boines, </em>386 A.2d 651 (Del.1978) (doctor negligently told patient that she had multiple sclerosis, and she underwent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>voluntary sterilization on his advice; <em>held, </em>\u201cinjury\u201d occurred on date of sterilization).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">We cannot accept the Delaware rule either. C.J. \u00a7 5-109(a)(1) does not date the five year limitations period from when the \u201cwrongful act or omission\u201d occurred. Instead, it specifically declares that the period begins to run on the date when the \u201cinjury was committed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">A comparison of C.J. \u00a7 5-109(a) with medical malpractice statutes of limitations in other jurisdictions illustrates the importance of this phraseology. Like Maryland, many states enacted special medical malpractice statutes of limitations during the medical malpractice insurance crisis of the 1970\u2019s. But most of these statutes use the date of the health care provider\u2019s \u201cact\u201d or \u201comission\u201d as a reference point, and not the date of the patient\u2019s \u201cinjury.\u201d Some of these statutes contain both a \u201cdiscovery\u201d period and a longer \u201couter limit\u201d period, and provide that the action must be filed within the time period that expires earlier. <em>(See </em>the statutes listed in Appendix A.) Other statutes that have attempted to counteract the \u201clong tail effect\u201d provide that limitations begins to run on the date of the \u201cact\u201d or \u201comission,\u201d but they do not include a discoverability clause. <em>(See </em>the statutes listed in Appendix B.)</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">In 1977, the American Bar Association\u2019s Commission on Medical Professional Liability recommended implementation of a statute of limitations requiring an action to be brought within two years from the date of the \u201cincident which gave rise to the action,\u201d or one year from when the injury was discovered or reasonably should have been discovered, whichever occurred later, but in no event more than \u201ceight years after the occurrence of the <em>incident which gave rise to the </em>injury.\u201d (Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">The Maryland Legislature could have followed the great majority of jurisdictions by enacting a statute providing for the commencement of limitations on the date of the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>dant\u2019s alleged \u201cact\u201d or \u201comission.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Such language would have compelled the conclusion that limitations begins to run from the date of the misdiagnosis. <em>See Humphreys v. Roche Biomedical Lab., Inc., </em>990 F.2d 1078, 1080 (8th Cir.1993) (interpreting Arkansas statute providing that suit must be filed within two years of the \u201cwrongful act,\u201d except in cases of foreign objects; <em>held, </em>limitations began to run on the date of misreading of Pap smear). <em>But see Bonz v. Sudweeks, </em>119 Idaho 539, 808 P.2d 876, 878-79 (1991) (interpreting statute requiring that suit be filed within two years of \u201cthe occurrence, act or omission complained of\u201d; despite this language, limitations does not begin to run until plaintiff sustains \u201csome damage\u201d). Despite the plethora of statutes in other states to this effect, our Legislature did not adopt such a provision. Instead, it provided that the period specified in C.J. \u00a7 5-109(a)(1) would begin to run on the date the \u201cinjury\u201d was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">In fact, while enacting amendments to C.J. \u00a7 5-109 in 1987, <em>see </em>1987 Md. Laws, ch. 592, the General Assembly considered and rejected a proposal that would have brought the statute more in line with those in other jurisdictions. Senate Bill 225, as originally proposed, would have amended C.J. \u00a7 5-109(a)(l) to provide that the five year period would begin to run from the date of \u201cthe allegedly -wrongful act or omission,\u201d rather than from the date when \u201cthe injury was committed.\u201d This amendment was proposed by the Governor\u2019s Oversight Committee on Liability Insurance, along with another proposal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>change the limitations period for medical malpractice claims by minors. A briefing paper prepared by the Legislative Office of the Governor, explaining the proposed changes, stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-4\">[T]he proposed legislation clarifies that the statute begins to run from the occurrence of the allegedly -wrongful act or omission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-6\">The Court of Appeals has recently given an expansive reading to the term \u201cinjury\u201d in \u00a7 5-109. The Court ruled in <em>Hill v. Fitzgerald, </em>304 Md. 689, 501 A.2d 27 (1985), that an \u201cinjury\u201d is committed on the date that the allegedly negligent act was first coupled with harm. Accordingly, it would be possible under this interpretation to bring an action for a harm that had not manifested itself for years after the negligent act. In some cases, this interpretation effectively negates the limitations period. Such unexpected expansions of risk exposure diminish predictability and pricing stability and, generally, contribute to the soaring premiums in the Maryland malpractice insurance marketplace.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-7\">* * * * <em>% </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-8\">The proposed bill modifies current law ... [to] make it express that the statutory periods begin to run from the date of the \u201callegedly wrongful act or omission\u201d in place of the common law term \u201cinjury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">This proposal, however, was deleted from the bill in the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee. The Committee\u2019s report for the bill stated: \u201cThe intent of the deleted language was to overturn the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Hill v. Fitzgerald, </em>304 Md. 689, 501 A.2d 27 (1985). In that case, the court ruled that an \u2018injury\u2019 is committed on the date the allegedly negligent act was first coupled with harm.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">This history provides strong evidence that the General Assembly did not intend to create an ironclad rule that a medical malpractice claim would be barred if filed more than five years after the health care provider\u2019s wrongful act. Instead, as the California Supreme Court suggested in <em>Larcher </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number><em>v. Wanless </em>in reference to that state\u2019s statute, the Legislature sought to balance two competing interests. First, it wished to combat the \u201clong tail effect\u201d on medical malpractice insurance. <em>See </em>Committee Report for Senate Bill 225, at 1 (\u201cThe intent of this bill is to promote predictability and pricing stability and reduce the huge increase in medical malpractice insurance premiums by shortening the \u2018long tail\u2019 for claims involving injury to minors.\u201d). Simultaneously, however, it wished to lessen the potential unfairness to victims of malpractice by not overly restricting their ability to present their claims. The Legislature reconciled these competing interests by providing that the five year \u201ccutoff\u201d period in C.J. \u00a7 5-109(a)(l) would begin to run on the date when the \u201cinjury\u201d resulting from the health care provider\u2019s wrongful act or omission occurred, rather than from the date of that act or omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">In sum, the General Assembly was evidently made aware of the potential ramifications of retaining the term \u201cinjury.\u201d Nonetheless, it elected to leave that language unchanged. Adopting the Delaware rule, therefore, would be to adopt a rule that the General Assembly has rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Our analysis focuses on the concept of \u201cinjury,\u201d because the five year limitations period embodied in C.J. \u00a7 5-109(a) is triggered when the \u201cinjury\u201d occurs. According to the Court in <em>Hill, </em>an injury occurs when \u201cthe negligent act [is] coupled with some harm [to create] a legally cognizable wrong.\u201d <em>Id., </em>304 Md. at 696, 501 A.2d 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">In our view, a negligent misdiagnosis is not necessarily an \u201cinjury\u201d for purposes of limitations; a wrongful \u201cact\u201d or \u201comission\u201d is not the same as an \u201cinjury\u201d. Indeed, the two need not necessarily occur simultaneously.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>The distinction between an injury and a wrongful act is reflected in the elements of a negligence claim, for which a plaintiff must plead and prove the following: (1) the defendant had a duty to protect the plaintiff from injury; (2) the defendant breached that duty; (3) the plaintiff suffered <em>actual injury or loss; </em>and (4) that injury or loss was the proximate result of the defendant\u2019s breach. <em>Baltimore Gas and Electric Co. v. Lane, </em>338 Md. 34, 43, 656 A.2d 307 (1995); <em>Rosenblatt v. Exxon Co., </em>335 Md. 58, 76, 642 A.2d 180 (1994). Furthermore, in order to recover, the plaintiffs injury or loss must be proven with reasonable probability or certainty, and cannot be the subject of mere speculation or conjecture. <em>See Mount Royal Cab Co. v. Dolan, </em>166 Md. 581, 584, 171 A. 854 (1934); <em>DiLeo v.

The Court of Appeals has also stated: \u201cIn a negligence claim, the fact of injury would seemingly be the last element to come into existence. The breach, duty, and causation elements naturally precede the fact of injury.\u201d <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc. v.

It meant a wrongful invasion of legal rights and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>not concerned with the hurt or damage resulting from such invasion. It is thus used in the familiar law phrase <em>damnum absque inju\u00f1a </em>[damage without violation of a legal right, for which no legal action will lie]. In common parlance, however, it is used broadly enough to cover both the <em>damnum </em>and the <em>inju\u00f1a </em>of the common law, and indeed is more commonly used to express the idea belonging to the former word, namely, the effect on the recipient in the way of hurt or damage, and we cannot doubt that at this day its common and approved usage extends to and includes any hurtful or damaging effect which may be suffered by any one [sic].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-4\"><em>Oxtoby, </em>294 Md. at 94, 447 A.2d 860.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The Court concluded that, \u201cin general, \u2018medical injuries\u2019 as used in the effective date clause refers to <em>legally cognizable </em>wrongs or damage arising or resulting from the rendering or failure to render health care.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Emphasis supplied.)

Because of the clear and uncontradicted evidence that \u201cpleural scarring does not cause a functional impairment or harm as defined in the <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 7,\u201d we concluded that damages could not be awarded for pleural plaques or pleural thickening. <em>Id. </em>at 735, 591 A.2d 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">In view of the foregoing authorities, we conclude that an \u201cinjury\u201d within the meaning of C.J. \u00a7 5-109(a) is not \u201ccommitted\u201d unless, as a proximate result of the wrongful act, the patient sustains damages.

Yet if Ms. Edmonds had filed suit against appellees immediately after their allegedly negligent acts, her suit may have been dismissed for lack of damages or lack of damages that could be proven with reasonable certainty. <em>See Pierce v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., </em>296 Md. 656, 666, 464 A.2d 1020 (1983) (\u201chighly likely\u201d that risk of developing lung cancer as a result of asbestos exposure would be \u201ctoo speculative to support a damage award\u201d). According to appellees, however, the limitations period would continue to run and, if Edmonds filed suit once she sustained legally cognizable damages, her claim may have been beyond the five year window, and thus would have been dismissed on limitations grounds. It is plainly evident that appellees\u2019 interpretation could create a situation in which the limitation period runs before all the elements of a viable cause of action even exist. The plaintiff would be caught in an impossible \u201cCatch-22\u201d situation, because she would <em>never </em>be able to file suit; her suit would always be either premature or untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Appellees\u2019 interpretation also flies in the face of the familiar principle of statutory construction that, in choosing between competing interpretations of a statute, \u201cthe eourt \u2018may consider the consequences resulting from one meaning rather than another, and adopt that construction which avoids an illogical or unreasonable result, or one which is inconsistent with common sense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund v. Erie Insurance Exchange, </em>105 Md.App. 377, 386, 660 A.2d 929 (1995) (quoting <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 75, 517 A.2d 730 (1986)). <em>See also Frost v. State, </em>336 Md. 125, 137, 647 A.2d 106 (1994) (\u201cwe seek to avoid constructions that are illogical, unreasonable, or inconsistent with common sense\u201d); <em>Lemley v. Lemley, </em>102 Md.App. 266, 291, 649 A.2d 1119 (1994) (same); <em>Reuter v. Reuter, </em>102 Md.App. 212, 225, 649 A.2d 24 (1994) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>The cases that appellees cite in support of their position that Ms. Edmonds suffered an immediate \u201cinjury\u201d at the time of the alleged misdiagnosis are not persuasive. Appellees rely on <em>Oxtoby </em>to argue that an \u201cinjury\u201d always occurs at the time of the physician\u2019s wrongful act. But, contrary to appellees\u2019 assertion, the Court in <em>Oxtoby </em>did not hold that the patient suffered an \u201cinjury\u201d at the time of the failed surgery. The trial court found that the patient suffered a medical injury prior to July 1, 1976, and the Court held that, because the record was inadequate to permit review of the finding, the finding had to stand. <em>Id., </em>294 Md. at 92, 447 A.2d 860. The Court noted that the lower court\u2019s \u201cruling may well have been based on the evidence, alluded to by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel at the time, <em>that cancer developed in [the patient] before July 1, 1976.\u201d Id. </em>(Emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Appellees also rely on our decisions in <em>Russo v. Ascher, supra, </em>76 Md.App. 465, 545 A.2d 714 (1988) and <em>Dennis v. Blanchfield, </em>48 Md.App. 325, 428 A.2d 80 (1981), <em>modified on other grounds, </em>292 Md. 319, 438 A.2d 1330 (1982). These cases are distinguishable, however, because it appears that the patient in each case <em>had </em>incurred legally cognizable damages more than five years before filing her action. Thus, the issue of whether a patient could suffer injury in the absence of legally cognizable harm was not before the Court in either case.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">In <em>Russo, </em>the patient filed a claim in 1985 with the Health Claims Arbitration Office, alleging that the defendant psychiatrist had negligently failed to diagnose a cyst in her brain during the course of her treatment from 1971 to 1982. The only test that could detect this type of cyst was a CAT scan. <em>Id., </em>76 Md.App. at 472, 545 A.2d 714. The psychiatrist\u2019s expert testified in a deposition that the CAT scan first became <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>available as a diagnostic tool in 1978, and the patient failed to rebut this testimony. Therefore, we held that the five year limitations period in C.J. \u00a7 5\u2014109(a)(1) had begun, at the latest, in 1978, when the psychiatrist allegedly failed to use a CAT scan to diagnose the patient\u2019s brain cyst. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">Appellees suggest that this holding means that a plaintiff invariably suffers an \u201cinjury\u201d immediately upon a misdiagnosis. To the contrary, we made clear that the patient, \u201c[djuring the course of\u2019 her treatment by the psychiatrist from 1971 to 1982, \u201cexperienced headaches, vomiting, dizziness, a gait problem and recurrent episodes of falling,\u201d and that her \u201ccondition had been deteriorating for over eleven years to the point where she could not walk unassisted.\u201d <em>Id., </em>76 Md.App. at 467, 470-71, 545 A.2d 714. Thus, it appears that this Court assumed that the patient, around the time of the misdiagnosis in 1978, suffered legally cognizable damages, in the form of pain and discomfort, that she would not have suffered in the absence of the psychiatrist\u2019s negligence. Therefore, <em>Russo </em>does not alter our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">In <em>Dennis v. Blanchfield, </em>48 Md.App. 325, 428 A.2d 80 (1981), the issue, as in <em>Oxtoby, </em>was whether the patient had suffered a \u201cmedical injury\u201d on or after July 1, 1976, requiring submission of the claim to arbitration. The plaintiff, Blanch-field, asserted that, in March 1976, Dr. Dennis negligently misdiagnosed her as having incurable cancer. From March to April of 1976, she underwent chemotherapy, but the treatment had to be discontinued due to \u201cthe severity of the side effects.\u201d <em>Id., </em>48 Md.App. at 326, 428 A.2d 80. Blanehfield claimed that she sustained physical and mental suffering as a result of the erroneous diagnosis and treatment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">She testified that the chemotherapy caused nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and weakness. She further testified that the treatment caused an uncomfortable dryness of the mouth, nose, and eyes, and that she still suffered from this condition at the time of trial.... Mrs. Blanehfield testified that the diagnosis and treatment had caused her to become extremely nervous and that she had lived for months in a state of severe depression; she stated that she suffered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>from chronic memory loss, an inability to concentrate, \u201chead swims,\u201d and nightmares. A psychiatrist testified that she suffered from \u201canxiety depressive reaction,\u201d that this condition had been caused by the improper diagnosis and treatment, and that she would require some two years of psychotherapy to alleviate her condition. It was also testified, that during the period when she believed her death to be imminent, she broke off her engagement to be married and was forced by the side effects of the chemotherapy to quit her job as a school bus dispatcher. She testified that she had been unable to regain this job and that, as a result, she had lost wages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><em>Id., </em>48 Md.App. at 327-28, 428 A.2d 80. We concluded that Blanchfield had sustained a medical injury prior to July 1, 1976, stating: \u201cBy April 27, 1976 [the last day of her chemotherapy treatments], the harm was done and the medical injuries had occurred.\u201d <em>Dennis, </em>48 Md.App. at 330, 428 A.2d 80. Yet it is clear from the excerpt that we have quoted that Blanchfield had suffered harm, in the form of legally cognizable damages, prior to July 1,1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The case of <em>Jones v. Speed, </em>320 Md. 249, 577 A.2d 64 (1990), is to the same effect. The patient, Jones, claimed that Dr. Speed had negligently failed to diagnose her brain tumor. She \u201csuffered from severe and often debilitating headaches\u201d from 1975 until a brain tumor was discovered and removed in 1986. <em>Id., </em>320 Md. at 254, 577 A.2d 64. She was under the care of Dr. Speed from July 17,1978 until September 16,1985. Although the issue was not contested before the Court, the Court stated that Jones\u2019s claim for the alleged misdiagnosis on July 17, 1978 was barred by limitations. \u201c[I]f one accepts the allegations of the plaintiffs, negligence producing .an \u2018injury\u2019 within the meaning of the statute occurred on 17 July 1978.... Claims for that medical injury are therefore barred by \u00a7 5-109(a)(l).\u201d <em>Id., </em>320 Md. at 255, 577 A.2d 64 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">But <em>Jones, </em>like <em>Russo </em>and <em>Dennis, </em>did not hold that a physician\u2019s negligent act automatically results in immediate \u201cinjury,\u201d even in the absence of legally cognizable damages. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>First, the issue of the definition of \u201cinjury\u201d was not before the Court. Second, Jones <em>did </em>apparently have legally cognizable damages immediately after her misdiagnosis, in the form of pain from her \u201csevere and often debilitating headaches,\u201d that would not have occurred if Dr. Speed\u2019s diagnosis had been correct, as shown by the fact that surgical removal of her tumor in 1986 eliminated her symptoms. <em>Jones </em>is, therefore, also not inconsistent with our view.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Finally, appellees refer to our decision in <em>Johns Hopkins Hospital v. Lehninger, </em>48 Md.App. 549, 429 A.2d 538 (1981). But we did not hold there that an \u201cinjury\u201d automatically occurs immediately upon misdiagnosis. The plaintiff, Lehninger, fractured his hip in a fall in 1971. He filed suit in 1979, claiming that, the day after the fall, the hospital negligently diagnosed his fracture as a bruise, causing him to walk around with \u201cchronic severe pain\u201d for three days before falling again. He also claimed that, after a surgical procedure on the hip in 1973, the hospital negligently assured him that he would not develop a bone condition called \u201cavascular necrosis,\u201d in which the bone deteriorates due to a disruption of the blood supply. Lehninger had no difficulties until he began to experience symptoms of avascular necrosis in 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">The hospital contended that the claim should have been submitted to arbitration. Although the hospital <em>conceded </em>that Lehninger had suffered a \u201cmedical injury\u201d prior to July 1, 1976, it argued that arbitration was required because (1) Lehninger\u2019s claim was <em>filed </em>after July 1, 1976, and (2) the injuries continued to manifest themselves after July 1, 1976. <em>Id., </em>48 Md.App. at 556-57, 429 A.2d 538. Based on the hospital\u2019s concession, the issue of the date when Lehninger\u2019s injury first occurred was not before us. Moreover, we stated that Lehninger had suffered \u201cchronic severe pain\u201d after the alleged misdiagnosis in 1971\u2014pain that would constitute legally cognizable damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">We cannot ignore <em>Newell v. Richards, supra, </em>323 Md. 717, 594 A.2d 1152 (1991), although the parties have not referred to it. There, the Court concluded that the burden of proof with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>respect to limitations in a medical malpractice case is on the health care provider. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-4\">[T]he health care provider ha[s] the burden of pleading and proving that the claimant\u2019s action is time-barred by either of the two statutory provisions. If a health care provider pleads and proves that an action was filed after five years from <em>the alleged negligent act, </em>the action is time-barred. If suit is brought within the five-year limitations period, the action will still be barred if the health care provider pleads and proves that the claim was not brought within three years of the date when \u201cthe injury was discovered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-5\"><em>Id., </em>323 Md. at 728, 594 A.2d 1152 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">While the foregoing statement in <em>Newell </em>could be read to say that the five year limitations period in C.J. \u00a7 5-109(a)(1) runs from the date of the health care provider\u2019s \u201cnegligent act,\u201d the issue of when an \u201cinjury\u201d is committed within the meaning of the statute was not before the Court in <em>Newell. See id., </em>323 Md. at 724-25, 594 A.2d 1152. We do not regard <em>Newell </em>as overruling the principles of <em>Hill </em>and <em>Oxtoby, </em>which make clear that there must be an \u201cinjury\u201d in addition to the \u201cnegligent act\u201d in order for the limitations period in C.J. \u00a7 5\u2014109(a)(1) to begin to run. As we have stated, <em>\u201c[S]tare decisis </em>is ill served if readers hang slavishly on every casual or hurried word as if it had bubbled from the earth at Delphi. <em>Obiter dicta, </em>if noticed at all, should be taken with a large grain of salt.\u201d <em>State v. Wilson, </em>106 Md.App. 24, 39, 664 A.2d 1, <em>cert. denied, </em>340 Md. 502, 667 A.2d 342 (1995), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 116 S.Ct. 2521, 135 L.Ed.2d 1046 (1996). <em>See also St. Mary\u2019s Honor Center v.

For example, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>in C.J. \u00a7 5-108(b), it has provided that no action may be brought against an architect, engineer, or contractor for injuries caused by the defective condition of an improvement to real property if the injury \u201coccurs more than 10 years after the date the entire improvement first became available for its intended use.\u201d We hold only that the Legislature did not express such an intention in this case. The Legislature is, of course, free to amend the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">We emphasize, however, that we are <em>not </em>re-introducing a discovery rule into C.J. \u00a7 5\u2014109(a)(1); the Legislature specifically abolished the discovery rule when it enacted that provision. But, the five year limitations period begins to run from the time of injury; that occurs when the patient sustains legally cognizable damages, even if the damages are hidden, undiscovered, and undiscoverable. <em>See Hill, supra, </em>304 Md. at 700, 501 A.2d 27 (limitation period runs \u201cwithout regard to whether the injury was reasonably discoverable or not\u201d).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">In addition, we reiterate the rule from the preceding case law that the five year period begins to run when injury (or \u201cdamages\u201d) <em>first </em>arises, and not when <em>all </em>damages resulting from the physician\u2019s negligence have arisen. The <em>Hill </em>Court stated that all that is required for an injury to exist \u201cis that the negligent act be coupled with <em>some </em>harm.\u201d <em>Id., </em>304 Md. at 696, 501 A.2d 27 (emphasis supplied). The other cases that we have discussed have also made clear that the date of the injury is the date when the injury first arises, even if all of the resulting damages do not occur until later. <em>See Oxtoby, supra, </em>294 Md. at 97, 447 A.2d 860 (\u201ca medical injury occurs, within the meaning of the effective date clause, even though all of the resulting damage to the patient has not been suffered prior to the Act\u2019s effective date\u201d); <em>Lehninger, supra, </em>48 Md.App. at 556-57, 429 A.2d 538 (Health Care Malpractice Claims Act did not apply, because injury occurred prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>effective date of Act, even though injuries \u201ccontinued to manifest themselves after the Act\u2019s effective date\u201d); <em>Dennis, supra, </em>48 Md.App. at 330, 428 A.2d 80 (\u201cBy April 27,1976, the harm was done and the medical injuries had occurred. That the effects of those injuries continued to be felt by Mrs. Blanchfield thereafter is irrelevant.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">A patient sustains an \u201cinjury\u201d within the meaning of C.J. \u00a7 5-109(a)(l) when, as a result of the tort, he or she first sustains compensable damages that can be proven with reasonable certainty. <em>See Davidson v. Miller, </em>276 Md. 54, 62, 344 A.2d 422 (1975); <em>Straughan v. Tsouvalos, </em>246 Md. 242, 257, 228 A.2d 300 (1967). Therefore, the patient could suffer an \u201cinjury\u201d as a result of a negligent misdiagnosis, when (1) he or she experiences pain or other manifestation of an injury; (2) the disease advances beyond the point where it was at the time of the misdiagnosis and to a point where (a) it can no longer effectively be treated, (b) it cannot be treated as well or as completely as it could have been at the time of the misdiagnosis, or (c) the treatment would entail expense or detrimental side effects that would not likely have occurred had treatment commenced at the earlier time; or (3) the patient dies. This is not, of course, an exhaustive checklist; the overriding inquiry in all cases must be when the patient first sustained legally compensable damages. In any event, the injury occurs, as we have observed, when legally compensable tort damages <em>first </em>occur, regardless of whether those damages are discoverable or undiscoverable.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">In the instant case, the trial judge determined, as a matter of law, that Debra Edmonds suffered an \u201cinjury\u201d at the moment of the alleged misdiagnoses in 1983. Given the posture of a summary judgment proceeding, and in light of the evidence proffered by appellants, the court erred. Dr. Rocereto testified that it was not possible to determine the point between 1983 and 1988 when the cervical cancer spread to other sites in Ms. Edmonds\u2019s body:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Q: Can you tell me if you are able to stage her disease in December of 1984 what stage she was in at that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak3\">A: <em>That\u2019s impossible.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-4\"># * # * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">Q: If we assume that 75 to 85 percent cure ratio in 1983 and zero in 1989, can you tell me what her cure rate would have been in 1984?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-6\">A: Now, are you asking me if it was diagnosed at that time or if she had proper treatment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-7\">Q: Diagnosed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-8\">A: In 1983.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-9\">Q: Diagnosed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-10\">A: <em>I have no records to help me on that so I really can\u2019t tell you where the tumor was at that time.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-11\">Q: Untreated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-12\">A: I still can\u2019t tell you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-13\">Q: You can\u2019t tell me what stage her disease would have been in 1984.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-14\">A: There is\u2014no, I can\u2019t. <em>I can assume it was the same, hadn\u2019t progressed much.

(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-17\">Dr. Roeereto also indicated that this inability stems in part from the nature of cancer:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-18\">Q: There\u2019s no rule you can look at through your experience to work our way backwards from 1989?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUg\">A: No____ [CJancer in one instance may spread rapidly and in other instances may be very slow growing, <em>may lay dormant, </em>so someone that does have a very early stage cancer that\u2019s undetected in one year, five years later may be the same then suddenly a year later has a lot of discomfort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>and advancing cancer. It\u2019s one of those things about cancer we don\u2019t understand completely.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">(Emphasis supplied.) He later testified: \u201c[TJhere obviously was a microscopic tumor present and that tumor may have been spreading all those years as microscopic disease very slowly, <em>it may have been sitting dormant </em>somewhere.\u201d (Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-5\">In addition, Dr. Stanley Burrows testified at his deposition:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">I can only say, certainly at the time she was seen at Georgetown she was incurable. I am suspicious she may have been incurable, or at least have a much lower probability of cure, as early as December \u201984, but I can\u2019t say that with any certainty. Perhaps I am going out on a limb even raising that particular date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">Appellants did not proffer any expert opinion that Ms. Edmonds\u2019s cancer had not spread at any time prior to April 9, 1988 (i.e., the date five years prior to the filing of the claim) or April 11,1985 (i.e., the date five years prior to Ms. Edmonds\u2019s death). But appellees did not advance any evidence, beyond conclusory assertions, to show that Ms. Edmonds\u2019s cancer <em>had </em>advanced during those time periods. Nor do appellees contend that Edmonds suffered any symptoms from the cancer prior to August 1988. Therefore, we conclude that the circuit court erred in ruling, as a matter of law, that appellant\u2019s claims were time-barred under the five year limitations provision in C.J. \u00a7 5-109(a)(l).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">SUMMARY JUDGMENT VACATED.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEES.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">The following twenty-two medical malpractice statutes of limitation include a discoverability clause, but also use the health care provider\u2019s \u201cact\u201d or \u201comission\u201d as a reference point:</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Ala.Code \u00a7 6-5-482 (1983): action must be brought within two years after \u201cact, omission, or failure\u201d or within six months after wrong was discovered or should have been discovered; but in no event more than \u201cfour years after such act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Colo.Rev.Stat.

In no event shall the time for commencement of legal action exceed three years unless tolled for [fraud, intentional concealment, or the presence of an unauthorized foreign body in the patient],</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b277-4\">. At least two California courts have recognized that interpreting the word \u201cinjury\u201d to mean \u201cdiscovered\u201d or \u201cappreciable\u201d harm in Cal.Civ. Proc Code \u00a7 340.5's three year cutoff provision could render the statute\u2019s one year discovery provision meaningless. <em>See Marriage and Family Center v. Superior Court, 228 </em>Cal.App.3d 1647, 1654, <em>279 Cal.</em>Rptr. 475, 480 (1991) (criticizing the <em>Hills </em>interpretation and holding that \u201cdamage is 'manifested' for purposes of commencing the three-year period when it has become evidenced in some significant fashion, whether or not the patient/plaintiff actually becomes aware of the injury\u201d); <em>Bispo v. Burton, </em>82 Cal.App.3d 824, 830, 147 Cal.Rptr. 442, 445 (1978) (\"If one were to simply lift the language from those cases concerning the definition of injury and apply it without analysis to all situations, the result would render the four-year limitation meaningless.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">One California court has attempted to remedy this problem by interpreting \u00a7 340.5 as follows: \"First, the plaintiff must file within one year after she first 'discovers' the injury <em>and the negligent cause </em>of that injury. Secondly, she must file within three years after she first experiences harm from the injury.\u201d <em>Dolan v. Borelli, </em>13 Cal.App.4th 816, 825, 16 Cal.Rptr.2d 714, 718 (1993) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The problems with this interpretation are two-fold. First, it causes the word \u201cinjury\u201d to have two different meanings in the same statute: one meaning being ''injury and the negligent cause,\u201d and the other meaning being \u201charm that is experienced.\u201d <em>Cf. Whack v. State, </em>338 Md. 665, 673, 659 A.2d 1347 (1995) (when identical words are used in the same statute, it is presumed that they have identical meanings, but the presumption is rebutted \"where it is apparent that the words used warrant the conclusion that they were employed in different parts with a different intent\u201d). Second, the one year limitations period in \u00a7 340.5 does not speak of discovery of the injury \"and the negligent cause.\u201d Rather, it only speaks of discovery of the \"injury.\u201d The California court thus added words to the statute that are not there. Such an interpretation would violate settled Maryland principles of statutory construction. <em>See Claggett v. State, </em>108 Md.App. 32, 41, 670 A.2d 1002, <em>cert. denied, </em>342 Md. 330, 675 A.2d 992 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b281-5\">. In addition to California and Delaware, the following states have medical malpractice statutes of limitation that use the patient's \"injury\" as a reference point: Nevada, <em>see </em>Nev.Rev.Stat. Ann. \u00a7 41A.097 (Michie 1996) (action must be commenced not more than \"4 years after the date of injury or 2 years after the plaintiff discovers or through the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered the injury, whichever occurs first\u201d); Montana, <em>see </em>Mont.Code Ann. \u00a7 27-2-205 (1995) (three years after the injury occurs or is discovered, but in no event more than five years \"from the date of injury\u201d); and West Virginia, <em>see </em>W. VaCode \u00a7 55-7B-5 (1994) (two years after date of injury or date when injury should have been discovered, whichever occurs latest, but in no event more than \"ten years after the date of-injury\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b283-8\">. To illustrate, we offer the following examples. If someone throws a snowball at another person fifty yards away and injures that person, the \"injury\u201d occurs not when the perpetrator commits the act of throwing the snowball, but rather when it strikes the other person\u2019s body. Likewise, if someone carelessly leaves dynamite on a city sidewalk, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>negligent \"act\u201d may have occurred, but an \u201cinjury\u201d may not occur until much later, when the dynamite explodes and causes damage to persons or property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b285-7\">. We recognize, as we noted earlier, that the <em>Hill </em>Court, while commenting on the purpose of C.J. \u00a7 5-109, stated: \"The purpose of the statute, readily evident from its terms, was to contain the 'long-tail effect ... by restricting, in absolute terms, the amount of time that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>could lapse between the allegedly negligent treatment of a patient and the filing of a malpractice claim related to that treatment.\u201d <em>Id., </em>304 Md. at 700, 501 A.2d 27. But this statement must be read in context. In two separate instances prior to this statement, the Court explicitly said that the triggering event for the five year period is not the negligent treatment but the \"injury,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>\"the date upon which the allegedly negligent treatment was first coupled with harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the date of the injury is not necessarily the date of the negligent treatment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b288-7\">. We recognize that there will not necessarily be a delay between the health care provider\u2019s negligent act and the resulting injury. We can certainly conceive of cases in which the negligent performance of a medical procedure causes legally cognizable damages immediately.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b288-8\">. The Nevada Supreme Court adopted such a view in <em>Massey v. Litton, 99 </em>Nev. 723, 669 P.2d 248 (1983), when it considered a medical malpractice statute of limitations that is similar to Maryland's. Nev. Rev.Stat. Ann \u00a7 41A.097 (1996) provides, in relevant part: ''[A]n action for injury or death against a provider of health care may not be commenced more than 4 years after <em>the date of injury </em>or 2 years after the plaintiff discovers or through the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered the injury, whichever occurs first....\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) The court construed the word \"injury\u201d in the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>as meaning \" <em>\u2018legal injury,\u2019 i.e., all essential elements of the malpractice cause of action.\u2019\u2019 Id., </em>669 P.2d at 250, 251. (Emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b290-6\">. In addition, it could also be argued that the patient in <em>Oxtoby </em>had a legally cognizable injury, and thus a cause of action in negligence, immediately after the operation. Because a portion of one of the ovaries sought to removed was left in her body, one could argue that she immediately had a cause of action in that she could have had another operation to remove it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b295-6\">. A cause of action in negligence may \"arise\"\u2014in the sense that facts exist to support each element\u2014before the cause of action is discovered or discoverable. <em>See Owens-Illinois v. Armstrong, supra, </em>326 Md. at 121, 604 A.2d 47.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b298-11\">. Appellees do not argue in their briefs that either of appellants' claims were time-barred under the three year \"discovery\u201d period in C.J. \u00a7 5-109(a)(2). Therefore, we shall not consider whether the claims were barred on that ground.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
