The action was for damages arising out of the local\u2019s alleged breach of its duty to use all legal means to assist plaintiff, Leo Gray, to gain employment with North Brothers, Inc., a construction firm engaged in work at Lexington, Kentucky. Article XXI, Section 12, of the Union\u2019s Constitution provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1200-4\">\u201cIt shall be the duty of the Business Agent to investigate all complaints referred to him and act in conjunction with and under the direction of the Executive Board. He shall use all legal means to procure employment for the members of the Local. The Business Agent shall cooperate with the Job Steward in the enforcement of the Code of Workmanship and report to the Local the quality of the work being performed in the application of insulating materials on any and all jobs he visits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1200-5\">Leo Gray was a member of Local 51. He died during the pendency of the action and his widow, Ella Gray, thereafter prosecuted the suit as widow and administratrix of Leo Gray\u2019s estate. The cause was tried and judgment entered in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky at Louisville. The propriety of the amount of the verdict is not in question. As initially filed, the action included claims against North Brothers, Inc., construction contractors, and the International Union. In a previous appeal, we upheld a District Court dismissal of plaintiff\u2019s claims against North Brothers and the International Union, as well as suit against the Local for breach of its <em>statutory </em>duty of fair representation. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a) \u2014 LMRA \u00a7 301. We, nevertheless, remanded the case for trial upon the plaintiff\u2019s claim that the Local breached its <em>contractual </em>duty to assist Leo Gray to obtain employment. Gray v. Internat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Heat &amp; Frost Insulators &amp; Asbestos Workers, Local No. 51, 416 F.2d 313 (6th Cir. 1969). The judgment entered upon such trial is the matter now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-7\">Appellant contends that the District Court erred in overruling its motions for a directed verdict, for judgment n.o. v. and for a new trial; that the District Court erred in its instructions to the jury; that the District Court lacked jurisdiction; that the action is barred by the statute of limitations, and is barred by Gray\u2019s failure to exhaust the union\u2019s grievance procedures. We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-8\">1. Jurisdiction and Statute of Limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-9\">We first dispose of two threshold questions \u2014 jurisdiction and the statute of limitations. Appellant argues that the District Court lost pendent jurisdiction of the cause when we sustained dismissal of the case against North Brothers, the International, and the suit against the Local for alleged breach of Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-10\">In view of the substantial time and energy that had already been expended at the time these claims were dismissed, the District Court clearly had the discretion and power to retain jurisdiction of the pendent state claim. We do not believe his decision to be an abuse of discretion. Rosado v. Wyman, 397 U.S. 397, 404-405, 90 S.Ct. 1207, 25 L.Ed.2d 442 (1970); United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 725-727, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-12\"> Similarly, we find no merit in appellant\u2019s contention that the instant action is barred by Kentucky\u2019s five year statute of limitations governing contracts not in writing. KRS \u00a7 413.-120(1). We hold that the Kentucky fifteen year statute of limitations on written contracts, KRS \u00a7 413.090(2), is applicable here. Contracts that are partly oral and partly in writing, or a written contract so indefinite as to require parole evidence of its terms are generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1121\">*1121</page-number>not \u201ccontracts in writing\u201d within the meaning of the statute. Mills v. McGaffee, 254 S.W.2d 716 (Ky.1953). The contract involved here, however, is made up of the union constitution and its bylaws. These are completely in writing and require only identifying appellee\u2019s deceased husband as a party thereto.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"avf-dedup-0\">\u201cGenerally speaking, where an instrument containing all the terms of a completed contract between two parties is executed by one of the parties and accepted or adopted by the other, the instrument constitutes a contract in writing within the meaning of the statutes of limitations, notwithstanding the fact that the instrument may not be signed by the latter.\u201d Annot., 3 A.L.R.2d 809, 819 (1949).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1201-4\">Gray\u2019s application for union membership and its acceptance, together with the union constitution and bylaws, constitute a written contract. Kentucky courts do not seem to have spoken on this issue, but their decisions indicate they would agree. See Mills v. McGaffee, 254 S.W.2d 716 (Ky.1953); Lyons v. Moise\u2019s Ex\u2019r, 298 Ky. 858, 861, 183 S.W.2d 493 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-5\">2. Motion for Directed Verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-6\">We set out the facts which could be found by the jury. We hold that plaintiff\u2019s proofs thereon justified submission of the case to the jury. Appellee\u2019s deceased husband, Leo Gray, had been a mechanic<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> member of Local 51 since 1927. He and his wife had moved to and were residing in a trailer in Free-port, Texas, while he was employed by Precision Insulation Company. He desired to return to work in Kentucky, allegedly to satisfy eligibility requirements for insurance and pension benefits under the Union\u2019s Health and Welfare Fund Program. He needed to work six more weeks within Local 51\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-7\">Early in 1960 Gray wrote a letter to Herbert Elmore, business agent of Local 51, telling of Gray's desire to return to Kentucky. Elmore replied that there would be jobs coming up at Lexington, Kentucky, in connection with construction of the University of Kentucky Medical Center; that he, Elmore, had heard that North Brothers had the contract; that he would check into it and let Gray know about it. Gray then telehoned El-more and arrangements were made for Gray to come to Lexington with his trailer. He did come about the first of April in anticipation of getting a job at the North Brothers project, although he did not then have a definite promise of such a job. Gray paid his minister $300 to haul the trailer the 1,000 miles from Texas to Lexington. Elmore had told Gray to \u201ctake your trailer to Lexington; that\u2019s the job you will go on.\u201d When he arrived, Gray contacted Elmore by telephone and was told to see a Mr. H. W. Adams, the working foreman on the North Brothers job. Adams was in charge of the hiring, and was also a member of the Knoxville Local of the same International as was defendant, Local 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-12\">On April 19, Gray reported to the construction site and spoke to Adams. Adams told him it would be a week to ten days before he could start. Gray again reported on the job on May 19, and received the same answer. Between April 19 and May 19 and thereafter, Gray spoke to Adams on frequent occasions when Adams would be visiting a friend, William Sisk, who lived in the same trailer park as Gray. Each time Adams put Gray off with the same answer \u2014 it would be a week to ten days.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-13\">Gray learned that Adams\u2019 friend Sisk, whose status in the union was that of an \u201cimprover\u201d \u2014 in the nature of an apprentice \u2014 was employed by North Brothers at a \u201cmechanic\u2019s\u201d wage. He insisted to the business agent, Elmore, and at a union meeting that Sisk\u2019s employment while he, Gray, was denied employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number>violated the bargaining agreement between North Brothers and the Local. Gray was told that he had no ground for his charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-4\">It is appellee\u2019s position that during the period Gray offered himself for employment, North Brothers was in violation of the agreement under which it worked with Local 51 as it pertained to the hiring and employment of the second year improver, William Sisk. Appellee argued that in failing to correct these violations, business agent Elmore and the Local failed to \u201cuse all legal means to procure employment\u201d for Gray, in violation of Art. XXI, Sec. 12, of the Union Constitution, set out above.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s evidence, viewed in its most favorable light, does permit a finding that at the time Gray first applied for work on April 19, 1960, only Sisk, an improver, one W. B. Beasey, a mechanic, and Adams, the working foreman and also a mechanic, were on the job. Appellant\u2019s evidence disputed this factual contention. Sisk, a second year improver, earned the wages of a third year improver during April and mechanic\u2019s wages beginning in May.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-6\">The Union Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Avr\">\u201cSection 8. Improver membership shall be granted in such numbers as to have available a ratio of one Improver to four Mechanics employed in a shop. No Improver shall execute work unless in company with a Mechanic. Im-provers shall under no circumstances be recognized as Mechanics.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1202-7\">With regard to Improvers\u2019 wages, it states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1202-8\">\u201cSection 7. Improvers shall serve a four (4) year period at the craft, and . during such time they will be paid at a maximum of four rates which shall be in the minimum amounts of 50, 60, 70 and 80 per cent of the Mechanic hourly rate for the first, second, third and fourth years respectively, after which they shall be entitled to apply for Mechanic\u2019s examination, which examination shall be conducted by a joint committee of the local and employers. An Improver failing to satisfactorily pass this examination shall not be re-examined within six (6) months.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1202-10\">Article III of the Collective Bargaining Agreement provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1202-11\">\u201cThe ratio of Improvers may equal but not exceed a ratio of one (1) Improver to four (4) Mechanics employed in a shop. No Improver shall execute work unless in company with a Mechanic.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1202-12\">Article VIII then provides the wage scale for Improvers and Mechanics which corresponds with the percentage rates designated in the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-13\">It was plaintiff\u2019s position that the Union\u2019s Constitution was violated when employee Sisk, whose status was that of an \u201cImprover,\u201d was hired and plaintiff Gray was denied employment. There was evidence that the Local and its business agent knew this but failed to press for vindication of Gray\u2019s right to employment. Opposing witnesses testified as to the meaning of the Constitution\u2019s provisions relevant to such subject. It is not contended that it was improper to receive evidence as to the Constitution\u2019s meaning, and the Court properly submitted the question for the jury\u2019s resolution. Sherman &amp; Sons v. United Clothing Stores, 214 Ky. 526, 527, 283 S.W. 1022 (1926). The jury found that a job was open for a mechanic under the 1-4 ratio during the period Gray offered himself for employment. This was in answer to one of several interrogatories presented to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-14\">Even though Adams, as the hiring agent for North Brothers, may have been in violation of the Union\u2019s Constitution in the employment of Sisk, the \u201cimprover,\u201d correction would not necessarily have resulted in employment of plaintiff Gray. There were many other members of Local 51 with the same qualifications as Gray \u2014 \u201cmechanics\u201d\u2014 who were unemployed at the time. But Gray\u2019s position is that Local 51 and its business agent were required to demand a correction of North Brothers\u2019 fault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1123\">*1123</page-number>and under the total circumstances, to press for Gray getting the job then made available. Adams, the hiring foreman, gave as a reason for not hiring Gray his belief that the latter\u2019s physical condition would forbid his performing the job. No such reason was given to Gray who insisted that he had the needed physical ability, as well as being otherwise qualified as a \u201cmechanic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-5\">Critical issues of fact were framed by the conflicting evidence. We have set out the facts which the jury could have found from the evidence presented. We deal with denial of defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict. It is familiar law that in testing such a motion the evidence and all inferences that may be legitimately drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Patterson v. Pennsylvania R. R. Co., 288 F.2d 645, 646 (6th Cir. 1956); Sutton v. Combs, 419 S.W.2d 775, 777 (Ky.1967). Applying that test, we consider that it was proper to submit the question of Appellant\u2019s breach of contract to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-6\">3. The District Judge\u2019s Instructions. Appellant asserts that it was error for the District Judge to instruct the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1203-7\">\u201cI instruct you that under the law the employment of Union members at the Chandler Medical Center was a matter within the sole judgment of the employer North Brothers. By this, I mean North Brothers did not have to give Mr. Gray a job provided that North Brothers was at the time required by the contract, following in its employment practices its contract with Local 51 as to the four to one ratio and the proper working of Mr. Gray and if North Brothers did violate its employment contract with Local 51 with respect to the ratio or the manner in which it worked Mr. Sisk then it was the law that it was the duty of Local 51 as the representative of Mr. Gray as one of its members, to use all legal means available to it to correct said contract violation by North Brothers, if you find any such violation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AO9\">While more precise language would have improved it, we do not find reversible error in the giving of this instruction. North Brothers did not have to hire Gray; but if North Brothers was in violation of the contract, it became the legal duty of the union, as a representative of Gray, to correct it. The action is not against North Brothers for failure to hire Gray, but against the union for the failure to exercise its legal duty in that it did not in good faith pursue the alleged violations. The union makes much of the fact that Elmore on one occasion before Gray arrived in Lexington did approach Adams and request that he consider Gray. The evidence also shows that once Gray was rejected and complained of violations, no action was taken. During all of the relevant period, Elmore visited North Brothers\u2019 job site two or three times a week specifically to check on possible contract violations. But, except for an initial proposal to Adams to hire Gray, he did nothing further toward helping him. He testified,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1203-9\">\u201cLeo [Gray] took the ball and he went on with it. So I just washed my hands of the whole affair. I mean, once he did his own, tried to secure his own employment, if he couldn\u2019t get it, I sure couldn\u2019t have got him a job with them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1203-10\">4. Failure to employ grievance procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-11\">Appellant also argues that there, is no evidence that Gray, as required, pursued his internal union remedies or was thwarted in doing so by the union. It is the general rule of Kentucky, as well as federal labor policy, that an individual member of a labor union asserting a contractual grievance against the union must in good faith attempt to exhaust the internal grievance procedure established by the constitution sued upon. Branham v. Benevolent &amp; Protective Order of Elks, Lodge No. 942, 427 S.W.2d 572 (Ky.1968); Braddom v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1124\">*1124</page-number>Three Point Coal Corp., 288 Ky. 734, 741, 157 S.W.2d 349 (1941); Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Williams, 211 Ky. 638, 644-645, 277 S.W. 500 (1925); See Vaca v. Sipes, 386 U.S. 171, 87 S.Ct. 903, 17 L.Ed.2d 842 (1967); Republic Steel Corp. v. Maddox, 379 U.S. 650, 85 S.Ct. 614, 13 L.Ed.2d 580 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-4\">Pursuant to submitted interrogatories, the jury found that Gray had in good faith pursued his internal grievance remedies. Appellee\u2019s evidence presented a clear issue of fact upon the point. Although it does not appear that Gray ever technically presented formal written charges to the local, he personally confronted Elmore and the local president at a monthly union meeting and was told he had no grounds to press charges. Thereafter, upon his return to Texas, through letters to the local and to the International Union, he pressed his grievance, requesting it be brought before the local and the International Joint Executive Board. Though receipt of these letters is acknowledged, no action was taken. Viewed in its most favorable light, we cannot say that the jury could not reasonably infer from the evidence that Gray had in good faith pursued his union remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1201-8\">. The Local\u2019s constitution provides for two types of membership: <em>mechanics, </em>who are skilled insulators, and <em>improv-ers, </em>who remain apprentices for 4 years before making application for standing as a mechanic.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
