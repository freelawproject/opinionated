W. \u201cCooter\u201d Smith and (overt act 3) the possession by Clifton at his home in Weaver, Alabama, of four stolen shotguns on October 21, 1969, said guns having previously been stolen from Agee Salvo in Anniston, Alabama. Clifton\u2019s commission of these overt acts was proved primarily by Salvo and Smith, and corroborated by the officer who recovered four guns from Clifton\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-21\">By pre-trial motion to strike from the indictment, by motions to exclude and by objections to the testimony going to proof of their commission, and by motions for mistrial, Clifton preserved for our review the question of whether or not prejudicial error was committed by the trial court in allowing this testimony to be considered by the jury. Indeed, this is the sole question presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"A2A\">Upon at least two theories we conclude that the conviction must stand. First, the evidence at trial was such that it was proper for the jury to consider whether or not Clifton and persons unknown were acting in furtherance of an existing conspiracy when overt acts 1 and 3 were committed and that Rhodes and Heafner shortly thereafter became members of this existing conspiracy. The testimony would then be clearly competent proof as to Clifton\u2019s guilt.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Additionally, if the jury rejected this theory and decided that no conspiracy existed before the first contacts between Clifton, Rhodes and Heafner about October 18, 1969, proof of the commission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>similar and clearly related offenses by Clifton earlier that month was clearly admissible as going to establish Clifton\u2019s intent which was a requisite element of proof under each of the three counts being tried.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1052-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1051-12\">. Count One alleged violation of Title 18, U.S.C., Section 371, by charging defendants, Rhodes and Heafner, and other persons to the grand jury unknown with conspiring, between on or about October 1, 1969, and on or about December 12, 1969, to transport and ship stolen firearms in interstate commerce with knowledge of their being stolen in violation of Title 18, U.S.C., Section 922 (i). Fifteen overt acts were alleged as committed to carry out the purpose of the conspiracy. Count Two was a substantive count charging Clifton, Rhodes and Heafner, aided and abetted by each other, with transporting certain described stolen firearms in interstate commerce, in violation of Title 18, U.S.C., Sections 922 (i) and 924. Count Three charged Clifton alone with violation of Sections 922 (i) and 924 by the transportation interstate of a described stolen shotgun.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1051-24\">.
