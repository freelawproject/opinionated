The appeal primarily is based upon this incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-19\">The trial was of short duration (three hours).. Two government witnesses testified as to payments made to Vega, a third told of an admission by Vega that he had received money to play records. The perjury count was based upon Vega\u2019s denial under oath before the Federal Communications Commission in June 1966 of having received any money.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-20\">After the case had been submitted to the jury and after some two hours of deliberation, the jury sent to the Court a message reading, \u201cSorry. It seems that we cannot come to an agreement. Foreman\u201d (Court Exh. 1). It being late Friday afternoon, the Court excused the jury until Monday morning. At the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>opening of Court on Monday, defense counsel, anticipating that the Court would give the so-called <em>Allen </em>charge, said, \u201cI believe the <em>Allen </em>charge would be a great disservice to the possible defense here.\u201d The Court did not agree and stated, \u201cWe would only impanel another jury forthwith.\u201d To the charge as proposed defense counsel said, \u201cI have no objection to that charge, if your Honor please, none whatsoever.\u201d The additional charge was not productive of a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">At noon a second note was received, reading, \u201cYour Honor. Sorry to say that we cannot come to a definite decision. We have stopped deliberating as we cannot come to a final decision. Foreman\u201d (Court Exh. 2). The Court again urged the jury to reach a decision at which point Juror number 12 attempted to address the Court but was told that any communication should be by note. A few minutes later a third note was received, reading, \u201cYour Honor. I am the primary hold-out. I cannot change my opinion in good conscience and feel that to do so under pressure would violate my oath as a juror. I respectfully request that the jury be dismissed. Ralph Hoag.\u201d The Court read the message to counsel and said, \u201cYou have one guy holding out. I don\u2019t know which way he is. Do you want to accept a jury verdict of 11. I don\u2019t know which way they stand.\u201d Then followed colloquy between Court and defense counsel, critical to this appeal. When defense counsel, who was both experienced and skilled in the strategy of the courtroom asked for and was granted time to discuss the matter with his client, the Court pointed out that there might be other holdouts and asked whether the defendant might take a 10 to 2 verdict, to which defense counsel replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-5\">\u201cMr. Solomon: My feeling very bluntly, as an old hand, Judge, is that some of the others are definitely, to my mind, more simp\u00e1tico to defendants, so I don\u2019t think that I want to\u2014 I will ask the defendant, but I don\u2019t think I want to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-8\">\u201cThe Court: It is your choice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ajh-dedup-0\">After a conference with defendant and his wife, counsel advised the Court \u201cWe will only accept a unanimous verdict.\u201d The defendant then talked with his wife, after which the following colloquy occurred :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-9\">\u201cThe Court: Take a verdict of ten jurors, agreement of ten?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-10\">\u201cMr. Solomon: 11. If he says T am holding out.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-11\">\u201cThe Court: He says T am the primary one.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-12\">\u201cMr. Solomon: Let\u2019s see if we can get a jury of 11.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-13\">\u201cThe Court: Will you take that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-14\">\u201cMr. Solomon: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-15\">\u201cThe Court: Is that agreeable?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-16\">\u201cMr. Solomon [apparently addressing the defendant]: Would that be agreeable to you? I suggest you do it. You are not going to get a better trial. I am telling you right now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-17\">(Pause.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-18\">\u201cMr. Solomon: Yes, 11, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-19\">\u201cThe Court: All right, bring the jury back. I will dismiss this one juror and tell the others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-20\">\u201cMr. Solomon: Right, absolutely and we will gamble on the rest. Absolutely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-22\">\u201cThe Court: All right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-23\">Mr. Hoag was thereupon excused and the jury of 11 continued its deliberations. Another note<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was then received from a juror but before any action was taken on it, a verdict was reached. Defense counsel said, \u201cI understand that you are to disregard the note. They have a verdict.\u201d A discussion at the bench and off the record ensued after which the Court addressed the jury. \u201cThe Court: I understand you have asked me to disregard the note that was sent earlier. Is that correct?\u201d \u201cThe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>Foreman: That is correct.\u201d No objection was taken by defense counsel to proceeding and the Foreman announced the verdict of guilty on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The conclusions to be derived from this record are clear beyond peradventure. The defendant was represented by competent counsel. Counsel during the selection of the jury and during the trial had an opportunity to select and appraise the jurors selected as best qualified to react favorably to the cause of his client. When the \u201choldout\u201d crisis arose, the Court gave counsel every opportunity to exercise his courtroom judgment as to further proceedings. Counsel conferred with the defendant and the defendant with his wife. Counsel was unwilling to accept less than a unanimous verdict but definitely was willing to accept a jury of 11. And, as measured against some other jury on a second trial, it was obviously his considered judgment that in courtroom parlance the jury \u201clooked good\u201d to him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Now on appeal the defendant argues that he had a statutory and constitutional right to a unanimous verdict which could not be waived and charges the Court with error in accepting what he now describes as a \u201cnon-unanimous verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">The many cases and law review articles cited upon the subject of \u201cWaiver of Jury Unanimity\u201d are not applicable to the facts here presented. The defendant here did not waive (his counsel clearly refused to waive) his right to a unanimous verdict. He did have a unanimous verdict. His waiver, knowingly and advisedly given, was of his right to a jury of 12. Both Rule 23(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and Rule 48 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure give to the parties the right to stipulate to a jury of less than 12, at any time before verdict. For this Court to hold otherwise would be to deprive a defendant of the opportunity to follow the advice of counsel of his own choice in making a critical decision. Defendant and his counsel probably believed that he was going to obtain a favorable decision from that particular jury and upon his agreed-upon jury of 11 he was willing to \u201cgamble.\u201d No statutory or constitutional error can be found in his exercise of these rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-12\">In retrospect the defendant now believes that he was coerced into his waiver. Again the many other cases cited to support the requirement of knowing and voluntary waiver are inapplicable. Our decision must depend upon the facts of <em>this </em>case. The defendant\u2019s claim of coercion is based upon \u201cthe threat of the trial judge to re-try this case immediately.\u201d Counsel now says that \u201cIt is clear that a consideration of defense counsel in recommending a non-unanimous verdict was the threat by the trial judge to re-try this case immediately\u201d (Applt\u2019s Br. p. 21). But counsel\u2019s position was quite positive that \u201cWe will only accept a unanimous verdict\u201d and equally positive that he was willing to accept a jury of 11. The fact, now asserted, that the defendant was not \u201csophisticated in criminal procedure\u201d is scarcely a persuasive argument. Because of this very fact defendants usually retain, as here, skilled counsel to protect their rights. Strong argument should be made by appellants but it should not be distorted. Nothing in the record supports the statement that the trial judge \u201ctwice suggested less than a unanimous verdict upon penalty of an immediate re-trial.\u201d The right to make a motion within seven days in the event that the jury is discharged without having returned a verdict, Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(c), did not arise. There was no \u201chung\u201d jury. Had the jury been discharged without reaching a verdict <em>and </em>had the trial judge started a new trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>within less than seven days <em>and </em>had objection thereto been made by defense counsel, a different situation might have arisen. But this state of facts is entirely hypothetical. Rule 29(c) provides that the motion for judgment of acquittal <em>may </em>be made \u201cwithin 7 days\u201d or \u201cwithin such further time as the court may fix during the 7-day period.\u201d Had the trial judge abused his discretion, this would have been a proper appellate point but, in a case of such brief duration with no legal or factual problems of a complex character, it was logical for the Court, while the witnesses were available and counsel prepared, to endeavor to dispose of the case. This can hardly be called coercion.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">Despite the Court\u2019s expressed desire for speed, there is ample proof in the record that defense counsel, in the interest of his client and in the exercise of his experienced judgment, elected with his client\u2019s consent to proceed with the jury he had selected and faced during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Lastly appellant\u2019s claim of error in refusing to postpone the trial because of the government\u2019s tardy filing of its bill of particulars does not constitute a ground for reversal. The revelation of Maestre and Orta as the payors of \u201cpayola\u201d to Vega was not a surprise to Vega or his counsel. Maestre was named in the first count of the indictment. Furthermore, defense counsel knew that Vega was the person to whom it was asserted that Orta had made payments, first because counsel recognized that naming Baez as the recipient \u201cwas a typographical error on the government\u2019s part\u201d and second, because Orta\u2019s 3500 material which related to Vega had been given to counsel on a prior trial. No prejudice to Vega resulted from the delay in delivery of the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Vega does not question the conviction on the perjury count on the merits. The same claim of error with respect to the jury would apply and for the reasons previously stated is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b780-25\">. \u201cI am under the same opinion. May I be excused? Barbara Schulz.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b781-8\">. The defendant and his counsel were apparently aware of the fact that of three others, indicted and tried on similar \"\u201cpayola\u201d charges, two had been acquitted and one convicted, and that upon a retrial the Government would probably call an additional witness then en route from Florida (Tr. pp. 5-6).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
