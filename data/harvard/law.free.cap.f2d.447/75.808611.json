(St. Paul) was not liable to National Union Fire Insurance Co. (National Union) in a controversy involving coverage of their respective automobile liability policies. Jurisdiction below rested on diversity of citizenship, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. The appeal is before us as one from a final judgment, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Mrs. Dorothy Daly was involved in an accident while she was driving an automobile with her husband\u2019s consent which had been leased by him from ORMCO Leasing Corporation (ORMCO), a company engaged in the business of leasing motor vehicles. Mrs. Daly\u2019s husband was insured by National Union under a General Automobile Comprehensive Liability Policy. ORMCO was insured by St. Paul under a Multiple Coverage Policy. As a result of the accident, a suit for personal injuries was instituted by two third parties against the Dalys. National Union defended the suit and settled it for $35,000 with costs of $3,-680. This action was filed by National Union to recoup its loss from St. Paul.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">ORMCO leased the automobile, a 1964 Cadillac four-door sedan to Robert R. Daly, d. b. a. Slip Form Power Co., for a term of two years. The lease was a comprehensive printed \u201cMotor Vehicle Lease Agreement\u201d giving the lessee exclusive possession of the motor vehicle during the period conditioned upon a number of mutual covenants. Number eight provided that Daly should at his own expense secure and maintain standard automobile insurance policies providing public liability coverage as well as insurance against property damage and fire, theft and comprehensive coverage for the full value of the vehicle. It further required Daly before taking possession to furnish ORMCO with a Certificate of Insurance evidencing compliance with the insurance provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-12\">Daly did obtain a General Automobile Comprehensive Liability Policy from National Union which provided the coverage required by the lease agreement and furnished ORMCO with a Certificate of Insurance which so stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-13\">The basis of National Union\u2019s claim against St. Paul was that under Arizona Revised Statutes \u00a7 28-324 an owner engaged in the business of renting motor vehicles without a driver is required to procure public liability insurance with an insurance company approved by the state insurance department insuring the <em>renter </em>against liability and property damage arising from his negligent operation in the amount of $5,000-10,000 for public liability and $1,000 for property damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-14\">Appellant also asserts that because ORMCO is the legal owner of the vehicle, it falls within the provisions of Arizona Revised Statutes \u00a7 28-1170 which is a part of the Arizona Safety Responsibility Act. This section defines an \u201cowner\u2019s policy\u201d under that Act and requires that such a policy must contain as one of its provisions an omnibus clause which extends the policy coverage to any person driving the automobile with the owner\u2019s express or implied consent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>pellant then relies heavily upon the decisions of the Arizona Supreme Court which hold that any attempt by the insurer to restrict or limit the application of the statutory omnibus clause is invalid and void. Rocky Mountain Fire Casualty Co. v. Allstate Insurance Co., 485 P.2d 552 (May 27, 1971, Arizona Supreme Court) ; Universal Underwriters Insurance Co. v. Dairyland Mutual Insurance Co., 102 Ariz. 518, 433 P.2d 966 (1967); Dairyland Mutual Insurance Co. v. Andersen, 102 Ariz. 515, 433 P.2d 963 (1967); Jenkins v. Mayflower Insurance Exchange, 93 Ariz. 287, 380 P.2d 145 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">On the basis of that law National Union then relates its contentions to the facts of this case. ORMCO is in the business of renting automobiles and it therefore comes within Arizona Revised Statutes \u00a7 28-324 and must procure a policy insuring the renter; in addition, it argues that since ORMCO is also the owner of the legal title it must provide an owner\u2019s policy under the Safety Re-sponsbility Act, and that this policy which is the St. Paul policy must contain the statutory omnibus clause under Section 28-1170, <em>swpra, </em>extending the St. Paul coverage to Daly. Thus, urges appellant, ORMCO is required to furnish coverage under two different statutory provisions, Arizona Revised Statutes \u00a7 28-324 and Arizona Revised Statutes \u00a7 28-1170. Since it did this by procuring two policies, the interpretation of the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses in each results in imposing primary liability on ORMCO\u2019s St. Paul policy and relieving National Union of all liability because its coverage is only excess.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The appellee, St. Paul, contends that the policy which National Union wrote to cover Daly\u2019s liability was an \u201cowner\u2019s policy of liability insurance\u201d within the provisions of Arizona Revised Statutes \u00a7 28-1170, because a lessee under a lease arrangement similar to this can be \u201cdeemed to be an owner\u201d for purposes of insurance coverage. Travelers Insurance Co. v. McElroy, 359 F.2d 529, 533 (9th Cir. 1966). As an additional argument it contends that the Arizona Safety Responsibility Act is inapplicable because it does not purport to determine a question such as exists here where the owner-lessor required the procurement of independent insurance coverage by the lessee-operator under the terms of a formal written lease agreement. The district court decided the question in favor of the appellee, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">In order for appellant to construe the policy provisions of the St. Paul policy covering ORMCO and the National Union policy covering lessee Daly in such a way as to say that the St. Paul coverage is primary and National Union is excess only, it is first necessary to show that both policies cover the same risk, i. e., lessee Daly. Then the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses of each policy come into play and the game of policy semantics begins. The first step to this end is to urge that ORMCO is an \u201cowner\u201d and therefore ORMCO must obtain an \u201cowner\u2019s policy\u201d and that owner\u2019s policy under Arizona Revised Statutes \u00a7 28-1170 must contain a statutory omnibus clause (\u00a7 28-1170, subsec. B, par. 2, as amended) extending the policy coverage to any person using the motor vehicle with the express or implied permission of the named insured. The named insured in this owner\u2019s policy is ORMCO and Daly is a permissive user by virtue of the lease agreement. Thus ORMCO\u2019s St. Paul policy must cover Daly. If ORMCO is subject to Arizona Revised Statutes \u00a7 28-1170, the first step has been completed and the legal consequences of the impressive array of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Arizona decisions interpreting that section follow, since this is a diversity case and this court will follow state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">Here ORMCO is a particular kind of owner for whom the Arizona Legislature has enacted express requirements for doing business. ORMCO is an owner \u201cengaged in the business of renting\u201d motor vehicles without drivers and is governed by Arizona Revised Statutes \u00a7 28-324.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This section states that such an owner must procure public liability insurance with certain limits (which at the date of this occurrence appeared to be different than the \u00a7 28-1170 limits) and with specified provisions. It provides in subsection B certain liabilities for failure to comply which appear to differ considerably from those in the Safety Responsibility Act. Subsection C has its own omnibus provision which appears to be as comprehensive as to renters as Section 28-1170 does as to owners. The entire section is a part of the Motor Vehicle Registration section as Chapter 3 of the Title, \u201cMotor Vehicles,\u201d while the \u201cUniform Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act,\u201d which contains Section 28-1170, as amended, is in Chapter 7 of the Title. Although Section 28-324 is consistent with the basic public policy described in Jenkins v. Mayflower Insurance Exchange, <em>supra, </em>\u201cto provide protection for the public using the highways from financial hardship which may result from the use of automobiles by financially irresponsible persons,\u201d it is not a part of the Safety Responsibility Act and contrariwise, Section 28-1170, as amended does not control ORMCO as an owner <em>\u201cengaged in the business of renting\u201d </em>under Section 28-324.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-13\">The significance of all of this is that neither section <em>requires </em>ORMCO to have a policy of automobile liability insurance with an omnibus provision extending its coverage to Daly for his rental car. Nor have we found any decisions of the Supreme Court of Arizona which so decide. Section 28-324 does <em>require </em>ORMCO to see to it that the renter is covered by automobile liability insurance as the section describes. Conceivably ORMCO <em>could </em>have done this by causing such a provision to be included in its own policy; it could have done it by procuring an independent policy and either holding the policy or delivering it to Daly; it could pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>sibly have done it in other ways. It did in this ease procure it by the provision in the rental agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">We then turn to ORMCO\u2019s policy with St. Paul to determine whether the policy itself extends coverage to Daly. Again we find that it does not. An examination of the policy discloses that there is a particular insuring agreement covering automobiles leased to others. It protects ORMCO only if that company\u2019s liability under \u00a7 28-324 is not covered by specific insurance on the leased vehicle because of errors or omissions or by invalid or insufficient insurance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> None of these contingencies exists in this case. Hence the St. Paul policy does not extend coverage either by statute, decision or policy provisions, to Daly. That being so, there is no \u201cother insurance\u201d in existence on this record to which National Union can look to make its own coverage participating, pro-rata or excess. It has the entire responsibility which from the facts appears to have been the intention of all of the parties from the beginning.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Nor do we see our decision here as being in conflict with Travelers Insurance Co. v. McElroy, 359 F.2d 529 (9th Cir. 1966). In that case Travelers issued its policy of automobile liability insurance to the lessee of a truck. The policy provided coverage for all owned automobiles and also to all \u201chired\u201d automobiles (as was the case of the lessee of this particular vehicle) except that the policy attempted to engraft a limitation on the coverage by providing that the hired automobile provision applied only if the vehicle was being used exclusively in the business of the insured. It was asserted as a defense by the insurer that the vehicle was not being used exclusively in the business of the lessee and thus the policy limitation applied. Following <em>Jenkins, supra, </em>the court declined <em>to </em>enforce the attempted limitation. The fact situation in Travelers would be the same if National Union were called upon to pay the judgment here as the only company whose policy could apply and National Union would defend upon the ground that the automobile was not being used for a business purpose when being operated by Mrs. Daly. In <em>Travelers </em>there was no claim against any policy of the lessor as there was in the case now before the court, and thus no problem of interpreting the \u201cother insurance\u201d clause or of deciding which of two policies was primary and which was secondary.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">The Travelers policy clearly applied to provide coverage to the lessee and there was no attempt to resort to Section 28-324 to write into the policy a provision applying to a lessor. The only problem was whether an attempted policy limitation or exclusion in the lessee\u2019s policy prevented the application of the coverage to the facts of this risk. The application of Section 28-324 was not raised. Neither was the inapplicability of Section 28-1170 to one who was engaged in the business of renting automobiles, because the lessor and his policy was not before the court as was ORMCO here.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b156-9\">. \u201cA.
