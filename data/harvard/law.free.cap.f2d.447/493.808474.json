He was sentenced to twenty years under the (a) count and to twenty-five years under the (d) count, to run concurrently. On and remanded for the District Court to appeal, we vacated the two sentences enter a single sentence. United States v. White, 5 Cir., 1971, 436 F.2d 1380.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-16\">On remand, appellant was resentenced to twenty-five years imprisonment on the conviction under \u00a7 2113(d). The sentence on the conviction under \u00a7 2113 (a) was vacated. See Eakes v. United States, 5 Cir., 1968, 391 F.2d 287. The present appeal is from the judgment re-sentencing appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-17\">Appellant argues that the district court committed error in failing to require a new jury trial, rather than merely resentencing him as stated. This contention is without merit. In fact, it was specifically rejected in United States v. White, 5 Cir., 1971, 440 F.2d 978.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-18\">Appellant also urges that his sentence was too harsh and that we should modify it. In Zaffarano v. Blackwell, 5 Cir., 1967, 383 F.2d 719, 721, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-19\">\u201cThis Court is without power to modify a sentence which was legally imposed and within the bounds prescribed by statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-20\">Thus this contention is also without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
