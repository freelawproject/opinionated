The specific conclusions of the District Court that such seizures without a prior adversary hearing were constitutionally invalid and that the films must be returned are in accord with the subsequent decision of this court in Demich, Inc. v. Ferdon, 426 F.2d 643 (9th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1484-15\">The Supreme Court has since remanded <em>Demich </em>to us for reconsideration in light of its decision in Perez v. Ledesma, 401 U.S. 82, 91 S.Ct. 674, 27 L.Ed.2d 701 (1971). Ferdon v. Demich, Inc., 401 U.S. 990, 91 S.Ct. 1223, 28 L.Ed.2d 528 (1971). We, in turn, remanded <em>Demich </em>to the District Court feeling it appropriate under the circumstances that that court should be allowed the opportunity for reconsideration in the first instance. Demich, Inc. v. Ferdon, 443 F.2d 1359 (9th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1484-17\">In our judgment the same course should be followed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1484-18\">Remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
