United States, 401 U.S. 667, 91 S.Ct. 1160, 28 L.Ed.2d 404, on April 5, 1971. Counsel have filed new briefs with us explaining their differing interpretations of those differing views.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-23\">Frank Zizzo was convicted in 1963 of traveling in interstate commerce with intent to carry on a business enterprise involving gambling illegal under the laws of Indiana. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952. In the course of his original trial and over his objection federal wagering tax forms signed and filed by him as required by law (26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4401, 4411 and 4412) were introduced into evidence. That conviction was affirmed by this court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>United States v. Zizzo, 338 <em>F.2d 577 </em>(7th Cir. 1964). Zizzo subsequently filed a motion, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and other post conviction relief provisions, seeking to vacate the prior imposed sentence and judgment of conviction. In that post conviction petition, Zizzo relied on the opinions of the Supreme Court in Marchetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 39, 88 S.Ct. 697, 19 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968); and Grosso v. United States, 390 U.S. 62, 88 S.Ct. 709, 19 L. Ed.2d 906 (1968), which held that the Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination was a valid defense to a prosecution for failure to register as a gambler and to pay the related occupational and gambling excise taxes under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4401, 4411 and 4412. Essentially Zizzo argued that under the reasoning of the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Marchetti </em>and <em>Grosso </em>the introduction into evidence of his gambling tax returns violated his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. He also argued that those decisions should be applied retroactively thus requiring that his original conviction be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">We agreed with these contentions and vacated the judgment of conviction. Zizzo v. United States, 431 F.2d 913 (7th Cir. 1970). In reaching our conclusion that the <em>Marchetti </em>and <em>Grosso </em>decisions should be applied retroactively to <em>Zizzo\u2019s </em>case, we noted that the Supreme Court had not yet ruled on the question, and that the issue was then before the Court in certain cases awaiting argument, particularly United States v. United States Coin and Currency, 401 U.S. 715, 91 S.Ct. 1041, 28 L.Ed.2d 434 and Mackey v. United States. Those cases were both decided on April 5, 1971. This cause, then pending on the government\u2019s petition for <em>certiorari, </em>was remanded for reconsideration in light of <em>Mackey.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">Upon remand we have so reconsidered our decision and determine, contrary to our prior opinion, that the <em>Marchetti </em>and <em>Grosso </em>decisions should not be applied retroactively to void Zizzo\u2019s original conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">The <em>Mackey </em>case also originated in this Circuit pursuant to a motion to vacate a judgment of conviction. See 411 F.2d 504. Mackey was convicted of income tax evasion. His prosecution proceeded upon a net worth theory, under which the government was required to prove a likely source giving rise to the unreported income. The probable source of Mackey\u2019s unreported income was gambling. To prove this source the government offered into evidence numerous wagering tax returns filed by Mackey during the years in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">Mackey\u2019s theory, similar to Zizzo\u2019s, was that the Fifth Amendment barred the prosecution\u2019s use of the wagering tax forms. This theory was rejected by both the district court and this court. The Supreme Court affirmed, holding that <em>Marchetti </em>and <em>Grosso </em>should not be applied retroactively to vacate the conviction in that case. The prevailing opinion was written by Mr. Justice White who was joined by the Chief Justice and Justices Stewart and Blackmun. That opinion clearly calls for a similar denial of post conviction relief in this case. The following observations from that opinion are particularly applicable.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"afs-dedup-0\">\u201cThere is no indication in <em>Marchetti </em>or <em>Grosso </em>that one of the considerations which moved the Court to hold that the Congress could <em>not </em>constitutionally compel citizens to register as gamblers and file related tax returns was the probable unreliability of such statements once given. Petitioner has not advanced any objective considerations suggesting such unreliability. The wagering tax returns introduced in evidence at his trial have none of the characteristics, and hence none of the potential unreliability, of coerced confessions produced by \u2018overt and obvious coercion.\u2019 Johnson [v. New Jersey], 384 U.S. [719], at 730, 86 S.Ct. [1772], at 1779 [16 L.Ed.2d 882]. Nor does Mackey suggest that his returns \u2014 made under oath \u2014 were inac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>curate in any respect. Thus, a gambling excise tax return, like physical evidence seized in violation of a new interpretation of the Fourth Amendment, is concededly relevant and probative even though obtained by the Government through means since defined by this Court as constitutionally objectionable. As in <em>Desist </em>[Desist v. United States, 394 U.S. 244, 89 S.Ct. 1030, 22 L.Ed.2d 248], <em>Elkanich </em>[Elk-anich v. United States, 401 U.S. 646, 91 S.Ct. 1148, 28 L.Ed.2d 388], and <em>Williams </em>[Williams v. United States, 401 U.S. 646, 91 S.Ct. 1148, 28 L.Ed. 2d 388], the result here should be that a <em>pre-Marchetti </em>trial in which the Government employed such evidence is not set aside through retroactive application of the new constitutional principle.\u201d (401 U.S. at 674-675, 91 S.Ct. at 1164).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">Even more persuasive is Mr. Justice White\u2019s dissenting opinion in United States v. United States Coin and Currency, 401 U.S. 715, 91 S.Ct. 1041, 28 L. Ed.2d 434, again joined in by the Chief Justice and Justices Stewart and Black-mun. In proposing a hypothetical tailor made to our case, Justice White states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARP\">\u201cHad Angelini registered and paid the federal tax and then been tried prior to <em>Marchetti-Grosso </em>for violating federal interstate gambling laws or state laws making gambling a crime, the admissions contained in his registration and gambling tax returns would have been relevant and presumptively reliable evidence of guilt, properly admissible under <em>Kahriger </em>[United States v. Kahriger, 345 U.S. 22, 73 S.Ct. 510, 97 L.Ed. 754] and <em>Lewis </em>[Lewis v. United States, 348 U.S. 419, 75 S.Ct. 415, 99 L.Ed. 475]. And if after <em>Marchetti-Grosso, </em>Angelini had complained about the use of this evidence, Tehan v. United States ex rel. Shott, 382 U.S. 406, 86 S.Ct. 459, 15 L.Ed.2d 453 (1966), and Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 732, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 1780, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 (1966), would surely dictate denial of relief whether Angelini came here on direct review of his conviction or from denial of collateral relief.\u201d (401 U.S. at 733, 91 S.Ct. at 1051).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b939-8\">On the other hand, Justices Black and Douglas who dissented in <em>Mackey </em>would clearly affirm our decision giving <em>Mar-chetti </em>and <em>Grosso </em>broader retroactive sweep. Justices Brennan and Marshall voted with the majority in <em>Mackey, </em>but would apparently distinguish the <em>Zizzo </em>case from <em>Mackey </em>on the same basis as we did in our original opinion, that is that <em>Zizzo, </em>unlike <em>Mackey, </em>was convicted of a gambling related offense and the purpose of <em>Marchetti-Grosso </em>was, \u201cto protect the individual against self-incrimination under the comprehensive system of federal and state prohibitions against wagering activities.\u201d 431 F.2d at 916. In the opinion written by Mr. Justice Brennan, in which Justice Marshall concurred, there is reference to the fact that the <em>Mackey </em>case, \u201cdoes not involve a prosecution for gambling or related activities.\u201d The opinion then observes :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-9\">\u201cIf such a reporting requirement raises a substantial danger of incrimination under state or federal statutes making criminal the activity that is being taxed, an individual may, of course, assert the privilege against self-incrimination and refuse to disclose the information sought. We so held in <em>Marchetti </em>and <em>Grosso. </em>And if the information has been compelled over a claim of privilege, application of those cases requires that the individual be protected against the use of that information in state prosecutions under the statutes making criminal the taxed activity, and to complete immunity from prosecution under federal statutes of like kind.\u201d (401 U.S. at 710, 91 S.Ct. at 1169).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b939-10\">With the Court thus potentially divided at 4-4, the swing vote appears to be that of Mr. Justice Harlan, who wrote the majority opinion in <em>United States Coin and Currency </em>and an extensive concurring opinion in <em>Mackey. </em>Justice Harlan it seems would first distinguish between the cases coming before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>Court on direct review and those on collateral review. In those cases coming on collateral review, i. e. habeas corpus, Justice Harlan states that it is sounder, \u201cgenerally to apply the law prevailing at the time a conviction became final than it is to seek to dispose of all of these cases on the basis of intervening changes in constitutional interpretation.\u201d 401 U.S. at 689, 91 S.Ct. at 1178. In other words, if a conviction was valid at the time it became final, Justice Harlan would not disturb that conviction upon collateral review based on changes in constitutional law, except that, \u201cNew \u2018substantive due process\u2019 rules, that is, those that place, as a matter of constitutional interpretation, certain kinds of primary, private individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal law-making authority to prescribe,\u201d would be given retroactive effect. He would also grant retroactive application to those claims of nonobservance of basic procedures that are, \u201cimplicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u201d Id. at 692-693, 91 S.Ct. at 1180.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">Applying these principles, Justice Harlan voted for retroactive application of <em>Marchetti-Grosso </em>in <em>United States Coin and Currency, </em>because that case involved the crime of failure to register under the statute \u2014 conduct which the Court had concluded was beyond the power of Congress to punish. In distinguishing <em>Mackey, </em>Justice Harlan writes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHO\">\u201cIn this regard, Mackey\u2019s claim differs from that raised by the respondent in <em>Coin and Currency, </em>also decided today, where <em>Marchetti </em>and <em>Grosso </em>do operate to render Congress powerless to punish the conduct there at issue. Instead, <em>Mackey\u2019s </em>claim is that the procedures utilized in procuring his conviction were vitiated by the <em>Marchetti </em>and <em>Grosso </em>decisions. Since matters of procedure rather than substance are involved, * * * I would apply to the resolution of this habeas petition the law in effect at the time <em>Mackey\u2019s </em>conviction became final, absent a showing that the procedures employed were fundamentally unfair.\u201d (401 U.S. at 700-701, 91 S.Ct. at 1184).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b940-8\">It seems to us if this case were decided when it was before the Supreme Court Justice Harlan would have concluded that like <em>Mackey </em>it involves only procedures utilized in procuring a conviction and he would therefore have voted to apply to the resolution of this ha-beas petition the law in effect at the time the conviction became final. Under that law the admission into evidence of the wagering returns would not be error.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-9\">Accordingly, the decision of the district court denying the motion to vacate the judgment of conviction is at long last affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
