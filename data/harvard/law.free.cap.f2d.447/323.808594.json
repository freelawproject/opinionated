C., and San Francisco, California, refused to donate time to the petitioners for the purpose of broadcasting messages opposing military service or informing the public of alternatives to military service, after the stations had aired recruiting announcements in behalf of the Armed Services. We sustain the Commission\u2019s conclusion that the petitioners have not shown that the various licensees\u2019 exercise of judgment under the fairness doctrine was unreasonable, arbitrary, or in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-22\">I. <em>Facts and Administrative Agency Action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-23\">The military recruitment announcements broadcast were appeals for voluntary enlistment in the various branches of the Armed Forces.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The recruitment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>announcements in themselves did not dwell upon the Vietnam war, or upon warfare in general, and only one of eighteen different announcements alluded to the draft<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Admittedly, they sought to present the attractive, positive, and advantageous side of military service.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Petitioner Green (No. 24,470), individually and as Chairman of the Peace Committee of the Baltimore Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends, wrote to television broadcasting stations in the Washington area to request \u201cfree air time to rebut the claim made by the numerous military recruitment advertisements presented on your station that a career in the armed forces is desirable, rewarding, and the best way to serve one\u2019s country.\u201d In response to some of the licensees\u2019 requests, petitioner Green submitted a proposed announcement as his presentation of a fair response to the issues he and the Committee asserted were raised by the military recruitment messages.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> All three network TV stations in the Washington area declined to broadcast the proffered spot announcement, but all three offered an opportunity to petitioner Green and members of his group to appear on other programs discussing the question of the military draft as a controversial issue of public importance. The offers of two stations were rejected by petitioner Green and a complaint was filed with the FCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-15\">On behalf of petitioner G.I. Association and the other parties (No. 24,516), a letter was addressed to twenty-seven radio and television stations in the San Francisco area requesting an opportunity under the fairness doctrine to broadcast petitioners\u2019 views in opposition to the military recruitment announcements. The letter alleged that in none \u201cof the recruitment advertisements on your station that have come to our attention (is it indicated) that an individual\u2019s participation in the armed services could lead to his involvement in the Vietnam war, * * *. Nor is it indicated in any of the recruitment advertisements that many deferments to military service are available under present laws and regulations.\u201d With the letter was enclosed a sample spot announcement entitled \u201cDraft Counseling,\u201d setting forth petitioners\u2019 view on the alleged controversial issue.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Those broadcast stations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>which were solicited denied the request, after which complaint was made to the FCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">By letters ruling simultaneously on the two requests, the Federal Communications Commission decided that the broadcast stations did not act unreasonably in refusing the petitioners\u2019 requests, declined to disturb the judgment of each television and radio licensee, and determined that no further action was warranted at that time. The Commission considered that the crucial question was \u201cwhether Armed Forces recruitment messages constitute the presentation of one side of a controversial issue of public importance\u201d and concluded that they did not.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Commission noted that the petitioners themselves seemed to view the recruitment messages as controversial because they were inextricably involved with the Vietnam war and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>draft, one strong indication of that being that the proposed spot announcements submitted both in Washington and San Francisco dealt in unmistakable terms with the draft and the Vietnam war, not with the merits of voluntary enlistment alone. On the issues of the Vietnam war and the draft the Commission concluded that all television and radio stations which had been requested to broadcast petitioners\u2019 spot announcements were giving a full coverage to these issues; indeed this was not controverted.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">II. <em>Federal Communications Commission Standards for the Fairness Doctrine</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">To invoke the fairness doctrine all parties recognize that there must exist a \u201ccontroversial issue of public importance\u201d on which the licensee has refused to allow the presentation of a reasonably balanced point of view. Petitioner in No. 24,470 urges that the difference of opinion as to what issues were raised by the recruitment announcements was caused by the FCC\u2019s failure to promulgate adequate standards to guide broadcasters in determining their obligations under the fairness doctrine, and he seeks not only a reversal of the Commission\u2019s ruling in this case but also a declaration from us that the Commission\u2019s fairness standards are inadequate. Petitioner Green argues that the FCC\u2019s rule of deferring to \u201creasonable\u201d fairness doctrine determinations by a licensee violates the public interest standard of the Communications Act, and the First and Fifth Amendments because this rule is too vague and imposes a prior restraint on expression. He asserts that the FCC should be required to promulgate specific standards to determine (1) what is the issue, (2) whether the issue is controversial, and (3) whether the licensee has presented a balanced coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-14\">At the outset we note that the fairness doctrine was most recently elaborated by the FCC <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in response to the Supreme-Court\u2019s decision in Red Lion Broadcasting Co., Inc., v. FCC.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Supreme Court itself enunciated two bases for the fairness doctrine: First, the statutory basis, that broadcast facilities must operate in the public interest; second, that under the First Amendment the public has a right to free and open debate. The Commission\u2019s rule provides that if one position on a controversial issue of public importance is broadcast twice within a period of six to nine months, or if the licensee itself editorializes on the air, the licensee has an affirmative duty to seek a spokesman for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>the other point of view. As to how the conflicting points of view are presented, 'a licensee can present conflicting views in any fashion, so long as the balance in format, time, protagonists, etc., meets a test of \u201creasonableness.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In addition to achieving a balance in presentation of conflicting views, this rule purports to foster self-regulation, to avoid any implication of censorship by the Commission, and to enable the broadcasters themselves to safeguard their economic interests in allocation of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">The fairness doctrine is not to be confused with the doctrine of \u201cequal time\u201d which directs in firm statutory language (\u00a7 315) that licensees treat equally all legally qualified candidates for public office; <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> under the fairness doctrine <em>identical </em>treatment of both sides of the issue is not necessary, as this would place an onerous and impractical burden on the licensees. A further difference, no individual member of the public has the right of access to the air; the licensees may exercise their judgment as to what material is presented and by whom. While we observe that the three network licensees in the Washington area all invited petitioner Green to appear in one program format or another, clearly under the FCC fairness doctrine the licensees were not obligated to have any particular advocate appear at all. The fairness doctrine is issue-oriented, and it would be sufficient if each licensee could show that the point of view advocated by petitioner Green had been or was being presented on its station by others.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>In our view, the essential basis for any fairness doctrine, no matter with what specificity the standards are defined, is that <em>the American public must not be left uninformed. </em>On the record in this case, no matter how the issue is taken, we cannot conceive that any live American has been left uninformed about the desirability or undesirability of military service, the draft, or the Vietnam war. We do not see that the participation of either petitioner Green and his group, or the G.I. Association and the other petitioners, under any doctrine of fairness, would be necessary to an informed public.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">To the extent that the FCC enunciation of the fairness doctrine may lack the precision of standards which petitioner Green believes necessary, it is sufficient answer to point out that at no time did petitioners urge upon the Commission a different standard than that already promulgated by the FCC. Under \u00a7 405 of the Communications Act this would seem to be a classic case for seeking reconsideration by the Commission before coming here for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s Action.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If the Commission standards for the fairness doctrine are deficient (we by no means infer that they are), surely the Commission itself deserves the first opportunity to improve those standards, and in so doing it should have the benefit of whatever assistance petitioner Green and his group can give. A proffer of such to the Commission was not made in this case. Therefore, we do not think it appropriate to review here the adequacy of the standards of the fairness doctrine as already enunciated by the FCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">III. <em>The Issues and the Fairness Doctrine Applied Thereto</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">To invoke the fairness doctrine as a ground for obtaining access to the air waves, it is not only necessary to define a controversial issue of public importance, but implicitly it is first necessary to define the issue. Intermixed in the exchange of letters and legal papers among the parties, and in argument before this court, there appear to be five different issues around which the petitioners and other parties have circled, trying to define \u201cthe issue,\u201d each in his own light: (1) military manpower recruitment by voluntary means, (2) the draft, (3) the Vietnam war, (4) the morality of participation in any war, and (5) the \u201cdesirability\u201d of military service.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">1. <em>Military manpower recruitment by voluntary means.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">We consider that the first issue, military manpower recruitment by voluntary means, is all that was implicit in virtually all the Armed Services recruitment announcements. If this is the issue raised, is it a \u201ccontroversial issue of public importance\u201d? To oppose all enlistment, even voluntary, would be in effect to urge the abolition of United States military forces. As the Commission stated, \u201cWe note that the power of the Government to raise an army has not been questioned.\u201d Nor do petitioners contend that the concept of unilaterally abolishing all United States military forces at the present time is \u201ca controversial issue of public importance\u201d demanding allocation of broadcast time. Indeed, in their briefs and at oral argument, the petitioners seemed to shy away from so defining the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-13\">Hence, the licensees concluded that voluntary military recruitment in itself was not controversial and was not any issue of public importance. The FCC decided that it was not unreasonable for the licensees to so conclude in regard to the Armed Services military recruitment announcements. On review here, we sustain this finding of the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>sion that the licensees made a good faith, reasonable judgment on this question, which is all that is required under the fairness doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">2 and 3. <em>The draft and the Vietnam war.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The petitioners did not treat the military recruitment announcements as being of such limited import, but rather treated the issue involved here as being (2) the draft and (3) the Vietnam war. It is readily apparent that both groups of petitioners in Washington and in San Francisco, when they came to submit their proposed replies to the Armed Forces recruitment announcements, immediately enmeshed themselves in opposition to the draft and the Vietnam war.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Analysis of the spot announcements proposed by both petitioners as rebuttals to the military recruitment announcements shows that in each case there was an anti-Vietnam and an anti-draft pitch. For example, petitioner Green\u2019s submitted announcement referred to \u201cevery draftee,\u201d \u201clegal alternatives to military service,\u201d \u201cdeferments.\u201d One who voluntarily enlists, which is the object of the recruitment announcements, is not a draftee. Legal alternatives to military service only have reference to the draft, there is no problem of legal alternatives to voluntary enlistment. Nor is there any such thing as a deferment from voluntary enlistment.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The proposed radio spot of petitioner G.I. Association was entitled \u201cDraft Counseling,\u201d and discussed the draft and possible deferment exclusively. The sample television spot focused on a young man standing in front of a row of gravestones, and his first words were to be, \u201cIt was my experience as a captain in Vietnam.\u201d The second young man, likewise silhouetted against a large cemetery, was to start off, <em>\u201cI </em>was an enlisted man in Vietnam,\u201d and referred to \u201cthe problems of what is basically a civil war.\u201d The announcer was to refer to \u201ca war that doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d and to \u201cmilitary deferment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AqE\">This was the basic content and theme which the petitioners wished to get across to the American public. This action of the petitioners themselves placed a broader interpretation on the military recruitment announcements than either the stations, the FCC, or we feel is justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">But taking the issue as thus broadened by the petitioners themselves, in neither case is there any allegation that there is no adequate coverage of these issues by the licensees at the present time.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It is not only apparent that the draft issue and the Vietnam war issue are issues of overwhelming importance, but also equally undeniable that these issues have been ventilated <em>in extenso </em>for years on (probably) every television and radio station in the land. If the draft and Vietnam are properly the issues raised, and petitioners\u2019 own submitted announcements seem to indicate they are, then there can be no complaint under the fairness doctrine that these licensees and others have not given full and adequate coverage to these issues. And, as a matter of record, the particular broadcast stations here involved did offer the petitioners and the groups they represent an opportunity to participate in programs dealing with these broader issues. Petitioner Green and his group accepted the offer of one TV station in Washington; they chose to reject the offers of the other two TV stations as not being responsive to their request.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-12\">4. <em>The morality of participating in any war.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b410-13\">In regard to the even broader issue, (4) the moral question of participation in any war, this too is an issue which we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>believe has been aired on many television stations (the record is not clear as to these particular licensees), and would have been at least peripherally involved in the programs offered by these licensees to the petitioners here. But petitioners in their briefs have not claimed that this is properly the issue raised, and in oral argument seemed to abjure any such philosophical question.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">5. <em>The desirability of military service.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">By the time of oral argument both groups of petitioners preferred to define the issue as whether military service was \u201cdesirable, rewarding, or the best way to serve one\u2019s country,\u201d according to petitioner Green, and simply as whether military service was \u201cdesirable,\u201d according to the petitioner G.I. Association. Yet even taking this as the defined issue, it is obvious that desirability or undesirability of military service comes right back to the draft and the Vietnam war. These features of desirability are exactly what both petitioners dramatized in their proposed spot announcements (see footnotes 3 and 4). And as we have made clear, and as no one contends otherwise, as issues the draft and the Vietnam war have been covered in multiple facets.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Considering the argument as phrased in terms of desirability, although generally agreeing in thus defining the issue, the two groups of petitioners took a different view on the way in which the fairness doctrine should be applied and the fact situation as to broadcast coverage. In response to a direct question by the court, petitioner Green flatly said that to his knowledge there was nothing now being shown on television which demonstrated that military service is tmdesirable.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> On known facts of common experience, we think this position verges on the incredible. Unless casual viewing over the past seven years has been totally unrepresentative, it is our. opinion that the \u00abmdesirable features of military life have been displayed in virtually every living room in the country, frequently in full living (or dying) color, in the American television networks\u2019 endeavor to bring the Vietnam war and all of its miseries home to the American people. To say that these national network television stations have not given adequate and complete coverage to the undesirable features of military life in our age, to ignore the past six years\u2019 television coverage of the American military effort in Southeast Asia, not to mention the weekly casualty figures routinely broadcast by the networks, and therefore to maintain that under the fairness doctrine the spot announcements or something similar thereto and the personal message of these petitioners on the airways is necessary to counteract the otherwise prevailing propaganda of the military forces that military service is exclusively desirable and good for you, is beyond our acceptance.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">Petitioner G.I. Association took a different approach. Its counsel, in response to the same or similar question, admitted that the American public was not unaware of the undesirable features <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>of military service, but argued that prior to the military recruitment announcements there was somewhat of a balance presented to the public as to the desirable and undesirable features, and that the addition of the military recruitment announcements to television time had thus upset the balance in favor of these \u201chighly effective spot announcements.\u201d We will not attempt to assay here what balance or lack of balance there has existed and does exist in a presentation of the desirable and undesirable features of military life; it is sufficient to point out that under the fairness doctrine it is not necessary that there be an absolute equality of either time, time of viewing, or dramatic impact, or absolute equality in any other criteria for the points of view presented under the fairness doctrine. What the petitioners are apparently confusing with the fairness doctrine is the doctrine of equal time, which has no relevance whatsoever to the issues in this case. Unlike the \u201cequal opportunities\u201d requirement, which as we have already pointed out deals with legally qualified candidates for public office, the question under the fairness doctrine is one of reasonableness of the station\u2019s action, and not whether absolute equality in allocation of time, time of day, or any other criteria, has been achieved.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">IV. <em>Inapplicability of the Banzhaf Decision Here</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Petitioners in No. 24,516 have taken the position, both before the Commission and now before this court, that their complaint is controlled by, and is indistinguishable from- the Commission\u2019s landmark cigarette advertising ruling.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Applicability of Fairness Doctrine to Cigarette Advertising, 9 F.C.C.2d 921 (1967), aff\u2019d <em>sub nom. </em>Banzhaf v. FCC, 132 U.S.App.D.C. 14, 405 F.2d 1082 (1968), cert. denied <em>sub nom. </em>Tobacco Institute v. FCC, 396 U.S. 842, 90 S.Ct. 50, 24 L.Ed.2d 93 (1969). Since the Commission found that the several issues \u2014 both explicit and implicit \u2014 surrounding military recruitment advertising were either not controversial matters of public importance (i. e., whether the United States should maintain an armed force) or were adequately covered by the various licensees (the draft and Vietnam), no discussion of the scope of its \u201ccigarette case\u201d was required. Likewise, the General Counsel for the FCC in his brief in this court, reasoning that \u201cthe determination of whether to extend the cigarette ruling to the broadcast of military recruitment announcements is a policy judgment to be made initially by the Commission,\u201d did not address himself to the merits of petitioners\u2019 contentions on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">Our disposition of petitioners\u2019 complaint, compatibly with the agency\u2019s ruling, renders extended evaluation of the similarities and dissimilarities between this case and <em>Banzhaf, </em>strictly speaking, unnecessary. However, petitioners\u2019 dogged reliance on that case, as well as Commissioner Johnson\u2019s lengthy dissenting discussion, compels us to interject a word of explanation regarding the matter of analogy to the cigarette litigation. Petitioners claim that <em>Banzhaf </em>sweepingly holds that \u201cwhen one side of a controversial issue is presented in the form of frequent spot announcements, the other side must be allowed to present its views in a similar fashion.\u201d We would have thought that the opinions of court and Commission would have made unmistakably clear that it is not every advertisement carrying a controversial message which calls for response through a similar spot announcement format.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The emphasis, quite to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>the contrary, was on the uniquely serious and well-documented hazards to the public health inherent in cigarette smoking \u2014 hazards deeply explored and extensively expounded upon by the other branches of government \u2014 which stood at the core of the <em>Banzhaf </em>ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Nor can we accept the dissenting Commissioner\u2019s view. He argues that because of the possibilities of grave physical injury and death associated with service in Vietnam, military recruitment ads raise issues equally as significantly related to the general public health as do cigarette commercials and therefore require similar treatment under the fairness doctrine. Such reasoning overlooks, we think, the crucial point that the fairness doctrine\u2019s goal is the \u201cpromotion of informed decision-making by the public.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u201cIt is the right of the public to receive suitable access to * * * ideas and experiences which is crucial here,\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> rather than the desire of those who espouse competing views to express their opinions no matter how fully the same subject matter is covered in the licensee\u2019s programming or is patently apparent to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Other cases presently pending or yet to be brought before this court will provide the appropriate occasions for critically tracing the contours of the public interest standard as it applies to commercial advertising.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> It is sufficient for the resolution of all contentions raised in the proceedings immediately before us to recognize that, whatever the logical sweep of the existing ruling as to cigarettes, these arguments reach far beyond the contemplation of either the court\u2019s or the Commission\u2019s ruling that a fair response to cigarette advertising in the name of the general public health was in the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">For the reasons stated, we decline to reverse the ruling of the Federal Communications Commission rejecting the complaint by both groups of petitioners under the fairness doctrine.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b404-10\">.

Association representative the Commission concluded :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-16\">In the present case, we do not believe that the broadcast of Armed Forces recruitment messages * * * raises a controversial issue of public importance requiring presentation of conflicting viewpoints. We note that the power of the Government to raise an army has not been questioned; rather the thrust of the complaint is an objection to the use made of the army (war in Vietnam) and the manner in which manpower is conscripted (Selective Service draft).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-20\">In reaching this conclusion we also note that complainants themselves reason that recruitment messages are controversial <em>because </em>they are inextricably intertwined with the conduct of the war in Vietnam and the Selective Service draft. There is no indication that any of the stations against whom the complaint was filed have failed to treat the issues of Vietnam and the draft (both concededly controversial issues of public importance) in conformance with the fairness doctrine. Moreover, the only indication as to what complainants consider the \u201copposing viewpoint\u201d to the Armed Forces recruitment announcements is one spot announcement entitled \u201cDraft Counseling,\u201d which offers information pertaining to draft deferments. The fact that Vietnam and the draft are controversial issues of public importance does not, in our view, automatically require that recruitment messages also be considered as such, and we are unable to conclude that it was unreasonable for the broadcast stations in the San Francisco area to decline to broadcast the \u201copposing\u201d spot announcements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-21\">Similarly, to the representative of the Friends Peace Committee the Commission said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-22\">[W]e note that the announcements which the Friends Peace Committee seeks to have broadcast does [sic] not deal with the issue of whether there should be armed forces, but rather focuses on the draft. * * * Absent evidence that stations WMAL and WRC have failed in their overall programming to achieve fairness in their coverage of the controversial issue here involved (i. e., the draft), the Commission will not disturb the licensees\u2019 determination as to how to best inform the public of the various facets of issues of controversial public importance.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b407-7\">. In re Obligations of Broadcast Licensees Under the Fairness Doctrine, 23 F.C.C. 2d 27, 28 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">The fairness doctrine was evolved as a policy under the public interest standard in a series of cases, given its definitive policy statement in the Commission\u2019s 1949 Editorializing Report (13 F.C.C. 1246), and codified into the Communications Act in 1959. See section 315(a) 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 315(a) ; Red Lion Broadcasting Company, Inc. v. Federal Communications Commission, <em>supra. </em>It requires the broadcast licensee to afford reasonable opportunity for the discussion of conflicting viewpoints on controversial issues of public importance. The Commission early determined that if the fairness doctrine were to achieve its most salutary purpose, an affirmative obligation in this respect must be imposed upon the licensee.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-15\">The Commission\u2019s general approach to this facet of the fairness doctrine is set forth in a 1964 ruling, Letter to Mid-Florida Television Corporation, 40 F.C.C. 620, 621 (1964) :</p>\n<p id=\"b407-16\">* * * The Commission does not seek to establish a rigid formula for compliance with the fairness doctrine. The mechanics of achieving fairness will necessarily vary with the circumstances, and it is within the discretion of each licensee, acting in good faith, to choose an appropriate method of implementing the policy to aid and encourage expression of contrasting viewpoints. Our experience indicates that licensees have chosen a variety of methods, and often combinations of various methods. * * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b407-18\">. 395 U.S. 367, 89 S.Ct. 1794, 23 L.Ed. 2d 371 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b408-5\">. The Commission has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-6\">The fairness doctrine deals with the broader question of affording reasonable opportunity for the presentation of contrasting viewpoints on controversial issues of public importance. Generally speaking, it does not apply with the precision of the \u201cequal opportunities\u201d requirement. Rather, the licensee, in applying the fairness doctrine, is called upon to make reasonable judgments in good faith on the facts of each situation \u2014 as to whether a controversial issue of public importance is involved, as to what viewpoints have been or should be presented, as to the format and spokesmen to present the viewpoints, and all the other facets of such programming. See par. 9, <em>Memorializing Report. </em>In passing on any complaint in this area, the Commission\u2019s role is not to substitute its judgment for that of the licensee as to any of the above programming decisions, but rather to determine whether the licensee can be said to have acted reasonably and in good faith. There is thus room for considerably more discretion on the part of the licensee under the fairness doctrine than under the \u201cequal opportunities\u201d requirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">In re Applicability of the Fairness Doctrine in the Handling of Controversial Issues of Public Importance, 40 F.C.C. 598, 599 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b408-8\">. Section 315 reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqJ\">\u00a7 315.

The \u201cequal opportunities\u201d requirement relates solely to use of broadcast facilities by candidates for public office. With certain exceptions involving specified news-type programs, the law provides that if a licensee permits a person who is a legally qualified candidate for public office to use a broadcast station, he shall afford equal opportunities to all other such candidates for that office in the use of the station.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-15\">In re Applicability of the Fairness Doctrine in the Handling of Controversial Issues of Public Importance, 40 F.C.C. 598, 599 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b409-8\">.

We do not suggest that a licensee charged with violation of the fairness doctrine may seek absolution by reference to compliance with it by other licensees. In each of the cases before us, however, the licensees complained of were expressly identified, and it was not alleged that any one of them was failing to discharge its public service obligation in respect of Viet Nam and the draft. <em>See </em>footnote 12, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b412-6\">. Petitioners in No. 24,470, on the other hand, have persistently eschewed any reliance on <em>Banzhaf </em>and have instead contended that their complaint may be resolved according to conventional fairness doctrine standards.
