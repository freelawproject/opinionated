Since the doctrine requires the presentation of opposing views on controversial issues of public importance,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Commission\u2019s inquiry dealt largely with whether the effect of cigarette smoking on health remained a controversial issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-16\">After receiving comments from interested parties, the Commission ruled that, in the light of developments, it would be reasonable for a broadcaster to determine that the health hazards of smoking no longer present a controversial issue.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Consequently, the Commission held, television and radio stations that carry antf-smoking announcements need not grant free time to broadcast opposing views. The Commission cautioned, however, that outside the context of a specific complaint it could not properly issue a blanket ruling on every anti-smoking message. It further admonished that the fairness doctrine would apply to anti-smoking broadcasts over which substantial controversy might arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-18\">The petitioners attack the ruling of the Commission as arbitrary and capricious because in their view the Commission has failed to state a reasoned basis for repudiating its prior position that the effect of smoking on health is a controversial issue subject to the fairness doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>trine. They add that the Commission failed to articulate any objective standard for determining when an issue ceases to be controversial. The petitioners emphasize the following facts as showing that the Commission has consistently regarded the hazards of smoking as controversial. In 1967, the Commission ruled that the fairness doctrine obliged stations broadcasting cigarette commercials to allow time for anti-smoking messages.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A short time later, in response to an inquiry by a licensee, the Commission ruled that a broadcaster who declined cigarette commercials would be required to carry pro-smoking messages if he broadcast anti-smoking announcements.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Finally, and most significantly, according to the petitioners, the Chairman of the Commission repeatedly represented to Congress during the hearings on the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969 that the fairness doctrine would apply after the broadcasting ban went into effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">The Commission\u2019s ruling, of course, cannot be faulted simply because it represents a shift from an earlier holding. FCC v. WOKO, Inc., 329 U.S. 223, 228, 67 S.Ct. 213, 91 L.Ed. 204 (1946). Our inquiry, therefore, is whether the Commission articulated with reasonable clarity a rational basis for its change of view. See Greater Boston Television Corp. v. FCC, 444 F.2d 841, 850 (D.C.Cir., 1970). As Judge Leven-thal emphasized, \u201can agency changing its course must supply a reasoned analysis indicating that prior policies and standards are being deliberately changed, not casually ignored. * * * \u201d 444 F.2d at 852.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">In stating its reasons, the Commission first reiterated a well established principle of the fairness doctrine that \u201cit is up to the licensee to make a reasonable, good faith judgment on the basis of the particular facts before him * * * whether he has presented one side of a controversial issue. * * * \u201d The Commission next stressed that the critical issue is \u201cthe licensee\u2019s judgment today\u25a0\u2014 directed to the circumstances before him.\u201d Finally, it pointed to \u201csignificant developments\u201d since the Surgeon General\u2019s 1964 report touched off substantial controversy about the effect of cigarette smoking on health. Specifically, the Commission referred to the 1967, 1968 and 1969 reports of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the change in the warning on cigarette packages, and the broadcasting ban imposed by the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b959-8\">The significance of the HEW reports is disclosed by extracts contained in the Senate Report on the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>can be no doubt that Congress relied in part on the HEW reports when it enacted the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969. Given this precedent, the Commission properly turned to these reports to reach its conclusion, finding in them \u201coverwhelming evidence on the general public health aspects of cigarette smoking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">Also quite properly, the Commission relied on the 1969 Act to undergird its ruling. The label required in the Act of 1965 \u2014 \u201cCaution: Cigarette Smoking May be Hazardous to Your Health\u201d \u2014 was made more positive by the Act of 1969\u2014 \u201cWarning: The Surgeon General Has Determined That Cigarette Smoking Is Dangerous to Your Health.\u201d More importantly from the standpoint of the Commission, Congress banned cigarette advertising from the air. The enactment of this legislation entitled the Commission to draw the inference that Congress had been persuaded that evidence purporting to establish the hazards of smoking was essentially valid. The Commission, therefore, was justified in reaching the conclusion that, regardless of its former views on the controversy over cigarettes, it is now reasonable for a licensee to assume that the detrimental effects of cigarette smoking on health are beyond controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-14\">We cannot accept the petitioners\u2019 suggestion that the Chairman of the Commission, testifying at legislative hearings, made representations about the fairness doctrine that precluded the Commission\u2019s ruling.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Both the Chairman\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>testimony and the Commission\u2019s order recognized that, notwithstanding the ban on advertising, under certain circumstances the fairness doctrine could require the presentation of the cigarette manufacturers\u2019 views. Moreover, the Chairman noted that he was speaking unofficially in answering the questions put to him and that he was not giving a studied opinion on behalf of the Commission.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Chairman\u2019s testimony, therefore, did not prevent the full Commission from subsequently reassessing the existence of controversy over the smoking and health issue. The fairness doctrine requires a current judgment, and it would lose its vitality if the Commission and licensees could not reasonably determine on facts before them that an issue is no longer controversial.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">We conclude, therefore, that the Commission did not act arbitrarily or capriciously, that its report and order sufficiently explain the reasons for its new rules, and that the objective data on which the Commission relied were adequate to justify its change of course.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b961-10\">The tobacco industry, having acquiesced in the statutory ban on radio and television advertising, does not challenge the constitutionality of the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The petitioners, however, contend that the Commission violated the first amendment and \u00a7\u00a7 326 and 315 of the Com-muncations Act by authorizing licensees to broadcast anti-smoking messages without requiring them to present the opposing point of view on the theory that the smoking and health issue has ceased to be controversial. In support of their position, the petitioners refer to the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>mission\u2019s statement that it will consider a licensee\u2019s treatment of the effect of smoking on health when it assesses the station\u2019s overall public service performance at renewal time. This warning, say the petitioners, coupled with the Commission\u2019s refusal to compel pro-smoking announcements amounts to coerced presentation of the \u201cofficial government view.\u201d Such coercion, the petitioners suggest, is just as truly censorship and abridgment of the freedom of speech and press as would be a rule explicitly requiring anti-smoking announcements and forbidding pro-smoking information.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">On its face, the Commission\u2019s order does not censor information about smoking in violation of \u00a7 326 of the Communications Act.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The order neither compels nor denies access to the petitioners\u2019 views but leaves program decisions on this issue to each licensee\u2019s discretion. The Commission specifically rejected a rule requiring stations to carry anti-smoking announcements, and it did not forbid them from broadcasting pro-smoking messages. Moreover, it carefully admonished that certain types of anti-smoking programs were subject to the fairness doctrine. Of course, an order or regulation valid on its face may be administered unlawfully. But petitioners have not cited any instances of coercion, and no broadcaster has petitioned for review because of the pressures the petitioners detect.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">Section 315 of the Communications Act,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> as amended in 1959, provides a statutory basis for the Commission\u2019s preexisting version of the fairness doctrine and imposes \u201ca duty on broadcasters to discuss both sides of controversial public issues.\u201d Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367, 380, 89 S.Ct. 1794, 1801, 23 L.Ed.2d 371 (1969). The fairness doctrine must be administered by the Commission to enhance, not inhibit, the rights secured by the first amendment.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In <em>Red Lion, </em>the landmark case on the doctrine, Mr. Justice White wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ask-dedup-1\">\u201cIt is the purpose of the First Amendment to preserve an uninhibited marketplace of ideas in which truth will ultimately prevail, rather than to countenance monopolization of that market, whether it be by the Government itself or a private licensee. * * * It is the right of the public to receive suitable access to social, political, esthetic, moral, and other ideas and experiences which is crucial here. That right may not constitutionally be abridged either by Congress or by the FCC.\u201d 395 U.S. at 390, 89 S.Ct. at 1806.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b962-10\">The channels of radio and television transmission are public property entrusted to licensees as proxies or fiduciaries of their communities. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 301; 395 U.S. at 389, 89 S.Ct. 1794. But the licensees are not deemed common carriers. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 153(h). Limitations of time and frequencies make it impracticable for them to accept every tendered program. Recognizing this, the Commission has applied the fairness doctrine only to controversial issues of public importance, and <em>Red Lion </em>has placed its constitutionality beyond question.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>As we noted in Part I, the Commission stated a rational basis for its decision that a broadcaster could reasonably determine that the effect of smoking on health was no longer controversial. However, knowledge of the effect of smoking is not static, and many aspects of this subject may still generate controversy. As to them, the Commission ruled the public is entitled to hear various points of view, including the tobacco industry's. The Commission cited particular studies, statistics, and proposals for remedial action as examples of potential controversy to which the fairness doctrine would apply. The Commission\u2019s ruling that the fairness doctrine applies to those aspects of the effect of smoking on health that remain controversial, but not to those that may now be deemed beyond controversy, provides the public \u201csuitable access\u201d to this issue and therefore satisfies both \u00a7 315 of the Communications Act and the first amendment. Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367, 390, 89 S.Ct. 1794, 23 L.Ed.2d 371 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">In contrast, controversy is not essential to a station\u2019s obligation to present programs about the effect of smoking on health. This duty does not rest merely on the fairness doctrine. The fundamental basis of this obligation is the licensee\u2019s responsibility to serve the public interest by providing information about cigarettes\u2019 unique threat to public health. Banzhaf v. FCC, 132 U.S.App.D.C. 14, 405 F.2d 1082, 1091 (1968), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 842, 90 S.Ct. 50, 24 L.Ed.2d 93 (1969); see Green v. FCC, 447 F.2d 332, 333 (D.C.Cir. June 18, 1971). A station\u2019s treatment of this subject is pertinent to renewal of its license. From its inception, the Commission\u2019s licensing function has involved not only examination of technical facilities, but also evaluation of the services a station renders the public. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 307, 309; National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 190, 216, 63 S.Ct. 997, 87 L.Ed. 1344 (1943). We find, therefore, no error in the Commission\u2019s continued recognition of the effect of smoking on the public welfare or in its statement that it will consider the treatment of this subject when it assesses a station\u2019s overall public service performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b958-9\">.

Something was said this morning about there might be a turnaround of the fairness doctrine the other way ; that in the event there were a number of these educational, anti-smoking showings, that perhaps there ought to be a right of the tobacco industry to come in the fairness doctrine and state its pro side over again.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-18\">What is your response to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-19\">\u201cMr. Ilyde. There may well be an advantage in that, Senator. Let me explain. The fairness doctrine in principle holds that the public is entitled to hear both sides of the proposition or both sides of the issue which is controversial, and affects the public interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-20\">Now, it is quite possible that, if a station carries an anticigarette smoking presentation, that more attention could be attracted to that presentation if you had the other side of the argument available at the same time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b961-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>What I am suggesting is that a good, sharp argument might attract more attention than a presentation of simply one side of the issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b961-12\">\u201cSenator Moss.

But let me indicate how this operates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b961-14\">The fairness doctrine says that if a station presents one side of an issue of public importance, a controversial issue of public importance, they must provide some reasonable opportunity for the presentation of other viewpoints.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b961-15\">Now, assuming there is no cigarette advertising as such, but simply a presentation of what we might classify as an educational presentation to discourage the use of a product which the Surgeon General has found harmful to health. In that situation fairness would require that there be some reasonable opportunity for the presentation of the other viewpoint as long as this remains in controversy. This doesn\u2019t mean that the other viewpoint should be presented in an advertising form. It simply means that some other spokesman, one knowledgeable, we trust, would present the other side of the argument, so that the public could have all of the relevant viewpoints upon which to make their judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b961-16\">It is not an invitation to advertising.
