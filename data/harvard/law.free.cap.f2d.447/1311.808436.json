Concurrent eighteen-month sentences were imposed on each of the three counts. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-21\">On appeal, LaMont\u2019s initial contention is that the district court abused its discretion when it refused to grant a continuance sought by counsel because of his allegedly busy schedule. Defendant and his counsel were given six weeks advance notice of the trial date. Three weeks before trial they were admonished that there would be no continuance. Counsel had more than adequate time to prepare for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-22\">Moreover there is no suggestion that the denial of the continuance actually resulted in prejudice to the appellant at trial. We find no abuse of discretion. <em>See </em>Avery v. Alabama, 308 U.S. 444, 60 S.Ct. 321, 84 L.Ed. 377 (1940); Witt v. United States, 414 F.2d 604 (9th Cir. 1969). Appellant\u2019s reliance on Everitt v. United States, 281 F.2d 429 (5th Cir. 1960) is misplaced. There, the court-appointed counsel had less than one day to prepare for a complex trial. Here, counsel had more than six weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-24\">Appellant\u2019s other contention is that the proof was insufficient to establish unlawful possession under count 3 in view of the fact that the firearms in question were registered to his employer, Cadmus Industries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-25\">Cadmus was licensed to conduct a firearms business only at one business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number>location, pursuant to 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 178.50. A license under that section is valid only at the address specified therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-4\">The home of appellant, to which he had removed the automatic weapons, was not licensed or registered as a Cadmus place of business. The district court ruled that the Cadmus dealer\u2019s license and the fact that the guns were registered to Cadmus were not a defense to the prosecution of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-5\">Though we believe that the district court\u2019s ruling in this matter was quite proper under these facts, we need not rule on this contention in view of the fact that the sentence on count 3 was concurrent with the sentences on the other two counts as to which appellant makes no attack. United States v. Ruiz, 441 F.2d 1120 (9th Cir.1971). <em>See </em>Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
