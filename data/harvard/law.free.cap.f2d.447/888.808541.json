The purpose of his proposed trip is to attend a special training course in Tel Aviv conducted by his employer, El A1 Israel Airlines. He asserts and the Government concedes that, because he exercised his treaty right<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as an Argentine national to claim exemption from U. S. military service, he would be excludable upon re-entry into the United States, under the provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 66 Stat. 163 as amended,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and his name would therefore be placed in the \u201cLookout Book,\u201d the Immigration and Naturalization Service\u2019s list of currently excludable aliens who might be seeking re-entry, apparently distributed to INS agents at points of entry into the United States. Appellant contends that insofar as the provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 do brand him an excludable alien, the provisions place an impermissible burden on his rights under the Argentine Treaty<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which, incidentally, is similar to fifteen other treaties, principally of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation in granting exemption from military service.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellant concedes for purposes of this appeal that by exercising his treaty right he has waived his eligibility for citizenship under Moser v. United States, 341 U.S. 41, 71 S.Ct. 553, 95 L.Ed. 729 (1951),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but he argues that such a waiver does not mean he may be declared an excludable alien.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-13\">Alternatively, appellant claims that as an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, temporarily leaving the country at the behest- and under the requirements of his employer, he would not be making an \u201centry\u201d into the United States upon his return from Israel.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-14\">The court below did not reach the merits, but found the case unripe, and dismissed the action for lack of a \u201cjusti-ciable controversy,\u201d without prejudice to appellant\u2019s right later to seek relief from an exclusion order, if and when issued. We disagree with the court below and think that appellant should not be forced into the <em>cul de sac </em>of leaving the country, only to be \u201csubjected,\u201d on his return, \u201cto the wearisome routine of immigration procedure as though [he] had never lived here,\u201d ILWU Local 37 v. Boyd, 347 U.S. 222, 226, 74 S.Ct. 447, 449, 98 L.Ed. 650 (1954) (dissenting opinion), and the probability, in this case, of exclusion. Our view is taken from the perspective of the extensive INS-Itz-covitz history, and has in sight the concession made on argument that appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>would upon departure immediately take his place in the pages of the \u201cLookout Book.\u201d That extensive history follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">Appellant came to this country from Argentina with his parents in 1966 and was admitted as a permanent resident alien. Although he had completed his Argentine military obligation, he was required as a permanent resident alien of draft age to register with our Selective Service System. 50 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 453. He did so and was classified I-A on October 24, 1966. On March 29, 1967, he received a notice to report for induction. The Argentine Consulate in New York advised him that he was entitled to exemption from military service pursuant to the Argentine Treaty, and he thereupon applied to our Department of State for exemption. Despite the State Department\u2019s best efforts, Itzcovitz was advised by Selective Service, erroneously, as it later turned out, that the draft exemption granted by the Treaty had been impliedly abrogated by the passage of the Selective Service Act. On May 22, 1967, one day before he was required under threat of arrest and prosecution to report for induction, he left the United States and was reclassified IV-C as an alien who had fled to avoid military service. On December 16, 1968, Oestereich v. Selective Service System, 393 U.S. 233, 89 S.Ct. 414, 21 L.Ed.2d 402 (1968), held that there may be pre-induction judicial review of the classification of a registrant for the purposes of determining the applicability of unequivocal statutory exemptions. Three weeks later Itzcovitz sued for injunctive relief against the Selective Service System\u2019s outstanding induction order and against INS\u2019s refusal to permit him to return to the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">The late Judge Herlands ruled that he had jurisdiction under <em>Oestereich, supra, </em>that Selective Service had no authority to deny Itzcovitz his claimed treaty exemption to which he had a \u201cplain and unequivocal\u201d right, and granted him in-junctive relief against Selective Service, but denied injunctive relief against the INS on the ground that Itzcovitz had not exhausted his administrative remedies. Itzcovitz v. Selective Service System, 301 F.Supp. 168 (S.D.N.Y.1969). Itzcovitz appealed from the denial of relief against the Immigration Service, and the Government cross-appealed from the granting of relief against the Selective Service System, but shortly before oral argument <em>in </em>this court the Government withdrew its cross-appeal. During oral argument a panel of this court consisting of (then Chief) Judge Lumbard, Judge Kaufman and Judge Hays suggested that Itzcovitz be permitted to return to this country and resume his permanent resident status. On November 26, 1969, in a letter to that panel, the Government agreed that it was \u201cnow prepared to admit Itzcovitz,\u201d without conceding his eligibility for citizenship, and affirmed to the court that \u201cupon [Itzeovitz\u2019s] return\u201d he would \u201cnot be subject to an exclusion proceeding and will be deemed to have resumed his permanent resident status.\u201d Subsequently, on February 10, 1970, the District Director of INS notified the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York that \u201csteps have been initiated to have Mr. Itzeovitz\u2019s name removed from our Service lookout book.\u201d He had returned on January 24, 1970. His appeal was then dismissed as moot by the panel in a per curiam opinion noting that \u201cthe government has conceded the propriety of admitting Itzcovitz into the country, and the parties have informed us of his return.\u201d Itzcovitz v. Selective Service Local Board No. 6, 422 F.2d 828 (2d Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">Only after the Immigration Service had ignored letters written on March 12, June 18 and September 23, 1970, inquiring whether a brief departure from the country would result in his classification as an excludable alien on his return, did appellant institute this action for declaratory judgment. Appellant alleges that he is employed by El A1 Israel Airlines as a passenger agent at Kennedy International Airport, and that one of El Al\u2019s employment requirements is a three-week course, given in Tel Aviv, on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>prevention of airline hijackings. El A1 requested that the plaintiff attend a session to be conducted from October 18 until November 10, 1970.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b971-4\">Both appellant and INS moved for summary judgment below, INS claiming, among other things, that as an alien ineligible for citizenship under \u00a7 315(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1426(a), Itzcovitz may be an excludable alien under \u00a7 212(a) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a) (22).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">We disagree with the conclusion of the court below that this controversy is not ripe for adjudication. Having once been unlawfully excluded, appellant rightfully wonders whether a two- or three-week departure on employer\u2019s business would raise again the spectre of exclusion, this time possibly without the grace of an INS retrenchment allowing appellant to re-enter and resume his status as a permanent resident alien. The Immigration Service admits and makes it very clear \u2014 clearer to us, perhaps, than it did to the court below\u2014 that it would seek to exclude appellant after his sojourn in Tel Aviv. Abbott Laboratories, Inc. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 1515, 18 L.Ed.2d 681 (1967), tells us that the ripeness doctrine \u201cis to prevent the courts * * * from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies, and also to protect the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has been formalized * * We are required to \u201cevaluate both the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.\u201d 387 U.S. 149, 87 S.Ct. 1515.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">We believe there is hardship in the case of this appellant, who has spent years seeking to retain his permanent resident alien status and is still left to guess whether he can go to Israel for a brief training course required by his employer. His case is not abstract, nor the issue without immediate concurrent significance. The issue is one which the courts can and appropriately should decide. Cf. Loos v. INS, 407 F.2d 651 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 877, 90 S.Ct. 150, 24 L.Ed.2d 135 (1969).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Government\u2019s suggestion that within two years the appellant could apply to the Attorney General for a waiver of the excludability bar under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) is not meaningful since such a waiver can be applied for only by an alien who has voluntarily proceeded abroad, thus subjecting himself to exclusion. Similarly, the Government\u2019s suggestion that within 3% years appellant could apply for citizenship under 8 U.S. C. \u00a7 1427(a) and thus obtain administrative and judicial review then is without merit, for on such an application the only issue would be whether he were validly declared ineligible for citizenship, a point which he concedes, and it would be unnecessary at the hearing thereon to reach the question of his excludability as an alien if he departed from the United States. This is a proper case for declaratory relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-14\">We do not reach the question of the apparent clash between appellant\u2019s rights under the treaty and the immigration laws, for we conclude that appellant\u2019s return to the United States after his proposed trip to Tel Aviv would not constitute an \u201centry\u201d within \u00a7 101(a) (13) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a) (13),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the INS would therefore have no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>authority to exclude him under \u00a7 212, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182, Rosenberg v. Fleuti, 374 U.S. 449, 452, 83 S.Ct. 1804, 10 L.Ed.2d 1000 (1963). We reach this result having in mind not the history of Itzcovitz's case but the history of \u00a7 101(a) (13) of the Act. As early as 1947, this court, in an opinion by Chief Judge Learned Hand, held that an alien convicted of robbery did not re-enter the United States when he went by sleeping car from Buffalo to Detroit, passing through Canada en route. Di Pasquale v. Karnuth, 158 F.2d 878 (2d Cir. 1947). The alien was held to have \u201ca vested interest in his residence,\u201d and was not to \u201cbe subject to meaningless and irrational hazards\u201d; while he could have learned by inquiry that the train would take him out of the United States and back into it, there was no evidence that he \u201cknew or had any intention of leaving the United States or of entering Canada.\u201d 158 F.2d at 878-879. Pointing out that \u201c[djeportation can be the equivalent of banishment or exile,\u201d the Supreme Court eleven months after <em>Di Pasquale, supra, </em>relied upon it and followed it, in Delga-dillo v. Carmichael, 332 U.S. 388, 391, 68 S.Ct. 10, 12, 92 L.Ed. 17 (1947). There an alien merchant seaman, also later convicted of robbery, was rescued after his ship was torpedoed in World War II and taken to Havana, Cuba; his re-entry into the United States by way of Florida was held not to be an \u201centry\u201d within the Act as it then read, the Court noting that \u201cthe exigencies of war, not his voluntary act, put him on foreign soil.\u201d 332 U.S. at 391, 68 S.Ct. at 12. In Kwong Hai Chew v. Colding, 344 U.S. 590, 73 S.Ct. 472, 97 L.Ed. 576 (1953), the Supreme Court held an alien lawfully admitted to permanent residence was not deprived of the rights of a resident upon his return to the United States from a voyage as a merchant seaman when he had stopped at but remained aboard the vessel at foreign ports of call. The Court found the alien entitled, under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, to a hearing on his objections to deportation, a right he would not have enjoyed without his resident status. In a 5-4 decision the Supreme Court in Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei, 345 U.S. 206, 73 S.Ct. 625, 97 L.Ed. 956 (1953), held that an alien who had traveled abroad and remained in Hungary for nineteen months could be treated as an \u201centering alien,\u201d and be detained on Ellis Island without a hearing on his threatened exclusion. 345 U.S. at 213, 73 S.Ct. 625. <em>Kwong Hai Chew </em>was distinguished by the majority on the grounds that Kwong\u2019s maritime service was continuous residence for naturalization purposes and that Kwong was pursuing his vocation for four months aboard an American ship. 345 U.S. at 213-214, 73 S.Ct. 625. <em>Mezei </em>did not affect the holdings in <em>Delgadillo, Di Pasquale, </em>or other cases following them, e. g., Carmichael v. Delaney, 170 F.2d 239 (9th Cir. 1948)' (no \u201centry\u201d occurred after ship to which resident alien was assigned stopped at many ports and alien debarked, because of ship movements pursuant to Navy orders) ; Yukio Chai v. Bonham, 165 F.2d 207 (9th Cir. 1947) (no \u201centry\u201d occurred after ship carrying resident alien back from seasonal cannery work in Alaska made unscheduled stop in Vancouver, B. C.). In Savoretti v. United States ex rel. Pincus, 214 F.2d 314 (5th Cir. 1954), decided after <em>Mezei </em>but relying on <em>Delgadillo </em>and <em>Di Pasquale, </em>a resident alien was held not to have made a new entry after the fishing boat on which he was sleeping (after some serious drinking) made an unscheduled stop in Bimini to sit out heavy weather. <em>Delgadillo </em>and <em>Di Pasquale, </em>in fact, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>incorporated into the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act by \u00a7 101(a) (13), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a) (13), which provides that an alien</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-4\">shall not be regarded as making an entry into the United States for the purposes of the immigration laws if the alien proves * * * that his departure * * * was not intended or reasonably to be expected by him or his presence in a foreign port or place * * * was not voluntary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">Rosenberg v. Fleuti, 374 U.S. 449, 83 S.Ct. 1804 (1963) (5-4) construed this provision to mean that a resident alien had not made an \u201centry\u201d when he returned to the United States from a two hour trip to Ensenada, Mexico. The Court, relying on both <em>Delgadillo </em>and <em>Di Pasquale, </em>examined extensively the legislative history, saying</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b973-8\">The most basic guide to congressional intent as to the reach of the exceptions is the eloquent language of <em>Di Pasquale </em>and <em>Delgadillo </em>themselves, beginning with the recognition that the \u201cinterests at stake\u201d for the resident alien are \u201cmomentous,\u201d 158 F.2d, at 879, and that \u201c[t]he stakes are indeed high and momentous for the alien who has acquired his residence here,\u201d 332 U.S., at 391, 68 S.Ct. 12. This general premise of the two decisions impelled the more general conclusion that \u201cit is * * * important that the continued enjoyment of * * * [our] hospitality once granted, shall not be subject to meaningless and irrational hazards.\u201d 158 F.2d at 879. See also <em>Delgadillo, supra, </em>332 U.S. at 391, 68 S.Ct. 12. Coupling these essential principles of the two decisions explicitly approved by Congress in enacting \u00a7 101(a) (13) with the more general observation, appearing in <em>Delgadillo </em>as well as elsewhere, that \u201c[d]eportation can be the equivalent of banishment or exile,\u201d it is difficult to conceive that Congress meant its approval of the liberalization wrought by <em>Di Pasquale </em>and <em>Del-gadillo </em>to be interpreted mechanistically to apply only to cases presenting factual situations identical to what was involved in those two decisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"akg-dedup-0\">374 U.S. at 458-459, 83 S.Ct. at 1810 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b973-12\">The decision concludes, significantly for our case, \u201cthat it effectuates congressional purpose to construe the intent exception to \u00a7 101(a) (13) as meaning an intent to depart in a manner which can be regarded as meaningfully interruptive of the alien\u2019s permanent residence.\u201d 374 U.S. at 462, 83 S.Ct. at 1812. The Court mentions three factors \u2014the length of time of absence, the purpose of the visit, and the necessity of procuring travel documents, <em>id., </em>but leaves the development of these and \u201cother possibly relevant\u201d factors to \u201c \u2018the gradual process of judicial inclusion and exclusion,\u2019 Davidson v. New Orleans, 96 U.S. 97, 104 * * *., 24 L.Ed. 616.\u201d 374 U.S. at 462, 83 S.Ct. at 1812.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-13\">That process helps to point the way for us.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-14\">The Ninth Circuit, following <em>Di Pasquale </em>and <em>Fleuti, supra, </em>in Wadman v. INS, 329 F.2d 812 (9th Cir. 1964), held that a five day absence from the United States by an alien vacationing in Mexico was not an interruption of \u201ccontinuous\u201d physical presence permitting deportation. Even more apposite, perhaps, is the Seventh Circuit decision in Zimmerman v. Lehmann, 339 F.2d 943 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 381 U.S. 925, 85 S.Ct. 1559, 14 L.Ed.2d 683 (1965). There the court, quoting at length from <em>Fleuti, </em>held that neither a five- or six-day \u201charmless, innocent\u201d vacation in Canada in 1952 nor a less than 24-hour trip to Canada in 1953 constituted an illegal \u201centry\u201d within \u00a7 101(a) (13) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-15\">We believe the Congressional purpose underlying the Act would best be served by a similar holding here. The time factor is, to be sure, longer than in <em>Zimmerman, Wadman or Fleuti, </em>but it is still limited to three weeks, and is fairly characterized as only temporary. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>purpose of Itzcovitz\u2019s planned trip is in a real sense for the benefit of his employer; he is not merely vacationing, as were the petitioners in the other cases just mentioned. True, he doesn\u2019t have to go, but whether he would be able to ke\u00e9p his job, much less advance himself, without going to Tel Aviv is doubtful.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In any event, he has been directed by his employer to go. In a general sense Itzcovitz \u201cintends\u201d to go to Tel Aviv, just as Fleuti intended to go to Mexico. But appellant is not in the posture of having taken the trip in disregard of the immigration consequences; rather he has here sought relief in advance. The purpose of his trip is entirely <em>bona fide, </em>honorable and lawful. He has every intention of retaining permanently his residence in the United States. And, indeed, the sole purpose of the three week trip is to qualify him for more useful employment service as he continues his permanent residence. Under these circumstances \u2014 and we consider them limited \u2014 we do not think appellant\u2019s trip to Tel A\u201eviv will be \u201cmeaningfully interrup-tive\u201d of his permanent residence \u201cwithin the meaning and ameliorative intent of the exception to \u00a7 101(a) (13).\u201d Rosenberg v. Fleuti, <em>supra, </em>374 U.S. at 461, 462, 83 S.Ct. at 1812.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">Our task in this, a case of statutory interpretation, has been made a little easier since Congress has had the gloss of <em>Fleuti </em>before it, for seven years, without tightening subsection (13) of the statute, or indeed changing it, even while changing provision after provision of subdivision (a) of \u00a7 101.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">Accordingly, we reverse and remand with direction to the court below to grant appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment and declare that appellant may take his proposed business trip.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b969-7\">.
