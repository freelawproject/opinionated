Lewis, appeals from a judgment of conviction, entered after a jury trial, on both counts of the indictment against him. Count 1 charged Lewis with giving an Inspector of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) $200 to induce him to furnish information from confidential files of the IRS in violation of Section 201(b) of Title 18, United States Code. Count 2 was based on the same facts but charged that the $200 was given for official acts being performed by the Investigator, namely, the investigation of misconduct and corruption on the part of IRS employees, in violation of subparagraph (f) of Section 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-17\">On motion the Court dismissed Count 2 as a lesser offense included in Count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>1. Our review is thus limited to the alleged errors during the trial which may have affected the conviction on Count 1. Count 1 alleges that the $200 payment was to induce a public official (the official was Harold Wenig [Wenig], an undercover agent of the IRS and an Inspector in the office of the Regional Inspector) \u201cto do an act in violation of his lawful duty, to wit, to furnish information from the offices and confidential files of the Inspection Service, Office of the Regional Inspector, 50 Church Street, New York, N. Y.\u201d The indictment must be read on the assumption that it was Wenig\u2019s lawful duty not to furnish information and that Lewis\u2019 alleged bribe was to cause Wenig to fail to comply with this duty. If there be a crime, it must be found under Section 201(b) (3), namely, inducement of an act \u201cin violation of his lawful duty\u201d \u2014 in short, Wenig was not supposed to disclose anything in the confidential files, or in other words disclosure was unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Lewis argues that he was entrapped as a matter of law and that the Trial Court (1) erroneously excluded evidence that the impetus for his alleged payment of money to Wenig came from the Government and (2) erroneously admitted into evidence testimony bearing no relationship to the charges against him. We reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">These claimed errors are best discussed as the facts are developed in chronological order. The defense of entrapment and governmental impetus thereunder depend upon the circumstances under which Lewis and Wenig first met on April 3, 1967, when the $200 is alleged to have been passed. It is undisputed that Lewis had never met Wenig until another IRS agent, Louis Behar (a mutual friend who has pleaded guilty to making illegal payments to Wenig), brought Lewis to We-nig\u2019s automobile on April 3. To Lewis\u2019 entrapment defense, these circumstances were highly significant and probative. The Government apparently was desirous of having the Wenig-Behar and Wenig-Lewis conversations tape-recorded. Certain of these recorded conversations were admitted at trial; others were excluded. The first recording was of a conversation on March 27, 1967, between Wenig and Behar. Lewis was not present, but he claims that this conversation shows how he was brought into the picture, hence, the relevance of this tape to his entrapment defense. Its exclusion, he asserts, was highly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">\n<em>Exclusion of the March 27, 1967 Conversation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b216-12\">\u201cWithout Wenig the Government had no case\u201d;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by the same token, without Wenig, Lewis had no case on the \u201cinducement\u201d aspect of his entrapment defense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The key to that defense lay in a portion of the recorded conversation which occurred on March 27,1967, between Wenig and Behar. Through an offer of proof (the transcript of the conversation) and the introduction of testimony through Wenig relating to that portion of the conversation referring to Lewis, the defense hoped \u201cto establish entrapment by showing that the impetus for the [April 3, 1967 Wenig-Lewis] meeting came from Wenig and not Lewis.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The pertinent portion of the trial transcript dealing with the conversation, which is reproduced in the margin <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is summarized below.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>The prosecutor appears to have endeavored to anticipate the defense on the issue of \u201cinducement\u201d by opening up the matter of the conversation through We-nig on direct examination. In the face of a sustained general objection to a question defective in form only (\u201cCan you tell the jury what you recall of your conversation with Lewis [sic] Behar regarding David Lewis on that date?\u201d), the prosecutor dropped the subject. On cross-examination, the subject was sought to be reopened when Wenig was asked whether he had asked Behar \u201cto have Lewis communicate with you.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> An objection was raised and sustained on the ground of hearsay. When Wenig was next asked whose initial idea and suggestion it was that Wenig meet Lewis, the prosecutor again objected and was sustained on the grounds of hearsay and exceeding the scope of the direct exam-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>\u00a1nation, despite the defense\u2019s strenuous argument that its line of questioning was for a narrowly limited, important and proper purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">During the continued cross-examination of Wenig following this initial colloquy at the side bar, defense counsel twice sought to elicit testimony or introduce other evidence regarding Behar\u2019s role in allegedly procuring Lewis for contact with Wenig. Each time the court sustained the Government\u2019s objection \u201cfor the reasons indicated at the side bar.\u201d On the second attempt, defense counsel asked the court \u201cto have marked as a court exhibit the transcript of the Behar-Wenig meeting of March 27, 1967, so that the record will be complete.\u201d The court stated, \u201cI don\u2019t see any necessity for marking it.\u201d At the end of trial, in support of his motion to set aside the jury\u2019s verdict, defense counsel handed up a 35-page copy of the transcript referred to, in order to demonstrate that counsel\u2019s earlier offer of proof regarding the con<em>versation </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>that \u201cif Mr. Wenig were asked what he said to Mr. Behar about Mr. Lewis, Mr. Wenig would have testified that he asked Mr. Behar to bring Mr. Lewis. * * * \u201d \u2014 was accurate and had \u201csubstance to it.\u201d The Court had the transcript marked as \u201cCourt Exhibit 1 on motion for a new trial,\u201d but denied the motion on the ground that \u201cthe conversations between Wenig and Behar were at best peripheral and not sufficiently material.\u201d <footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The transcript reveals the following. Wenig showed Behar a list of names and asked him, \u201c[D]o you know any of these names here ?\u201d The first name on the list was that of Lewis. Behar responded, \u201cDavid Lewis is the only one I think I know.\u201d Behar then asked, \u201cOn Dave Lewis, you want me to talk to him?\u201d Wenig answered, \u201cIf you know him?\u201d When Behar said he would talk to his group chief, a Mr. Block, about Lewis, Behar added, \u201cI don\u2019t know Lewis to talk to.\u201d Wenig, undaunted, responded, \u201cOh but Block knows Lewis.\u201d Behar concluded with, \u201cWell, maybe I can find somebody else that knows, maybe Moe Waeks knows.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\"> It would thus appear that the web was woven on March 27, and that Lewis was brought by Behar to Wenig on April 3 at Wenig\u2019s instance, contrary to the prosecution\u2019s theory and Wenig\u2019s testimony that it was Lewis who initiated contact with Wenig through Behar. Given Lewis\u2019 defense of entrapment, it is difficult to conceive how a defense attempt to elicit testimony tending to show Government impetus for the commission of the alleged crime can be regarded as \u201cperipheral.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-12\">In Lopez v. United States,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the Supreme Court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-13\">\u201cThe conduct with which the defense of entrapment is concerned is the <em>manufacturing </em>of crime by law enforcement officials and their agents. * * Thus before the issue of entrapment can fairly be said to have been presented in a criminal prosecution there must have been at least some showing of the kind of conduct by government agents which may well have induced the accused to commit the crime.\u201d (Emphasis in the original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-14\">In United States v. Morrison,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> a panel of this court expanded on the nature and thus the conduct of the entrapment defense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-15\">\u201cWe take this opportunity to restate what was implicit in our former decision [United States v. Pugliese, 346 F.2d 861 (2 Cir. 1965)]: assuming that the government has initiated or set in motion the acts of the defendant, the entrapment defense probes not only the predisposition of the defendant to commit the crime with which he is charged, but alternatively, the conduct of the government in promoting the commission of the crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>Moreover, with respect to the question whether Behar, as Wenig\u2019s agent, induced Lewis to commit the crimes, the defense had the burden of proof.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That burden consisted merely of showing \u201cthe Government\u2019s initiation of the crime and not * * * degree of pressure exerted.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Lewis was improperly denied a critical opportunity to meet this burden by the Trial Court\u2019s refusal to permit cross-examination of Wenig with respect to the conversation regarding Lewis, and the jury was thereby precluded from considering the impact of alleged Government instigation as well as Lewis\u2019 alleged predisposition to commit the crime charged. This clearly was far from \u201charmless error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The Government argues that both of the Trial Court\u2019s stated reasons for preventing defense counsel from cross-examining with respect to the conversation, as it bore on who initiated contact as between Wenig and Lewis, were correct. These grounds were that the line of questioning went beyond the scope of the Government\u2019s direct examination and that in any event Wenig\u2019s testimony would be inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">This court\u2019s rule with respect to the scope of cross-examination continues to be that it is limited to the \u201csubject matter of the examination in chief,\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or in more modern parlance to \u201cthe limited scope of the direct examination.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> While enforcement of this rule generally is within the trial court\u2019s discretion,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> in a close case the rule must not be so strictly applied as to deprive the defense of an opportunity to present to the jury a vital element of the defense, here Government \u201cinducement,\u201d an element of the entrapment defense on which the accused has the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">Our inquiry is directed to whether the matter of the conversation was sufficiently opened up by the Government on Wenig\u2019s direct examination to entitle the defense to probe into whether it was Wenig rather than Lewis who provided the impetus for the fateful April 3 meeting. Just before the prosecutor asked the excluded question directing Wenig generally to recall the conversation, the following question was posed, \u201cAt this [March 27] meeting with Mr. Behar, did you have any conversation regarding David Lewis?\u201d Wenig replied, \u201cYes, I did.\u201d The excluded question was then asked, objected to generally and sustained without comment by counsel or the Court. Questions regarding the subject matter of the pertinent part of the conversation were not picked up again until cross-examination of Wenig, when defense counsel asked, \u201cDid you ask Agent Behar to have Lewis communicate with you?\u201d The prosecutor objected, on the ground \u201c[t]hat this is the same material that was objected to, when I tried to bring it out on direct examination, by Mr. Lon din.\u201d The objection was sustained under the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-13\">Under any generally accepted theory or definition of \u201cscope,\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> there is no doubt that the subject matter of the conversation was sufficiently opened up for searching inquiry on cross-examination.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The purpose of the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>clearly was to lay the foundation for further questioning of Wenig on direct regarding the subject matter of that portion of the conversation. Rather than formulate a more narrowly framed question not violative of the hearsay rule, not a burdensome curative measure, the prosecution ceased to pursue that line of questioning and took up the matter of a March 30, 1967 telephone conversation with Behar (the contents of which also were not explored on direct), which provided the logical transition into the matter of the April 3 meeting, initially comprised of Wenig, Lewis and Behar. Thus, absent cross-examination as to the conversation, the jury was left by the prosecution with a strong and unrebutted inference that it was Lewis through corrupt middleman Behar, rather than We-nig through Behar, who arranged the April 3 meeting.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-4\">Wigmore points out that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmeR\">\u201c[u]nder the <em>Federal rule, </em>it is clear that nothing prohibits cross-examination to one\u2019s own ease where the calling party has been allowed (ante \u00a7 1883) in his direct examination to bring out facts in rebuttal of a prospective defense * * * \u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (emphasis in the original: footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">That is exactly what happened below. For reasons unexplained, the prosecutor decided to ask Wenig on direct examination about the conversation specifically as it related to Lewis. Obviously the prosecutorial purpose in raising this special aspect of the conversation was to anticipate or preempt the defense\u2019s entrapment case by attempting to show on direct that there was no possible Government instigation of the alleged criminal events of April 3. That the prosecutor failed on direct to continue upon its charted course once it hit choppy seas could not prevent the defense from taking the wheel on cross-examination. The prohibition of cross-examination unfairly deprived the defense of the opportunity for far-ranging cross-examination of We-nig on the subject of the conversation and left the jury with an impression clearly unfavorable to Lewis, based on highly fragmentary circumstantial evidence.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">The chief, if not sole, virtue advanced on behalf of the restrictive \u201cFederal rule\u201d is that it ensures that the customary order for the introduction of proof is preserved by preventing the cross-examiner from eliciting evidence for its affirmative case. Surely that rationale, laboring under long-levied criticism by eminent authorities,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> is thoroughly subverted where it is applied even though the prosecution on direct is permitted to open the door to a matter bearing directly upon the defense\u2019s case in chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">With respect to the hearsay argument, the Government contends (1) that none of Behar\u2019s March 27 statements were admissible because of their hearsay nature and (2) that several of Wenig\u2019s Statements on the occasion of the conversation were likewise inadmissible hearsay because they \u201ccontain hearsay declarations previously made by Behar, the out-of-court declarant.\u201d Returning to the record: defense counsel asked Wenig, \u201cDid you ask Agent Behar to have Lewis communicate with you ?\u201d The prosecutor objected and was sustained by the court on the ground of hearsay. It</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>is clear that no hearsay answer was called for; Wenig was a sworn witness testifying in court, subject to cross-examination (here via re-direct), who was asked to answer a question posed for the narrow but highly important purpose \u201cof the entrapment defense [whether] the impetus to the meeting came from Wenig [the witness] and not Lewis.\u201d No out-of-court statement of any stripe by an unsworn out-of-court declarant, offered for the truth of the assertion, was called for, directly or indirectly, by the question, and it should therefore have been allowed.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Whether \u201cWenig\u2019s request for the [April 3] interview was just one little pebble on the beach of this whole matter and [whether] there had been a great deal that went on before that indicated that Lewis was the initiator,\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> would have been a proper subject for Government coverage on re-direct \u2014 not a basis for exclusion on hearsay grounds, as the Trial Court ruled. Returning to the transcript: Wenig asked Behar whether he recognized any of the names on a list shown to Behar on which Lewis\u2019 name was the first. A question put to Wenig whether he had shown such a list to Behar and asked him, \u201c[D]o you know any of these names here ?\u201d clearly would have been proper under the hearsay rule.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> After a brief conversational interlude, Wenig returned to the matter of the names on the list:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">Wenig: \u201c * * * So this is-a-The other fellows you don\u2019t know, Fennell, Kosyn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-6\">Behar: \u201cDavid Lewis is an old timer there, Group Chief I used to have, Group Chief he\u2019s no longer there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-9\">\u201cI don\u2019t know them at all. David Lewis is the only one I think I know.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-10\">Later on, when Behar asked, \u201cOn David Lewis, you want me to talk to him?\u201d, Wenig replied, \u201cIf you know him?\u201d Neither of these sentences fall into the inadmissible hearsay category because the sentences clearly had no assertive or testimonial <em>import </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>their truth or falsity was irrelevant; the respective utterances went solely to the declarants\u2019 states of mind vis-a-vis the initial establishment of contact of Wenig with Lewis through Behar to induce the commission of the crimes charged. This latter rationale, constituting an exception to the hearsay rule,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> is likewise applicable to Behar\u2019s cautionary remark, \u201cI don\u2019t know Lewis to talk to,\u201d and Wenig\u2019s immediate follow-up, ' of \u201cOh but Block knows Lewis.\u201d The truth or falsity of the respective declarants\u2019 statements that Behar didn\u2019t know Lewis \u201cto talk to\u201d or \u201cBlock knows Lewis\u201d was irrelevant. The statements were relevant \u201cimpliedly, indirectly or inferentially [to] indicate the existence of the mental or emotional state that they are tendered to prove [here, Wenig\u2019s persistence in attempting to establish contact with Lewis, as evidenced by his coming up with a suggested alternative means of communication with Lewis when Behar indicated that he knew of none],\u201d which in turn became relevant as circumstantial evidence of other facts<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> (here \u201cto inform the jury that the subsequent meeting and payment was induced by Wenig\u2019s instructions to Behar, not by Lewis\u2019 instructions to Behar.\u201d).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-15\">The court\u2019s exclusion of defense counsel\u2019s question and the closing off of any questioning of Wenig with respect to the conversation deprived the jury of important evidence necessary in considering whether the defense had sustained its burden of proof on the issue of Government \u201cinducement\u201d as part of the entrapment defense and in our opinion was highly prejudicial to Lewis. The erroneous evidentiary ruling below effectively cut off a vital aspect of Lewis\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>defense and his cause was seriously-prejudiced thereby as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">\n<em>The Wenig-Lewis Meeting of April 3, 1967</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Lewis had been an IRS employee auditing taxpayers\u2019 returns for some 21 years. Wenig, using frequently the alias or code name of \u201cSpringer,\u201d was assigned the task of ferreting out IRS employees suspected of taking bribes. In pursuit of this assignment Wenig arranged to meet Lewis, whom he had never spoken with or met. The meeting was brought about as previously outlined and took place in Manhattan on April 3, 1967. Behar brought Lewis to the meeting place and introduced him to Wenig. Shortly thereafter Behar departed, leaving Lewis and Wenig alone in Wenig\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Wenig\u2019s car, and Wenig himself, were well equipped with modern electronic transmitting and recording devices. Secreted behind the glove compartment was a microphone attached to a wire which ran into the trunk of the car where a Butoba tape recorder was located. Wenig carried, concealed on his person, a radio transmitter and a wire recorder with microphone attachment. Other IRS agents photographed the meeting from another car. Therefore, whatever occurred between Wenig and Lewis on that day should be as well perpetuated by sight and sound as modern electronic science permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">Wenig opened the conversation by telling Lewis that he had information that concerned Lewis and dropped the names of a \u201cfew of the boys\u201d who could vouch for what he (Wenig) had done. He threw out bait for other names that he would be willing to see but because it was risky he, Wenig, had \u201cto \u2022 make a piece of bread.\u201d On the basis of some papers that \u201cI Xeroxed from the file,\u201d Wenig disclosed to Lewis that two reliable informants knew about Lewis\u2019 \u201cmanipulations with stocks,\u201d particularly about his \u201ctrading in new issues\u201d in 1961 (some six years earlier) and his \u201ckickbacks of [70% of] the profits to the brokers,\u201d while \u201cat the same time you [Lewis] legitimized some of your money that you couldn\u2019t show.\u201d Wenig further volunteered that \u201cthey\u201d \u201calso have good information that you recommend accountants to certain people which is a violation of the rule,\u201d that \u201cthey have your tax returns,\u201d and that \u201c[t]hey are also interested in the fact that they might be able to get you on the speculation angle where it says an [IRS] employee is not to speculate, Dave.\u201d Wenig added that \u201cthey have a lot of information that\u2019s very detailed,\u201d including \u201csome information that the money was accumulated through a series of bribes that you accepted.\u201d Wenig increased Lewis\u2019 uneasiness by telling him, \u201cOh yeah you\u2019ll probably be called in\u201d and concluded his presentation of \u201cfacts\u201d with the following flourish, \u201cThey got a lot of stuff, there\u2019s a lot of stuff in that file, and [although] I haven\u2019t read * * 90% of it, * * * it\u2019s dynamite.\u201d Very shortly after this point came the following conversation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-11\">\u201cLewis: Take this down here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-12\">Wenig: All right \u2014 ah\u2014O.K., good.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-13\">Lewis: Uh \u2014 little envelope for you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-14\">Wenig: Oh, oh, O.K. good, fine, fine. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-15\">Lewis: Uh \u2014 Harold, uh \u2014 many many years I\u2019ve been working on these publicly listed corporations.

Lewis initially was disinterested, when Wenig raised the spectre of his friend\u2019s bringing the alleged Lewis investigation \u201cto a conclusion that\u2019s uh unfavorable.\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019m not concerned abo,ut that, ah, Harold\u201d; \u201cWell, well you know you have to trust in God too, Harold\u201d; \u201c * * * I mean nothing\u2019s guaranteed in this life * * * \u201d Unsuccessful thus far in getting Lewis to offer money or a specific amount, Wenig began to apply pressure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-8\">\u201cThe thing is this, what do you want me to do?

He might, ah, he might then know what tack to take in completing the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">When Wenig asked Lewis what would happen if Wenig\u2019s friend would not \u201cfeel your interest,\u201d Lewis responded: \u201cWell, that\u2019s a chance I will have to take Harold, because uh frankly, I am not concerned about it as I say ah, nobody can be above God.\u201d Because Lewis still did not indicate that he wanted anything to be done, Wenig asked him, \u201cWhat\u2019s the sense of pulling punches,\u201d and added, \u201c[Y]ou want to live in a false sense of security, * * * that\u2019s up to you. But ah it\u2019s ah best ah to know ah the truth even if it\u2019s pessimistic. Right?\u201d Lewis answered, \u201c[L]et me put it this way Harold. I haven\u2019t done anything wrong so I\u2019m not concerned.\u201d Lewis was worried, however, because \u201cin the last few years I [have] seen several fellows who haven\u2019t done anything wrong who have been discredited\u201d; moreover, since, as Wenig reminded him, Lewis had only two years of IRS service remaining before retirement, although \u201cthere\u2019s no truth to the thing,\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t take the aggravation.\u201d This conversation was summarized by each party\u2019s conclusion: Lewis, \u201cIt\u2019s better to say nothing at all to him\u201d; Wenig, \u201c[Y]ou didn\u2019t give me any leeway ah, or any ah specific ah ah, figures or anything so I got to ah just ah,\u201d to which Lewis interrupted, \u201cLook Harold, I think this thing will be forced to a close on its merits. Let me say that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-14\">\n<em>The Prosecution\u2019s Opening Statement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b223-15\">In his opening statement to the jury, the prosecutor characterized the function of the IRS Inspection Service in the following manner: \u201cThey investigate allegations of bribery, corruption and other misconduct by Internal Revenue agents such as Mr. Lewis \u2014 \u201d This sentence, the meaning of which is at best ambiguous, must have left a distinct impression in the jurors\u2019 minds that Lewis was guilty of \u201cbribery, corruption, or other misconduct.\u201d Near the conclusion of his remarks, the prosecutor stated that \u201c[t]he Government will also prove that the facts of the Inspection Service investigation of Lewis were true,\u201d which in the prosecutor\u2019s own words earlier included \u201cillegally obtained bribe money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b223-16\">Thus at the outset the jury must have obtained the impression that Lewis had accepted bribes from taxpayers. There was no proof whatsoever of this assertion. The prosecution, however, was permitted to introduce proof that Lewis had in the past purchased various stocks which the prosecutor characterized as speculations. Again without any proof even to support an inference, the Government proceeded on the theory that Lewis\u2019 stock transactions were to \u201clegitimize\u201d his bribe moneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-17\">\n<em>Lewis' Stock Transactions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b223-18\">After Lewis entered Wenig\u2019s car and Behar left, Wenig immediately pursued his assigned task. He produced two cards from which he read information purportedly contained thereon, namely, \u201cthat the inspection service had two informants that were giving information regarding David Lewis and his manipulations in the stock market and his deals with legitimizing certain monies that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>had.\u201d Wenig told Lewis that the Inspection Service knew that in 1961 Lewis was speculating in new issues and was \u201ckicking back\u201d to brokers seventy percent of his profits. This was not \u201cnew\u201d information to Lewis.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">At this point the prosecutor asked Wenig, \u201cWhat does that term [legitimizing money to Mr. Lewis] mean?\u201d Whereupon, although saying that, \u201cThis is just to illustrate, this is not evidence that that was the fact in this case,\u201d the Court, over objection, permitted the following answer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">\u201cAs I was saying, where one has large sums of illicit money or illegally gotten money, money that may have been stolen or accumulated through a series of bribes and this person is afraid to spend this money openly because he is afraid that the Internal Revenue Service may audit him some day and then they may question that the money was illicitly gotten, so this person uses a device or mechanism or a scheme whereby he makes this money appear legitimately, appear legitimate so that he could spend it without fear of investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">\u201cFor example, if a gentleman had large sums of money that he couldn\u2019t show, bribe money, and he had a business on the side and he then would declare large nonexistent profits coming from this business, or what he may do, he may work with a stockbroker and have this stockbroker give him new issues of stock which would be bound to make money, bound to go up in value and then when he sells this stock at a good profit give back to the stockbroker 70 percent of his money and then he would be able to bring out the illegitimate cash and spend it openly without fear of any investigation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Although the Court described Wenig\u2019s answer to the Government\u2019s questions concerning \u201clegitimizing money\u201d and \u201cmanipulation\u201d as a \u201chypothetical statement\u201d and \u201cnot evidence,\u201d the jury could only have obtained the impression that it was directed solely at Lewis and that Wenig knew that his assumptions were actual facts. The answer was as damning to Lewis as any <em>Bruton </em><footnotemark>25</footnotemark> confession might have been \u2014 an impression that no instruction or charge could eliminate. The jury thus were told without any supporting proof that Lewis had \u201clarge sums of illicit money or illegally gotten money * * * accumulated through a series of bribes * * * [and was] afraid that the Internal Revenue Service may audit him some day * * * [and that he used] a device or mechanism or a scheme whereby he makes [made] this money appear legitimately [sic] * * * \u201d. There was no proof of \u201cillegally gotten money\u201d or of a \u201cseries of bribes\u201d despite the Government\u2019s opening statement that it would prove that Lewis had been taking bribes.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">The rest of the answer was even more pointedly directed at Lewis and was equally without factual foundation. Wenig was saying that a \u201cgentleman\u201d (Lewis) who didn\u2019t want to show \u201cbribe money\u201d might \u201cwork with a stockbroker and have the stockbroker give him new issues of stock which would be bound to make money\u201d and from this profit this gentleman would \u201cgive back to the stockbroker 70 per cent of his money\u201d [the very percentage the Government claims here] and be able to spend the \u201cillegitimate cash\u201d without fear of investigation. Wenig also accused Lewis of \u201cmanipulating new issues\u201d but his understanding of the term \u201cmanipulating\u201d was that giving 70 per cent of the profits to a broker was \u201cmanipulating\u201d and that this gave \u201ca false appearance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">Wenig\u2019s answer as to his conception of \u201cmanipulation\u201d is so patently erroneous as to need no other refutation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaR\">\u201cWhat I\u2019m talking about the manipulation is when this stock is sold that he\u2019s giving 70 per cent of the profits to this particular broker and he is, therefore, manipulating with this stock be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>cause if you look up the definition of manipulation this is what it is, it is the act of performing in such an efficient manner the purpose to give a false appearance, the false appearance is that he was making all the money. He wasn\u2019t making all the money. This is what I am trying to get at, what I mean by stock manipulation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">With respect to the stock speculation, it was the Government\u2019s theory that Lewis and his regular 1961 broker (an Abbott Glasser then of Bruns, Norde-man &amp; Co.) had an arrangement whereby Glasser allowed Lewis to purchase a portion of certain new issues which were allegedly guaranteed to rise in value. When these new issues turned over a quick profit to Lewis, he would give (\u201ckick back\u201d) 70% of his profits to Glasser, thereby enabling Lewis to account for unspecified bribes allegedly received from taxpayers.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Abbott Glasser, a former registered broker presently in the hair weaving business, took the stand under a grant of immunity from prosecution for income tax evasion. He testified that Lewis in 1961 had given him a substantial portion of his profits on three stock transactions, some $5,500 out of $8,000 profits in the aggregate. Glasser in turn \u201ckicked back\u201d all or part of Lewis\u2019 \u201ckickbacks\u201d to him to the underwriters of the three respective issues. Two brokers associated with the underwriters named (Stanley Hilton of Robert Martin Associates and George Searight of Searight, Ahalt <em>&amp; </em>O\u2019Connor) took the stand to corroborate Glasser\u2019s s.tory with respect to the kickbacks. Searight on cross-examination testified that it was not a violation of NASD rules for a broker to get \u201ckickbacks\u201d from his customer and that he did not know whether it was improper for a broker to get a \u201ckickback\u201d from his customer\u2019s profits in return for selling him securities. The Government never introduced any proof to rebut Sea-right\u2019s understanding of the law. The prosecutor did, however, attempt to infer impropriety by eliciting testimony from Glasser, Searight and Hilton that they had never participated in any kickback arrangement other than the Lewis transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">The only purposes which the introduction of these stock transactions could have served in the minds of the jury was that there was something highly illegal in them which Lewis sought to conceal by bribing Wenig or as indicating circumstantially that Lewis had taken bribes in the past. However, there was no claim that there was any law which prohibited Lewis from sharing profits with brokers and no proof that Lewis did not pay the full income tax due on any such profits. In fact, the contrary was established and the Government does not claim otherwise. It is not disputed that Lewis properly reported all his stock transactions and his profits on his 1961 tax returns and paid the tax thereon. Nor was there proof that Lewis had taken bribes in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">On summation, the prosecutor further capitalized on his \u201ckickback\u201d theory by pointing to the immunity granted to the brokers, thus making it appear that the giving and receiving of a share in Lewis\u2019 profits was a crime. Lewis\u2019 \u201c$30,000 to $40,000 trading in his own account\u201d was stressed. The prosecution sought to find a motive for the payment in order \u201cto hide those kickbacks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">The prejudicial nature of the introduction and characterization of Lewis\u2019 stock market activities is further emphasized by the Government\u2019s argument upon appeal that \u201c[fjurther evidence that Lewis was predisposed to commit the crime charged is found in the kickbacks that he made to stockbrokers of his profits on the sale of new issues of stock.\u201d Although evidence of prior crimes under circumstances may be admissible, here not only was there no showing that profit-sharing with a broker was a violation of law or IRS rules and regulations (despite Wenig\u2019s gratuitous and unfounded suggestion to the contrary) but no proof was even offered that such a practice by a stockbroker was prohibited by any stock exchange, NASD or firm rule or custom. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>The importance of this proof as influencing the jury\u2019s verdict is stressed by the Government\u2019s own statement that \u201c[t]he jury obviously credited the brokers\u2019 testimony as to these payoffs [a term, like \u201ckickback,\u201d sounding on wrongdoing] and disbelieved Lewis\u2019 denials.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">\n<em>Recommending an Accountant</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Wenig told Lewis that he had information that Lewis had recommended an accountant, which Wenig told the jury was \u201ca violation of the Internal Revenue Service rules and regulations.\u201d There was no proof adduced at trial that Lewis\u2019 admitted recommendation of an accountant in a non-IRS-connected case violated any IRS rule or regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">\n<em>The Use of a Different Name</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">The Government (through Wenig), to further prejudice him in the minds of the jury, was permitted to introduce testimony that Lewis had told Wenig of a week-end trip to the Catskills (several years ago according to Lewis) with a religious group on which occasion Lewis did not give his right name. How this testimony bore any relationship to a predisposition to commit the crime of bribing a Revenue Agent in 1967 to deviate from his duty is beyond comprehension. The incident could only have been introduced to besmirch Lewis and was so used by the prosecution in summation. It was not only remote in time but completely irrelevant to the crime charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Finally, not content with these character-besmirching innuendoes, the prosecutor over defense objection told the jury on summation (assertedly by way of \u201can analogy\u201d) of former New York City Water Commissioner Marcus, a man supposedly of good character, who recently had been convicted of bribery in a case much featured in the public press.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">This court\u2019s comment in United States v. Tomaiolo,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-12\">\u201cIn summary, by receiving this mass of inadmissible, irrelevant and highly prejudicial testimony, the District Court permitted the prosecution to paint the defendant Tomaiolo as a bad man, associated with criminal companions, who would do most anything. The accumulation of these errors made it impossible for the jury to limit its consideration to the charges for which Tomaiolo was being tried, and in sum, they constitute reversible error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-13\">Appellant\u2019s other points need not be passed upon at this time. We are mindful of the force of a jury verdict but are convinced that the verdict could well have been based upon such prejudicial and inadmissible proof as would warrant the conclusion that Lewis was deprived of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-14\">The Government\u2019s use of the stock transactions, its characterization of Lewis\u2019 profit-sharing as \u201ckickbacks,\u201d the implied illegal nature thereof by pointing to the testimony of the brokers under a grant of immunity, Wenig\u2019s testimony as to his interpretation of \u201clegitimizing\u201d and \u201cmanipulation,\u201d all combined must have had an effect on the jury which diverted it from the charges for which Lewis was being tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-15\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b216-6\">.

Though we find no dispositive hearsay problem, to which <em>Manfredonia </em>speaks, we note that to have called Behar as a defense witness would have entailed considerable risks which in all likelihood outweighed any possible benefits. Behar was an IRS agent who had been compromised by, in-dieted for, and had pleaded guilty to making illegal payments to Wenig, and therefore could hardly have been expected to give favorable and creditable testimony for the defense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b216-14\">.
