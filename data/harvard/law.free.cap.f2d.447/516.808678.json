Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., 5th Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 409, Part I.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b596-18\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b596-19\">Marvin Spencer Johnson, a federal prisoner, appeals from the District Court\u2019s dismissal of his petition for ha-beas corpus. The court below held that appellant\u2019s proper remedy would be a motion to vacate judgment and sentence, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, filed in Johnson\u2019s sentencing court, the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-20\">Johnson was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 495. The District Court for the District of Wyoming sentenced him to a four year prison term, and he was sent to the La Tuna Federal Correctional Institution at Anthony, New Mexico-Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-21\">After serving some six months of his sentence, Johnson filed in the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit a self-drawn \u201cWrit of Habeas Corpus to Vacate and Sat (sic) Aside Sentence.\u201d The Tenth Circuit treated this document as a petition for writ of habeas corpus and transferred it to the District Court for the District of New Mexico. That court, however, did not have jurisdiction to consider a habeas corpus petition, since Johnson was actually being held in Texas.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The New Mexico District Court returned Johnson\u2019s petition to the Tenth Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-22\">The Tenth Circuit then transferred Johnson\u2019s petition to the District Court for the Western District of Texas. The original petition, and some exhibits, which apparently had been attached to it, were lost in transmittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-23\">On the basis of the record presented to it, the Texas District Court held that the petition for writ of habeas corpus should be dismissed. Johnson had not made the required showing that a motion under 28 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 would be inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The ruling of the District Court was clearly correct. Craft v. United States, 433 F.2d 981 (5th Cir. 1970); Accardi v. Blackwell, 412 F.2d 911 (5th Cir. 1969); Birchfield v. United States, 296 F.2d 120 (5th Cir. 1961). Nevertheless, we note that Johnson has never had his case for post-conviction relief heard on its merits. Our decision is in no way intended to preclude Johnson from filing a properly designated \u00a7 2255 motion in the District Court for the District of Wyoming.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b596-24\">. The city of Anthony sits on the New Mexico-Texas border. Though the city itself is in New Mexico, the federal prison is located across the Texas line.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
