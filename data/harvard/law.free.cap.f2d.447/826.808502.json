On January 16, 1969, he testified as a defense witness at the trial of Jack W. Baum. As a result of that testimony, a nine-count perjury indictment was returned against him on January 28, 1969. The judge who had presided at the Baum trial also conducted appellant\u2019s trial. The jury found him guilty on Counts III and IV and not guilty on the other seven counts; the judge sentenced him to imprisonment for three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-23\">Each of the nine counts of perjury charged a conflict between testimony given by appellant on cross-examination in the Baum trial and statements which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>he made on June 27, 1967, to Inspectors Weber and Pazdziora, who were then investigating alleged irregularities in an audit examination he had conducted in 1961. The audit involved returns for certain clients of Baum, an attorney, and was conducted in Baum\u2019s offices. It had been alleged, in substance, that appellant had found an aggregate deficiency of about $20,000 for the years 1958, 1959 and 1960, which, together with other circumstances, warranted a 50% fraud penalty. Baum allegedly had caused appellant not to make a fraud referral by giving him false information to include in his report and offering him a bribe of $3,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">The principal false information given to appellant was Baum\u2019s explanation of the understatement of income; Baum had said the taxpayer, a masonry contractor, had incorrectly set up a contingent liability for pending litigation relating to certain jobs. There was no basis in fact for this explanation. The Government contended, in both the Baum trial and in appellant\u2019s perjury trial, that ordinary diligence would have revealed the fraud and that appellant had deliberately prepared a false Revenue Agent\u2019s Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">We recently affirmed Baum\u2019s conviction. United States v. Baum, 435 F.2d 1197 (7th Cir. 1970). There were three counts to Baum\u2019s indictment: (1) conspiracy to evade his clients\u2019 taxes; (2) an attempt to bribe appellant; and (3) the procurement of a false Revenue Agent\u2019s Report. Baum was convicted on. the first and third counts but found not guilty of the attempted bribery. Appellant and one Samuel Carmel, an associate of Baum\u2019s, were named as co-defendants on the conspiracy count, but were severed ; as far as the record here discloses, appellant has never been tried on that charge and, therefore, still retains his presumption of innocence (which, of course, is consistent with the jury\u2019s acquittal of Baum on the Count II charge of attempted bribery).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">At the Baum trial appellant\u2019s direct testimony was quite brief. He stated that he had conducted the audit in Baum\u2019s office during the summer of 1961. On one hot day, Carmel (Baum\u2019s alleged co-conspirator) invited him into an air-conditioned private office and offered him a short term interest free loan to buy some stock that was sure to increase in value promptly. He construed the conversation as a bribe overture; he replied to the overture by stating that he would think it over; later, according to his testimony, he reported the incident orally to his superior.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He denied that Baum ever offered him money.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">There were two parts to the cross-examination of appellant. The first was clearly within the scope of the direct examination. In that part of his cross, appellant acknowledged that he considered Carmel\u2019s proposal as an overture to a bribe and that he suspected Carmel to be an intermediary for Baum.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">Thereafter Baum\u2019s lawyer objected to additional questions as going beyond the scope of the direct examination. The court stated: \u201cThe scope is as wide open as this case is, counsel, * * * he may inquire into any fact in this case.\u201d The prosecutor then asked the series of questions that gave rise to the perjury indictment. Count III charged that appellant falsely \u201ctestified in substance that during an interview with two Inspectors of the Internal Revenue Service on June 27, 1967, he did not state that possibly Jack W. Baum told him not to make a fraud referral.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">Count IV charged that he falsely testified in substance that during the same interview \u201che did not say \u2018How else could I have arrived at a figure of omitted income if I didn\u2019t specifically identify the jobs involved?' \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b908-11\">This appeal raises a number of questions, including ultimately the question whether the error in the record is of sufficient importance to require a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">The perjury indictment was returned less than two weeks after appellant testified at the Baum trial. The indictment was assigned to the same judge who presided at that trial upon the suggestion of the Government that the two cases were related. Defendant\u2019s motion to have the perjury case transferred to the Executive Committee for reassignment to a different judge was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">We accept the district court\u2019s construction of the applicable rules for the control of its calendar as then in effect,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and find no error in the denial of the motion. We believe, however, that the fact that the assignment procedure enabled the prosecutor to select a judge who may have been persuaded of appellant\u2019s guilt before the trial started is a factor we must take into account in weighing the significance of any error committed during the course of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">After the perjury trial, the jury found appellant guilty on only two of the nine counts; the Judge, however, was convinced that he was guilty on all nine counts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He had witnessed appellant\u2019s testimony in the Baum trial and may well have formed his opinion of appellant\u2019s guilt at that time. Although we neither hold nor imply that this would disable him from conducting the perjury trial in a fair and impartial manner, inevitably it created the risk that the accused\u2019s presumption of innocence might be undermined by an inadvertent comment by the court, or by unintended bias in the exercise of discretion on evidentiary or other rulings. In these circumstances, we believe it would have been better practice to forestall the charge of bias, or appearance thereof, by sending the case back to the Executive Committee for reassignment. The failure to do so, although not error, increased the risk of prejudice to the accused.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b909-20\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-21\">Appellant contends that the alleged false statements were not \u201cmaterial\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>within the meaning of the federal perjury statute.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">Materiality is a question for the court, not the jury, to decide. United States v. Rivera, 448 F.2d 757 (7th Cir. 1971). We do not know the basis of the trial judge\u2019s determination of materiality since he simply indicated that he was familiar with the Baum trial. The Government, however, predicates its claim of materiality on its right to impeach a witness by proving prior inconsistent statements. We agree with the Government that if the statements which appellant made to Inspectors Weber and Pazdziora on June 27, 1967, were inconsistent with his direct testimony at the Baum trial on January 16, 1969, a false denial, on cross-examination, that he had made those statements would clearly be \u201cmaterial\u201d within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">We do not find any inconsistency between the two statements to the Inspectors which, according to Counts III and IV, appellant falsely denied, and his direct testimony. He could have admitted that Baum had possibly asked him not to make a fraud referral and that he had determined the amount of omitted income by specifically identifying the jobs involved without compromising his direct testimony at all. The Government claims that there is an inconsistency with the thrust of the direct testimony, which tended to implicate Carmel, and thereby impliedly to exonerate Baum from responsibility for the bribe overture. This argument falls, however, because prior to any reference to the interview with the Inspectors, appellant had acknowledged that he thought Carmel was an intermediary for Baum. We do not accept the Government\u2019s argument that Counts III and IV charge false denials of prior inconsistent statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\"> As we understand the perjury statute, however, the requirement that the false matter be \u201cmaterial\u201d does not mean that a defendant may excuse false testimony on the ground that an objection to its admissibility should have been sustained. Thus, even if we assume, without deciding, that the court should not have permitted the cross-examination of appellant to go beyond Baum\u2019s narrow interpretation of appellant\u2019s direct testimony, once the court had ruled that the question was proper, the witness had a duty to respond truthfully. <em>Cf., </em>United States v. Manfredonia, 414 F.2d 760 (2nd Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-8\">The subject matter of Counts III and IV, even if not material to appellant\u2019s direct testimony, were certainly material to critical issues in the Baum litigation. An admission by appellant that Baum had possibly asked him not to make a fraud referral would have tended to prove Baum\u2019s guilt; an admission that he specifically identified the jobs involved in the understatement of income would have tended to prove the conspiracy charge because it would have evidenced knowledge of the fraudulent character of Baum's explanation for the erroneous returns. The alleged false testimony had a tendency to influence the trier of facts in the case on trial and was, therefore, material within the meaning of the perjury statute. United States v. Mitchell, 417 F.2d 1246, 1248-1249 (7th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-10\">Appellant offered to prove his reputation for honesty and integrity through the testimony of two group supervisors of the Internal Revenue Service and two agents. The witnesses were qualified to testify to appellant\u2019s reputation in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>community in which he had been employed for many years, but not to his reputation in the community in which he resided. The court sustained the prosecutor\u2019s objection to this line of proof.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">As the Government correctly points out, there is language in the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in Michelson v. United States, 335 U.S. 469, 69 S.Ct. 213, 93 L.Ed. 168, which may be read to require a character witness to know the defendant\u2019s reputation in the community in which he lives.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We believe, however, that the Court\u2019s reference to \u201cthe community in which he has lived and the circles in which he has moved\u201d is broad enough to encompass the circles in which a defendant has been employed, as well as his social relationships. In today\u2019s complex urban society, a man\u2019s reputation among co-workers may well be more significant than his reputation among neighbors, particularly if they are apartment dwellers. Although the Government\u2019s position is not without support,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we believe the better rule is that \u201cthe testimony may extend to the reputation of the witness for truth and veracity in the community where he works as well as that in which he has his home.\u201d State v. Axilrod, 248 Minn. 204, 79 N.W.2d 677, 682 (1956)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">We hold that it was error to exclude the proffered evidence of appellant\u2019s reputation among other members of the Internal Revenue Service.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-9\">Count III charged that appellant falsely denied that he had admitted to the Inspectors that possibly Baum had told him not to make a \u201cfraud referral.\u201d It was, therefore, appropriate to explain that term to the jury. The prosecutor, however, went well beyond an explanation of that term. He tried to convince the jury that appellant was guilty of not making a fraud referral which was plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>ly required by the normal procedures of the Internal Revenue Service in view of the discovery of a tax deficiency as large as $20,000. Thereafter, defendant sought to respond by proving that a Government witness had misdescribed the fraud referral procedure, and that the amount of omitted income in relation to taxpayer\u2019s gross income was not sufficient to make a fraud referral mandatory.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court sustained the prosecutor\u2019s objections to this line of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">Although the trial judge has broad discretion when ruling on the relevance of proffered evidence, it is imperative that on any given issue the same standard be applied to both parties. It was error to give the prosecutor enough latitude to develop his fraud referral contention while applying a narrower standard of relevance to appellant\u2019s attempt to make a fair response to that contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">Appellant also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, the instructions to the jury, and some of the comments of the prosecutor and the court as unduly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">If the jury believed the testimony of Inspectors Weber and Pazdziora, there was adequate evidence of guilt. Contrary to appellant\u2019s argument, we find no ambiguity in his categorical denial of the statements referred to in Counts III and IV. We are also satisfied that the jury was properly instructed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-9\">With one exc\u00e9ption, the challenged comments relate to matters we have already discussed or were of minor significance when read in context. That exception related to the written memorandum prepared by Weber and Pazdziora of their interview with appellant on June 27, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-10\">When appellant was on the witness stand at the Baum trial he had first placed the date of that interview in July. His recollection as to the date was refreshed by showing him the memorandum. He, therefore, knew of the existence of the document and had seen it, but except for a glance at the date he had not read it. The prosecutor had not attempted to refresh his recollection by permitting him to review the specific statements about which the prosecutor inquired.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">In the perjury trial, in closing argument, the prosecutor stated that before appellant perjured himself \u201che was offered the memorandum which was discussed here, prepared by Weber and Pazdziora.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel objected, whereupon the court stated that the record indicated that the memorandum had been proffered to him. In fact, only the date appears to have been shown to appellant and, as we understand the record, neither he nor his counsel was permitted to review its text before he testified. The memorandum was obviously of importance on the issue of appellant\u2019s knowledge of the falsity of his testimony. A fair statement of its availability to the witness should, therefore have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>Viewing the record as a whole, we have concluded that the errors we have identified were of sufficient importance to require a new trial. We also believe that the prosecutor should not retain any possible advantage resulting from his selection of a particular judge with personal knowledge of critical evidenti-ary facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with instructions to transfer it to the Executive Committee for reassignment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b908-12\">.

Although we do not hold that the refusal to retransfer the case was error under then prevailing practice, we note that the recent recommendations of the American Bar Association Special Committee on Standards of Judicial Conduct may re-require a significant re-examination of existing procedure. Proposed Canon 2(c) not only states that a judge should disqualify himself if he has \u201cpersonal knowledge of evidentary facts\u201d (as in this case, since the judge had witnessed the alleged perjury), but also may require criminal cases which have been remanded for a new trial to be heard by a different judge. The broad language of the proposed canon refers to \u201cany proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned\u201d and specifically includes cases in which he \u201chas a fixed belief concerning the merits of the matter before him.\u201d Having heard evidence which satisfied a jury of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the judge sitting at the second trial might well have such a fixed belief concerning the merits. Accordingly, he should give serious consideration to the question whether his presiding at a retrial would create at least an appearance of prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b910-6\">. \u201cWhoever, having taken an oath before a competent tribunal, officer, or person, in any case in which a law of the United States authorizes an oath to be administered, that he will testify, declare, depose, or certify truly, or that any written testimony, declaration, deposition, or certificate by him subscribed, is true, willfully and contrary to such oath states or subscribes any material matter which he does not believe to be true, is guilty of perjury, and shall, except as otherwise expressly provided by law, be fined not more than $2,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. * * * \u201d 18 U.S.O. \u00a7 1621.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b911-10\">. \u201cMr. Makarski: Xour Honor, I object.

Appellant offered copies of taxpayer\u2019s returns for 1958, 1959 and 19G0 showing gross income of $383,520.00, $427,881.37 and $403,873.40 for those years respectively.
