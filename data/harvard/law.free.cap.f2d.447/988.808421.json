None of his assignments of error has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-15\">The record contains substantial evidence to support the District Court\u2019s finding that Arnold was mentally competent at the time he entered his plea of guilty. Likewise, there was substantial evidence to support the District Judge\u2019s finding that he was afforded the effective assistance of counsel in entering his plea. And, finally, we agree with the District Court that Arnold understood the nature of the charges and the consequences of his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-16\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
