Defendants Mark Christian and Evans Daniel testified they had not had sexual relations with Violet Carr on November 8, 1967; defendant Reinhold John testified that he did have sexual intercourse with the girl on that day but that it was consensual, and that he had previously and subsequently had such intercourse with her. The defense adduced testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>corroborating John\u2019s prior and subsequent sexual relationship with Violet Carr, and of her prior frequent sexual relationships with other men. Two defense witnesses, girl friends of Violet, testified that she had a bad reputation as to chastity and credibility. Additionally, the defense placed in evidence Violet\u2019s pre-trial statement, under oath, that the defendants had not raped her.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">It would serve no useful purpose to recite in detail the Government\u2019s evidence adduced at the three-day trial of this case in April, 1969, insofar as defendants\u2019 challenge to its sufficiency to sustain the jury\u2019s guilty verdicts is concerned. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, as we must,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we cannot say that the evidence adduced at the trial did not sustain the jury\u2019s verdicts, although we cannot refrain from the observation that were we the triers of fact, we might well have arrived at a contrary result.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On this score we point out that the rape-complainant\u2019s equivocal testimony and that of a corroborating witness, abstracted in the margin,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> sharply conflicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Defendants\u2019 contentions that prejudicial errors marked the conduct of their trial and the court\u2019s charge to the jury, require, however, that we advert, <em>seri-atim, </em>to certain aspects of defense testimony critical to these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-14\">First:</p>\n<p id=\"b151-15\">Defendant John testified, on direct examination, that, upon Violet\u2019s invitation, he had sexual intercourse with her on November 8, 1967, as he had done both prior and subsequent to that day and that neither Daniel or Christian had sexual intercourse with Violet on November 8, 1967. The prosecutor, on cross-examination, confronted John with a signed statement which he had given to police on the afternoon of November 8, 1967 in which he said that he heard Christian call Violet into Daniel\u2019s home; shortly thereafter he saw the girl sitting on the bed \u201cand Mark [Christian] was holding both her hands upward; then Evans Daniel came in wearing his brief and closed the windows and the door * * * Minnie [Violet] started to scream out and she said \u2018Loose me\u2019 * * * I saw Daniel lay down on Minnie in a position to have sexual intercourse with her * * * Mark was on the bed, holding one hand * * * I stood * * * until Evans got up, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>then I * * * got on her and had sexual intercourse with her * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">John denied, during his cross-examination, that he had made the inculpatory-charges against his co-defendants attributed to him in his statement to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">When the prosecutor confronted John with his statement, and had him read it to the jury, over defense objection, he did not say to the court or the jury that he was doing so for the sole purpose of impeaching John\u2019s oral testimony, on direct examination, exculpating all the defendants from any wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">The trial judge, at that time, did not caution the jury that John\u2019s statement could only serve to impeach his credibility and that it was not to be considered as evidence of his guilt or the guilt of his co-defendants. Nor did he give such cautionary instruction to the jury when John\u2019s statement was offered and admitted into evidence just before he commenced his charge to the jury. And, finally, he gave no such cautionary instruction in his charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">The recited failures to give cautionary instructions with respect to John\u2019s statement constituted error which standing alone would require reversal of the judgments of conviction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The requirement for cautionary instructions in situations such as existed here is of such dimension that even where given a conviction will be reversed when they are \u201c* * * nullified by the manner in which the prosecutor used the confession on cross examination * * *\u201d West v. Henderson, 409 F.2d 95, 97 (6th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">It may be noted, parenthetically, that the Government contends on this appeal, that \u201c * * * the statement was used * * * to impeach the credibility of appellant Reinhold John as a witness, and not to implicate him or any of the Appellants in the crime.\u201d Implicit in that contention is the Government\u2019s recognition of the fact that under well-settled rules John\u2019s statement could only be used to impeach his trial testimony and not as substantive evidence of his guilt or the guilt of Daniel and Christian, and that cautionary instructions should have been given to the jury with respect to the limited scope of the statement\u2019s consideration. To this we add that the Government\u2019s contention comes with ill grace in the light of its failure to make known to the jury at any time during the trial, that its use of John\u2019s statement was intended only to impeach his credibility, and that it could not be considered as evidence of the guilt of John and his co-defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-12\">What has been said brings us to defendants\u2019 contention that there was error in the charge to the jury in failing to instruct it that defense evidence as to the rape-claimant\u2019s bad reputation for chastity and untruthfulness had substantial probative value on the presented issue of consent, and in denying defendants\u2019 requested Instruction (No. 11) to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-13\">The trial judge instructed the jury with reference to the adduced testimony of Violet\u2019s bad reputation for chastity as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-14\">\u201cYou have heard testimony of the kind which I don\u2019t like to relate as to \u2018chastity\u2019 and reputation of this actually young girl. <em>This also has a bearing on it. </em>* * * Now, members of the jury, the fact that she may have been promiscuous with some of these people, or all of them at different times, does not give them a vested interest in their demanding that she perform it at their pleasure. They had no right to assume that they could do with her because of past relations what they pleased, and if on this day they did have intercourse with her against her will, despite previous relations, they <em>ought </em>to be found guilty. I think it is as simple as that, if she consented and didn\u2019t resist, ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>quit them; if she resisted, find them guilty.\u201d (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">It is settled that where the issue of consent of a rape-complainant is presented and evidence is adduced of her bad reputation for chastity, the trial judge is required to instruct the jury that such evidence is \u201cof substantial probative value in judging the likelihood of her consent.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">The naked instruction here anent the chastity evidence, viz., \u201cThis also has a bearing on it,\u201d manifestly failed to instruct the jury as to the \u201csubstantial probative value\u201d dimension of that evidence with respect to the presented issue of consent. The stated failure was prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">We must direct attention to still another aspect of the instruction as to the chastity evidence, viz., its fatal error to instruct the jury that evidence as to a rape-complainant\u2019s bad reputation for chastity has a \u201cdirect bearing on her credibility\u201d where the issue of her consent is presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">In Commonwealth v. Eberhardt, 164 Pa.Super. 591, 603-604, 67 A.2d 613, 619 (1949), allocatur refused 165 Pa.Super. xxvi, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-9\">\u201cUnder the modern view the unchaste character of the woman in a rape case has a direct connection with her general credibility or veracity on all the elements of rape. Wigmore on Evidence, 3d Ed., vol. III, \u00a7 924a; 44 Am.Jur., p. 963, \u00a7 97. The previous want of chastity may be shown by proof of reputation. 44 Am.Jur., p. 960, \u00a7 92. In the present case the complainant had testified to intercourse by force and without her consent, and to the extent that evidence of her bad reputation for chastity tended to show consent on her part it necessarily had a direct bearing on her credibility. * * * <em>Suffice to say that the credibility of the evidence of the female in a trial involving a rape charge is vital amd of great </em>importance.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-22\">The stern duty of a trial judge \u201cto bring into view the relations of the particular evidence adduced to the particular issues involved\u201d was succinctly spelled out in the leading case of Bird v. United States, 180 U.S. 356, 21 S.Ct. 403, 45 L.Ed. 570 (1901).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-23\">There, in holding that \u201cIt is well settled that the defendant has a right to a full statement of the law from the court,\u201d and that a trial court\u2019s failure to give full effect to this right \u201cis suffi-</p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>cient reason for reversal,\u201d the Court said at page 361, 21 S.Ct. at page 405:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AO5\">\u201cThe chief object contemplated in the charge of the judge is <em>to explain the law of the case, to point out the essentials to be proved on the one side and the other, and to bring into view the relations of the particular evidence adduced to the particular issues involved.\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">In Tatum v. United States, 88 U.S. App.D.C. 386, 190 F.2d 612 (1951) the Court said at page 615:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-5\">\u201cFailure on the part of a trial court in a criminal case to \u2018instruct on all essential questions of law involved in the case, whether requested or not\u2019 would clearly \u2018affect substantial rights\u2019 within the meaning of Rule 52(b) [Fed.R.Crim.P.]\u201d (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">As earlier stated, the defendants submitted a Request for Instruction (No. 11) as to \u201cReputation of Complaining Witness;\u201d the trial judge denied it; and exception was noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">In United States v. Blane, 375 F.2d 249 (6th Cir. 1967), the Court, citing, <em>inter alia, </em>Bird v. United States, <em>supra, </em>said (p. 252):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-8\">\u201cIn a criminal case, it is reversible error for a trial judge to refuse to present adequately a defendant\u2019s theory of defense, especially where a proper request therefor is proffered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">We come now to the defendants\u2019 contention that they were deprived of the effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">The contention is epitomized in this statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-11\">\u201cHere, all three defendants were represented by one counsel. Where co-defendant John made a statement implicating the other two defendants, the representation of all three defendants by one counsel is error, in that while the co-defendant making the statement took the stand, joint representation did not give rise to effective cross-examination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-17\">The following principles were settled in the leading case of Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942):</p>\n<p id=\"b154-18\">A defendant is constitutionally entitled to the \u201cuntrammeled and unimpaired\u201d assistance of counsel for his defense; <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the right to such assistance is breached where a defendant\u2019s counsel simultaneously represents a co-defendant or co-defendants with \u201cconflicting interests,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or \u201c[irrespective of any conflict of interest, the additional burden of representing another party may conceivably impair counsel\u2019s effectiveness ; \u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the right may be \u201caffirmatively waived\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> but the waiver must be knowingly and intentionally made,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and a trial judge is charged with the \u201cserious and weighty responsibility\u201d \u201cof determining whether there is an intelligent and competent waiver by the accused; \u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> in doing so the trial judge is to \u201cindulge every reasonable presumption against the waiver;\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and if the trial judge determines that a \u201cproper waiver\u201d has been made, that determination should appear upon the record.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-19\">Applying the principles stated to the instant case, we are of the opinion that the defendants were deprived of their constitutional right to the \u201cuntrammeled and unimpaired assistance of counsel;\u201d and that there was no affirmative waiver of that right, and the defendants should be indulged with \u201cevery reasonable presumption against\u201d waiver. On the score of the foregoing, we must point out that the Government has not chosen to challenge the defendants\u2019 contention that they were deprived of their right of \u201cuntrammeled and unimpaired assistance of counsel,\u201d nor has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>the Government made any contention that the defendants waived the stated right.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">The record affirmatively establishes that neither defendants\u2019 counsel, the prosecutor nor the trial judge at any time during the trial gave any consideration to the rights of the defendants to \u201cuntrammeled and effective representation of counsel,\u201d although existence of the conflicting interests of the defendants became apparent when John\u2019s pretrial statement implicating his co-defendants was introduced into the evidence by Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">What has been said makes unnecessary discussion of the other points urged by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">The judgments of conviction will be reversed and the cause remanded with directions to grant the defendants a new trial in accordance with this Opinion. In consonance with what has here been said, the District Court is further directed to grant severances should the Government proceed with the defendants\u2019 prosecution, unless defendants either employ separate counsel, or the Court appoints separate counsel to represent them if they, or any of them, prove to be indigent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b150-13\">.
