We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-20\">Appellant is confined by authority of a life sentence imposed on February 16, 1968, following a jury conviction for murder with malice. There was no direct appeal. After considering evidence contained in affidavits filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2246, the district court below denied habeas relief on the ground that Briggs intentionally bypassed his state remedy of direct appeal from the conviction. <em>See </em>Fay v. Noia, 1963, 372 U.S. 391, 438-440, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837. This holding was based on facts stated in the affidavit of one of the appellant\u2019s former court-appointed counsel. That affidavit indicated positively that Briggs knowingly and intentionally waived his right to take a direct appeal. It stated that at Briggs\u2019 request, counsel first had attempted to bargain with the State for a life sentence on a guilty plea, but that the prosecutor refused to accept this offer and sought the death penalty at trial. After rendition of the verdict, in which the jury imposed a life sentence, the appellant, according to his attorney\u2019s affidavit, waived all delays and received his sentence immediately. Counsel alleged that he fully advised Briggs of his direct appeal rights, whereupon appellant reportedly said, \u201cWhy on earth would I appeal a case that I have won?!!\u201d He then expressed his appreciation to his counsel for their representation of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-21\">We find no error in the determination by the district court that Briggs intentionally bypassed his right to appeal. The district court accepted as true the detailed and specific affidavit testimony of the attorney, rather than the conclu-sory allegations contained in the affidavit of appellant, and the court was not clearly erroneous in so doing. <em>See </em>Tyler v. Beto, 5 Cir. 1968, 391 F.2d 993, cert. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1303\">*1303</page-number>denied, 393 U.S. 1030, 89 S.Ct. 642, 21 L.Ed.2d 574; <em>cf. </em>McGarrah v. Dutton, 5 Cir. 1967, 381 F.2d 161. On the basis of this affidavit evidence, it would be hard to imagine a more definite and intentional waiver. <em>See </em>Henderson v. Heinze, 9 Cir. 1965, 349 F.2d 67; Watkins v. Crouse, 10 Cir. 1965, 344 F.2d 927. The judgment is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"At4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
