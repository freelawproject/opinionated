KAUFMAN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b310-16\">This is an appeal from the dismissal after trial of plaintiff Humble Oil &amp; Refining Company\u2019s action brought under Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185, to vacate or modify an arbitration award in favor of defendant Teamsters Local 866. The issues raised concern the scope of the Board of Arbitration\u2019s powers under the applicable collective bargaining agreement. We agree with Judge Bonsai below, who denied Humble\u2019s motion for summary judgment, D.C., 271 F.Supp. 281, and with Judge Cooper who in a decision after trial, D.C., 321 F.Supp. 374, found that the Board acted within the scope of the arbitration clause contained in that bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-18\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. The collective bargaining agreement in question (\u201cthe contract\u201d) was executed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>January 22, 1965, at the conclusion of a three-month strike at Humble\u2019s Bayway Refinery, New Jersey. Articles 21 and 22 of the contract provided for arbitration by a three-member Board of any \u201cgrievance,\u201d defined as \u201ca claim by an employee or the Union that the Company has violated an express provision of this agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">On the same day as the parties concluded the bargaining contract, they also signed a so-called Special Agreement designed by its own terms \u201cto provide procedures for returning employees to work at the end of the strike * * * including provisions for handling a special early retirement and layoff program.\u201d The Agreement contained an arbitration provision conceded by the Union to be irrelevant to the present dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">The Special Agreement established a procedure for reducing the work force at the refinery in conformance with the Company\u2019s notice to the Union that \u201ca surplus of no more than 325 employees exists in the bargaining unit.\u201d Pursuant to the provision of the Agreement, Humble instituted immediately after its adoption a program of combined voluntary and involuntary layoffs to eliminate the surplus. Under the Agreement, each employee laid off received a special severance allowance of at least $7,500, a generous amount in comparison to allowances provided in instances of other \u201clayoffs\u201d under the contract, defined as \u201cthe termination of an employee whose services are no longer required because of lack of work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Because Humble subsequently agreed to extend the originally fixed deadline prior to which voluntary resignations would be accepted, it discovered that it had initially laid off involuntarily too many employees and would be required to reinstate some of them. Thus on February 1 the Company began to recall laid-off employees. Ultimately fifty were called and offered reinstatement, but only on condition that they returned their severance pay. Twenty-eight employees accepted the offer after repaying the severance allowance while protesting at the same time that requiring repayment violated the Special Agreement or the contract or both. Twenty-two other former employees refused to accept the Company\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">The Union then demanded arbitration by the Board of the issue whether the Company violated \u201cthe agreement between the parties in refusing the return of severance allowances * * The question of arbitrability was duly raised by the Company before the three-member Board, which voted two-to-one in the Union\u2019s favor on the issue, finding that \u201cthe Special Agreement was enforceable through the grievance and arbitration provisions of the Contract.\u201d Following an extensive evidentiary hearing, the Board then concluded, also by a vote of two-to-one, that the condition of repaying the severance allowances \u201cviolated the agreement between the parties\u201d and accordingly ordered that the Company return the amounts repaid by the reinstated employees with interest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-13\">The Company\u2019s primary contention is that the Board\u2019s award was grounded in rights and obligations created by the Special Agreement, that the Agreement is not, as the Board held, enforceable through the contract\u2019s arbitration clause, and hence that the award is beyond the scope of the Board\u2019s powers as delegated to it in the bargaining agreement. We are spared from passing on whether any violation of the Special Agreement would be arbitrable because, as Judge Cooper held, the award \u201cdraws its essence from the collective bargaining agreement,\u201d United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., 363 U.S. 593, 597, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>80 S.Ct. 1358, 1361, 4 L.Ed.2d 1424 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">The impartial Chairman of the three-member Arbitration Board, who filed a written decision explaining the reasons for his decisive vote, clearly found that the employees\u2019 rights were governed by the contract and not by the Special Agreement. The gist of his rationale was that the Agreement defined primarily the procedure for carrying out the special reduction of force but, like a statute whose interstices are filled by pre-existing law, recall rights were inferentially left for the contract to define. Thus, the only reference to recall in the Agreement provided that \u201cfor the purpose of recall rights all employees laid off pursuant to the provisions contained herein shall be considered as having been laid off on the same date * * \u201cTo find recall rights,\u201d the Chairman looked to Article 30-1 of the contract, entitled \u201cRehire.\u201d That provision mandates in relevant part that an \u201cemployee who is laid off for lack of work has preference for rehire, provided he is qualified,\u201d meaning \u201cqualified for the assignment for which the rehire is being made.\u201d The Chairman concluded that the language, purpose, and mechanics governing the special layoff procedure all indicated that recalls following the special layoffs were to be treated as were any other such recalls under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">In construing the provisions of Article 30-1 of the contract to determine the employees\u2019 recall rights, the Chairman made use of a typical battery of construction techniques, relying especially upon the parties\u2019 previous practices under predecessor bargaining agreements and on the bargaining history of the 1965 contract. He concluded that Article 30-1 reflected a \u201cmutual intent to continue the former practices\u201d under prior similarly worded clauses, permitting laid-off employees to retain severance allowances. In sum, the Chairman found that the laid-off workers \u201cwere entitled to retain [the allowance] <em>under the contract.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">Even assuming, as seems inevitable from the above and as we hold, that the Board did in fact interpret the contract, rather than the Special Agreement, to establish a right to retain severance allowances, the Company insists that the arbitrators nonetheless exceeded their powers under the arbitration clause of the contract, contained in Articles 22 and 23, which provide for arbitration whenever there is claimed a violation of \u201can express provision\u201d of the contract. The Company maintains that the arbitrators grounded their award in an implied rather than an \u201cexpress\u201d provision. Although the arbitration clause here is narrower than arbitration clauses that permit arbitration of \u201cany dispute arising under the contract,\u201d or \u201cunder any provision of the contract,\u201d or the like, the Board <em>did </em>find that an \u201cexpress provision\u201d controlled the dispute, <em>viz. </em>Article 30-1. To determine whether the Company had violated rights intended by the parties to be preserved by the language of that provision, the Board was required to discover the intent of the parties, and to do this it looked to evidence and not merely the cold and cryptic words on the face of the agreement which shed little light on the issue. We see nothing in the arbitration clause which forbids resort to such rudimentary tools of construction. If the Board were barred from resorting to bargaining history and rights established under similar language in past contracts, the parties to the contract would be remitted to securing arbitration only when there was a violation of a provision so plain and unambiguous as to require no collateral evidence of intent \u2014 and we might add hardly requiring arbitration itself. To emasculate the arbitration clause, absent a more clear and definite intent that the parties intended it to have such a wooden effect and to be construed so antiseptieally, would be contrary to the well-recognized presumption in labor law favoring private settlement of labor dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>putes. See United Steelworkers of America v. American Mfg. Co., 363 U.S. 564, 80 S.Ct. 1343, 4 L.Ed.2d 1403 (1960); United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Nav. Co., 363 U.S. 574, 80 S.Ct. 1347, 4 L.Ed.2d 1409 (1960); United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp., 363 U.S. 593, 80 S.Ct. 1358, 4 L.Ed.2d 1424 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">Appellant relies heavily on our decisions in International Union of Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers, A. F. L.-C.I.O. v. General Electric Co., 407 F.2d 253 (1968), cert. denied, 395 U.S. 904, 89 S.Ct. 1742, 23 L.Ed.2d 217 (1969), and Torrington Co. v. Metal Products Workers Union Local 1645, 362 F.2d 677 (1966). However, both cases are distinguishable. In the former, the arbitration clause limited arbitration as a matter of right, <em>inter alia, </em>to a \u201cclaimed violation of a specific provision\u201d in the collective bargaining agreement. We said that this meant that the union \u201cmust at least rely on specific language that arguably expressly covers the \u2018subject\u2019 of the grievance.\u201d 407 F.2d at 260. On this basis, we held nonarbitrable two grievances concerning special piece prices because there was no language in the contract which restrained the company in any way with regard to such rates. In this case, however, Article 30-1 does deal with the whole subject of recalls and arguably sets forth the only permissible conditions for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">In <em>Torrington, </em>we found nonarbitra-bility where an arbitrator had relied on a past unilateral practice of the company which the company had terminated two years before the arbitrated dispute arose. In the negotiations resulting in the applicable agreement in that case, there had been discussion of the possibility of reviving past practice to grant employees time off on election days. But the final agreement itself contained no provision remotely bearing on employee rights for election day time off. Thus, in <em>Torrington, </em>the arbitrator relied not at all on specific language in the collective bargaining agreement. The arbitrators here, however, confronted with an opaque but \u201cexpress provision\u201d of the contract governing the rights at issue, sensibly sought clarification in totally relevant evidence beyond the language of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">The Company\u2019s final claim is that the arbitrators\u2019 award is inconsistent with Article 22-2 of the contract, which denies to the arbitrator \u201cthe power to inflict a punitive award against the Company,\u201d limiting permissible awards to \u201ca sum of money not to exceed the individual\u2019s normal earnings or other premiums he would regularly earn.\u201d But a reasonable construction of this provision would not preclude awards of sums to which, as the arbitrator found in this case, employees have a claim protected by the terms of the contract itself, as opposed to awards of sums not provided for in the contract but inflicted solely to punish the company for its wrong-doing. In thus affirming the arbitrator\u2019s resolution of this issue of construction adversely to the company, we are mindful, as was the district court, of the admonition of United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel, <em>supra, </em>363 U.S. at 599, 80 S.Ct. at 1362, that: \u201cthe question of interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement is a question for the arbitrator. It is the arbitrator\u2019s construction which was bargained for * *</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-7\">. The Board also ruled that the twenty-two employees who refused to return to work thereby forfeited their opportunity to be rehired. The Union has not contested this aspect of the award.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
