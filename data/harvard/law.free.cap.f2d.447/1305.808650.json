We agree with the District Court that no such claim is stated and affirm the dismissal of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-9\">' The original plaintiffs in this action were Harold Kellman as trustee for Barbara Kellman, Ira Kellman, and Stewart Kellman; Ann Kellman; Elliel G. Red-stone and Daniel Redstone; and V.S.D. Clothing Co., Inc. Subsequently, Harold Kellman was added individually as a party plaintiff and all of the remaining plaintiffs except Harold Kellman as trustee were dismissed from the suit upon settlement of their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-19\">On June 28, 1968, Harold Kellman as trustee for Barbara, Ira and Stewart Kellman purchased a total of 100 shares of common stock of Information Control Systems, Inc., a Michigan corporation (Information Control Systems, Inc. subsequently changed its name to ISC, Inc. This corporation will be referred to hereinafter as the \u201cMichigan Corporation.\u201d). In addition, Harold Kellman as an individual had acquired in various transactions a total 1,071.199 shares of the Michigan Corporation. Some of the shares were acquired as compensation for services, and others in exchange for cash and his services. The value of those services is unliquidated and is a matter of considerable dispute among the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-20\">Some time after Harold Kellman acquired his stock in the Michigan Corporation, the majority shareholders of the corporation decided to reorganize and recapitalize the business. The principal factor precipitating their decision is not clear. It appears that during this period someone connected with the Michigan Corporation began to suspect that there had been a violation of the Michigan Blue Sky Laws at the time the corporation originally was organized.</p>\n<p id=\"b1386-21\">If such a violation has occurred, Michigan Blue Sky Law<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> permits the seller <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1307\">*1307</page-number>of the stock to limit his liability by offering to refund the consideration paid for the stock plus interest at six per cent per year from the date of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-4\">In any event the plan adopted by the majority shareholders called for dissolution of the Michigan Corporation and an offer to refund to each shareholder the consideration paid by him for the shares plus interest. The plan further called for the organization of a Delaware corporation named Information Control Systems, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as the Delaware Corporation) to carry on the business previously conducted by the Michigan Corporation. Shares in the Delaware Corporation were to be issued and sold pursuant to a public offering under the Federal Securities Laws. If the shareholders of the Michigan Corporation did not accept the offer of a refund of the consideration paid by them for their stock, they would automatically receive stock in the Delaware Corporation at a \u201cone for one\u201d exchange rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1387-5\">These alternatives were put to plaintiffs in a letter dated August 12, 1969. The letter read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1387-6\">\u201cTO PURCHASERS OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FROM INFORMATION CONTROL SYSTEMS, INC., A MICHIGAN CORPORATION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1387-7\">\u201cGentlemen:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1387-8\">\u201cThe sale to you by Information Control Systems, Inc., a Michigan corporation, (now ICS, Inc.), of its shares of common stock, $1 par value, may have been in violation of Section 301 of the Uniform Securities Act of the State of Michigan (Act 265 of the Public Acts of 1964). A copy of Section 410 of the Uniform Securities Act which governs civil liabilities under that Act is attached.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1387-9\">\u201cICS, Inc. hereby offers to rescind the sale and to take back the shares of common stock of Information Control Systems, Inc., a Michigan corporation (now ICS, Inc.) sold to you by it and to refund to you the consideration paid by you to it together with interest at 6% per year from the date of payment, less the amount of any income received on the common stock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1387-13\">\u201cThose stockholders who do not accept the recission offer will become a stockholder of Information Control Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation. A copy of a Preliminary Prospectus dated July 10, 1969 of that corporation is enclosed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1387-14\">\u201cYou may accept or refuse this offer in writing within the later of thirty days after receipt of this offer by you or forty-eight hours after receipt of a final Prospectus of Information Control Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation, relating to the offering of shares of common stock of that corporation to stockholders of ICS, Inc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1387-15\">\u201cVery truly yours,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1387-16\">\u201cICS, INC.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1387-17\">\u201cDavid Carlson, President</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"adu-dedup-1\">\u201c[x] I wish to return the securities and obtain a refund as mentioned above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1387-18\">\u201c[ ] I wish to retain the securities and do not wish to obtain the refund mentioned above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1387-19\">\n<em>\u201cSept. 4, 1969</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1387-20\">\n<em>/s/ Harold Kellman, Trust.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1387-21\">Signature of Purchaser</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1387-22\">\u201c/s/ Barbara Kellman\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADx\">Plaintiffs decided to return the shares and obtain the refund, and they exercised their decision by signing the August 12, 1969, letter and returning it on September 4, 1969, as indicated above. Thereafter a dispute arose concerning the value of the consideration paid by Harold Kellman for his shares, since part of that consideration was unliquidated services rendered to the company. When that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1308\">*1308</page-number>dispute was not resolved, this suit followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-4\">The issue on this appeal revolves around the sufficiency of the complaint to state a claim under (I) \u00a7 17 of the 1933 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77q, or (II) \u00a7 10 (b) of the 1934 Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j. The original complaint also contained a count based on breach of contract with federal jurisdiction of that count pendent on the Securities Act count.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-5\">In addition to the statement of facts outlined above, the complaint contained the following allegations concerning fraud:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1388-6\">\u201c7. That the aforesaid [letter of August 12, 1969] was material to the exercise of investment decisions regarding the common stock of both THE MICHIGAN CORPORATION and THE DELAWARE CORPORATION.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1388-9\">\u201c9. That the aforesaid [\u2018Preliminary Prospectus\u2019] was material to the exercise of investment decisions regarding the common stock of both THE MICHIGAN CORPORATION and THE DELAWARE CORPORATION.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1388-12\">\u201c13. That in reliance upon the representations contained in the letter of August 12, 1969 and the \u2018Preliminary Prospectus\u2019 of July 10,1969, the above-named plaintiffs made timely written acceptance of the rescission offer of August 12.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1388-14\">\u201c16. That the material representations made in the letter of August 12th and the \u2018Preliminary Prospectus\u2019 of July 10th are, and at the time made, were false and/or misleading.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1388-15\">\u2019 \u201c17. That the letter of August 12th and the \u2018Preliminary Prospectus\u2019 of July 10th, omitted material facts necessary to make the statements made therein not misleading.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1388-16\">\u201c18. That at the time the defendants made the aforementioned representations and omissions, they, and each of them, knew or should have known that said material representations and omissions were false or misleading.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1388-18\">\u201c18. That the individual defendants, by virtue of the aforementioned control relationship to the defendant corporations, jointly and severally, undertook and caused the defendant corporations to undertake, individually, a practice and course of business conduct which operated as a fraud and/or deceit upon the plaintiffs, and each of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1388-19\">\u201c19. That the individual defendants, by virtue of the aforementioned control relationship to the defendant corporations, jointly and severally, undertook and caused the defendant corporations to undertake, individually, and employ the aforesaid devices in a scheme to defraud the plaintiffs, and each of them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1388-20\">Two amendments to the original complaint also were filed and considered, but they dealt primarily with the parties and did not affect the substance of the claims for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-21\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-22\">Section 17 of the 1933 Act makes it unlawful for any person to employ any fraudulent means in the \u201coffer or sale of any securities,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77q. However, as this Court recently held in Simmons v. Wolfson, 428 F.2d 455 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 999, 91 S.Ct. 459, 27 L.Ed.2d 450 \u201c[o]nly purchasers have standing to sue for violation of the 1933 Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-23\">In the present case, plaintiffs\u2019 only allegation of fraud was in connection with the August 12, 1969, letter and accompanying prospectus. The record does not show that plaintiffs purchased any stock in the Michigan Corporation on or after that date. Thus at the time they received the letter they already owned all their shares in the Michigan Corporation. Their ownership of that stock inherently would make them \u201cpurchasers\u201d in the sense that at some point in time they would have had to acquire the stock. However, their ownership of the stock <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1309\">*1309</page-number>does not make them \u201cpurchasers\u201d within the purview of \u00a7 17 of the 1933 Act since their \u201cpurchases\u201d occurred prior to the alleged fraud of which they complain. We hold that since their acquisition could not have been as a consequence of the alleged fraud, it is impossible for them to be within the class of \u201cpurchasers\u201d which the section was designed to protect and that they therefore do not have standing under \u00a7 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-5\">Plaintiffs attempt to avoid this outcome by alleging in the complaint that their \u201cinvestment decision\u201d was in reliance on the August 12, 1969, letter and the accompanying prospectus. However, that decision was not to sell, rather than a decision to buy, the latter of which would have made them \u201cpurchasers\u201d but the former of which did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-7\">The District Court also dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted under \u00a7 10(b) of the 1934 Act. Section 10(b), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1389-8\">\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce or of the mails, or of any facility of any national securities exchange\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1389-10\">\u201c(b) To use or employ, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security registered on a national securities exchange or any security not so registered, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1389-11\">This section covers sellers as well as purchasers. Defendant contends that plaintiffs were neither sellers nor purchasers since the August 12, 1969, letter involved only a rescission of a previous sale. They argue that when plaintiffs accepted the offer to rescind the earlier sale, the parties were merely put in <em>status quo ante. </em>In view of the manner in which we dispose of the remainder of this case, we are not required to rule on defendants\u2019 contention. For our purposes we can assume, without deciding, that whether the transaction is termed a \u201crescission\u201d of an earlier sale or a \u201ccontract\u201d to sell is of no significance under the securities laws. Based upon the above-stated assumption, defendants have consummated a purchase, and if they used fraud \u201cin connection with\u201d the purchase, plaintiffs as sellers would have a claim upon which relief could be granted. The central element of plaintiffs\u2019 claim in such a case would be the fraud \u201cin connection with\u201d the purchase.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-13\">General allegations of fraud are not sufficient. Rule 9(b) of the Fed.R.Civ.P. requires that: \u201c(b) Fraud, Mistake, Condition of the Mind. In all averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-14\">A perusal of the complaint makes it clear that plaintiffs have not complied with rule 9(b). They do not state what portions of the letter or prospectus are false or constitute \u201chalf truths\u201d nor have they ever stated how they were defraud-' ed in any specific respects. Their primary complaint is that defendants have failed to fulfill their contract obligation, but breach of contract does not necessarily support a claim under the Federal Securities Laws. Seward v. Hammond, 8 F.R.D. 457 (D.Mass.). The only possible damage seems to be court costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-15\">Such tactical considerations, even coupled with a complaint that is adequate <em>pro forma, </em>do not require this court to blind itself to the failure of plaintiffs to allege any particulars of the alleged fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-16\">District Judge Theodore Levin questioned counsel for plaintiffs extensively during the hearing on the motion to dismiss about the specifics of the alleged fraud, the details of how plaintiffs had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1310\">*1310</page-number>been damaged and the substance of the Securities Acts violations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-4\">\u201cTHE COURT: * * * I want to know what your position is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-5\">\u201cMR. LIFTON: First of all I would like to say we are not willing to concede that there was an offer of rescission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Suppose it isn\u2019t, you\u2019re getting back your money and you are satisfied with that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-7\">\u201cMR. LIFTON: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: What do you want?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-9\">\u201cMR. LIFTON: As a result of the defendants\u2019 failure to live up to their obligations, our clients sustained certain damages which we are prepared to present evidence of at the proper time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: What damages?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-11\">\u201cMR. LIFTON: It was only after\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: (Interposing) Weren\u2019t you offered the money and didn\u2019t you agree to rescission?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-14\">\u201cMR. LIFTON: We didn't agree to rescission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: There is a paper in here indicating that you did. It\u2019s marked\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-16\">\u201cMR. LIFTON: (Interposing) I am not willing to concede that this was an offer of rescission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-17\">\u201cTHE COURT: But you accepted it as\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-18\">\u201cMR. LIFTON (Interposing) We accepted the offer\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-19\">\u201cTHE COURT: (Interposing) \u2014 of the rescission</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-21\">\u201cMR. LIFTON (Continuing) \u2014 to exchange our shares of stock for a promise of money. That money never came through. We were forced to initiate an action in this court. It was only after the action was initiated in this court that the defendants finally agreed \u2014 finally indicated that they were prepared to follow through with that offer. It was only after an action was initiated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1390-22\">Counsel was put on notice that the court was concerned with the propriety of the complaint and its sufficiency under Rule 9(b), but no offer was ever made to explain the general allegations of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-23\">We agree with Professor Wright that \u201ca complaint lacking such particulars is properly subject to dismissal. This is desirable in order to prevent irresponsible and improvident aspersions and charges of fraud.\u201d 1A Barron &amp; Holt-zoff, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 302 at 225 (Wright ed. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-24\">Since details of the alleged fraud were never offered in an amended complaint even though two amendments were made, and since counsel was put on notice of the need for these details, we hold that the District Judge was correct in dismissing the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. <em>Cf. </em>Davis v. State Bank of Woodstock, 151 F.2d 180 (7th Cir.). Counsel had the opportunity to correct the insufficient complaint by amending to add details, but he never took advantage of that opportunity. Hence, because of rule 9(b), the complaint stood as if the essential allegation of fraud had never been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-25\">All other points raised by appellants have been considered and are deemed to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-26\">In summary, we read the complaint as stating a cause of action based upon alleged breach of contract which plaintiffs have undertaken to bring within the scope of the Federal Securities Laws by broad averments of fraud without any specificity. We consider this undertaking to be without merit in view of the purpose of the Securities Acts and the existence of a State court remedy if plaintiff can prove the facts alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-27\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed. Our decision is without prejudice to the right of plaintiffs to prosecute their contract action in any State court which might have jurisdiction over such a claim.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1386-10\">.
