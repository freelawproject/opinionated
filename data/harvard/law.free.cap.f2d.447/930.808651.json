BYRNE, District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1010-18\">On February 13, 1953, Zane Walrod was injured while employed by the Southern Pacific Company (the Company). Pursuant to the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act (FELA), Walrod brought suit against the Company for damages. Walrod\u2019s amended complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>filed on March 19, 1962, alleged that as a result of the Company\u2019s negligence the injury he incurred had manifested itself as multiple sclerosis. In November, 1962, Walrod was awarded a judgment of $50,000.00 as compensation for the \u201ctotal and permanent disability\u201d which he allegedly suffered in the 1953 accident. This judgment was subsequently satisfied by the Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-5\">Walrod died on June 28, 1965. Pursuant to Section 1 of FELA (45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51), Walrod\u2019s three minor children, by and through their guardian, brought a wrongful death action against the Company on June 14, 1968. The thrust of this action is that Walrod\u2019s death was directly attributable to multiple sclerosis, a malady incurred in the 1953 accident. A motion for a partial summary judgment filed on behalf of Walrod\u2019s children was denied, and the district court granted the Company\u2019s motions for summary judgment and judgment on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">Appellants have set forth three contentions which assertedly support their position that the district judge erred in granting the Company\u2019s motion for summary judgment and judgment on the pleadings. Firstly, appellants argue that the wrongful death action is not barred- by their father\u2019s judgment for injuries resulting from the 1953 accident. In appellants\u2019 view, the very nature of the wrongful death action precludes a compensatory action, which has been resolved by way of \u201ccompromise or by lawsuit,\u201d from preempting all possible recoveries from the wrongdoer, i. e., the railroad company, and argue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-7\">\u201c[I]t is totally inconceivable how an injured person or employee could compromise the right of other persons, namely, the beneficiaries, as to their right to recover for their damages, especially in light of the fact that the beneficiaries\u2019 cause of action for their damages cannot by definition arise until the death of the injured person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"a-q-dedup-0\">The courts have resolved this dilemma free of the self-interest which has distorted appellants\u2019 view of the problem. In Mellon v. Goodyear, 277 U.S. 335, 48 S.Ct. 541, 72 L.Ed. 906 (1928), an employee who had sustained serious injuries arising from an on-the-job accident agreed to an out of court settlement with his railroad employer. After his death, the employee\u2019s widow brought a wrongful death action against the railroad on behalf of herself and her children. At the second trial, the jury was instructed, in effect, that the settlement agreed to by the employee and the railroad in no way affected the wrongful death action. In reversing the trial court and remanding the case \u201cfor further proceedings,\u201d the court articulated a position which had already met with widespread approval (see 39 A.L.R. 579):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-10\">\u201cBy the overwhelming weight, of judicial authority, where a statute of the nature of Lord Campbell\u2019s Act in effect gives a right to recover damages for the benefit of dependents, the remedy depends upon the existence in the decedent at the time of his death of a right of action to recover for such injury. A settlement by the wrongdoer with the injured person, in \u201e the absence of fraud or mistake, precludes <em>any remedy </em>by the personal representative based upon the same wrongful act.\u201d (Emphasis added). 277 U.S. at 344, 48 S.Ct. at 544. Accord, Gilmore v. Southern Railway Co., 229 F.Supp. 198, 200 (E.D.La. 1964).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1011-11\">Appellants\u2019 attempt to distinguish <em>Mellon </em>from the instant ease on the fact that in the former the deceased employee agreed to a settlement while in the latter the employee received a money judgment is unconvincing as well as inconsistent. Appellants admit that \u201cit is true that there are cases and authorities seeming to say that where the decedent recovers for his injuries during his lifetime, either by <em>compromise or by lawsuit, </em>such action on his part has the effect of eliminating any claim after death * * See, Michigan C.R. Co. v. Vreeland, 227 U.S. 59, 33 S.Ct. 192, 57 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>L.Ed. 417 (1913), where the court stated that an action for death under Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act depends upon the existence of a cause of action for wrongful injury by the decedent immediately prior to his death. In the instant case, the decedent\u2019s judgment against the company effectively prevented appellants from satisfying the statutory prerequisite explained in <em>Vreeland </em>and <em>Mellon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">Recognizing the absence of the mandatory \u201ccondition precedent\u201d and taking cognizance of the relevant authorities, the lower court had no alternative but to grant the company\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">As noted above, Walrod died on June 28, 1965. The instant wrongful death action -was filed on June 14, 1968. Accordingly, appellants contend in their second argument that the said action is not barred by the statute\u2019s three year period of limitation. In support of their contention, appellants primarily rely on Baltimore &amp; Ohio Southwestern Railroad Co. v. Carroll, 280 U.S. 491, 50 S.Ct. 182, 74 L.Ed. 566 (1980) where the court stated that \u201cThe cause of action which arises from death accrues at the time of death * * Reading Co. v. Koons, 271 U.S. 58, 46 S.Ct. 405, 70 L.Ed. 835 (1926). It is appellants\u2019 view that the rule enunciated in <em>Carroll </em>and <em>Koons </em>disposes of the statute of limitations question because their action was filed within three years of their father\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">The position taken by the court in <em>Carroll </em>and <em>Koons </em>is only a partial resolution of the problem concerning a FELA related wrongful death action and the statutory period of limitation. In Flynn v. New York, N.H. &amp; H.R. Co., 283 U.S. 53, 51 S.Ct. 357, 75 L.Ed. 837 (1931), a case decided after the rule of <em>Carroll </em>and <em>Koons </em>had been announced, the railroad employee was injured in 1923 and died in 1928 without having instituted a suit against the company. In 1929 his executor filed a wrongful death action. A unanimous court, speaking through Mr. Justice Holmes, held the executor was without a right to commence the action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-9\">\u201cObviously Flynn's right of action was barred, but it is argued that the right on behalf of the widow and children is distinct; <em>that their cause of action could not arise until Flynn\u2019s death, </em>and that therefore the two years did not begin to run until September 1, 1928. But the argument comes too late. It is established that the present right, although not strictly representative, is derivative and <em>dependent upon the continuance of a right in the injured employee at the time of his death, </em>(citing <em>Vreeland). </em>On this ground an effective <em>release by the employee makes it impossible for his </em>administrator to recover, (citing <em>Mellon). </em>The running of the two years from the time when his cause of action accrued <em>extinguishes it as effectively as a release, </em>Engel v. Davenport, 271 U.S. 33, 38, 46 S.Ct. 410, 70 L.Ed. 813, and the same consequence follows * * *\u201d (Emphasis added.) 283 U.S. at 56, 51 S.Ct. at 358.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7W\">Here, the decedent\u2019s judgment \u201cextin-guishe(d) [his cause of action] effectively as a release.\u201d As a consequence, the absence of \u201ca right in the injured employee * * * makes it impossible for his administrator to recover.\u201d In sum, here, as in <em>Flynn, </em>appellants\u2019 representative is without a \u201cderivative and dependent\u201d right upon which to base his wrongful death action. This being so, appellants\u2019 compliance with the rule governing the timely filing of a wrongful death action is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-11\">Because the relevant Supreme Court decisions dictated rejection of appellants\u2019 initial claims of error, their final argument need warrant only momentary attention. According to appellants, the lower court acted improperly when it denied their motion for partial summary judgment. The authorities which they cite are inapplicable because this argument, to retain any degree of credibility, must be premised on the validity of the preceding arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
