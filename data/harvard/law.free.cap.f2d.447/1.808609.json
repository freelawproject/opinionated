BYRNE, District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">On March 6, 1970, at approximately 2:00 P.M., Dean Antone entered the Eugene Branch of the Oregon Bank of Portland (sometimes referred to as \u201cthe bank\u201d), approached a teller window and ordered the teller on duty to empty her purse of its contents and to replenish it with money. After having fled the scene of the robbery by running \u201cthrough an alley,\u201d Antone threw the \u201cmoney bag\u201d \u201cinto the bushes\u201d near a white building and then \u201chopped into [an awaiting] car\u201d driven by Patricia Dawson. Dawson drove Antone to his dormitory on the campus of the University of Oregon and then returned to the apartment she shared with Polk and Wilson and the latter\u2019s brother, Stewart. At a jury trial, appellants were found guilty of inducing, aiding and abetting the said bank robbery, a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 <em>2</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and 2113(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">The appellants testified in their own defense. Their testimony was couched in exculpatory claims of innocence and assertions that Dawson was the instigator and co-ordinator of the bank robbery in issue. As indicated by the verdict, the triers of fact failed to lend credence to this testimony. Accordingly, we are bound on appeal to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. Glasser v. United States, 315 U. S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); United States v. Zumpano, 436 F.2d 535 (9th Cir. 1970); Kay v. United States, 421 F.2d 1007 (9th Cir. 1970). This evidence is set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-15\">On the afternoon of March 5, 1970, Polk encountered Antone in an inebriated condition outside the University of Oregon Student Union. Antone entered Polk\u2019s car and the two drove to Polk\u2019s apartment. Shortly after arriving at the apartment, Polk took Antone into the bedroom. They were joined immediately by Wilson, who was being visited by Terry McJunkin. Two hours later Wilson emerged from the bedroom and announced to McJunkin that \u201cthey were planning a bank robbery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-16\">That evening, Dawson went to Portland without telling her boy friend Polk, with whom she had been \u201chassling.\u201d Acting upon the advice of two companions, Dawson telephoned Polk and told him where she was. Upon learning of Dawson\u2019s whereabouts, Polk, who \u201cseemed to get mad,\u201d told his estranged girl friend that \u201cif [she] wanted any of [her] things * * * [she] better be back by morning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-17\">Arriving in Eugene by bus the following morning, Dawson was met by Polk, who upon leaving the bus depot, drove by the local branch of the Oregon Bank of Portland. As they drove by, Polk related his intent to rob the bank \u201cbefore noon.\u201d Polk then drove to the end of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>alley directly across from the bank. It was here that Dawson learned she was to be parked waiting for Antone to make his \u201cget away\u201d from the bank. Before entering the car, Antone would, Polk informed Dawson, toss the purse filled with money into the bushes near a white apartment building. The purse was to be retrieved shortly after the commission of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Back at the apartment, Polk accused Dawson of making \u201ca fool out of him.\u201d In order \u201cto make up for * * * [the] wrong [she] had done,\u201d Polk told her that she must go through with the bank robbery as he had outlined. Otherwise, he warned, she would \u201cpay\u201d. Dawson was certain she \u201cknew what he meant by that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Once Dawson\u2019s commitment to the plan was secured, events occurred in rapid succession. Pursuant to Wilson\u2019s instructions, Dawson was able to obtain, by chicanery, an automobile from a nearby used car lot. Having gained possession of an automobile, Dawson and Antone, who elected not to wear women\u2019s clothing and a wig as originally planned, set out for the bank. They were followed by Wilson, his brother Stewart and Polk in a white Chevrolet Impala borrowed from Polk\u2019s friend Jill Hanna.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Within minutes of the robbery, the Wilsons and Polk entered the bank and were immediately approached by Wayne Irvin, an \u201cemployee\u201d of the Eugene Police Department. After Irvin had answered their inquiry about the commotion inside the bank, the three volunteered they had seen \u201ca honkey\u201d chasing an Indian \u201cdown the alley from the bank.\u201d All three expressed a desire to leave the premises in order that they might aid in the robber\u2019s capture and thus claim any reward that might be offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">As the three young men talked, Irvin noted a sense of anxiety in their manner. Accordingly, he asked each of them his name. The trio responded by giving fictitious names.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">Upon returning to the apartment, Wilson was enraged that the police had recovered the purse. Because the police had a description of Antone, Wilson asked McJunkin to cut Antone\u2019s long hair. Wilson then \u201cripped up\u201d the blue jacket Antone had worn and went downstairs to burn the torn pieces.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">Because both appellants claim distinct and unrelated errors, we will discuss separately the contentions of each.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-11\">\n<em>Polk\u2019s Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b84-12\">Immediately prior to setting out for the bank, Polk produced a gun and instructed Dawson \u201cto put it into [her] purse and give it to Antone before he went in.\u201d Although Dawson complied with Polk\u2019s instructions, the gun was not needed to execute the crime. Antone committed the robbery without having to brandish the weapon. At the trial, the gun was marked for identification, but was not introduced into evidence. On appeal, Polk maintains that it was prejudicial error to have permitted the jury to view and to hear testimony about a gun which had been obtained \u201cas a result of an illegal search and seizure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-13\">Contrary to Polk\u2019s view, we are of the persuasion the gun was lawfully secured by the authorities. The day following her arrest, Dawson \u201ctook\u201d members of the Lane County Sheriff\u2019s Department to the apartment. Once inside, she disclosed to Detective Roy Dirks that the gun used in the robbery \u201chad been there.\u201d At the trial, in response to the government\u2019s inquiry about whether she had consented to the search, Dawson replied in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-14\">Polk maintains that Cipres v. United States, 343 F.2d 95 (9th Cir. 1965), buttresses his position that the evidence adduced at trial does not establish that Dawson voluntarily consented to the search of the apartment. In <em>Cipr\u00e9s, </em>the defendant who had been detained at an airport departure gate by customs officials, was told that a narcotics investigation was being conducted and that it was believed her luggage contained mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>ihuana. Cipr\u00e9s proclaimed she had \u201cnothing to hide\u201d but asserted the bags could not be opened because she had left the keys in New York City. In fact, the bags were unlocked, and upon their opening, the belief of the customs officials was confirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Under the circumstances of that factual setting, the court was of the view that evidence of \u201cverbal expression of assent\u201d was not sufficient to establish that the defendant \u201chad waived her constitutional immunity from unreasonable search and seizure.\u201d The \u201ccircumstances\u201d which led the court to this view are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">\u201c * * * it (the verbal consent) was coupled with the statement that the bags were locked and the keys unavailable, which on its face would have rendered the consent ineffectual; it was accompanied by assertions that Cipr\u00e9s was innocent and that the suitcases contained innocuous articles and not marihuana, assertions certain to be exposed as false the moment the bags were opened; and admittedly Cipr\u00e9s asked if the officers had a search warrant.\u201d 343 F.2d at 98.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">The coercive circumstances which necessitated the finding in <em>Cipr\u00e9s </em>that the defendant\u2019s \u201cverbal consent\u201d to the search did not constitute a waiver of her constitutional right are clearly not present in the instant controversy. Here, the record indicates that immediately following her arrest, Dawson was determined to cooperate with the authorities. For example, the day following her arrest, she \u201ctook\u201d the sheriff to the apartment. Dawson\u2019s use of the word \u201ctook\u201d, which in the context of her testimony is free of any coercive overtone, was hardly ill chosen. After disclosing to the sheriff her belief that the \u201cgun that was used in the bank robbery\u201d was in the apartment, Dawson consented to the search which led to its discovery. Her cooperative manner continued at the trial when she testified as a government witness. Thus here, unlike in <em>Cipres </em>and Schoepflin v. United States, 391 F.2d 390 (9th Cir. 1968), cert, denied, 393 U.S. 865, 89 S.Ct. 146, 21 L.Ed.2d 133 (1968), another case upon which Polk primarily relies, the authorities did not suggest to the consenting party that she was believed to be harboring the matter which was the object of the search. In our view, this distinction is significant because it underscores the aura of voluntariness which surrounds Dawson\u2019s decision to permit the authorities to search the apartment for the \u201cgun that was used in the bank robbery * * * \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">As an adjunct to his contention that the search violated his constitutional right against unreasonable searches and seizures, Polk charges that Dawson was without \u201cauthority to consent to a search of the apartment * * The basis of this argument is that as the paying tenants, only he and appellant Wilson were empowered to give such consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">At the time of the robbery, Dawson stated that she was living in the appellants\u2019 apartment. Another principal in this case, Stewart, also lived in the apartment. Dawson acknowledged that only Polk and Wilson paid rent. According to Polk, this was the second apartment he had shared with Dawson. Polk estimated that Dawson had lived in the apartment for \u201cabout three months or two months, somewhere around there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">It belabors the obvious to point out that in the parlance of the day, Dawson and Polk were \u201cliving together\u201d in a common-law status. The record indicates that Dawson had unrestricted accessibility to the apartment. Indeed, the totality of this \u201carrangement\u201d is evidenced by Dawson having her \u201cthings\u201d at the apartment. Under such circumstances, Dawson had equal rights to the use and occupation of the premises at the time she consented to the search. It is well settled, one endowed with such rights may authorize a search of the premises, and the evidence thus disclosed can be used against his co-habitant. United States v. Wixom, 441 F.2d 623 (7th Cir. 1971); United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>States v. Hughes, 441 F.2d 12 (5th Cir. 1971); Pasterchik v. United States, 400 F.2d 696 (9th Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 395 U.S. 982, 89 S.Ct. 2142, 23 L.Ed.2d 770 (1969); Wright v. United States, 389 F.2d 996 (8th Cir. 1968). Accordingly, we are satisfied that because of the nature of .the rights which had accrued to Dawson by reason of her sharing an apartment with Polk, the search in issue is impervious to the claim that it is tainted by illegality. See United States v. Airdo, 380 F.2d 103 (7th Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 913, 88 S. Ct. 238, 19 L.Ed.2d 260 (1967), where the court held that the defendant\u2019s mistress with whom he shared an apartment acted with complete propriety when she consented to a search of the premises. Accord, Nelson v. People of State of California, 346 F.2d 73 (9th Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 964, 86 S.Ct. 452, 15 L.Ed.2d 367 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Also, we cannot agree with Polk that the gun found in his apartment was unrelated to the crime for which he was charged with having committed. Although'Polk was not accused of armed robbery, he was indicted for inducing, aiding and abetting the bank robbery committed by Antone and Dawson. According to Dawson, immediately prior to her departure for the bank, Polk produced the gun in question and informed her that Antone was to have it on his person when he entered the bank. It defies logic to assert that such an instruction is not related to the crime for which Polk was charged. Merely because Antone found it unnecessary to display the weapon during the robbery does not mean that Polk\u2019s action did not constitute aiding and abetting the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">In any case, we can detect no prejudice resulting from the gun\u2019s seizure. At the trial, the gun was marked as a government exhibit. Although it was shown to two witnesses (Antone and Dawson) for identification, it was not introduced into evidence. Polk made no objection to the fact that the jury had observed an item which had not been placed into evidence. His failure to object, no doubt, was attributable to the inconsequential import the gun was to the establishment of the government\u2019s prima facie case. In a remarkably similar factual situation, the Eighth Circuit deemed such a claim of reversible error \u201cfrivolous.\u201d Mee v. United States, 316 F.2d 467, 470 (8th Cir. 1963), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 997, 84 S.Ct. 1923, 12 L.Ed.2d 1049 (1964), reh. denied, 379 U.S. 873, 85 S.Ct. 20, 13 L.Ed.2d 80 (1964). There, the defendant had been charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud by feigning a burglary and then making false insurance claims. At trial, the government displayed, as an exhibit <em>only, </em>items that had been buried near the scene of the feigned burglary. Several witnesses including the appellant gave testimony about the articles which made up the exhibit. No objection was made about the exhibit having been brought into the courtroom or to the government\u2019s failure to have moved its admission into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">We agree with the Eighth Circuit\u2019s view that in such a context, the failure to introduce the exhibit into evidence does not constitute error, let alone prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">Equally wanting is Polk\u2019s contention \u201creversible error\u201d was committed when Dawson stated that the gun in question had been \u201cused in other eases.\u201d It is not without significance to our disposition of this matter that the record\u2019s <em>sole </em>reference to the commission of other crimes does not specifically refer to <em>this </em>appellant. Indeed, Dawson continued her testimony by indicating the search for the gun was conducted by \u201clifting up\u201d <em>Wilson\u2019s </em>mattress. We are satisfied that this isolated allusion to other criminal acts, which the trial court accurately labeled \u201cAn innocuous statement,\u201d did not influence the verdict reached by the jury. Cf. Courtney v. United States, 390 F.2d 521 (9th Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 857, 89 S.Ct. 98, 21 L.Ed.2d 126 (1968), reh. denied, 393 U.S. 992, 89 S.Ct. 440, 21 L.Ed.2d 457 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Following his arrest, Polk was incarcerated at Rocky Butte Jail in Portland. During his confinement, he wrote a letter to Jill Hanna. Pursuant to the practice of inspecting outgoing mail of federal prisoners, a United States Marshal examined the letter and made a photo copy before it was mailed. At trial, Hanna, who acknowledged receiving the letter, was unable to comply with a subpoena duces tecum because the letter had been \u201cthrown away.\u201d She attested to the fact that the photo copy of the letter made by the Marshal was a \u201ctrue and correct\u201d copy of the letter she had received from Polk. After all the immaterial portions had been deleted, the letter was admitted into evidence without objection. Now, for the first time, Polk maintains that the contents of the letter \u201calthough ambiguous, could be construed as admissions.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Acordingly, he argues that his Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights were violated because these \u201cadmissions\u201d were made \u201cinvoluntarily.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">Conditions of confinement dictated that Polk resort to subterfuge in order to convey this type of message \u201cto the outside.\u201d It seems clear from his letter to Hanna that he feared \u201cP.P.\u2019s\u201d cooperation with the authorities. In light of this situation, Polk wanted to let \u201chim\u201d know what would happen if \u201cP.P.\u201d continued \u201cto blow her cool.\u201d Anticipating the worst, Polk set forth two statements which apparently were to constitute the basis of testimony to be given by unnamed defense witnesses. Each statement discredited \u201cher\u201d and absolved \u201chim\u201d of any criminal culpability.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-12\">The deliberate usage of oblique language has not rendered the purpose of this letter opaque. The thrust of Polk\u2019s communication was to influence the testimony of a prospective witness. That such conduct constitutes an admission is well settled. See, e. g., Segal v. United States, 246 F.2d 814 (8th Cir. 1957), cert. denied, 355 U.S. 894, 78 S.Ct. 269, 2 L.Ed.2d 192 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-13\"> Our agreement with Polk as to the nature of the letter\u2019s contents does not extend to his contention that the admissions were not free and voluntary. As indicated, it was the \u201cpractice\u201d of the Marshal\u2019s Office to inspect the outgoing mail of prisoners prior to posting. The guarded language which pervades this letter strongly indicates Polk was aware of this \u201cpractice.\u201d The letter refers to an event involving the police but shrouds its exact nature in the jargon of the street scene. Save for \u201cP.P.\u201d, \u201cTerry\u201d, and \u201cJezabell,\u201d Polk avoided the use of proper names to identify the persons who were the subjects of his letter. In short, Polk\u2019s meticulous avoidance of detail indicates that he well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>knew this letter would be subjected to official scrutiny before reaching the intended recipient.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">\n<em>Wilson\u2019s Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Prior to commencement of his trial, Wilson stipulated, that on March 6, 1970, the Eugene Branch of the Oregon Bank of Portland was robbed of $1,565. Called as the government\u2019s first witness, Dean Antone admitted committing the crime which was the subject of the said stipulation. Antone\u2019s direct testimony was limited solely to detailing the mechanics of the robbery. By way of his cross-examination, Wilson elicited from Antone the statement that at the time of the robbery\u2019s commission, they did not know each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">At the close of its case-in-chief, the government \u201crequested\u201d the court to call Antone as its own witness, claiming that it (the government) could not \u201cvouch for his veracity in connection with the events which took place prior to the bank robbery * * At first, the court declined, saying it had no question to ask of the witness. The court relented, however, when the government indicated its purpose was to impeach Antone during cross-examination. The government based its need to impeach by cross-examination on an interview with Antone held a few days before trial. At the interview, Antone purportedly made statements which were inconsistent with those he made to the FBI four days after the commission of the robbery. As the court\u2019s witness, Antone repeated these inconsistent statements by absolving Polk and Wilson of all culpability in the commission of the robbery. FBI Agent Enyart rebutted this testimony by relating statements to the contrary made by Antone shortly after the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">Wilson claims that the trial court committed an abuse of discretion when it made Antone its own witness because by doing so, the government was able to manipulate the testimony of this witness in its favor. As a witness for the government, Antone\u2019s direct testimony related solely to the actual commission of the robbery. In his cross-examination, Wilson, who acknowledges \u201ctouching on matters not opened up by the Government on its direct testimony,\u201d evoked from Antone that the two did not know each other at the time of the robbery. According to Wilson, the government refused to have Antone made a hostile witness in order \u201cto cross-examine him\u201d because at that stage of the proceedings, it only wanted the jury exposed to testimony favorable to its position. Wilson concludes \u201cthat this type of trial tactic was highly prejudicial to him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-12\">In the interest of justice and the ascertainment of truth, it is within the discretion of the trial court to call any witness as the court\u2019s witness. See, e. g., Estrella-Ortega v. United States, 423 F.2d 509 (9th Cir. 1970). Equally familiar is the oft repeated statement that a showing of prejudice resulting from an abuse of this discretion must be established before a defendant\u2019s conviction will be reversed. See, e. g., Smith v. United States, 331 F.2d 265 (8th Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 824, 85 S.Ct. 49, 13 L.Ed.2d 34 (1964), reh. denied, 379 U.S. 940, 85 S.Ct. 321, 13 L.Ed.2d 350 (1964). It is within the framework of these established princi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>pies that the viability of Wilson\u2019s assertion of reversible error must be judged.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">As indicated, because of the pre-trial interview, the government was not able to claim \u201csurprise\u201d by Antone\u2019s cross-examination testimony that he did not know Polk and Wilson at the time he robbed the bank. Similarly, the government\u2019s knowledge of Antone\u2019s hostility precluded it from making him its own witness and then attempting to impeach his direct testimony. Doss v. United States, 431 F.2d 601 (9th Cir. 1970); Bushaw v. United States, 353 F.2d 477 (9th Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 921, 86 S.Ct. 1371, 16 L.Ed.2d 441 (1966). Under the circumstances, the government\u2019s only recourse was to request the court to call Antone as its witness. Contrary to Wilson\u2019s view, this was not a manipulation of evidence, but an honest attempt \u201cto ascertain the truth.\u201d Courts have a duty to aid in seeking the truth and to see that justice is not perverted.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Assuming arguendo that the trial court abused its discretion when it made Antone its own witness, we see no prejudice. Wilson claims the government employed the tactic of making Antone the court\u2019s witness in order to keep from the jury any evidence which would undermine the establishment of its prima facie case. In point of fact, of course, the jury was exposed to such evidence at the outset of the trial. Both appellants, in their cross-examinations, elicited from Antone the statement that the robbery was executed sans any knowledge of their existence. It is difficult to imagine evidence which could more seriously undermine the government\u2019s prima facie case. The jury had been exposed to testimony which indicated that the thrust of the government\u2019s evidence, i. e., Polk and Wilson induced, aided, and abetted the robbery of the bank, had been refuted by the perpetrator of the crime. Under such circumstances, we are satisfied that the government\u2019s trial tactic was neither contrived nor prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">During the course of his cross-examination of Antone, the Assistant United States Attorney made a number of references to the letter written by Polk to Hanna. The prosecutor\u2019s examination method was to read or paraphrase a statement from the letter and then question Antone whether Polk or \u201canyone\u201d had told this to him. Antone replied negatively to each question. Maintaining the government\u2019s attorney is guilty of misconduct, Wilson charges that \u201chighly confusing and irrelevant\u201d material \u201cwas deliberately interjected into the trial.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">As already demonstrated, at trial the Assistant United States Attorney was aware that Antone had reversed his position regarding the events surrounding the robbery\u2019s commission. Antone\u2019s reversal occurred while he was confined in the same jail which housed Polk and Wilson. From this jail, Polk wrote Hanna a letter in which he outlined \u201cThe way things are going to come down in the court room * * * \u201d. Polk\u2019s outline consisted of what the government has dubbed, for lack of a better term, \u201ctwo plans.\u201d \u201cPlan one\u201d dealt with a female witness asserting her innocence and placing the odium of criminality on \u201cthe first party.\u201d The second \u201cplan\u201d involved the same female witness, only under this version she is saddled with the culpability.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-11\">Under these circumstances we find the government\u2019s cross-examination to be entirely proper. Dawson, a participant in the bank robbery, testified on behalf of the government. It might be said, to use the words of Polk\u2019s letter, Dawson \u201chad blown her cool.\u201d Called as a government\u2019s witness, Antone, who had been confined with Polk and Wilson, reversed his earlier account of the crime by absolving Polk and Wilson and inculpating Dawson. Clearly, this testimony was consistent with \u201cPlan Two\u201d of Polk\u2019s letter. Because an attempt to suborn a witness manifests a consciousness of guilt, United States v. Culotta, 413 F.2d 1343 (2d Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 1019, 90 S.Ct. 586, 24 L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Ed.2d 510 (1970), the government acted with complete propriety when it sought to learn from Antone whether his \u201cabout face\u201d was attributable to any intimidation. Given the nature of the letter in issue and its relationship to the purpose of the government\u2019s cross-examination, we are satisfied that the inquiry to which Wilson objects was appropriate. See, generally, Wilson v. United States, 162 U.S. 613, 620-621, 16 S.Ct. 895, 40 L.Ed. 1090 (1896).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">The convictions of Polk and Wilson are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b83-10\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYm\">\u201cWhoever commits an offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b83-12\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-13\">\u201cWhoever, by force and violence, or by intimidation, takes, or attempts to take, from the person or presence of another any property or money or any other thing of value belonging to, or in the care, custody, control, management, or possession of, any bank * * * or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-19\">\u201cWhoever enters or attempts to enter any bank, * * * or any building used in whole or in part as a bank, * * * with intent to commit in such bank, * * * any felony affecting such bank * * * and in violation of any statute of the United States, or any larceny\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-25\">\u201cShall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b87-5\">. The admitted portion of Polk\u2019s letter to Hanna reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-7\">\u201cI want him to know what\u2019s going to happen if P.P. continues to blow her cool but the way out is for her to back up and say that she was tricked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-8\">\u201cThe way things are going to come down in the court room is going to be like this:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-9\">\u201cShe was afraid of the police and they told her that if she did it that we was going to go down and she would come out on top so she made up part of it and the police made up the other part. The first party made up his part to get some of the weight off him because she didn\u2019t really know what was going down, she didn\u2019t really know until he told her what he did she was so afraid then she didn\u2019t know what to do so she just kept her mouth closed but she knew that she was involved then so when we were arrested she had to lie to take the weight off herself. No. 1 party is backing up too. But, if it don\u2019t go down like that it\u2019ll go down like this :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3Y\">\u201cShe knew what was happening she told Terry that she was going to get me a whole lot of money but she didn\u2019t exactly know how but she was going to do it some kind of way. But Terry didn\u2019t know anything about what was going down. She never have seen me do anything to Jezabell. And when she saw that different guy at our apartment Jezabell told her that morning that she was going to use him. When we all came back later on that evening to the apartment she was there by herself. And really that\u2019s all Terry can say and she didn\u2019t have any knowledge of the incident until we were arrested.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b88-8\">. The law is settled that prison officials may not, by a practice of mail censorship, deny a prisoner reasonable access to the courts or other basic rights. See, e. g., Lee v. Tahash, 352 F.2d 970 (8th Cir. 1965). In the instant case, it is readily apparent the Marshal\u2019s action did not, in any manner, interfere with Polk\u2019s \u201caccess to the courts.\u201d Also, contrary to Polk\u2019s view, prison officials may examine the communications of a prisoner without infringing upon his rights. Denson v. United States, 424 F.2d 329 (10th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 844, 91 S.Ct. 88, 27 L.Ed.2d 80 (1970). See, also, Cox v. Crouse, 376 F.2d 824 (10th Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 865, 88 S.Ct. 128, 19 L.Ed.2d 136 (1967), where the court held that the warden\u2019s opening, reading and communicating to the state attorney general the contents of a letter written by a prisoner and addressed to his attorney was \u201callowed by established law.\u201d 376 F.2d 826.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
