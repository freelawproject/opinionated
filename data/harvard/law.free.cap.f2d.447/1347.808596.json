SMITH, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1428-14\">We seek to determine the coverage provided by an automobile liability insurance policy issued in the State of Arizona. There is no dispute as to the facts. Culiver Motor Company owned a 1967 Rambler automobile which it leased to Lyle-O\u2019Keefe Adjustment Company (O\u2019Keefe). O\u2019Keefe was insured by Tri-State Insurance Company (TriState). O\u2019Keefe furnished the Rambler for the regular use of its employee, Gil-pin. (George Gilpin died while this appeal was pending and Marian G. Gilpin was substituted as appellee. The references in this opinion to Gilpin are to George Gilpin.) Gilpin\u2019s personal automobile, a Chrysler, was insured by Northwestern Security Insurance Company (Northwestern). Gilpin, while driving the Rambler, had an accident, was sued and became a judgment debtor. He contributed $15,000.00 to the settlement of the judgment<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and by this action sought to recover the $15,000.00 from Northwestern, which had at all times denied liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-15\"> The only problem presented by the appeal is whether the district court was correct in concluding that by virtue of Arizona law the policy in question, notwithstanding the limitations expressed in it, provided a full coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1428-16\">Arizona has a financial responsibility law (A.R.S. \u00a7 28-1170, as amended, Laws 1961). That law in sub-section A defines a \u201cmotor vehicle liability policy\u201d as being an \u201cowner\u2019s\u201d or an \u201coperator\u2019s\u201d policy. Sub-section B establishes the legal requirements for an \u201cowner\u2019s policy.\u201d The \u201cowner\u2019s policy\u201d must designate the vehicle covered. It must also insure all persons using the owned vehicle with permission of the owner. Sub-section C establishes the requirements of the operator\u2019s policy and requires that it insure him in the use of \u201cany motor vehicle not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1349\">*1349</page-number>owned by him.\u201d It is the plaintiff\u2019s position that since the Northwestern policy protected Gilpin while he was driving other cars, it was in effect an operator\u2019s policy, that the law governing operator\u2019s policies should be read into it, and that Gilpin was insured when he drove any other car, regardless of the restrictions contained in the policy itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-4\">In the Northwestern policy Gilpin was the named insured, and the car insured was a 1957 Chrysler. Northwestern agreed to pay the sums which Gilpin became legally obligated to pay as damages \u201c * * - arising out of * * * use of the owned automobile or any non-owned automobile * * The Rambler was not an owned automobile under any possible construction of the Northwestern policy and the definition of \u201cnon-owned automobile\u201d excludes an automobile \u201c * * * furnished for the regular use of * * * the named Insured * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-7\">In Arizona an insurance company may fashion the terms of the policies which it issues in any way it sees fit in the absence of statutory restriction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As noted, the Arizona statutes differentiate between an owner\u2019s and an operator\u2019s policy. That distinction is recognized by the Arizona courts. In Reserve Ins. Co. v. Staats, 9 Ariz.App. 410, 453 P.2d 239 (1969), the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1429-8\">\u201cMotor vehicle liability policies issuable in Arizona under A.R.S. \u00a7 28-1170, as amended, of the Safety Responsibility Act fall into two general categories: an \u2018owner\u2019s policy\u2019 and an \u2018operator\u2019s policy.\u2019 * * * In utmost brevity, an owner\u2019s policy insures the owner of a specified vehicle or vehicles against liability arising out of their use, while an operator\u2019s policy insures the person in the act of operating.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1429-12\">The \u201cdrive other cars\u201d coverage does not convert what obviously by its terms is an \u201cowner\u2019s policy of automobile insurance\u201d into an \u201coperator\u2019s policy.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Northwestern policy is an owner\u2019s policy; the provisions of Arizona law governing operator\u2019s policies are not to be read into it; the limitations stated in the policy do not offend any provision of the Arizona law relating to owner\u2019s policies and are valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-13\">The cases relied upon by plaintiff are not contrary. Jenkins v. Mayflower Ins. Exchange, 93 Ariz. 287, 380 P.2d 145 (1963); Dairyland Mutual Ins. Co. v. Andersen, 102 Ariz. 515, 433 P.2d 963 (1967) ; Harleysville Mutual Ins. Co. v. Clayton, 103 Ariz. 296, 440 P.2d 916 (1968) , and Travelers Ins. Co. v. Mc-Elroy, 359 F.2d 529 (9th Cir. 1966), all involved owner\u2019s policies which attempted to limit the omnibus coverage required of owner\u2019s policies by the Arizona Financial Responsibility Law. Sandoval v. Chenoweth, 102 Ariz. 241, 428 P.2d 98 (1967), involved a policy, the terms of which were in conflict with the section of the Arizona Financial Responsibility Law (A.R.S. \u00a7 28-1170, subsec. E) making the liability of the insurer absolute upon the infliction of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1429-16\">The judgment is reversed with directions to enter judgment denying the plaintiff all relief.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1428-17\">. The balance of the settlement up to the limit of its liability was paid by Tri-State.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1429-9\">. New York Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Superior Court, 104 Ariz. 544, 456 P.2d 914 (1969).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1429-10\">. Civil Service Employees Ins. Co. v. Roberts, 10 Ariz.App. 512, 460 P.2d 48 (1969). In the absence of persuasive evidence that the Arizona Supreme Court would refuse to follow an Arizona Court of Appeals decision we are bound by it. Sullivan v. Shell Oil Co., 234 F.2d 733 (9th Cir. 1956). There is no evidence that the Arizona Supreme Court would refuse to follow any of the Arizona Court of Appeals cases cited herein. In fact in all of them the Arizona Supreme Court refused to review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
