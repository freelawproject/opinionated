SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"ajf-dedup-0\">Appellants and petitioners<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in these consolidated cases <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> challenge the legality of the \u201cPolicy Statement on Compara<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>tive Hearings Involving Regular Renewal Applicants,\u201d 22 F.C.C.2d 424, released by the Federal Communications Commis-si\u00f3n on January 15, 1970, and by its terms made applicable to pending proceedings. Briefly stated, the disputed Commission policy is that, in a hearing between an incumbent applying for renewal of his radio or television license and a mutually exclusive applicant, the incumbent shall obtain a controlling preference by demonstrating substantial past performance without serious deficiencies.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus if the incumbent prevails on the threshold issue of the sub-stantiality of his past record, all other applications are to be dismissed without a hearing on their own merits,</p>\n<p id=\"Ab_\">Petitioners contend that this policy is unlawful under Section 309(e) of the Communications Act of 1934<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the doctrine of Ashbacker Radio Corp. v. F. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>C.C., 326 U.S. 327, 66 S.Ct. 148, 90 L.Ed. 108 (1945). The 1970 Policy Statement is also attacked by petitioners on grounds that it was adopted in disregard of the Administrative Procedure Act and that it restricts and chills the exercise of rights protected by the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-4\">Respondents urge the court to refrain from considering these arguments at this time because the 1970 Policy Statement is neither a final order nor yet ripe for review. In the alternative, respondents take the position that the Policy Statement is a lawful exercise of the Commission\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-10\">We find that the judicial review sought by petitioners is appropriate at this time. Without reaching petitioners\u2019 other grounds for complaint,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>that the 1970 Policy Statement violates the Federal Communications Act of 1934, as interpreted by both the Supreme Court and this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-5\">Petitioners argue that the 1970 Policy Statement is \u201cfinal\u201d in the primary sense of the term because no further proceedings concerning the Policy Statement are contemplated by the Commission or provided for by the Commission\u2019s rules. Respondents\u2019 position is that neither the Policy Statement nor the order denying the petitions for reconsideration are final orders within the statutory meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342(1) and 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402(a). They argue that the Policy Statement sets only general guidelines to be applied in future adjudicatory proceedings where applicable. We find it unnecessary to resolve this particular disagreement because, even if the Policy Statement is characterized as interlocutory, it is still reviewable at this time. Since the Policy Statement is alleged to deprive petitioners in No. 24,491 of their statutory right to a full comparative hearing under the <em>Ashbacker </em>doctrine, the Commission\u2019s action in issuing the Policy Statement is reviewable now. Chicago &amp; Southern Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman Steamship Corp., 333 U.S. 103, 113, 68 S.Ct. 431, 92 L.Ed. 568 (1948); Delta Air Lines v. C.A.B., 97 U.S.App.D.C. 46, 228 F.2d 17 (1955). As this court stated in summarizing the holding of <em>Delta Air Lines </em>in a subsequent case, \u201cwhen the Commission adopts a procedure which precludes a true comparative hearing of conflicting applications, review may be sought here without awaiting a grant of one of the applications.\u201d Midwestern Gas Transmission Co. v. F. P.C., 103 U.S.App.D.C. 360, 366, 258 F.2d 660, 666 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-7\">Petitioners contend that the same line of cases holding an interlocutory order denying a party an <em>Ashbacker </em>hearing to be final for purposes of review necessarily supports the proposition that such an order is also ripe for review before completion of the contemplated hearing. Without deciding whether this proposition holds in every case, we agree that the Policy Statement is ripe for review under the test laid out in Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 87 S.Ct. 1507, 18 L'.Ed.2d 681 (1967). According to the Supreme Court in <em>Abbott Laboratories, </em>the ripeness of a controversy depends upon both \u201cthe fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 149, 87 S.Ct. at 1515. The Policy Statement controversy is ripe under both halves of this test. Here the Policy Statement has been administratively considered and reconsidered by the Commission. The issues before us are \u201cpurely legal.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Ibid. </em>Whether the Policy Statement denies a competing applicant the full comparative hearing to which he is entitled is strictly a matter of statutory interpretation involving a comparison of the hearing procedures spelled out in the Policy Statement with the requirements of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 309(e) and <em>Ashbacker. </em>Likewise, the other issues raised by petitioners and enumerated in the introduction of this opinion are also purely legal and will not be focused or clarified by further proceedings in particular cases before the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1285-8\">Moreover, it would work a severe hardship on petitioners for the court to withhold consideration of their appeal. The substantial financial expense<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>which Hampton Roads and Community Broadcasting will have been put if review of their alleged denial of procedural rights is delayed is a hardship which the court may properly take into account in finding this case ripe for review. <em>Abbott Laboratories, supra, </em>387 U.S. at 153-154, 87 S.Ct. 1507; City of Chicago v. Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe R. Co., 357 U.S. 77, 84, 78 S.Ct. 1063, 2 L.Ed.2d 1174 (1958). Even more important perhaps is the deadening effect the Policy Statement has had since its institution upon renewal challenges generally. By depriving competing applicants of their right to a full comparative hearing on the merits of their own applications, and by severely limiting the importance of other comparative criteria, the Commission has made the cost of processing a competing application prohibitive when measured by the challengers\u2019 very minimal chances of success. That the Policy Statement is in this sense self-executing <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and that it has in fact served to deter the filing of a single competing application for a television renewal in over a year<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is perhaps the most compelling factor in the court\u2019s decision to review this dispute at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1286-12\">In order to clarify not only the legal issues but also the related substantive policy considerations involved in these consolidated cases, the court will first attempt to put the present controversy in its historical context. The national effort at comprehensive regulation of broadcasting began in 1927 with the Federal Radio Act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This Act was intended to insure that \u201cthe broadcasting privilege will not be a right of selfishness\u201d but would rather \u201crest upon an assurance of public interest to be served.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> To achieve this purpose the Act provided for expiration of licenses, and consequent renewal hearings, every three years.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> At both initial and renewal licensing, applicants were to be tested by the basic standard of \u201cpublic interest, convenience, or necessity,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which was defined by the Federal Radio Commission in 1928 as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1286-13\">\"a matter of <em>comparative </em>and not an absolute standard when applied to broadcasting stations. Since the number of channels is limited and the number of persons desiring to broadcast is far greater than can be accommodated, the Commission <em>must deter</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number><em>mine from among the applicants before it which of them will, if licensed, best serve the </em>public.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6Es\">Although the Federal Communications Act does not itself establish any specific licensing criteria, the Supreme Court has noted that \u201c[s]ince the very inception of federal regulation [of] radio, comparative considerations as to the services to be rendered have governed the application of the standard of \u2018public interest, convenience, or necessity.\u2019 \u201d National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 190, 217, 63 S.Ct. 997, 1009, 87 L.Ed. 1344 (1943). With the great expansion of the broadcast media after World War II, the Commission was under heavy pressure to develop specific criteria for choosing among competitors seeking licenses for the quickly diminishing number of unallocated frequencies. The criteria were developed through a series of comparative hearing decisions and were reviewed and given final statement in the Commission\u2019s 1965 Policy Statement on Comparative Broadcast Hearings, 1 F.C.C.2d 393. The 1965 Policy Statement defines the purpose of the comparative hearing as choosing the applicant who will provide the \u201cbest practicable service to the public\u201d and who will insure the \u201cmaximum diffusion of control of the media of mass communications.\u201d The basic criteria relating to the determination of which applicant will provide the best service to the public are listed as full-time participation in station operation by owners, proposed program service, past broadcast record, efficient use of frequency, and character. Diversification of control of the media of mass communication is elevated in the 1965 Policy Statement to a factor of primary significance; and in an effort to resolve the inherent contradiction between the goal of diversification and its tradition of according an advantage to initial applicants with past broadcasting experience, the Commission states that it will not consider a past broadcast record which is \u201cwithin the bounds of average performance.\u201d Only records which demonstrate \u201cunusual attention to the public\u2019s needs and interests\u201d are to be given favorable consideration, since average performance is expected of all licensees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1287-9\">Although the 1965 Policy Statement explicitly refrains from reaching the \u201csomewhat different problems raised where an applicant is contesting with a licensee seeking renewal,\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the Communications Act itself places the incumbent in the same position as an initial applicant. Under the 1952 amendment to the Act, both initial and renewal applicants must demonstrate that the grant or continuation of a license will serve the \u201cpublic interest, convenience, and necessity.\u201d The Communications Act itself says nothing about a presumption in favor of incumbent licensees at renewal hearings; nor is an inability to displace operating broadcasters inherent in government management, as is established by the fact that in its early years of regulation the Federal Radio Commission often refused to renew licenses.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1287-10\">Nonetheless, the history of Commission decision and of the decisions of this court reflected until recently an operational bias in favor of incumbent licensees;<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> despite Commissioner Hyde\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>observation in his dissent to the 1965 Policy Statement that there was no rational or legal basis for its purported nonapplicability to comparative hearings involving renewals,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> it was commonly assumed that renewal decisions would continue to be governed by policy established in the well known Hearst<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and <em>Wabash Valley </em><footnotemark>20</footnotemark> cases. These two cases, which began with the unassailable premise that the past performance of a broadcaster is the most reliable indicator of his future performance, were typical of the Commission\u2019s past renewal rulings in that their actual effect was to give the incumbent a virtually insuperable advantage on the basis of his past broadcast record <em>per se. </em>In <em>Hearst </em>the Commission ruled that the incumbent\u2019s unexceptional record of past programming performance, coupled with the unavoidable uncertainty whether the challenger would be able to carry out its program proposals, was sufficient to overcome the incumbent\u2019s demerits on other comparative criteria. And in <em>Wabash Valley </em>the Commission held that a newcomer seeking to oust an incumbent must make a showing of superior service and must have some preference on other comparative criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-10\">Then, in the very controversial WHDH<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> case, the Commission for the first time in its history, in applying comparative criteria in a renewal proceeding, deposed the incumbent and awarded the frequency to a challenger. Indicating a swing away from <em>Hearst </em>and <em>Wabash Valley, </em>in practical if not theoretical terms, the Commission stated its intention to insure that \u201cthe foundations for determining the best practicable service, as between a renewal and a new applicant, are more nearly equal at their outset.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Finding that because the incumbent\u2019s programming service had been \u201cwithin the bounds of the average\u201d it was entitled to no preference, and that the incumbent was inferi- or on the comparative criteria of diversification and integration, the Commission awarded the license to one of the challengers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1288-11\">The <em>WHDH </em>decision became the immediate subject of fierce attack, provoking criticism from those who feared that it represented a radical departure from previous law<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and that it threatened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>the stability of the broadcast industry by undermining large financial investments made by prominent broadcasters in reliance upon the assumption that licenses once granted would be routinely renewed.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> While the Commission\u2019s de-cisi\u00f3n was still on appeal to this court, ultimately to be affirmed, the broadcast <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>industry sought to obtain from Congress the elimination or drastic revision of the renewal hearing procedure. A bill introduced by Senator Pastore, Chairman of the Communications Subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> proposed to require a two-stage hearing wherein the renewal issue would be determined prior to and exclusive of any evaluation of challengers\u2019 applications. The bill provided that if the Commission finds the past record of the licensee to be in the public interest, it shall grant renewal. Competing applications would be permitted to be filed only if the incumbent\u2019s license is not renewed. Although more than 100 congressmen and 23 senators quickly announced their support, the bill was bitterly attacked in the Senate hearings by a number of citizens groups testifying, <em>inter alia,, </em>that the bill was racist, that it would exclude minorities from access to media ownership in most large communities, and that it was inimical to community efforts at improving television programming.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1290-4\">The impact of such citizen opposition measurably slowed the progress of S. 2004. Then, without any formal rule making proceedings,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> the Commission suddenly issued its own January 15, 1970 Policy Statement, and the Senate bill was thereafter deferred in favor of the Commission\u2019s \u201ccompromise.\u201d The 1970 Policy Statement retains the single hearing approach but provides that the renewal issue must be determined first in a proceeding in which challengers are permitted to appear only for the limited purpose of calling attention to the incumbent\u2019s failings.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The Policy Statements sets forth that a licensee with a record of \u201csubstantial\u201d service to the community, without serious deficiencies, will be entitled to renewal notwithstanding promise of superior performance by a challenger. Only upon a refusal to renew because of the incumbent\u2019s past failure to provide substantial service would full comparative hearings be held. Thus, in effect, the Policy Statement administratively \u201cenacts\u201d what the Pastore bill sought to do. The Statement\u2019s test for renewal, \u201csubstantial service,\u201d seems little more than a semantic substitute for the bill\u2019s test, \u201cpublic interest,\u201d and the bill\u2019s two-stage hearing, the second stage being dependent on the incumbent\u2019s failing the test, is not significantly different from the Statement\u2019s summary judgment approach. The \u201csummary judgment\u201d concept of the 1970 Policy Statement, however, runs smack against both statute and case law, as the next section of this opinion will show.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-10\">Superimposed full length over the preceding historical analysis of the \u201cfull hearing\u201d requirement of Section 309(e) of the Communications Act<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> is the towering shadow of <em>Ashbacker, supra, </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>its progeny, perhaps the most important series of cases in American administrative law. <em>Ashbaeker </em>holds that under Section 309(e), where two or more applications for permits or licenses are mutually exclusive, the Commission must conduct one full comparative hearing of the applications.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Although <em>Ashbaeker </em>involved two original applications, no one has seriously suggested that its principle does not apply to renewal proceedings as well. This court\u2019s opinions have uniformly so held, as have decisions of the Commission itself.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1291-5\">It is not surprising, therefore, that the Commission\u2019s 1970 Policy Statement implicitly accepts <em>Ashbaeker </em>as applicable to renewal proceedings. To circumvent the <em>Ashbaeker </em>strictures, however, it adds a twist: the Policy Statement would limit the \u201ccomparative\u201d hearing to a single issue \u2014 whether the incumbent licensee had rendered \u201csubstantial\u201d past performance without serious deficiencies. If the examiner finds that the licensee has rendered such service, the \u201ccomparative\u201d hearing is at an end and, barring successful appeal, the renewal application must be granted. Challenging applicants would thus receive no hearing at all on their own applications, contrary to the express provision of Section 309(e) which requires a \u201cfull hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-11\">In <em>Ashbaeker </em>the Commission had promised the challenging applicant a hearing on his application after the rival application was granted. The Supreme court in <em>Ashbaeker </em>said that such a promise was \u201can empty thing.\u201d At least the Commission here must be given credit for honesty. It does not make any empty promises. It simply denies the competing applicants the \u201cfull hearing\u201d promised them by Section 309(e) of the Act. Unless the renewal applicant\u2019s past performance is found to be insubstantial or marred by serious deficiencies,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> the competing applications get no hearing at all. The proposition that the 1970 Policy Statement violates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1212\">*1212</page-number>Section 309(e), as interpreted in <em>Ash-backer, </em>is so obvious it need not be labored.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1292-4\">In support of its 1970 Policy Statement the Commission is reduced to reciting the usual litany that \u201c[t]he task of choosing between various claimants for the privilege of using the air waves is essentially an administrative one\u201d consigned by Congress to the Commission. Brief for the Commission at 30. But Congress did not give the Commission <em>carte blanche. </em>To protect the public it limited its mandate with the Section 309(e) \u201cfull hearing\u201d requirement. Unless the limitation is observed, any putative exercise of the mandate is a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-5\">Early after <em>Ashbacker </em>this court indicated what a \u201cfull hearing\u201d entailed. In Johnston Broadcasting Co. v. F.C.C., 85 U.S.App.D.C. 40, 45-46, 175 F.2d 351, 356-357 (1949), we explained that the statutory right to a full hearing included a decision upon all relevant criteria:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1292-6\">\u201cA choice between two applicants involves more than the bare qualifications of each applicant. It involves a comparison of characteristics. Both A and B may be qualified, but if a ehoice must be made, the question is which is the better qualified. * * * \u00ab* * * Comparative qualities and not mere positive characteristics must then be considered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1292-11\">\u201c * * * The Commission cannot ignore a material difference between two applicants and make findings in respect to selected characteristics only. * * \" It must take into account all the characteristics which indicate differences, and reach an over-all relative determination upon an evaluation of all factors, conflicting in many cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1292-13\">We, as well as the Commission,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> have consistently applied the teaching of <em>Johnston Broadcasting </em>to renewal proceedings. <em>See </em>South Florida Television Corp. v. F.C.C., 121 U.S.App.D.C. 293, 349 F.2d 971 (1965); Community Broadcasting Corp. v. F.C.C., 124 U.S. App.D.C. 230, 363 F.2d 717 (1966). Particularly since the 1965 Policy Statement, in a comparative hearing involving a renewal application each applicant has been aware that its task is \u201cto make the best case possible on the basis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number>program offering, integration, diversification, past performance and any other matters the parties asked the Commission to consider as pertaining to licensee fitness.\u201d <em>WHDH, supra, </em>143 U.S.App.D.C. at 399, 444 F.2d at 857.</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-4\">We do not dispute, of course, that incumbent licensees should be judged primarily on their records of past performance. Insubstantial past performance should preclude renewal of a license. The licensee, having been given the chance and having failed, should be through. <em>Compare WHDH, supra. </em>At the same time, <em>superior </em>performance should be a plus of major significance in renewal proceedings.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Indeed, as <em>Ash-backer </em>recognizes, in a renewal proceeding, a new applicant is under a greater burden to \u201cmake the comparative showing necessary to displace an established licensee.\u201d 326 U.S. at 332, 66 S.Ct. at 151. But under Section 309(e) he must be given a chance. How can he ever show his application is comparatively better if he does not get a hearing on it? The Commission\u2019s 1970 Policy Statement\u2019s summary procedure would deny him that hearing.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>The suggestion that the possibility of nonrenewal, however remote, might chill uninhibited, robust and wide-open speech cannot be taken lightly. But the Commission, of course, may not penalize exercise of First Amendment rights. And the statute does provide for judicial review. Indeed, the failure to promote the full exercise of First Amendment freedoms through the broadcast medium may be a consideration against. license renewal. Unlike totalitarian regimes, in a free country there can be no authorized voice of government.

It would also, in effect, substitute a standard of <em>substantial </em>service for the <em>best possible </em>service to the public and effectively negate the hearing requirements of the statute as interpreted by the Supreme Court.

The first is that the public receive the benefits of the statutory spur inherent in the fact that there can be a challenge, and indeed, where the public interest so requires, that the new applicant be preferred. The second is that the comparative hearing policy in this area must not undermine predictability and stability of broadcast operation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1283-10\">\u201cWe believe that these two considerations call for the following policy\u2014 namely, that if the applicant for renewal of license shows in a hearing with a competing applicant that its program service during the preceding license term has been substantially attuned to meeting the needs and interests of its area, and that the operation of the station has not otherwise been characterized by serious deficiencies, he will be preferred over the newcomer and his application for renewal will be granted. His operation is not based merely upon promises to serve solidly the public interest. He has done so. Since the basic purpose of the act \u2014 substantial service to the public \u2014 is being met, it follows that the considerations of predictability and stability, which also contribute vitally to that basic purpose, call for renewal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AROM\">22 E.C.C.2d at 424-425.

Petitioners\u2019 complaint charging a violation of the APA is based on the Commission\u2019s failure to proceed by rule making rather than by issuing a policy statement. One of the purposes of rule making procedures, of course, is to make an administrative agency more aware of the wishes of the public on whose behalf it must regulate. Although it is not necessary for this court, in disposing of this case, to decide whether the Commission violated the letter of the APA in issuing the 1970 Policy Statement without first holding a public hearing, a serious question does arise as to the propriety of the Commission\u2019s action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-7\">In order to avoid conflict with Ashbacker Radio Corp. v. F.C.C., 326 U.S. 327, 66 S.Ct. 148, 90 L.Ed. 108 (1945), the Commission characterizes <em>Ashbaclcer </em>as dealing only with \u201cprocedure,\u201d and distinguishes the Policy Statement as being in effect substantive. Then, caught between Soylla and Chai'ybdis, the Commission turns around and calls the Policy Statement \u201cprocedural rather than * * substantive\u201d in order to avoid conflict with \u00a7 4 of the APA. The APA requires the Commission to follow certain procedures (notification, opportunity to file comments, etc.) in all cases of administrative \u201crule making.\u201d Section 2(c) of the APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(4), defines a \u201crule\u201d as \u201cthe whole or a part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or describing the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of an agency.\u201d Section 4(a) of the APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(a) (3) (A), however, exempts from rule making \u201cinterpretative rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice.\u201d The Commission argues that the January 15, 1970 Policy Statement is an exempted \u201cgeneral statement of policy\u201d under \u00a7 4(a) and that it did not therefore have to be developed under the procedural safeguards described in \u00a7 4. As was said in Columbia Broadcasting System v. United States, 316 U.S. 407, 416, 62. S.Ct. 1194, 86 L.Ed. 1563 (1942), however, it is not the label placed upon such procedures by the Commission which dictates the procedures to be followed, but rather \u201cthe substance of what the Commission has purported to do and has done which is decisive.\u201d The issue here turns on whether the January 15, 1970 Policy Statement effected a substantive change in the Commission\u2019s comparative renewal standards.

The Commission has in effect abolished the comparative hearing mandated by \u00a7 309(a) and (e) and converted the comparative hearing into a petition to deny proceeding. The petition to deny proceeding is separately provided for in the Act under \u00a7 309(d), but this section is intended to cover only those situations in which the petitioner does not seek the license himself but seeks only to prevent its award again to the incumbent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b1290-14\">. <em>See </em>Note 4, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b1291-6\">. The primary question in <em>Ashbaeker </em>was whether an applicant for a construction permit under the Federal Communications Act is granted the hearing to which he is entitled by the Act where the Commission, having before it two applications which are mutually exclusive, grants one without a hearing and sets the other for hearing. Faced with two \u201cactually exclusive\u201d applications, the Commission had granted that of the Fetzer Broadcasting Company. At the same time, the Commission had designated the Ashbaeker Radio Corporation application for hearing. The Commission took the position that at this hearing Ashbaeker would have ample opportunity to show that its operation would better serve the public interest than would the grant of the Fetzer application and that the Fetzer grant did not preclude the Commission, at a later date, from taking any action which it found would better serve the public interest. Construing the Act, the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-8\">\u201c * * * We do not think it is enough to say that the power of the Commission to issue a license on a finding of public interest, convenience or necessity supports its grant of one of two mutually exclusive applications without a hearing of the other. For if the grant of one effectively precludes the other, the statutory right to a hearing which Congress has accorded applicants before denial of their applications becomes an empty thing. We think that is the case here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-13\">\u201c * * * [The procedure adopted by the Commission] is in effect to make [Ashbacker\u2019s] hearing a rehearing on the grant of the competitor\u2019s license rather than a hearing on the merits of its own application. That may satisfy the strict letter of the law but certainly not its spirit or intent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-15\">\u201c * * * We only hold that where two <em>bona fide </em>applications are mutually exclusive the grant of one without a hearing to both deprives the loser of the opportunity which Congress chose to give him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1291-17\">326 U.S. at 330-333, 66 S.Ct. at 150.

Although the broadcast industry was perhaps less satisfied with the substantive <em>result </em>in <em>WIIDII </em>than it had been with the results in <em>llearst </em>and <em>Wabash Valley, </em>it should be clear from our earlier historical review that the <em>procedure </em>by which the Commission came to its decision was precisely the same in all three of these cases. It is true that the 1965 Policy Statement on Comparative Broadcast Hearings specifically refrained from reaching the \u201csomewhat different problems\u201d raised by renewal applications. But the Commission itself concluded within the same year, and consistently with its own past practice, that the same comparative criteria set out in the Statement (if not the weight assigned to each such criterion) must also be considered in renewal hearings. Seven (7) League Productions, Inc. (Will), <em>supra </em>Note 23. Thus, without impinging at all upon the Commission\u2019s substantive discretion in weighing factors and granting licenses, our holding today merely requires the Commission to adhere to the comparative hearing procedure which it has followed without fail since <em>Ashbacker </em>and which has rightly come to be accepted by observers as a part of the due process owed to all mutually exclusive applications.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b1292-16\">. There are several cases cited by respondents to the effect that <em>no hearing </em>need be held where an application fails to measure up to the Commission\u2019s rules and does not indicate waiver, or where one of several mutually exclusive applicants is basically unqualified. United States v. Storer Broadcasting Co., 351 U.S. 192, 76 S.Ct. 763, 100 L.Ed. 1081 (1956) ; Guinan v. F.C.C., 111 U.S.App.D.C. 371, 297 F.2d 782 (1961) ; Simmons v. F.C.C., 79 U.S.App.D.C. 264, 145 F.2d 578 (1944). Contrary to the suggestion of respondents, however, these cases in no way undercut our holding of today. Whatever the power of the Commission to set basic qualifications in the public interest and to deny hearings to <em>unqualified </em>applicants, the cases cited above cannot be read as authorizing the Commission to deny <em>qualified </em>applicants their statutory right to a <em>full hearing </em>on their own merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b1293-5\">. The court recognizes that the public itself will suffer if incumbent licensees cannot reasonably expect renewal when they have rendered superior service. Given the incentive, an incumbent will naturally strive to achieve a level of performance which gives him a clear edge on challengers at renewal time. But if the Commission fails to articulate the standards by which to judge superior performance, and if it is thus impossible for an incumbent to be reasonably confident of renewal when he renders superior performance, then an incumbent will be under an unfortunate temptation to lapse into mediocrity, to seek the protection of the crowd by eschewing the creative and the venturesome in programming and other forms of public service. The Commission in rule making proceedings should strive to clarify in both quantitative and qualitative terms what constitutes superior service. <em>See </em>Comment, <em>supra </em>Note 26, 318 U.Pa.L.Rev. at 406. Along with elimination of excessive and loud advertising and delivery of quality programs, one test of superior service should certainly be whether and to what extent the incumbent has reinvested the profit on his license to the service of the viewing and listening public. We note with approval that such rule making proceedings may soon be under way. News Notes, 39 U.S. L.Week 2513 (March 16, 1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b1293-6\">. Since one very significant aspect of the \u201cpublic interest, convenience, and necessity\u201d is the need for diverse and antagonistic sources of information, the Commission simply cannot make a valid public interest determination without considering the extent to which the ownership of the media will be concentrated or diversified by the grant of one or another of the applications before it. Johnston Broadcasting Co. v. F.C.C., 85 U.S.App.D.C. 40, 175 F.2d 351 (1949) ; McClatchy Broadcasting Co. v. F.C.C., 99 U.S.App.D.C. 195, 239 F.2d 15 (1956), cert. denied, 353 U.S. 918, 77 S.Ct. 662, 1 L.Ed. 2d 665, (1957) ; Scripps-Howard Radio v. F.C.C., 89 U.S.App.D.C. 13, 189 F.2d 677, cert. denied, 342 U.S. 830, 72 S.Ct. 55, 96 L.Ed. 628 (1951). The Supreme Court itself has on numerous occasions recognized the distinct connection between diversity of ownership of the mass media and the diversity of ideas and expression required by the First Amendment. <em>See, e. g., </em>Associated Press v. United States, 326 U.S. 1, 20, 65 S.Ct. 1416, 89 L.Ed. 2013 (1945) ; Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. F.C.C., 395 U.S. 367, 390, 89 S.Ct. 1794, 23 L.Ed. 2d 371 (1969). While it is possible under the \u201cfairness doctrine\u201d approved in <em>Red Lion Broadcasting Co., supra, </em>to insure that all stations will give time to more than one side of important and controversial issues, we reiterate the observation of this court in <em>WHDH, supra </em>Note 17, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1293-13\">\u201cThe Commission need not be confined to the technique of exercising regulatory surveillance to assure that licensees will discharge duties imposed on them, perhaps grudgingly and perhaps to the minimum required. It may also seek in the public interest to certify as licensees those who would speak out with fresh voice, would most naturally initiate, encourage and expand diversity of approach and viewpoint.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1293-14\">143 U.S.App.D.C. at 402, 444 F.2d at 860. As new interest groups and hitherto silent minorities emerge in our society, they should be given some stake in and chance to broadcast- on our radio and television frequencies. According to the uncontested testimony of petitioners, no more than a dozen of 7,500 broadcast licenses issued are owned by racial minorities. The effect of the 1970 Policy Statement, ruled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>illegal today, would certainly have been to perpetuate this dismaying situation. While no quota system is being recommended or required, and while the fairness doctrine no doubt does serve to guarantee some minimum diversity of views, we simply note our own approval of the Commission\u2019s long-standing and firmly held policy in favor of decentralization of media control. Diversification is a factor properly to be weighed and balanced with other important factors, including the renewal applicant\u2019s prior record, at a renewal hearing. For two strong statements by the Commission itself on the importance of diversification, <em>see </em>Bamberger Broadcasting Service, Inc., 3 Pike &amp; Fischer R.R. 914, 925 (1946), <em>and </em>Policy Statement on Comparative Broadcast Hearings, 1 F.C.C.2d 393, 394 &amp; n. 4 (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b1294-7\">. The Commission\u2019s fears for the stability of the industry seem groundless in view of the fact that in the year following the <em>WHDH </em>opinion \u2014 that is, in the period when feared instability was greatest \u2014 only eight out of approximately 250 (or three per cent of) television license renewals were challenged. <em>See </em>Staff Study, <em>supra </em>Note 4, at 18 n. 101.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b1294-12\">.
