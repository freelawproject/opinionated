In 2003, Banjoko pled guilty to conspiracy to commit witness tampering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371,1512(b)(1). Banjoko was sentenced to six months in prison and two years of supervised release, all of which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>has completed. The Department of Homeland Security initiated deportation proceedings against him due to his conviction, and placed him in immigration detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-4\">In his <em>coram nobis </em>petition, Banjoko sought to vacate his federal conviction on grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel, arguing that (1) his trial attorney failed to advise him that his guilty plea carried the risk of deportation, and (2) if Banjoko had known about the immigration consequences of his guilty plea, he would have negotiated a different plea deal or proceeded to trial. Banjoko relied on <em>Padilla v. Kentucky, </em>559 U.S. 356, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010), which held that counsel rendered deficient performance by failing to advise the client that a guilty plea carried the risk of deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">The district court denied Banjoko\u2019s <em>comm nobis </em>petition, concluding, in part, that <em>Padilla </em>did not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review. <em>See Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 310, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 1075, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989) (plurality opinion) (holding that \u201cnew constitutional rules of criminal procedure\u201d generally \u201cwill not be applicable to those cases which have become final before the new rules are announced\u201d); <em>see also Howard v. United States, </em>374 F.3d 1068, 1073-77 (11th Cir.2004) (applying the <em>Teague </em>retroactivity doctrine). Banjoko timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">Shortly after the district court denied Banjoko\u2019s petition, the Supreme Court decided <em>Chaidez v. United States, </em>568 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1103, 185 L.Ed.2d 149 (2013), which wholly disposes of this appeal. In <em>Chaidez, </em>as in the present case, the petitioner challenged her convictions via a <em>coram nobis </em>petition on the ground that her trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to advise her of the immigration consequences of pleading guilty. <em>Id. </em>at -, 133 S.Ct. at 1106. The district court granted relief based on <em>Padilla, </em>but the Seventh Circuit reversed. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court upheld the Seventh Circuit\u2019s denial of <em>coram nobis </em>relief, holding that <em>Padilla </em>established a \u201cnew rule\u201d for retroactivity purposes, and that \u201cdefendants whose convictions became final prior to <em>Padilla </em>therefore cannot benefit from its holding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 133 S.Ct. at 1113.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-12\">In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Chaidez, </em>we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Banjoko\u2019s <em>coram nobis </em>petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AdX\">. \"A writ of error coram nobis is a remedy available to vacate a conviction when the petitioner has served his sentence and is no longer in custody, as is required for post-conviction relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>United States v. Peter, </em>310 F.3d 709, 712 (11th Cir.2002). We review a district court\u2019s denial of <em>coram nobis </em>relief for abuse of discretion, \u201ckeeping in mind that an error of law is an abuse of discretion per se.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 711 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
