After review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-6\">On March 14, 2006, Mr. Mitchell pled guilty to distribution of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B). The pre-sentence investigation report indicated that Mr. Mitchell\u2019s total offense level was 24 based upon the quantity of cocaine base (8.3 grams) as well an adjustment for being a minor participant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mr. Mitchell, however, qualified as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, which subjected him to an enhanced total offense level of 31 and a sentencing guideline range of 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court found Mr. Mitchell was a career offender, but sentenced him to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment after granting the government\u2019s motion for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-7\">On December 27, 2011, Mr. Mitchell filed a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a sentence reduction based on Amendment 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines and the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub.L. No. 111-220, 124 Stat. 2374 (2010). The district court denied Mr. Mitchell\u2019s motion because (1) \u201ca defendant whose original sentence was based on the Career Offender Guidelines ... cannot receive a sentence reduction pursuant to a Guideline amendment like Amendment 750,\u201d and (2) the Fair Sentencing Act does not apply to defendants sentenced before its enactment. <em>See </em>D.E. 124 at 2-4. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-10\">\u201cIn a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, \u201cwe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). Under \u00a7 3528(c)(2), a district court may reduce the terms of a defendant\u2019s imprisonment if the sentence was based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. If, however, \u201ca retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-11\">In this case, Mr. Mitchell was not eligible for a reduced sentence because he was sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1. His sentencing guideline range remained unchanged because \u00a7 4B1.1 was not affected by Amendment 750. <em>See id. </em>at 1327 (holding that defendants sentenced as career offenders under \u00a7 4B1.1, even those who receive a downward departures for substantial assistance, are not entitled to sentence reductions based on an amendment to the base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses in \u00a7 2D1.1); <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>686 F.3d 1317, 1319 (11th Cir.2012) (holding that <em>Moore </em>remains binding precedent and applies to Amendment 750).</p>\n<p id=\"b997-12\">Mr. Mitchell urges us to reconsider this interpretation of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because he believes that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), has \u201ccall[ed] Moore\u2019s narrow interpretation of the phrase \u2018based on\u2019 into question.\u201d <em>See </em>Initial Brief at 8. We have, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>however, already rejected that argument in a published decision. <em>See Lawson, </em>686 F.3d at 1321 (interpreting <em>Freeman </em>and holding that <em>\u201cMoore </em>remains binding precedent because it has not been overruled\u201d). And, under our prior precedent rule, we are bound to follow <em>Lawson </em>\u201cunless and until it is overruled by this court <em>en banc </em>or by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>342 F.3d 1245, 1246 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b998-4\">Mr. Mitchell\u2019s claim for relief under the Fair Sentencing Act is similarly foreclosed by our precedent. In <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 377 (11th Cir.2012), we held that the Fair Sentencing Act is not a guidelines amendment by the Sentencing Commission and, therefore, cannot be the basis for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). In addition, Mr. Mitchell was sentenced before the effective date of the FSA, and it is not retroactively applicable to him. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cWe agree with every other circuit to address the issue that there is \u2018no evidence that Congress intended [the FSA] to apply to defendants who had been sentenced prior to the August 3, 2010 date of the Act\u2019s enactment.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">In sum, the district court correctly denied Mr. Mitchell\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b997-8\">. If Mr. Mitchell had been sentenced according the offense level for his crack cocaine offense, his sentencing guideline range would have been 77-96 months' imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt. A (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
