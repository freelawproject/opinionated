We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-16\">Weirback argues that the administrative law judge failed to account for Weirback\u2019s moderate difficulties in maintaining concentration, persistence, or pace in a hypothetical question to a vocational expert and in determining Weirback\u2019s residual functional capacity, but we disagree. Weir-back testified that his functional limitations were impaired by severe diarrhea, fatigue, vomiting, and a lack of concentration, but the administrative law judge was entitled to discredit Weirback\u2019s testimony because he had not complained about those symptoms to his physicians; his medical treatment had remained routine or conservative in treating his impairments; and a doctor for the Florida Department of Health had examined Weir-back and found that he had an intact memory and adequate concentration. Further, the doctor who performed the residual functional capacity assessment accounted for Weirback\u2019s complaints and found that he could perform sedentary work with occasional stopping and crouching and that he had exaggerated the severity of his complaints. <em>See Swindle v. Sullivan, </em>914 F.2d 222, 226 (11th Cir.1990); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529(c)(4) (evaluating symptoms based on \u201cany inconsistencies in the evidence and the extent to which there are any conflicts between [the] statements [of the claimant] and the rest of the evidence\u201d). The administrative law judge found that Weirback\u2019s moderate difficulties restricted his ability to work only to the extent that he was limited to simple repetitive tasks with no work with crowds or the public and no teamwork, and the administrative law judge included those limitations in the hypothetical question and her assessment of Weirback\u2019s residual functional capacity. <em>See Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1181 (11th Cir.2011) (remanding because the hypothetical question failed to mention that the applicant was limited in concentration, persistence, and pace or to \u201cother<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>wise implicitly account for the limitation\u201d). The answer of the vocational expert provided substantial evidence to support the finding that Weirback could perform the requirements of a dowel inspector, nut sorter, and document preparer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-5\">We AFFIRM the denial of Weirback\u2019s application for benefits.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
