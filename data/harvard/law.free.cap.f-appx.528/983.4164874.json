After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-22\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court has the authority to reduce a defendant\u2019s prison term if it was \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 994(o).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). If, however, the defendant\u2019s sentencing range is not lowered by a retroactively applicable guideline amendment, the district court has no authority to reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir.2008); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). Thus, a reduction is not authorized if an applicable amendment does not lower a defendant\u2019s guidelines range \u201cbecause of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision,\u201d such as the statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 1(A); <em>see also United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1206 (11th Cir.2012) (explaining that a sentence reduction is not authorized \u201cwhere the difference in the initial calculation would have made no difference because a mandatory minimum would have trumped the initial calculation and dictated the final guidelines range anyway\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1007-24\">Gordon\u2019s initial advisory guidelines range was 97 to 121 months\u2019 imprisonment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>using a base offense level of 32 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1. Because the mandatory minimum under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) was ten years, or 120 months, Gordon\u2019s guidelines range became 120 to 121 months. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(c)(2) (prohibiting the district court from imposing a guidelines sentence below the statutory mandatory minimum sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">At Gordon\u2019s April 17, 2009 sentencing, the district court imposed the mandatory-minimum 120-month sentence required by \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Thus, even if Amendment 750 changed Gordon\u2019s base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 from 32 to 28, it did not actually lower her applicable guidelines range. <em>See Glover, </em>686 F.3d at 1206.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-5\">Gordon contends that she is eligible for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction because the FSA lowered the mandatory minimum sentence for her offense from ten years to five years. <em>See </em>Pub. L. No. 111-220 \u00a7 2(a), 124 Stat. 2372 (2010). The FSA, however, does not serve as a basis for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) sentence reduction because it is a statutory change implemented by Congress, not a guidelines amendment enacted by the Sentencing Commission. <em>See United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 377 (11th Cir.2012). Furthermore, the FSA does not apply retroactively to defendants like Gordon who were sentenced before its August 3, 2010 enactment. <em>Id.; see also United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535, 542 (11th Cir.2013). Thus, neither Amendment 750 nor the FSA provided a basis for the district court to reduce Gordon\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Gordon\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce her sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1007-18\">. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States </em>v. <em>Liberse, </em>688 F.3d 1198, 1200 n. 1 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
