Martinez-Alvarez raises the issue to preserve it for possible further review but concedes that his argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Calbat, </em>266 F.3d 358, 364 (5th Cir.2001), and <em>United States v. Box, </em>50 F.3d 345, 359 (5th Cir.1995). <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009). Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affir-mance is GRANTED, its alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AY5\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
