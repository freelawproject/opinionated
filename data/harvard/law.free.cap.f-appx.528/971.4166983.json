At sentencing, the district court applied a 2-level substantial assistance departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, and calculated Noird\u2019s guideline range to be 210 to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment based on his career offender designation. The district court sentenced him to 260 months\u2019 imprisonment. The government subsequently filed a Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b) motion for a sentence reduction on account of Noird\u2019s substantial assistance in the prosecution of other persons. The district court resen-tenced Noird to a term of 135 months\u2019 imprisonment. On appeal, Noird argues that the rule of lenity dictates that Amendment 750 is applicable to his sentence because he received a downward departure for substantial assistance. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-21\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). Amendment 750 revised the crack cocaine quantity tables to conform to the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, which amended certain statutory minimum sentences for crack cocaine offenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b995-22\">A district court may not reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment that has been imposed unless: (1) the defendant\u2019s sentence was based upon a guideline range that the Sentencing Commission subsequently lowered; (2) the district court considers the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors; and (3) a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). When determining whether a reduction is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>warranted, a court should determine the guideline range that would have applied had the relevant amendment been in effect at the time of the defendant\u2019s sentencing. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(1). A court must only substitute the relevant amendment into the district court\u2019s original guideline calculations, and leave all other sentencing decisions unaffected. <em>Id.; see United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">A reduction is not consistent with the Guidelines\u2019 policy statement if the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). A reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not authorized where the applicable amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline. <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-28. This includes situations in which the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range is calculated through the application of the career offender guideline. <em>Id. </em>at 1328.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">In <em>Moore, </em>we explained that a district court had discretion to resentence a career offender under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) where he had previously received a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 because the seriousness of his criminal history was substantially overrepresented by his career offender designation. <em>Id. </em>at 1329-30. The rationale behind such authority in that situation was that the court was reducing the appellant\u2019s offense level to what would be in effect absent the career offender guideline. <em>Id. </em>at 1329. In contrast, the appellants in <em>Moore </em>were ineligible for sentence reductions because their respective departures were based on substantial assistance and diminished capacity. <em>Id. </em>at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">In this case, Amendment 750 did not have the effect of lowering Noird\u2019s applicable guideline range under \u00a7 4B 1.1(b) as a career offender. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327-28. Under \u00a7 4Bl.l(b), Noird\u2019s applicable guideline range remains the same as it was at his original sentencing. Further, neither his \u00a7 5K1.1 departure nor Rule 35(b) reduction rendered him eligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1329-30. Accordingly, we affirm the denial of his motion for a sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b995-19\">. Amendment 750 was subsequently made retroactive by Amendment 759, thereby permitting defendants to move for sentence reductions under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) in appropriate circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
