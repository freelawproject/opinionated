On appeal, she argues that the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) erred by failing to expressly include Dawson\u2019s limitations in maintaining concentration, persistence, or pace in the residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) assessment or in the hypothetical question posed to the vocational expert (\u201cVE\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-8\">We review the Commissioner\u2019s decision for substantial evidence. <em>Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1178 (11th Cir.2011). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla and is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). The individual seeking Social Security disability benefits bears the burden of proving that she is disabled. <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-11\">The Commissioner uses</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AeC\">a five-step, sequential evaluation process ... to determine whether a claimant is disabled: (1) whether the claimant is currently engaged in substantial gainful activity; (2) whether the claimant has a severe impairment or combination of impairments; (3) whether the impairment meets or equals the severity of the specified impairments in the Listing of Impairments; (4) based on [the RFC] assessment, whether the claimant can perform any of his or her past relevant work despite the impairment; and (5) whether there are significant numbers of jobs in the national economy that the claimant can perform given the claimant\u2019s RFC, age, education, and work experience.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1000-12\"><em>Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1178. The RFC is \u201cthat which an individual is still able to do despite the limitations caused by his or her impairments.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1238 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-13\">If the claimant successfully proves that she is unable to perform her past relevant work, the Commissioner bears the burden of determining whether there is other work available at the fifth step. <em>Jones v. Apfel, </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1228 (11th Cir.1999). The Commissioner may show \u201cthat the claimant can perform other jobs ... through the testimony of a YE.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1229. \u201cIn order for a VE\u2019s testimony to constitute substantial evidence, the ALJ must pose a hypothetical question which comprises all of the claimant\u2019s impairments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, an ALJ is \u201cnot required to include findings in the hypothetical that the ALJ had properly rejected as unsupported.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number><em>of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1161 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">If an ALJ determines at step two of the sequential evaluation process that the claimant\u2019s mental impairments caused limitations in concentration, persistence, or pace, the ALJ must include those limitations in the hypothetical questions posed to the VE. <em>Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1180-81. However, the ALJ may instead include in the hypothetical questions the limitation that the claimant is restricted to unskilled work if the medical evidence shows that the claimant can perform simple, routine tasks or unskilled work despite her limitations in concentration, persistence, or pace. <em>Id. </em>at 1181 (remanding for the ALJ to explicitly include the claimant\u2019s moderate limitation in maintaining concentration, persistence, or pace in the hypothetical question because \u201cthe ALJ did not indicate that medical evidence suggested [that the claimant\u2019s] ability to work was unaffected by this limitation, nor did he otherwise implicitly account for the limitation in the hypothetical\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">In this case, unlike in <em>Winschel, </em>the ALJ indicated in the hypothetical that the medical evidence showed that Dawson\u2019s ability to work was only affected by her limitations in maintaining concentration, persistence, or pace to the extent that she was limited to routine, repetitive tasks with up to three-step instructions. <em>See id. </em>Therefore, the ALJ did not err by not explicitly including limitations in maintaining concentration, persistence, or pace in the RFC assessment or in the hypothetical question to the VE, and the VE\u2019s testimony constituted substantial evidence. Because substantial evidence shows that the ALJ sufficiently accounted for Dawson\u2019s limitation, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
