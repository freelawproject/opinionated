After review of the record, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1002-3\">Montelongo, a native and citizen of Mexico, was ordered deported from the United States in 1994, prior to the enactment of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRI-RA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009. Montelongo reentered the United States without inspection in 1997, and in August 2012, pled guilty to illegal reentry in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1325(a) and 1326(b)(2). In January 2012, he filed a motion to reopen his deportation proceedings. The Immigration Judge <em>(\u201c13\u201d) </em>denied the motion, holding that she lacked jurisdiction to entertain the motion pursuant to the \u201cdeparture bar\u201d regulation, which prevents an IJ or the BIA from considering a motion to reopen filed by a person who has departed the United States, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.23(b)(1), 1003.2(d). The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s denial. Montelongo filed a second motion to reopen, requesting that the BIA reverse the denial based on our decision in <em>Lin v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>681 F.3d 1236 (11th Cir.2012), in which we held that the administratively-created departure bar impermissibly conflicted with the statutory right to file a motion to reopen removal proceedings codified in IIRIRA. The BIA denied the motion, concluding that <em>Lin </em>did not apply to Montelongo\u2019s case because he was seeking to reopen pre-IIRIRA deportation proceedings, not removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">\u201cThe \u2018general rule\u2019 is that the 1996 amendments do not apply to aliens who are in deportation proceedings prior to April 1, 1997.\u201d <em>Cunningham v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>335 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir.2003) (citing IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(1)(B)). IIRIRA explicitly mandates that \u201c[deportation] proceedings (including judicial review thereof) shall continue to be conducted without regard to such amendments.\u201d IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(1)(B). Because Montel-ongo\u2019s deportation proceedings concluded in 1994, his case is governed by the pre-1996 Immigration and Nationality Act, which did not include a statutory right to file a motion to reopen.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Consequently, our decision in <em>Lin, </em>which was based exclusively on the statutory text of IIRIRA and did not posit any independent right to file a motion to reopen, is also inapplicable to Montelongo\u2019s case. Accordingly, because Montelongo left the United States, the BIA correctly determined that it lacked jurisdiction to consider his motion to reopen pursuant to the departure bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">. We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 808 (11th Cir.2006). However, questions of law are reviewed <em>de novo. Makir-Marwil v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>681 F.3d 1227, 1233 n. 3 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AP6\">. The BIA was authorized by administrative regulations from its outset in 1940 to reopen closed cases. <em>See Lin, </em>681 F.3d at 1238-39; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 90.10 (1940). However, this authority was discretionary. No pre-1996 regulations or statutes gave aliens a right to file a motion to reopen.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
