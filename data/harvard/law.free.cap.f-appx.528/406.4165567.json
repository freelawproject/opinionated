In calculating his guidelines range of imprisonment, the district court applied a 16-level enhancement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) for Moniet-Wong\u2019s prior conviction of conspiracy to distribute marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">As he did in the district court, Moniet-Wong argues that his prior conspiracy conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 did not require any overt act; it is thus not a conspiracy within the generic, contemporary meaning of the word, and it cannot support the enhancement. Moniet-Wong correctly concedes that his argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Escareno, </em>700 F.3d 751, 753-54 (5th Cir.2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2044, 185 L.Ed.2d 902 (2013), but he raises it to preserve it for further possible review.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b430-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
