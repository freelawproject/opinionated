Bubsey, appointed counsel for Celso Guerra in this appeal, has moved to withdraw from further representation of the appellant and filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Our independent review of the entire record reveals that counsel\u2019s assessment of the relative merits of the appeal is correct. Because independent examination of the entire record reveals no arguable issues of merit, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and Guerra\u2019s convictions and sentences in the instant case are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-21\">However, there appears to be a typographical error in the judgment for the instant case. Guerra\u2019s statutes of conviction are listed as, in part 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(cii), in count one and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(iii), in count three. It appears that both statutes should instead refer to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(A)(viii). Accordingly, the judgment is VACATED and the case is REMANDED for the limited purpose of correcting a clerical error in the judgment. <em>See United States v. Massey, </em>443 F.3d 814, 822 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
