We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">While on probation for various drug offenses, Perry was arrested by Georgia police for possessing cocaine and marijuana. Perry pleaded guilty in state court and was sentenced to ten years of probation. Perry\u2019s state-law drug offenses admittedly violated the conditions of his federal supervised release and called for a guideline-range sentence of 30 to 37 months. After a hearing, the district court sentenced Perry to 30 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">Perry argues his sentence was procedurally and substantively unreasonable. Perry\u2019s arguments lack merit. First, Perry\u2019s sentence was not procedurally unreasonable. <em>See, e.g., Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 345, 356, 358, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Even if brief, the district court\u2019s explanation of Perry\u2019s sentence was nonetheless sufficient. <em>See United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1195 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc). The court properly calculated the guideline range, treated the Guidelines as advisory, considered the sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C \u00a7 3553(a), and did not rely on clearly erroneous facts. <em>See, e.g., Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). On this record, Perry has not carried his burden to show procedural unreasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">Second, Perry\u2019s 30-month sentence was not substantively unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) (noting sentencing courts must only acknowledge their consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, but are not required to discuss each of the factors considered). Ordinarily, guideline-range sentences like Perry\u2019s are reasonable. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). Also, the district court did not improperly weigh \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s sentencing factors in considering the recidivist nature of Perry\u2019s state-law drug offenses. <em>See id.; see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (noting courts should consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, as well as the history and characteristics of the defendant). Moreover, because the weight given to each \u00a7 3553(a) factor is \u201ca matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court,\u201d the court did not err in rejecting Perry\u2019s explanations or excuses for his state-law offenses. <em>See United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). Hence, Perry has not shown his 30-month sentence was substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-14\">Perry\u2019s 30-month sentence for violating the conditions of his supervised release is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1005-9\">. A sentence imposed for revocation of supervised release is reviewed for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). Such a sentence is upheld unless it constitutes an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
