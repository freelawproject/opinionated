They certified in favor of a route which will run through three houses. The necessity of the extension was not contested, but it was claimed by the contestant that another route offered by him was as good, and cheaper. The value of the land on the route certified by the commissioners and that proposed by the contestant is practically the same; and the only difference in cost is the expense of moving the buildings, which would be $900 less on contestant\u2019s route. However, the route certified by the commissioners will make a direct continuation eastward of Union avenue, while that proposed by contestant will make a zigzag course. All the owners through whose land the road will pass, with but one exception, are satisfied with the commissioners\u2019 route. The county judge affirmed the decision of the commissioners, and the matter is now presented to the general term, in accordance with Laws H. Y. 1873, c. 773, which provides; \u201cIf the county judge shall affirm the decision of said commissioners, they shall present the order of the county judge for confirmation to the supreme court, at a general term, in the judicial department in which such premises are situated.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b737-7\">Argued before Barnard, P.

That order of the county judge is now presented for confirmation to the supreme court at general term, under the provision's of chapter 773 of the Laws of 1873, and we find no reason for disagreement with the local authorities respecting the contemplated improvement, and the order of the county judge is therefore confirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
