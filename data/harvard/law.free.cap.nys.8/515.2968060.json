The commissioners having considered the evidence, and having found against the relator, we do not understand that we can interfere with it, according to the rules established by the court of last resort. For these reasons the proceedings of the commissioners should be affirmed, and the writ dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
