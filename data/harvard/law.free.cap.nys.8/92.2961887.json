Bissell and Nathan Lapham, to recover on a contract for freight of a cargo of potatoes transported on plaintiff\u2019s canal-boat. On trial by the court, there was judgment for plaintiff, after allowing defendants\u2019 counter-claim of non-delivery, from which judgment, and the order of the court denying a motion to dismiss the counterclaim, plaintiff appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b111-5\">Argued before Learned, P.

The case was tried by the court without a jury. The main question was whether the plaintiff delivered all the potatoes he received. The court made aliow-ance for shrinkage, and found that he delivered 56 barrels less than he received, and charged him with the value thereof. The testimony is not as satisfactory as to the amount received as could be desired, and the trial court was oppressed with this circumstance. We must affirm the findings of fact, because they are within the evidence, and we cannot see that they are wrong. Of course, if the plaintiff did not deliver all the cargo he received and agreed to deliver, he must excuse himself or pay for the deficit. No error of law to the prejudice of the plaintiff was committed. Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
