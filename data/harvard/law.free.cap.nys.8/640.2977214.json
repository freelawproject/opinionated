Carrigan, a patrolman of the city of Yonkers, was dismissed from the police force on charges of violation of rules in being absent without leave, and of being unable to perform his duties on account of a vile disease, and of seeking to deceive and mislead the police surgeon in relation thereto. He brings <em>certiorari </em>to review the proceedings of the board of police commissioners in dismissing him.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b658-13\">Argued before Barnard, P. J., and Dykman and Pratt, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b658-14\"><em>John F. </em>Brennan, for relator. <em>James P.

It was a valid ground for his absence from duty; and he requested his physician to make a report of his illness to the police authorities, which report was in fact made, although not till half an hour after roll-call. Such an absence from roll-call does not constitute the offense of \u201cabsence without leave,\u201d for which he could legally be removed from office. Hor was the charge of misleading the police surgeon established. He requested his physician to inform the police surgeon of his illness, which was in fact done. The surgeon was not misled. He was not only notified of the illness, but of its nature, and the treatment pursued. After such notice from relator\u2019s physician, there was no reason why relator should give any further information on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-16\">The evidence does not establish that the illness was the result of misconduct. Other possible causes were given by the police surgeon. There is no presumption in favor of crime, and the legal presumption is the other way. It follows that relator\u2019s discharge from the police force was unauthorized, and the proceedings must be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
