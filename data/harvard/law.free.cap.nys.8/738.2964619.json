Defendant said he would consult'a lawyer, went to the lawyer\u2019s office, and after his return made no proposal to deliver the goods, although the parties met on numerous occasions. Under the circumstances, silence and inaction were equivalent to a refusal.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">The admission of the evidence of the conversation by which the agent was authorized to receive the goods was not error, it was not introduced \u201cto bind the defendant, \u201d but to show that the agent had authority to demand and receive the goods, and was competent for the purpose. It is of the same nature as was the written paper which gave such authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Upon the question of the ownership of the property, the evidence was conflicting. The referee did not follow the evidence of either party in its entirety. It is evident that the testimony was carefully weighed, and, so far as we can judge from the printed record, a correct result has been reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">We do not understand the recent decisions cited by appellant to determine that a wife cannot maintain an action against her husband for tortious acts respecting the wife\u2019s property. If it be that a husband is properly made a defendant in an action brought by a third party for the wife\u2019s tort, we do not think it necessarily follows that a wife cannot maintain an action against him for an injury to her rights of property. Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
