Clark against Sarah E. Sullivan, in which an open commission to take testimony was ordered on plaintiff\u2019s motion. The order was granted on notice to the defendant\u2019s attorney, and was founded upon the affidavit of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, which constituted the only proof presented to the court; and the material part of the affidavit states \u201cthat the plaintiff has fairly and fully stated the case in said action to Zachary P. Taylor, his counsel therein, and has fully and fairly disclosed to said counsel the facts which he intends to prove by the witness hereinafter mentioned; and deponent fully believes that the testimony of George P. Parkhurst is material to-deponent in the prosecution of said action; that said George P. Parkhurst is not within this state, as deponent is informed and fully believes, but that said George P. Parkhurst is at Elgin, in the state of Illinois.\u201d The defendant appeared by her counsel to oppose the motion, and made the preliminary objection, among others, that the affidavit was insufficient. The order does not give the name of any witness who is to be examined. Defendant appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b584-5\">Argued before Barker, P.

The right of a party to an action to take the deposition of a witness out of the state, under a commission, to be read on the trial, is founded on the statute, and-all its requirements must be observed by the moving party, or the court has no power to grant an order for a commission to issue. <em>McColl </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>50 N. Y. 332; <em>In re An Attorney, </em>83 N. Y. 164. An open commission can only issue when it is made to appear by affidavit, to the satisfaction of the court or officer to whom the application is made, that one or more witnesses not within the state \u201care material and necessary to the prosecution or defense of the action.\u201d Section 894. The affidavit on which this order is founded was made by the attorney for the plaintiff, and his statements are wholly on information and belief, and he omits to declare that he believes that the evidence of the witness is necessary for his client in the prosecution of the action, and makes the single and immaterial statement that the evidence of the witness named therein is material to himself in the prosecution of the action. The statute gives either party the privilege on the execution of an open commission -to produce before the commissioner witnesses, and to examine them upon oral questions. Section 897. This order requires the deposition of the witnesses who may be produced by either party to be taken upon written interrogatories and cross-interrogatories, to be annexed to the commission. The court below had no power to deprive the defendant of the right to examine his own witnesses, or to cross-examine the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, by propounding oral questions to them on their examination before the commissioner. This provision of the order was wholly unauthorized, and seems to be absurd to require a party to prepare written interrogatories to be asked a witness whose name is not disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">The moving affidavit is wholly upon information and belief, and the material part of it is based upon statements made by the plaintiff to his attorney, and no excuse whatever is made why he does not himself make an affidavit of the facts upon which the right to issue the commission depends, and of which the law supposes he has knowledge. The affidavit does not constitute proof of any fact which the plaintiff was required to establish. <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Albergar, </em>78 N. Y. 252. Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
