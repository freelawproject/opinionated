No copy of the testimony on which the principal was originally held is submitted, nor is the complainant\u2019s last place of residence; and, although it is sworn to by the surety that the complainant was subpoenaed on the first hearing, that fact could not be within surety\u2019s knowledge, and no source of information is given. The motion must therefore be denied, but with leave to renew on supplying those deficiencies.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
