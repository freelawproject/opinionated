The defendants are retail sellers of gloves and other dry goods in Kansas City, Mo. The plaintiffs\u2019 traveling salesman, April 8,1887, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>at the defendants\u2019 store in Kansas City, upon the exhibition of samples of No. 1, first quality gloves, made an agreement in behalf of the plaintiffs to sell to the defendants a bill of gloves as specified in an order then made, the same to be of the quality of the samples shown, the gloves to be sent to the defendants August 15,1887; and the defendants agreed to buy and pay for the same at the prices then fixed. The gloves were to be thereafter made or imported by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs did .import and send.to the defendants on August 31,1887, the gloves as ordered, except that the quality of a portion of them was inferior to that of the samples. The gloves were received by the defendants September 17, 1887. The defendants immediately placed some of them on sale, and found them to be defective, the gloves breaking when fitted to the hands of customers. The defendants carefully examined every pair of the gloves before October 1,1887. The liability of the gloves to bi;eak would not be detected upon such examination. October 6, 1887, the defendants returned to the plaintiffs 21-12 dozen of the gloves, and wrote them as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-5\">\u201cKansas City, Mo., October 6, 1887. <em>\u201cMessrs.

We are still at a loss to understand in what way the Bussian calf goods were defective, for it is evident to any judge of gloves that they are the finest and most perfect goods in every particular that can be brought to this country. The first few pairs of ladies gloves retd, to us were credited on your acct., and we did not bother to exchange them. As it was, we were hindered at our busiest season to inspect goods which, when examined, proved perfect in a majority of cases.

The plaintiffs refused to receive the box containing them from the express office. Evid\u00e9nce was given tending to show that September and October are the best months for the retail trade in gloves. This action is to recover for the bill of gloves first sent, less the credit given for those first returned. The court directed a verdict for the plaintiffs, holding that the defendants had had ample opportunity to examine, and had examined, the gloves before they received the plaintiffs\u2019 letter of October 22,1887, and that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>not having returned them because of .their non-conformity to the sample, the title to the gloves vested in the defendants, and that they did return them pursuant to plaintiffs\u2019 proposition in their letter of October- 22d, and were therefore bound by its terms to accept the gloves sent them by plaintiffs, November 10, 1887, and hence the plaintiffs\u2019 right to recover was complete. The defendants asked to go to the jury upon the evidence. The court refused, and defendants excepted.'</summary>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b322-5\">Argued before Learned, P. J., and Landon and Ingalls, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b322-6\"><em>Arthur R. Robertson, </em>for appellants. <em>John M.

The defendants were not obliged to keep the gloves if they were not of the kind and quality ordered; that is, No. 1, first quality, of the styles specified. When defendants received the gloves, it was their duty to examine them as promptly as they reasonably could,\u2014some of the cases say immediately,\u2014and if they found the gloves were not the gloves ordered, but varied from the order in any respect unsatisfactory to themselves, they were put to their election either to accept or reject them. Failing to return them, or to give the plaintiffs notice to take them back, they are presumed to have accepted them. <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Randall, </em>29 N. Y. 358; <em>Manufacturing Co. </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>53 N. Y. <em>515; McCormick </em>v. <em>Sarson, </em>45 N. Y. 265; <em>Beck </em>v. <em>Sheldon, </em>48 N. Y. 365; <em>Iron Co. v. Pope, </em>108 N. Y. 232, 15 N. E. Rep. 335. The evidence shows that the defendants did examine the gloves, and on October 6, 1887, returned a small parcel of them as defective. They had examined every pair of them. They knew how they looked and felt, and had fitted enough of them to their customers\u2019 hands to know to what extent to expect breakage in that process. The plaintiffs accepted the returned parcel without objection. The defendants\u2019 letter of October 6th to the plaintiffs states as the result of their examination, which the letter speaks of as a \u201cproper examination,\u201d that \u201c we are not at all satisfied with them.\u201d It appears from that letter that they elected to return a part, and invited concessions from the plaintiffs as to the rest. They say: \u201cWe would much rath\u00e9r return them to you than to place them on s\u00e1le, as they do not open up as we think they should. We should prefer not to accept these even at ten per cent, allowance. * * * Awaiting your reply, we remain,\u201d etc. Returning part, and retaining the rest, after examination, was a loss of the right of further return. The matter thenceforth rested upon such concessions as the plaintiffs might make. The plaintiffs made concessions in their letter of October 22d. These were that the defendants might return such gloves as did not suit them, and plaintiffs would replace them with \u201cA No. 1 goods.\u201d The defendants thereupon returned all the gloves unsold, and plaintiffs sent them the \u201cA No. 1 goods,\u201d and defendants rejected them without examination. The defendants have no remedy upon the original contract, and none upon the subsequent' one. The replaced gloves became theirs, and their refusal to accept them was their own fault. There is no disputed question of fact, and we think it was the duty of the court to declare the law, and direct the verdict for the plaintiffs. Judgment affirmed,'with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
