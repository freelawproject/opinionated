His statements de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>pended upon information acquired by him, the sources of which have not been disclosed, and the practice is settled that an attachment cannot be obtained upon such an affidavit. The affidavit made by one of the plaintiffs does not strengthen this part of the case; for, while he states that the defendant assigned and disposed of and secreted his property with intent to cheat and defraud his creditors, no facts are disclosed which would justify this statement. The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the attachment vacated. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
