The dilemma in which it now finds itself is one of its own creation. When the administrator made his demand, it could have refused payment to him on the ground of plaintiff\u2019s claim, and then waited until one or the other commenced an action to recover the amount, when it could have brought in the other claimant, op notified him or her of the action, and require the one not suing to defend, instead of which it took the responsibility of determining to which it would pay, and must abide by the result. The motion will therefore be denied, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
