On this question there is a conflict of evidence; and while, to us, the weight seems to be in favor of defendant, yet plaintiff\u2019s testimony is not inconsistent with itself, or-so overborne by the defendant\u2019s as to permit us to reverse the judgment. It will therefore be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
