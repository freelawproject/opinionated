Roger D. Browning</p>\n<p id=\"Add\">(Police Officer)</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">Clerk oe Court Copy White</p>\n<p id=\"b188-12\">The affidavit for search warrant, the search warrant itself, and the method of execution and return thereof are not the subject of attack by the motion to suppress except in the following two particulars:</p>\n<p id=\"b188-13\">1. Defendant contends that failure of Officer Richard Gruppi, the applicant for the warrant, to sign the inventory and receipt, <em>supra, </em>invalidates the search because of noncompliance with R. C. 2933.241.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-14\">2. Defendant further contends that the search is invalid because of noncompliance with this same code section in that the signature of the officer affixed to the inventory and receipt, <em>supra, </em>was not verified.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-15\">R. C. 2933.241 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b188-16\">\u201cThe officer taking property under a warrant for search shall give to the person from whom or from whose premises the property was taken a copy of the warrant and a receipt for the property taken or shall leave the copy and receipt at the place from which the property was taken. The return shall be made promptly and shall be accompanied by a written inventory of any property taken. The inventory shall be made in the presence of the applicant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>for the warrant and the person from whose possession or premises the property was taken, if they are present, or in the presence of at least one credible person other than the applicant for the warrant or the person from whose possession or premises the property was taken and shall be verified by the officer. The judge or magistrate shall upon request deliver a copy of the inventory to the person from whom or from whose premises the property was taken and to the applicant for the warrant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">The first contention of defendant is without merit as a reading of the above R. C. 2933.241 readily shows. The reference made therein at the very beginning to \u201cThe officer taking property under a warrant for search\u201d provides an antecedent for the subsequent referral to the person who signs or verifies the inventory. The verifying or signing officer clearly and logically refers to the antecedent clause of \u2018 \u2018 The officer taking property * * * \u201d; hence, they are one and the same person.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">That this officer or person need not be \u201cthe applicant for the warrant\u201d is clear when viewed in the context of this entire section of the Ohio Revised Code. Obviously, if it is incumbent upon \u201cThe officer taking property * # *\u201d to verify the inventory, and the inventory must be made \u201cin the presence of the applicant for the warrant,\u201d if he is present. <em>There is no requirement that the applicant officer sign the inventory.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Defendant\u2019s second contention, however, is well taken and the court accordingly grants the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The proposition that all criminal laws must be strictly construed against the state or governmental agency responsible for the prosecution and in favor of the accused is so basic to our system of jurisprudence as to require no citation of authority. .</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">When this strict construction also entails the interpretation of statutory language using the mandatory word \u201cshall\u201d in respect to requirements imposed upon law enforcement officers, the omission of one such requirement invalidates an otherwise lawful search and seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">Specifically, the plain language of R. C. 2933.241 requires, among other .things, that the officer taking property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>under a warrant for search file with his return a written inventory, and this inventory shall (in other words, \u201cmust\u201d) be made in the presence of the applicant for the warrant <em>and </em>the person from whose possession or premises the property was taken, <em>if they are present, </em>or in the presence of at least one credible person other than the applicant for the warrant, or the person from whose possession or premises the property was taken <em>and shall be verified by the officer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Without considering the last requirement, mandating a verification by the officer, it is clear that <em>if present, </em>the inventory <em>must be made </em>in the presence of <em>both </em>the applicant for the warrant and the person from whose possession or premises the property was taken. It is only if one of these two persons is not present that, in the alternative, at least one credible person may be a substitute witness therefor. In no event can the \u201cat least one credible person\u201d substitute himself or themselves for more than one of the two (2) persons first named. Lastly, and perhaps more importantly, neither can be substituted for <em>unless it appears affirmatively that one of them was not present. </em>Nowhere on the inventory and receipt for property seized by search warrant does it <em>affirmatively appear that the warrant applicant, </em>Richard Gtruppi, <em>was not present. </em>By implication only would this appear to be the case, since his name does not appear thereon as a witness but does appear as the warrant applicant. This alone is fatal to the validity of the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">However, when the additional requirement that such inventory <em>\u201cshall be verified by the </em>officer\u201d is examined, this also is fatal.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">The Legislature of the state of Ohio clearly desired to safeguard the interests of one from whom property was seized pursuant to a <em>valid </em>search warrant (whether from his person or premises). The search warrant itself herein is assumed to be valid since it has not been attacked.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">All other matters being valid, the affidavit for search warrant and the preliminary means of execution thereof through seizure of property, the Legislature to insure the reliability and authenticity of a search required even more; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>namely, an inventory, written and made in the presence of at least one of the two (2) key persons involved and preferably both (the warrant applicant and person from whom taken). If only one is present, then and then only, a credible person or persons may be used as a substitute witness or witnesses. The Legislature, in addition, provided for the giving of a copy of the warrant and a receipt for the property taken or leaving same at the place where the property was taken. By the last sentence of this section both the applicant for warrant and the person from whom or from whose premises the property was taken can receive a copy of such inventory; indeed, <em>must be given </em>same upon request of the judge or magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">The question arises as to why the Legislature included the words \u201cand shall be verified by the officer\u201d and what is meant thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Truly, without stretching one\u2019s imagination in the face of all of the other enumerated safeguards, this clause is not meaningless or it would have been omitted entirely. Not only was it added but mandated by employing the word \u201cshall\u201d by way of preface.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The Legislature unquestionably wanted the officer to verify the inventory as an additional safeguard. Perhaps, this requirement was designed to insure the person from whom taken and/or the applicant officer that the \u201ctaking officer\u201d took no more than that listed thereon in the event either witness was absent at the time of the taking and to commit the \u201ctaking officer\u201d officially in the event more might be discovered later to have been taken by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">What does the word \u201cverified\u201d mean?</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">In <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, Fourth Edition, </em>\u201cverify\u201d is first defined as follows, complete with the annotations also shown:</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">\u201cTo confirm or substantiate by oath. <em>S. B. McMaster, Inc., </em>v. <em>Chevrolet Motor Co., </em>D. C. S. C., 3 F. 2d 469, 471; <em>Francesconi </em>v. <em>Independent School Dist. of Wall Lake, </em>204 Iowa 307, 214 N. W. 882, 885; <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>State, </em>116 Neb. 45, 215 N. W. 564, 566. Particularly used of making formal oath to accounts, petitions, pleadings, and other papers.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">\u201cThe word \u2018verified,\u2019 <em>when used in a statute, </em>ordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>narily imports a verity attested by the sanctity of an oath. [Emphasis added.] <em>Bristol </em>v. <em>Buck, </em>201 App. Div. 100, 194 N. Y. S. 53, 55. It is frequently used interchangeably with \u2018sworn.\u2019 <em>Francesconi </em>v. <em>Independent School Dist. of Wall Lake, </em>204 Iowa, 307, 214 N. W. 882, 885.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\"><em>Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary, Third Revision </em>defines \u201cverify\u201d as follows: \u201cThe swearing to an affidavit. To confirm and substantiate by oath * *</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Applying the principle of strict construction of a criminal statute against the state as well as the ordinary legal meaning of the word \u201cverify,\u201d the failure of Officer Roger D. Browning to confirm or substantiate by oath invalidates the search and seizure made in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Accordingly, defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence seized is hereby granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
