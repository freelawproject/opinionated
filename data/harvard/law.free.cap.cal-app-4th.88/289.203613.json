(Pen. Code,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u00a7\u00a7451, subds. (c) &amp; (d), 243, subd. (b), 69.) The court sentenced Labaer to prison for four years on the arson of a structure count, and imposed a five-year probation term for the battery convictions. Labaer appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>In the published portion of the opinion, we conclude substantial evidence supported the jury\u2019s implied finding that the subject matter of the fire, a stripped-down mobilehome, was a \u201cstructure\u201d within the meaning of section 451, subdivision (c). In the unpublished portion, we hold the trial court erred when it ordered a five-year probation term on the misdemeanor battery convictions. We affirm the judgment, but remand for resentencing on the battery convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Labaer owned a double-wide mobilehome that he kept at RV World, a storage facility. Although the storage contract did not allow him to do so, he frequently stayed in the mobilehome. After Labaer repeatedly failed to pay monthly storage fees, a court declared the mobilehome abandoned and permitted sale of the home and its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">Immediately before the public auction began, the auctioneer saw Labaer and several other men disassemble parts of the mobilehome. The men removed trusses from the roof, aluminum siding pan\u00e9ls, and sliding glass doors, and loaded the parts on a truck. The auctioneer called the sheriff\u2019s department, and sheriff\u2019s deputies arrested Labaer on unrelated misdemeanor warrants. While waiting in court, Labaer referred to the mobilehome and said, \u201cI should just bum the damn thing down.\u201d Labaer was later released from custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">At the auction held later that day, RV World, the only bidder, purchased Labaer\u2019s mobilehome for $100. The next day, Jeffrey Funk, manager of a nearby nursery, noticed the mobilehome on fire and saw Labaer backing away from the southeast portion. When Deputy Sheriff Roderick MacDonald arrived, Funk identified Labaer as the person who was near the mobilehome when the fire started. Labaer interfered with Deputy MacDonald\u2019s investigation of the fire by being hostile and slapping Deputy MacDonald\u2019s hand when the deputy reached for Labaer\u2019s jacket. When Deputy Sheriff Jonda Hammons directed Labaer to the patrol car, Labaer began pushing and hitting her. After witnessing this and receiving punches from Labaer, Deputy MacDonald placed Labaer in a carotid restraint hold and handcuffed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">The jury found Labaer guilty of arson of a structure (\u00a7451, subd. (c)), arson of property of another (\u00a7451, subd. (d)), two counts of battery upon Deputies MacDonald and Hammons (\u00a7 243, subd. (b)), and resisting an executive officer (\u00a7 69).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">I. <em>The Mobilehome Was a Structure Within the Meaning of Section 451, Subdivision (c)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Labaer contends the prosecution failed to introduce sufficient evidence that the mobilehome was a \u201cstructure\u201d within the meaning of section 451, subdivision (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">\u201cA person is guilty of arson when he or she willfully and maliciously sets fire to or bums or causes to be burned . . . any structure, forest land or property . . . (\u00a7451.) The arson statutes provide different levels of punishment, depending on the subject matter of the arson. (\u00a7 451.) These statutory categories, in descending level of punishment, are: (1) arson resulting in great bodily injury (five, seven, or nine years); (2) arson to \u201can inhabited structure or inhabited property\u201d (three, five, or eight years); (3) arson of a \u201cstructure or forest land\u201d (two, four, or six years); and (4) arson to other types of property (16 months, two, or three years). (\u00a7 451, subds. (a), (b), (c) &amp; (d).) By creating these different levels of punishment, the Legislature intended to impose punishment \u201c \u2018in proportion to the seriousness of the offense,\u2019 \u201d and, in particular, \u201caccording to the injury or potential injury to human life involved . . . .\u201d <em>(People v. Green </em>(1983) 146 Cal.App.3d 369, 378 [194 Cal.Rptr. 128].)</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">In this case, Labaer was charged and found guilty of the third type of arson: the burning of a \u201cstructure or forest land.\u201d (\u00a7 451, subd. (c).) Section 450, subdivision (a) states that for purposes of the arson statutes, \u201c \u2018Structure\u2019 means any building, or commercial or public tent, bridge, tunnel, or powerplant.\u201d The trial court instructed the jury on this definition. The prosecutor\u2019s theory was that the mobilehome was a \u201cstructure\u201d because it was a \u201cbuilding.\u201d The Penal Code does not define \u201cbuilding\u201d for purposes of arson; we therefore apply the plain meaning of the word. <em>(People v. Jasso </em>(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 591, 595 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 572].)</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">Labaer does not dispute that the mobilehome\u2014as it existed during the months before the fire\u2014constituted a \u201cbuilding\u201d under the arson statutes. The evidence established the home was fixed to a particular location, could not be readily moved, and had been used as Labaer\u2019s residence for several months. Labaer argues instead that the dilapidated condition of the home on the day of the fire\u2014caused primarily by his illegal dismantling activities the previous day\u2014converted the mobilehome from a \u201cstructure\u201d under section 451, subdivision (c) to generic \u201cproperty\u201d subject to lesser punishment under section 451, subdivision (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>The easy answer to this contention is that the Legislature could not have intended that a criminal defendant benefit from his or her unlawful activities to obtain a lesser punishment merely by attempting to take apart a building shortly before setting it on fire. The more lengthy\u2014but equally correct\u2014 response to Labaer\u2019s contention is that despite his dismantling activities, the mobilehome remained a \u201cbuilding\u201d within the meaning of the arson statute because the dismantling was never completed. Although the mobilehome was in a substantially substandard condition, there was ample evidence showing it remained a standing and constructed structure that had four sides and a partial roof.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">In this respect, Labaer\u2019s argument that the home no longer had walls or a roof does not accurately reflect the record. Four witnesses testified concerning the nature of the mobilehome\u2019s exterior. Although each witness had a slightly different opinion on the subject, the evidence showed that the mobilehome did have some form of exterior walls and at least a portion of a roof.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">The auctioneer testified that after Labaer\u2019s dismantling activities there \u201cabsolutely\u201d were walls on the mobilehome: \u201cthe front was still there. The front door, the sides, [and] the roof to the front [portion] of the mobile home [were] still there . . . .\u201d He stated that someone could walk into the home and be shielded from the sun, rain, and wind. He explained that the roof fully covered one of the two parts that composed the double-wide mobilehome.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">The storage park manager testified that after the sale she viewed the outside of the mobilehome and walked through the inside of the home. She said, \u201cthe outside of the mobile home mostly looked pink because of insulation, and it had been out in the weather and the insulation was kind of drooping off of it, and there were studs, and there was no siding on the double-wide. There were windows, doors. In places, there was plastic or visqueen over the outside . ... [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6] There were some stairs in the north side . . . leading into a doorway, or a door, that was on the north side. There were windows along the east side. I think on the south side there was plywood . . . instead of just insulation, there was plywood on there as well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Jeffrey Funk, the neighboring commercial nursery manager, testified, \u201c[t]here were no walls on it, really. It was an open mobilehome. Looked unfinished, actually.\u201d In response to the court\u2019s question as to what he meant by \u201copen,\u201d Funk stated, \u201c[t]wo-by-four framing. No plastic, no outside wall.\u201d Funk later clarified that there was two-by-four wood framing around the entire mobilehome, and that at least two sides were covered by \u201cplastic sheeting.\u201d Funk testified that a roof covered the entire home, but admitted he could only see two sides of the mobilehome.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>The arson investigator, who viewed the mobilehome only after the fire, testified that the structure did not appear to \u201chave any walls to it [before the fire]. What was used on it was a plastic visqu[een] that looked like it was used to shield or give some sort of shielding from the weather, which is a little unusual. It looked like it was either under construction or being tom down . . . .\u201d He also confirmed that the mobilehome had only one-half of a roof before the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution <em>(People v. Hatch </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 260, 272 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 80, 991 P.2d 165]), the jury could have reached certain reasonable conclusions regarding the mobilehome. First, it appears reasonably clear that although the mobilehome did not have four solid walls, it had four \u201csides,\u201d and each of these sides was enclosed by some material\u2014two-by-four open wood framing and/or plastic visqueen sheeting with studs and insulation. Second, it was essentially undisputed that although the home did not have a full roof, an aluminum or light metal roof covered at least one-half of the mobilehome, the front section that contained the bedroom. Third, despite this unfinished-looking exterior, the mobilehome\u2019s interior was largely intact. A solid middle wall divided the double-wide mobilehome lengthwise. Stairs led to the front door, and the mobilehome had a particleboard floor. The home contained furniture and other accessories, including a bed, desk, dresser, lounge, and fish aquarium.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">On this factual record, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to conclude this partly disassembled mobilehome was a \u201cstructure\u201d within the meaning of section 451, subdivision (c). To constitute a \u201cstructure,\u201d the statute does not require a finished or completed building. Although there was conflicting testimony, the jury was entitled to find the testimony credible that the mobilehome had four sides and one-half of a roof, and that the building would provide shelter from the elements. Viewed from this perspective, the mobilehome certainly was a \u201cbuilding,\u201d rather than razed property. Further, although in its partially disassembled state the mobilehome may not have been appropriate for habitation, the subdivision does not require a building be inhabited or be capable of being inhabited before it may constitute a structure. (Compare \u00a7 451, subd. (b) with \u00a7 451, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Although there are no California reported cases on the meaning of a \u201cbuilding\u201d for purposes of the arson statutes, decisions in other states support our conclusion. For example, in one Maryland case, the subject of the arson was \u201ca 20-year-old shell of an unused clubhouse, primarily of \u2018[s]teel skeleton construction with a frame flooring interior and bearing walls with a built up roof.\u2019 The windows . . . had been removed or broken, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>utilities had been turned off, copper piping removed and the interior severely vandalized.\u201d <em>(Brown v. State </em>(1978) 39 Md.App. 497 [388 A.2d 130, 133], reversed on other grounds in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>State </em>(1979) 285 Md. 469 [403 A.2d 788].) Notwithstanding the rundown condition of the clubhouse, the court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument the property was not a \u201cbuilding\u201d as used in the Maryland arson statute. (388 A.2d at pp. 133-135.) The court reasoned that \u201c[dilapidated or not, used or unused, the \u2018clubhouse\u2019 still stood, and the evidence further demonstrated that its steel-framed walls and roof had, just months prior to the burning, been used for the storage of various persons\u2019 property. Such standing structures fall under the protection of our statute, and their unlawful burning is proscribed despite their present, past or future purpose. If the Legislature intended to restrict the protection of buildings to those \u2018in use\u2019 or those with a contemporaneous intended use, it could more easily have added such clarifying words than can we in retrospect, and with far more right to have done so.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 134-135.)</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The facts here are similar. The mobilehome was still a standing structure and effectively served as a storage space for Labaer\u2019s various personal items. Despite the dilapidated condition of its exterior, the mobilehome was built property with four sides and a partial roof; individuals could enter the mobilehome and walk through its interior. The fact that portions of the walls were open (the interior was visible through the two-by-four wooden framing) does not mean the building was no longer a building. There is nothing in the applicable statutes supporting that the Legislature intended a structure be fully covered or of a particular quality before it could fall within the definition of a \u201cbuilding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">In contending the mobilehome property was not a \u201cbuilding,\u201d Labaer relies primarily on the burglary statutes. This reliance is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">First, the arson statutes specifically provide that the definition of a \u201cstructure\u201d has the stated meaning \u201c[i]n this chapter.\u201d (\u00a7 450.) The burglary statutes are contained in an entirely separate chapter and therefore judicial interpretations of these statutes are not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">Additionally, the analogy is not helpful because the legislative intent underlying the arson and burglary statutes is different. Because the burglary statutes are designed to protect against <em>unauthorized </em>entry, courts construing these statutes focus on whether the structure was such that a reasonable person would believe the property afforded a \u201creasonable expectation of protection from invasion.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Nible </em>(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 838, 844 [247 Cal.Rptr. 396]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Brooks </em>(1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 200, 204 [183 Cal.Rptr. 773].) The same principle does not apply in interpreting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>arson statutes. The \u201cstructure\u201d element in section 451, subdivision (c) was not intended to impose a higher punishment merely because the property owner has reflected an intention to keep others out. Instead, its purpose is to distinguish between those types of property for which a fire would create a higher potential of injury to human life. <em>(People v. Green, supra, </em>146 Cal.App.3d at p. 378.) Because a building, such as the mobilehome here, is capable of holding persons within its interior, a fire would be much more likely to create a higher potential for bodily injury than a fire to other types of property falling within section 451, subdivision (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Further, even assuming we apply the definition of \u201cbuilding\u201d applicable to the burglary statutes, the mobilehome here would satisfy this requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">A person commits burglary when he or she \u201centers any house, room, apartment, tenement, shop, warehouse, store, mill, barn, stable, outhouse <em>or other building, </em>tent, vessel . . . trailer coach . . . any house car . . . inhabited camper . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 459, italics added.) Under this statute, a building is generally defined to mean a place that has walls on all sides and is covered by a roof. <em>(In re Amber S. </em>(1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 185, 187 [39 Cal.Rptr.2d 672]; <em>People v. Brooks, supra, </em>133 Cal.App.3d at p. 204.) But \u201c[w]hat comprises four walls and a roof has been broadly construed.\u201d <em>(Brooks, </em>at p. 205.) The walls, in whatever form, must provide a significant barrier to entrance without being cut or broken. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 206.) The composition of the walls is not an important factor. <em>(People v. Buyle </em>(1937) 22 Cal.App.2d 143, 148 [70 P.2d 955].) A building is \u201c \u2018a structure which has a capacity to contain, and [is] designed for the habitation of man or animals, or the sheltering of property.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 148-149.) The Legislature intended the broadest possible interpretation of \u201cbuilding\u201d to be used in the context of the burglary statutes. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brooks, supra, </em>133 Cal.App.3d at p. 204.)</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">As discussed, Labaer\u2019s mobilehome had four sides, as well as a middle wall. In addition, a roof covered at least one-half of the home. The law of burglary treats Labaer\u2019s mobilehome, made of two-by-four framing, plastic and insulation, the same as if it were made of different material, such as brick or plaster. Because chicken wire and a chain link fence have satisfied the requirement of walls, two-by-four wood studs and/or plastic and insulation similarly satisfy the requirement in this case. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brooks, supra, </em>133 Cal.App.3d at p. 205.) Therefore, even if we applied the definition of a building under the burglary statutes, Labaer\u2019s mobilehome would qualify under section 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>II., III.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The sentence on counts 3 and 4 (\u00a7 243, subd.
