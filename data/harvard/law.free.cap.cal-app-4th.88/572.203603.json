The original complaint charged negligent misrepresentation, common law fraud, deceit under Civil Code sections 1709 and 1710, and unlawful market manipulation activity under Corporations Code sections 25400 and 25500.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">In March 2000, the Plan brought a motion to be appointed lead plaintiff of the class, and for certification of the class only as to the fourth cause of action, alleging violations of Corporations Code sections 25400 and 25500.  On May 3, 2000, the trial court found that the Plan was a \u201cprofessional plaintiff,\u201d that it was not typical of the class, did not have sufficient knowledge of the facts of the case or involvement in it, and was not, therefore, an adequate class representative.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court refused to appoint the Plan as lead plaintiff, and continued the certification motion to an unspecified date.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">On June 30, 2000, Gary Feldman sought leave to intervene in the action. The trial court denied the motion after finding Feldman\u2019s claims time-barred under Corporations Code section 25506.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The matter was set for a status conference on July 18, 2000. At the status conference, plaintiffs were still without a candidate for lead plaintiff, and sought leave to notify the class of their need for alternative class representatives. The court allowed plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>to submit a draft of the proposed communication. The court proposed its own form of notice. Defendants then proposed to send a letter in response to plaintiffs\u2019, and the court proposed its own form of response.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">In a series of hearings, the court heard extensive argument for and against the wording of the letters, as well as testimony regarding the accuracy of statements made in them. The court heard and made suggested changes to language which it considered to be slanted, misleading, or inflammatory, and the parties eventually arrived at language approved by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Plaintiffs and defendants then filed separate petitions for writ of mandate. Plaintiffs\u2019 petition asks that we set aside the trial court\u2019s imposed edits of its letter seeking a new class representative, and its order authorizing defendants to contact putative class members in response to the letter. Defendants seek to prohibit plaintiffs from any solicitation of a new representative by mass mailing; or, in the alternative, to eliminate from plaintiff\u2019s letter any reference to compensation, a boldface reference to loss of rights, and a boldface reference to a deadline; and if plaintiffs\u2019 letter is to be permitted, defendants ask that its responsive letter not be edited in any way, unless it is found to be materially inaccurate or incomplete.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\"> We consolidated the petitions and issued an order to show cause on December 1, 2000.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">Each party contends that the trial court should not have permitted the other to communicate with the potential class members under the circumstances presented here. Thus, defendants contend that plaintiffs should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>not be permitted to send a letter soliciting a new class representative, and plaintiffs contend that defendants should not be permitted to send a letter urging potential class members not to participate.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Plaintiffs and defendants both acknowledge that there is scant California authority regarding communication with potential class members prior to certification. Plaintiffs contend that their communication with the potential class members is constitutionally protected by the First Amendment, as commercial speech, so long as it is not false, misleading, or deceptive. (See <em>Shapero </em>v. <em>Kentucky Bar Assn. </em>(1988) 486 U.S. 466, 472 [108 S.Ct. 1916, 1921, 100 L.Ed.2d 475].)</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Defendants contend that plaintiffs\u2019 proposed communication is improper solicitation, which should not be condoned by the court, because plaintiffs initiated this action with a \u201cprofessional plaintiff\u2019 whose credibility is questionable, under circumstances which make it apparent that the attorneys are in charge of the litigation, not a genuine plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">To put the issues into perspective, we must begin, not with contentions regarding limitations on speech, but by examining plaintiffs\u2019 motion to certify the class, and to approve the Plan as lead plaintiff, which was heard several months before the hearings on the proposed communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">To obtain class certification, the proponents of a consumer class action have the burden to prove not only that there are questions of law or fact common to the class, and that the claims or defenses of the representative plaintiffs are typical of the claims or defenses of the class, they must also prove that the representative plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. <em>(Richmond </em>v. <em>Dart Industries, Inc. </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 462, 470 [174 Cal.Rptr. 515, 629 P.2d 23]; Civ. Code, \u00a7 1781, subd. (b)(2)-(4).) After hearing the parties\u2019 argument and evidence in the form of declarations and excerpts from depositions, the trial court found that there were common questions of law or fact. However, the court found the Plan to be atypical of the class, and that it would not fairly or adequately protect its interests, and denied the Plan\u2019s motion for appointment as lead plaintiff. It did not, however, deny the motion for class certification. Instead, the court continued it indefinitely to give plaintiffs the opportunity to find a suitable representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">In its written order, the court made extensive findings. It found that the Plan was a \u201cprofessional plaintiff,\u201d having filed approximately 20 lawsuits alleging fraud and mismanagement in securities or derivative actions, and represented in substantially all of them by its attorneys in this action, Stull, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Stull &amp; Brody, with the assistance in some of them by Weiss &amp; Yourman, also counsel in this action. The court also found the Plan, acting through its administrator, Caesar, to be an inadequate representative, because Caesar demonstrated inadequate knowledge about the case, and his credibility was weak. The court concluded, \u201cIt is clear to this court that the attorneys, rather than the Plan, are in control of this litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">As a general proposition, class actions are favored in California. <em>(City of San Jose </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 447, 457 [115 Cal.Rptr. 797, 525 P.2d 701, 76 A.L.R.3d 1223]; see also <em>Vasquez v. Superior Court </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 800, 807-808 [94 Cal.Rptr. 796, 484 P.2d 964].) Federal law also favors class actions. Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (28 U.S.C.) expresses \u201c \u2018a policy in favor of having litigation in which common interests, or common questions of law or fact prevail, disposed of where feasible in a single lawsuit.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Gulf Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Bernard </em>(1981) 452 U.S. 89, 99-100, fn. 11 [101 S.Ct. 2193, 2199, 68 L.Ed.2d 693].) In furtherance of the policy favoring class actions, courts have allowed plaintiffs the opportunity to amend their complaints to redefine the class, or to add new individual plaintiffs, or both, in order to establish a suitable representative, when the named plaintiff has been found inadequate. (See, e.g., <em>La Sala v. American Sav. &amp; Loan Assn. </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 864, 872. [97 Cal.Rptr. 849, 489 P.2d 1113].) For example, plaintiffs are permitted to conduct discovery to find a suitable representative (see, e.g., <em>Budget Finance Plan v. Superior Court </em>(1973) 34 Cal.App.3d 794, 799 [110 Cal.Rptr. 302]) and they are permitted precertification communication with potential class members for the purpose of investigation and preparation of their claims or defenses. (See, e.g., <em>Atari, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 867, 873 [212 Cal.Rptr. 773].)</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">But the tide has turned and not all class actions are favored. \u201cIn recent years, concern over potentially meritless securities lawsuits filed by \u2018professional\u2019 plaintiffs abounded.\u201d <em>(AUSA Life Ins. Co. v. Ernst and Young </em>(2d Cir. 2000) 206 F.3d 202, 218.) Companies choose to settle, \u201c \u2018rather than face the enormous expense of discovery and trial,\u2019 \u201d which has created \u201c \u2018an in terrorem effect on Corporate America.\u2019 \u201d <em>(EP MedSystems, Inc. v. EchoCath, Inc. </em>(3d Cir. 2000) 235 F.3d 865, 881.)</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">In 1995, Congress passed the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, which imposes stricter pleading requirements, limits precertification discovery, and limits the number of actions in which a person may be a lead plaintiff. <em>(AUSA Life Ins. Co. v. Ernst and Young, supra, </em>206 F.3d at p. 218; see 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77a et seq.) The purpose of the act was, among other things, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>to empower investors to exercise primary control over private securities litigation, instead of their lawyers, and to encourage defendants to fight abusive claims. <em>(AUSA Life Ins. Co. v. Ernst and Young, supra, </em>206 F.3d at p. 218; see also <em>S.G. Cowen Sec. v. U.S. Dist. Court for N.D. of CA </em>(9th Cir. 1999) 189 F.3d 909, 911.) Indeed, lawyer-driven litigation and professional plaintiffs are the primary abuses which led Congress to enact the legislation. (See <em>Burke v. Ruttenberg </em>(N.D.Ala. 2000) 102 F.Supp.2d 1280, 1305; <em>In re Telxon Corp. Securities Litigation, supra, </em>67 F.Supp.2d at p. 815.)</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">In 1998, Congress went further. It amended title 15 of the United States Code section 77p, to prohibit class actions by private parties, in state or federal court, with exceptions not applicable here, based upon state statutory or common law, which allege \u201c(1) an untrue statement or omission of a material fact in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security; or [\u00b6] (2) that the defendant used or employed any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of a covered security.\u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77p(b).)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">While class actions are an important means to <em>prevent </em>a failure of justice in our judicial system, they also carry the potential to create injustice. <em>(Linder </em>v. <em>Thrifty Oil Co. </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 429, 435 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 179, 2 P.3d 27].) \u201c[The] potential for misuse of the class action mechanism is obvious. Its benefits to class members are often nominal and symbolic, with persons other than class members becoming the chief beneficiaries.\u201d <em>(Deposit Guaranty Nat. Bank v. Roper </em>(1980) 445 U.S. 326, 339 [100 S.Ct. 1166, 1174, 63 L.Ed.2d 427].)</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Despite its general support for class actions, our Supreme Court \u201chas consistently admonished trial courts to carefully weigh respective benefits and burdens and to allow maintenance of the class action only where substantial benefits accrue both to litigants and the courts. [Citations.] <em>It has also urged that the same procedures facilitating proper class actions be used to prevent class suits where they prove nonbeneficial.\u201d (City of San Jose </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>12 Cal.3d at p. 459, italics added.) Once the trial court has identified a potential abuse, it \u201chas both the duty and the broad authority to exercise control over a class action and to enter appropriate orders governing the conduct of counsel . . . .\u201d <em>(Gulf Oil Co. v. Bernard, supra, </em>452 U.S. at p. 100 [101 S.Ct. at p. 2200].) A trial court acts properly when it refuses to certify class actions in which the named plaintiff is simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>\u201c \u2018lending his name to a suit controlled entirely by the class attorney.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Kirkpatrick </em>v. <em>J.C. Bradford &amp; Co. </em>(11th Cir. 1987) 827 F.2d 718, <em>727.)</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Here, the findings by the court in connection with its decision that the Plan was not an appropriate party plaintiff signal to us a potential for abuse in this particular action. We have found no reported case in which a trial court has permitted amendment, discovery, or investigation, for the purpose of finding and substituting an appropriate class representative, after an express finding that the action was filed by a professional plaintiff and controlled by attorneys. Nor have we found any reported case in which a court has exercised similar discretion in favor of any party found to have abused the class-action procedure in some other way. In <em>Atari, Inc. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>166 Cal.App.3d at page 873, precertification investigation or other communication with potential class members was held to be appropriate, <em>absent a showing of actual or threatened abuse. </em>In <em>Budget Finance Plan. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>34 Cal.App.3d at page 799, the plaintiffs were permitted to conduct discovery to find a suitable representative after the trial court found a <em>prima facie proper class action.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Precertification communication carries the potential for abuse. Thus, any \u201corder limiting communications between parties and potential class members should be based on a clear record and specific findings that reflect a weighing of the need for a limitation and the potential interference with the rights of the parties.\u201d <em>(Gulf Oil Co. v. Bernard, supra, </em>452 U.S. at p. 101 [101 S.Ct. at p. 2200].) The trial court should identify the potential abuses and weigh them against the rights of the parties under the circumstances. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 102 [101 S.Ct. at p. 2201].) We are not convinced from the record that the trial court did weigh the potential abuses against the rights of the parties in granting a continuance or in addressing the issue of solicitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">At the hearing, the court stated to the parties: \u201cI want to move this case along. I want to make sure that the case is fairly presented for the plaintiff so that they can get a class representative, and that\u2019s what my goal here is.\u201d The court then granted an open continuance to allow for the solicitation. It is not the court\u2019s role to encourage or discourage prosecution of class actions. Thus, we believe that remand is necessary for the court to readdress this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">In reassessing the matter, the court must acknowledge its finding that the Plan is a professional plaintiff and not an appropriate representative. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>finding has placed the court in the anomalous position of approving solicitation of a lead plaintiff for a class action which the court might well have cause to refuse to certify at a later date. To this end, we suggest that on remand, the trial court calendar a hearing on plaintiffs\u2019 motion to certify. If, upon weighing the findings already made, any further evidence of abuse, the rights of the parties, and the policies underlying class action procedures, the trial court determines that plaintiffs have established a prima facie proper class action, it will then be at the appropriate starting point to determine what controls, if any, should be imposed on communications to the potential class members.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Plaintiffs contend that since their communication with potential class members is protected commercial speech under the First Amendment, the only limitation is that it not be false, misleading, or deceptive. (See <em>Shapero v. Kentucky Bar Assn., supra, </em>486 U.S. at p. 472 [108 S.Ct. at p. 1921].) We disagree. In the context of a class action, it is the court\u2019s authority and duty to exercise control over the class action to protect the rights of all parties, and to prevent abuses which might undermine the proper administration of justice. (See <em>Gulf Oil Co. v. Bernard, supra, </em>452 U.S. at pp. 100-103 [101 S.Ct. at pp. 2200-2201].)</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Although traditional concerns about \u201cstirring up litigation\u201d have been discredited by the Supreme Court as the sole reason to bar attorney advertising and written solicitations (see <em>Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel </em>(1985) 471 U.S. 626, 642 [105 S.Ct. 2265, 2277, 85 L.Ed.2d 652]), the court has not retreated from its suggestion in <em>Gulf Oil, </em>that such concerns are relevant to determining what limitations are consistent with the policies underlying class action procedures. (See <em>Gulf Oil Co. v. Bernard, supra, </em>452 U.S. at p. 99, fn. 11 [101 S.Ct. at p. 2199].) We recognize that the court did not reach the constitutional issue in <em>Gulf Oil, </em>but we shall follow the lead of its dictum, that the \u201cconstitutional issue should await a case with a fully developed record concerning possible abuses of the class-action device.\u201d <em>(Gulf Oil Co. v. Bernard, supra, </em>452 U.S. at p. 102, fn. 15 [101 S.Ct. at pp. 2200-2201].) In this case, such a record should include a carefully crafted order demonstrating the trial court\u2019s weighing of any abuses or potential abuses against the rights of the parties, including potential class members, and the integrity of the litigation process.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">Should the trial court find itself and the parties back in the position of crafting a letter notifying the potential class members of the status of the litigation and the need for a lead plaintiff, the court will have the appropriate record to make specific findings which \u201creflect a weighing of the need for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>limitation and the potential interference with the rights of the parties.\u201d <em>(Gulf Oil Co. v. Bernard, supra, </em>452 U.S. at p. 101 [101 S.Ct. at p. 2200].) Communications that misrepresent the status or effect of the pending action, or which may cause confusion, adversely affect the administration of justice. <em>(Gulf Oil Co. v. Bernard, supra, </em>452 U.S. at p. 101, fn. 12 [101 S.Ct. at p. 2200].) The court should take care that any communication approved by it be completely neutral in language, merely notifying of the status of the lawsuit, the need for a lead plaintiff, and the consequences of dismissal if no qualified plaintiff steps forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">The order to show cause is discharged, and the petitions for writ of mandate are granted. The matter is remanded to the trial court with directions to vacate the orders previously made and for further hearing consistent with this opinion to determine class certification and the need for court intervention in the communication process, if necessary. Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Vogel (C. S.), P. J., and Curry, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b459-10\">On February 22, 1999, a first amended complaint was filed, showing Robert E. Yelin, individually and on behalf of the Yelin Family Trust, as additional named plaintiffs. There is no motion or order in the parties\u2019 appendices regarding the Yelins\u2019 intervention, and the parties have offered no explanation of his role in these proceedings. In December 2000, in response to defendants\u2019 motion for summary adjudication, the Plan dismissed the causes of action for fraud, deceit, and negligent misrepresentation, as to itself only, leaving only the securities violations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b459-11\">\u201cThe term professional plaintiff generally is used to refer to a plaintiff who is either a frequent filer ... or a \u2018hired gun\u2019 (one who allows an attorney to sue in his name in exchange for a fee), or both.\u201d <em>(In re Telxon Corp.
