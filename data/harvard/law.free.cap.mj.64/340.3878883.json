Carruthers entered pleas of not guilty to the charges but was convicted by a general court-martial composed of officer and enlisted members.

Carruthers used forged requisition orders purporting to request supplies for his unit to obtain access to the DRMO from which he transported stolen property to an off-base storage facility. He also sold and gave items he had stolen to civilians and military personnel, including his coconspirators. Further facts relevant to each issue will be set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">\n<em>Cross-Examination of Sergeant First Class (SFC) Rafferty</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">At trial, one of Carruthers\u2019 coconspirators, SFC Paul Rafferty, testified for the Government. Rafferty had entered a pretrial agreement to plead guilty in federal district court to one count of larceny of over $1,000 of government property. At the time of Carruthers\u2019 court-martial, Rafferty had not yet been charged by federal officials. Carruthers\u2019 civilian defense counsel (CDC) cross-examined Rafferty extensively about the terms and effect of this pretrial agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-9\">[CDC]: You knew, by not going to a court-martial, that you wouldn\u2019t be subjected to a punitive discharge which is \u2014 could cost you your career and your retirement; isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-10\">[Rafferty]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-11\">[CDC]: Do you also know that, if and when you are convicted by the federal authorities, that you could still be administratively discharged and receive an other than honorable discharge? Do you realize that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-14\">[Rafferty]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-15\">[CDC]: But the government hasn\u2019t processed you for an administrative discharge, have they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-16\">[Rafferty]: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-17\">[CDC]: You don\u2019t know whether they\u2019re intending to do that either, do you? [Rafferty]: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-18\">[CDC]: In fact, that hasn\u2019t been discussed, has it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-19\">[Rafferty]: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-20\">[CDC]: In fact, wouldn\u2019t you agree that a lot of what happens with you after this court-martial could depend on your testimony at trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-21\">[Rafferty]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-22\">-[CDC]: If you do a good job for the government, they\u2019re going to help take care of you; isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-23\">[Rafferty]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-24\">[CDC]: Now isn\u2019t it true that, in the plea agreement, it says that, \u201cif the defendant provides false, incomplete or misleading information or testimony, that would constitute a breach of this agreement by the defendant, and the defendant shall be subject to prosecution for any federal criminal violation. Any information provided by the defendant may be used against the defendant in such prosecution\u201d? Isn\u2019t it true that, if for some reason there\u2019s an indication that you don\u2019t provide accurate information here at court, that this plea agreement can be revoked? Isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-25\">[Rafferty]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-26\">[CDC]: Wouldn\u2019t it be real important for you to testify today consistently with how you told investigators all this happened? Would you agree with that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-27\">[Rafferty]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-28\">[CDC]: \u2019Cause, if you didn\u2019t, then certainly it could be indicated that you were provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>ing some false or misleading information; isn\u2019t that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\">[Rafferty]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-6\">[CDC]: One count of theft of public property over $1,000, and that\u2019s it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">[Rafferty]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-8\">[CDC]: One count \u2014 your understanding is that you\u2019re going to be charged with one count, even though \u2014 well, let me ask you, how many times would you say you actually took possession of property from DRMO with the intent to steal? How many times did you do that and walk away from DRMO?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-9\">[Rafferty]: I couldn\u2019t even remember the count, sir. A lot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-10\">[CDC]: A lot, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-11\">[Rafferty]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-12\">[CDC]: In fact, you understand, don\u2019t you, there\u2019s a good possibility that you may just get some suspended\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-13\">[Trial Counsel]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-14\">In an Article 39(a), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 839(a) (2000), session with the military judge, the Government objected to the defense\u2019s questions about Rafferty\u2019s potential sentence as being improper for the panel to consider before a finding of guilt. Defense counsel responded that testimony about Rafferty\u2019s potential maximum punishment would be important to show his motive for testifying and that if he could not be cross-examined on this point, the agreement itself should be entered into evidence. The defense counsel did not, however, explain what special significance the maximum punishment in the plea agreement had in motivating the witness\u2019s testimony as compared to other aspects of the pretrial negotiation. The military judge sustained the objection and did not permit further questions or other evidence as to the specifics of the plea agreement, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-15\">I feel that it\u2019s just not relevant; and, even if it is, I find, under [M.R.E.] 403, the probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of misleading the members. That said, counsel, if you want to go back and find some case law on this point that indicates that \u2014 specific to the plea bargain, that has not already been brought out\u2014 should go before the members, then please bring that to my attention; and, if you can point to me some case law on point, then I\u2019ll allow you to recall Sergeant First Class Rafferty and bring that out. At this point, to me, you\u2019ve made your point, Mr. Dunn, that Sergeant First Class Rafferty has a plea bargain with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, which means that he will be tried in U.S. District Court, not at a court-martial; that he would not be subject to the potential penalty of a punitive discharge. I think that point has clearly been made. I think that\u2019s really what you\u2019re driving at. You\u2019re driving at the different potential penalties. From what I hear you saying and my view of the way you\u2019ve approached this is to try to point out and to lay the foundation so that, if we do get to sentencing, that issue of a punitive discharge is obviously very important to you and to Staff Sergeant Carruthers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-17\">The military judge asked if there were further questions or objections and hearing none, recalled the members. Under further cross-examination Rafferty again confirmed that his own treatment by the Government could depend on his performance as a witness against Carruthers and that the Army had not yet taken any adverse administrative action against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-18\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b523-19\">Carruthers argues that the defense should have been permitted to bring to light the sentencing details of Rafferty\u2019s pretrial agreement because the possibility Rafferty would receive a substantially reduced sentence in exchange for his cooperation with the Government provided \u201ca clear motive to lie.\u201d Carruthers disputes the military judge\u2019s conclusion that testimony about Rafferty\u2019s possible sentence was irrelevant and argues that the military judge\u2019s second ground for exclusion \u2014 the danger that the evidence would mislead the members \u2014 could have been remedied by a curative instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-20\">The Government responds that defense counsel had already elicited many details of the plea bargain from Rafferty, including that he was not facing a court-martial, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>he was doing everything he could to avoid a punitive discharge, and that the leniency he expected to receive depended on his performance as a witness against Carruthers.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">In <em>James, </em>61 M.J. at 134, this court reiterated its adherence to the standard set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>Van Arsdall </em>for evaluating a trial judge\u2019s limitation of inquiry into potential bias on cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">[W]e have recognized that the exposure of a witness\u2019 motivation in testifying is a proper and important function of the constitutionally protected right of cross-examination. It does not follow, of course, that the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment prevents a trial judge from imposing any limits on defense counsel\u2019s inquiry into the potential bias of a prosecution witness. On the contrary, trial judges retain wide latitude insofar as the Confrontation Clause is concerned to impose reasonable limits on such cross-examination based on concerns about, among other things, harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witness\u2019 safety, or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 134-35 (citing <em>Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. at 678-79, 106 S.Ct. 1431) (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">In light of this \u201cwide latitude,\u201d a military judge\u2019s decision to limit cross-examination as to the sentencing details of a prosecution witness\u2019s plea agreement is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 136; <em>United States v. Jones, </em>49 M.J. 85, 88 (C.A.A.F.1998). However, this court has held that the military judge\u2019s discretionary authority arises only after \u201c \u2018there has been permitted as a matter of right sufficient cross-examination.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jones, </em>49 M.J. at 88 (quoting <em>United States v. Lindstrom, </em>698 F.2d 1154, 1160 (11th Cir.1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Defense counsel engaged Rafferty in a lengthy cross-examination, during which he admitted: (1) that his plea agreement could get him out of a court-martial and punitive discharge; (2) that the Government would \u201ctake care of him\u201d if he were to \u201cdo a good job\u201d at trial; (3) that his story at trial would have to be consistent with what he told investigators; and (4) that he would only be charged with one count of larceny in federal district court despite having stolen property on \u201ca lot\u201d of occasions. We conclude that the military judge permitted sufficient cross-examination of Rafferty.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">Having permitted defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination to bring to light Rafferty\u2019s possible motive to testify falsely, the military judge then properly conducted an M.R.E. 403 balancing test on the record. He was not persuaded that the sentencing details of the pretrial agreement had any special relevance to Rafferty\u2019s motive in testifying beyond that already elicited. He concluded that even if the terms of the pretrial agreement were relevant, the probative value of further inquiry into Rafferty\u2019s possible sentence under the plea agreement was substantially outweighed by the possibility that such testimony would mislead the members. We defer to the military judge\u2019s on-record application of M.R.E. 403 to the facts of this case. <em>United States v. James, </em>63 M.J. 217, 222 (C.A.A.F.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">The military judge did not deny the defense the right to examine the possibility of bias, but rather simply limited its ability to inquire about yet another aspect of the plea agreement, when the agreement\u2019s bearing on bias had already been thoroughly explored. As we held in <em>James, </em>\u201conce the defendant has been allowed to expose a witness\u2019s motivation in testifying, \u2018it is of peripheral concern to the Sixth Amendment how much opportunity defense counsel gets to hammer that point home to the jury.\u2019\u201d 61 M.J. at 136 (quoting <em>United States v. Nelson, </em>39 F.3d 705, 708 (7th Cir.1994)). Here, the military judge correctly determined that defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination had brought to light Rafferty\u2019s possible motive to lie, such that further inquiry into his sentence would have been marginally relevant at best and potentially misleading. Since \u201csufficient cross-examination\u201d had been permitted and the military judge properly identified and weighed the danger of misleading the members under M.R.E. 403, we find no abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>discretion and need not reach the question of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">\n<em>Leniency Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AKS\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">During an Article 39(a), UCMJ, session prior to instructing the members, the military judge explained his proposed findings instructions to the parties and asked whether there were any objections or proposed modifications from the parties. The defense did not object to the military judge\u2019s proposed accomplice instruction and stated that it had no other issues with the proposed instructions. Later, however, the defense submitted a request for the following tailored leniency instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">TESTIMONY OF A WITNESS WITH A REDUCED SENTENCE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASU\">There is evidence and indeed it is not in dispute and all the evidence shows that SFC Paul Rafferty and Robert Nunes testified under an agreement with the Government to give truthful testimony in any proceeding when requested by the government in order to have their charges and sentences reduced. It is uncontroverted that SFC Paul Rafferty and Robert Nunes testified in whole or in part for this reason. You should therefore examine SFC Paul Rafferty\u2019s and Robert Nunes\u2019s testimony with great care and caution in deciding whether or not to believe it. If, after doing so, you believe their testimony, in whole or in part, you should treat what you believe the same as any other believable evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">The military judge declined to give this instruction, stating he believed \u201cthe standard benchbook instruction is adequate.\u201d He issued the following instruction dealing with the testimony of Carruthers\u2019 alleged accomplices:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-9\">A witness is an accomplice if he was criminally involved in an offense with which the accused is charged. The purpose of this advice is to call to your attention a factor specifically affecting the witness\u2019 believability; that is, a motive to falsify his testimony in whole or in part, because of an obvious self-interest under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-11\">For example, an accomplice may be motivated to falsify testimony in whole or in part because of his own self-interest in receiving immunity from prosecution or leniency in a forthcoming prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-12\">The testimony of an accomplice, even though it may be corroborated and apparently credible, is of questionable integrity and should be considered by you with great caution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-13\">In deciding the believability of Sergeant First Class Paul Rafferty, Mr. Grandy Hooper, Mr. Bob Nunes, Mr. Paul Morgan, and Mr. Jerry Roach, you should consider all the relevant evidence in this ease and the extent to which their respective testimony is either corroborated or contradicted by other evidence in this ease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-14\">Whether Sergeant First Class Rafferty, Mr. Hooper, Mr. Nunes, Mr. Morgan and/or Mr. Roach were accomplices is a question for you to decide. If those individuals shared the criminal intent or purpose of the accused, if any, or aided, encouraged, or in any other way criminally associated or involved themselves with the offenses with which the accused is charged, they would be an accomplice whose testimony must be considered with great caution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-15\">This instruction is substantially similar to the \u201cAccomplice Testimony\u201d sample instruction in the Dep\u2019t of the Army, Pamphlet 27-9, Legal Services, <em>Military Judges\u2019 Benchbook </em>ch. 7, para. 7-10 (2000) [hereinafter <em>Bench-</em>book]. The <em>Benchbook </em>contains another sample instruction on \u201cwitness[es] testifying under a grant of immunity or promise of leniency,\u201d but the military judge did not issue that instruction. <em>Benchbook </em>ch. 7, para. 7-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-17\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b525-18\">\u2018While counsel may request specific instructions from the military judge, the judge has substantial discretionary power in deciding on the instructions to give.\u201d <em>United States v. Damatta-Olivera, </em>37 M.J. 474, 478 (C.M.A.1993) (citing <em>United States v. Smith, </em>34 M.J. 200 (C.M.A.1992)); Rules for Courts-Martial 920(c) Discussion. Thus the military <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>judge\u2019s denial of a requested instruction is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Damatta-Olivera, </em>37 M.J. at 478; <em>United States v. Rasnick, </em>58 M.J. 9, 10 (C.A.A.F.2003). \u201cWe apply a three-pronged test to determine whether the failure to give a requested instruction is error: \u2018(1) [the requested instruction] is correct; (2) it is not substantially covered in the main [instruction]; and (3) it is on such a vital point in the case that the failure to give it deprived [the accused] of a defense or seriously impaired its effective presentation.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>58 M.J. 1, 7 (C.A.A.F.2003) (quoting <em>Damatta-Olivera, </em>37 M.J. at 478) (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Carruthers argues that the defense requested leniency instruction should have been issued under <em>Gibson, </em>but even if the military judge was right to deny it, he should have issued another instruction on leniency in addition to the accomplice instruction that was given. That instruction could either have been a modified version of the defense requested instruction or the \u201cstandard instruction\u201d on leniency from the <em>Benchbook </em>ch. 7, para. 7-19. Carruthers maintains that the military judge promised to give the <em>Benchbook </em>leniency instruction when he stated that he found that \u201cthe standard bench-book instruction is adequate.\u201d The Government responds that the defense requested instruction does not meet any of the three <em>Gibson </em>requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Applying the first <em>Gibson </em>requirement to the facts of this case, we observe that the overall thrust of the defense requested instruction was correct. The two witnesses mentioned, Rafferty and coconspirator Robert Nunes, did testify in exchange for \u201cdeals\u201d with the Government. Nonetheless, as Carruthers concedes, the wording of the defense requested instruction was \u201csubstantially more favorable to the defense\u201d than the sample leniency instructions in the <em>Benchbook. </em>While the military judge could have modified this instruction to bring it in line with the sample instructions\u2019 more neutral tone, he was not required to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Under the second <em>Gibson </em>requirement, we must determine whether the proffered leniency instruction was \u201csubstantially covered\u201d in the military judge\u2019s instruction on accomplice testimony. The instruction given by the military judge identified Rafferty and Nunes along with three other witnesses and instructed the members to consider all relevant evidence to decide whether they were accomplices, and to accordingly evaluate their credibility. Describing accomplice testimony, the instruction called the panel\u2019s attention to \u201ca factor specifically affecting the witness\u2019 believability; that is, a motive to falsify his testimony in whole or in part, because of an obvious self-interest under the circumstances.\u201d The instruction also stated that the accomplices\u2019 interests may include \u201creceiving immunity from prosecution or leniency in a forthcoming prosecution,\u201d and that their testimony, \u201ceven though it may be corroborated and apparently credible, is of questionable integrity and should be considered by you with great caution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">In <em>Damattar-Olivera, </em>this court found \u201csubstantial coverage\u201d when a military judge\u2019s instructions on accomplice testimony \u201cadequately addressed\u201d the accomplice\u2019s credibility, which was the issue underlying the defense\u2019s requested instruction. 37 M.J. at 487-79. Similarily, in <em>United States v. Poole, </em>47 M.J. 17, 19 (C.A.A.F.1997), we found that a military judge\u2019s instruction on resistance to apprehension, which named aggravated assault as a lesser included offense, \u201csubstantially covered\u201d the defense requested instruction on \u201cmere flight,\u201d even though it did not mention \u201cmere flight\u201d as a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">We hold that the instructions in this case \u201csubstantially covered\u201d the leniency offered Rafferty and Nunes and addressed their possible motives to lie as a result of their favorable pretrial agreements. Although it would have been better to give the <em>Benchbook </em>leniency instruction once the issue was raised, the military judge did not err because the instruction he gave covered its \u201ccritical principles.\u201d <em>United States v. Bigelow, </em>57 M.J. 64, 67-68 (C.A.A.F.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">Moreover, Carruthers\u2019 claim that the military judge agreed to issue the \u201cstandard instruction\u201d on leniency mischaracterizes the record. The defense was given the opportu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>nity to review the military judge\u2019s planned instructions, which included neither the defense requested instruction nor the <em>Bench-book </em>leniency instruction, and did not object. <em>See United States v. Gay, </em>16 M.J. 475, 477-78 (C.M.A.1988) (holding that military judge\u2019s instruction on reasonable doubt \u201csubstantially covered\u201d defense requested instruction when defense did not object or request additional instruction). Later, after the defense submitted its requested instruction, the military judge stated that while he had considered it, he believed \u201cthe standard benchbook instruction is adequate.\u201d Given that the instruction he actually issued was substantially similar to the sample instruction on accomplice testimony from the <em>Benchbook </em>eh. 7, para. 7-10, there is no reason to believe the military judge was referring to an instruction other than the one he actually gave. The <em>Benchbook </em>leniency instruction was neither requested by the defense nor mentioned by the military judge as an instruction he was considering. Carruthers\u2019 contention that the military judge had agreed to issue the <em>Benchbook </em>leniency instruction lacks support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Finally, applying the third <em>Gibson </em>requirement, we find that without the requested instruction Carruthers was neither deprived of a defense nor seriously impaired in his ability to present a defense. Defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Rafferty clearly elicited his possible bias. It revealed Rafferty\u2019s interest in avoiding a court-martial and punitive discharge, his desire to \u201cdo a good job\u201d at trial so the Government would \u201ctake care of [him],\u201d including his motive to testify consistently with what he told investigators, and the fact that he would only be charged with one count of larceny in federal district court despite having stolen property on \u201ca lot\u201d of occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">Likewise, Nunes testified that he had not yet been charged, that he had avoided \u201cadverse administrative action,\u201d and that he was testifying against Carruthers \u201cin exchange for leniency in federal court,\u201d which \u201cwould give [him] ample reason to cooperate with the government.\u201d After the military judge instructed the members on the strong motive of accomplices to lie when testifying in exchange for deals with the prosecution, the defense argued in its closing that the evidence provided by Rafferty and Nunes was not credible precisely because they were getting a \u201cdeal\u201d for \u201clenient treatment.\u201d The defense was not denied the ability to attack the credibility of prosecution witnesses testifying in exchange for leniency.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">\n<em>DECISION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">The decision of the United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b521-11\">.
