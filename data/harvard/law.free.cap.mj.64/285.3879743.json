Contrary to his pleas, Appellant was convicted of four specifications of selling military property and one specification of larceny on divers occasions, in violation of Articles 108 and 121, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 908, 921 (2000), respectively. The adjudged sentence included a dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, confinement for five years, and reduction to E-l. The convening authority approved the adjudged sentence, and waived forfeitures pursuant to Article 58b(b), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 858b(b) (2000). The court below affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">On Appellant\u2019s petition, we granted review on the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">WHETHER THE MILITARY JUDGE ERRED IN DENYING APPELLANT\u2019S CHALLENGE FOR CAUSE AGAINST CAPTAIN H.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">Appellant was an electro-environmental technician whose duties involved maintaining C-5 aircraft at Travis Air Force Base. He was accused of stealing and later re-selling survival vests from the aircraft he was responsible for maintaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-12\">Captain (Capt) H, the wife of Appellant\u2019s flight commander, was detailed to serve as a court member at Appellant\u2019s court-martial. Capt H raised her hand when asked whether she had prior knowledge of the case. On voir dire, Capt H stated that she had learned from her husband that \u201cvests went missing and that the person or a person \u2014 -I didn\u2019t know who \u2014 was put on desk duty.\u201d Upon further questioning, Capt H stated that she did not know any additional details about the case, and that her husband was deployed to Kuwait at the time of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-13\">Appellant challenged Capt H for cause, arguing that there would be an appearance of unfairness if the wife of Appellant\u2019s commanding officer were allowed to sit on Appellant\u2019s court-martial. The military judge denied Appellant\u2019s challenge, noting that Capt H \u201cwasn\u2019t aware precisely of which flight the person was in\u201d and since Capt H\u2019s husband was currently deployed to Kuwait there would be little chance for them to discuss the case. The military judge further concluded that Capt H \u201cappeared to be quite sincere and listened quite attentively as I instructed her on what she could consider\u201d and that \u201cregardless of whether she had a discussion with her husband ... there is going to be evidence presented that vests were missing from one of the flights on this base.\u201d Appellant preserved this issue on appeal by using his sole peremptory challenge against another member of the panel. Rule for Courts-Martial (R.C.M.) 912(f)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-15\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b466-16\">R.C.M. 912(f)(1)(N) requires removal for cause when a court member should not sit \u201cin the interest of having the court-martial free from substantial doubt as to legality, fairness and impartiality.\u201d R.C.M. 912(f)(1)(N) encompasses both actual and implied bias. <em>United States v. Strand, </em>59 M.J. 455, 458 (C.A.A.F.2004). The concepts of actual and implied bias are \u201cseparate legal tests, not separate grounds for challenge.\u201d <em>United States v. Armstrong, </em>54 M.J. 51, 53 (C.A.A.F.2000). Because a challenge based on actual bias is \u201cessentially one of credibility,\u201d and because \u201cthe military judge has an opportunity to observe the demeanor of court members and assess their credibility on voir dire,\u201d a military judge\u2019s ruling on actual bias is afforded deference. <em>United States v. Daulton, </em>45 M.J. 212, 217 (C.A.A.F.1996) (citations and quotation marks omitted). However, implied bias is \u201cviewed through the eyes of the public, focusing on the appearance of fairness.\u201d <em>United States v. Rome, </em>47 M.J. 467, 469 (C.A.A.F.1998). Implied bias exists when, \u201cregardless of an individual member\u2019s disclaimer of bias, most people in the same position would be prejudiced [that is, biased].\u201d <em>United States v. Napolitano, </em>53 M.J. 162, 167 (C.A.A.F.2000). Since implied bias is an objective standard, a military judge\u2019s ruling on implied bias, while not reviewed de novo, is afforded less deference than a ruling on actual bias. <em>Strand, </em>59 M.J. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>at 458. However, deference is warranted only when the military judge indicates on the record an accurate understanding of the law and its application to the relevant facts. <em>United States v. Downing, </em>56 M.J. 419, 422 (C.A.A.F.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">In this case, the military judge addressed Appellant\u2019s challenge to Capt H without expressly addressing implied bias or the liberal grant mandate on the record. Rather, the military judge discussed various factors relating to Capt H\u2019s demeanor, her professed lack of knowledge, and her husband\u2019s absence during Appellant\u2019s court-martial. While the military judge\u2019s analysis made it clear that he found no actual bias, we do not know what, if any, reasoning prompted him to deny a challenge predicated on implied bias. In <em>United States v. Clay, </em>64 M.J. 274, 276-77 (C.A.A.F.2007), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-5\">[I]n light of the role of the convening authority in selecting courts-martial members and the limit of one peremptory challenge per side, military judges are enjoined to be liberal in granting defense challenges for cause. Challenges based on implied bias and the liberal grant mandate address historic concerns about the real and perceived potential for command influence on members\u2019 deliberations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">In short, the liberal grant mandate is part of the fabric of military law. The mandate recognizes that the trial judiciary has the primary responsibility of preventing both the reality and the appearance of bias involving potential court members.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Applying the standard for implied bias, we conclude that the military judge erred when he denied the challenge for cause against Capt H. It is true that Capt H\u2019s responses did not reflect actual bias against Appellant. Among other things, Capt H disclaimed prior knowledge of the ease beyond the fact that some \u201cvests went missing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">However, there are a number of factors that necessitated dismissing Capt H from the panel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> First, her husband was a member of the squadron whose members\u2019 safety might have been implicated by the theft. The military judge was aware of the safety concerns. Immediately before the questioning of Capt H, two other members had expressed the view that the thefts could have affected mission safety. Second, Capt H was married to Appellant\u2019s flight commander, whose performance evaluation could be affected by criminal conduct regarding critical squadron equipment that was supposed to be safeguarded in a secure area. Third, in military practice, the immediate commander is often responsible for the initial inquiry into potential misconduct occurring within his command and the initial decision as to disposition. <em>See </em>R.C.M. 301; R.C.M. 303; R.C.M. 306. Moreover, if the immediate commander lacks the authority to dispose of the matter at his level, he forwards the matter to a superior. R.C.M. 306. The intent of the drafters of the UCMJ was to \u201cprevent courts martial from being an instrumentality and agency to express the will of the commander,\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or to appear to be such an instrumentality. The decision to retain Capt H, the spouse of Appellant\u2019s immediate commander, unnecessarily raised the perception of improper command bias. For these reasons, we conclude that the military judge erred by denying the challenge for cause against Capt H, the spouse of Appellant\u2019s commander whose safety might have been affected by the alleged theft, on the ground of implied bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b467-13\">The decision of the United States Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals is reversed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>and the findings and sentence are set aside. The record of trial is returned to the Judge Advocate General of the Air Force. A rehearing may be authorized.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b467-8\">. \"Although military <em>or </em>national security exigencies may create personnel circumstances relevant to the liberal grant analysis, there is no indication in the record that this was the reason for the military judge\u2019s denial of Appellant\u2019s challenge for cause.\u201d <em>Clay, </em>64 M.J. at 278, n. 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b467-9\">. <em>Uniform Code of Military Justice: Hearings on H.R. 2498 Before a Subcommittee of the House Committee on Armed Services, </em>81st Cong. 606 (1949) (statement of Professor Edmund M.
