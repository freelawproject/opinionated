The convening authority approved the adjudged sentence to a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for four months, and forfeiture of $767.00 pay per month for four months, and credited appellant with thirty days of confinement credit against his sentence to confinement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This case is before the court for review pursuant to Article 66, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-13\">In their initial pleadings, appellate defense counsel assert, <em>inter alia, </em>the military judge erred by failing to merge the following specifications of Charge III: Specification 4 (reckless driving on a parking lot), Specification 5 (reckless driving on a roadway or highway), Specification 6 (driving in an improper direction on a one-way roadway or highway), and Specification 7 (failing to stop at a posted stop sign). Our court specified the following four additional issues: (1) whether non-criminal traffic offenses, i.e., Specifications 6 and 7 of Charge III, can be charged under clause 3 of Article 134 pursuant to the ACA; (2) assuming, arguendo, Specifications 4 and 5 of Charge III were improperly charged under clause 3 of Article 134, UCMJ, whether this court can affirm findings of guilty to the closely-related offense of reckless driving in violation of Article 111, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 911; (3) assuming, arguendo, that noncriminal traffic offenses (Specifications 6 and 7 of Charge III) cannot be charged under clause 3 of Article 134, whether this court can affirm findings of guilty to lesser-included simple disorders in violation of clause 1 or 2 of Article 134; and (4) assuming, arguendo, Specifications 4 and 5 of Charge III were improperly charged under clause 3 of A'ticle 134, whether this court can affirm findings of guilty to lesser-included simple disorders in violation of clause 1 or 2 of Article 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-14\">We find appellant\u2019s initial assertion of error without merit, but hold: (1) the government improperly assimilated the state law offenses of driving in an improper direction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>on a one-way roadway or highway (Specification 6 of Charge III) and failing to stop at a posted stop sign (Specification 7 of Charge III) because non-criminal traffic offenses may not be assimilated into federal law under the ACA; (2) appellant\u2019s misconduct in Specifications 6 and 7 of Charge III constituted part of his reckless driving; therefore, we consolidate these specifications in Specification 5 of Charge III; (3) the government improperly assimilated state law reckless driving offenses (Specifications 4 and 5 of Charge III) because those offenses are preempted by Article 111, UCMJ; and (4) appellant\u2019s guilty pleas to the state law reckless driving offenses are nevertheless provident to the closely-related offense of reckless operation of a motor vehicle in violation of Article 111. Based on our disposition of this case, we need not decide the third and fourth specified issues regarding simple disorders. We will grant appropriate relief in our decretal paragraph.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Late in the evening on 10 January 2003, Department of Defense gate guards stopped appellant as part of a 100 percent vehicle inspection as he drove onto Fort Eustis, Virginia. Fort Eustis is a military installation with different areas of federal jurisdiction; some are exclusively federal, while others are shared or concurrent with state jurisdiction. A gate guard asked appellant to produce his driver\u2019s license, but appellant had a suspended license and falsely told the guard he lost it. After the guard electronically verified appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license status and confirmed that his license was suspended, the guard asked appellant to get out of his ear. During a subsequent lawful pat-down by a military police officer (MP), the MP found a 9-millimeter handgun and a loaded ammunition magazine containing six bullets in appellant\u2019s jacket pocket. The MP apprehended appellant while another MP searched appellant\u2019s car. The vehicle search disclosed a small amount of marijuana and a pipe containing marijuana residue.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">On 11 January 2003, the unit First Sergeant restricted appellant to post and ordered him not to drive his car. Later the same day, appellant violated these orders and drove his car off post. When appellant attempted to re-enter Fort Eustis on 11 January 2003, a MP involved in the previous night\u2019s incident recognized and detained appellant again to check his driver\u2019s license status. When the MP tried to apprehend appellant, appellant fled the scene by speeding down Washington Boulevard, the post\u2019s main thoroughfare. The MP pursued appellant in his marked police car. After avoiding a police roadblock, driving the wrong way on Washington Boulevard, running several stop signs, jumping a curb and roadway median, crossing over railroad tracks, striking a MP vehicle, speeding through several parking lots, and almost striking several pedestrians, appellant was finally apprehended at gunpoint when his car became stuck in a ditch. Based on this misconduct, the government charged appellant with the offenses listed in the jurisdictional paragraph of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b765-11\">Our court reviews a military judge\u2019s acceptance of a guilty plea for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Abbey, </em>63 M.J. 631, 632 (Army Ct.Crim.App.2006) (citing <em>United States v. Eberle, </em>44 M.J. 374, 375 (C.A.A.F.1996)). We will not disturb a military judge\u2019s acceptance of a guilty plea unless the record of trial shows a substantial basis in law and fact for questioning the plea. <em>United States v. Adams, </em>63 M.J. 223, 226 (C.A.A.F.2006) (citing <em>United States v. Prater, </em>32 M.J. 433, 436 (C.M.A.1991)). A providence inquiry into a guilty plea must: (1) establish that the accused believes and admits he or she is guilty of the charged offenses; and (2) provide a set of factual circumstances \u2014 admitted by the accused\u2014 which objectively support the guilty plea. Rule for Courts-Martial 910(e); <em>United States v. Simmons, </em>63 M.J. 89, 92 (C.A.A.F.2006); <em>United States v. Barton, </em>60 M.J. 62, 64 (C.A.A.F.2004); <em>United States v. Morris, </em>58 M.J. 739, 742-43 (Army Ct.Crim.App.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>\n<em>Assimilation and Preemption</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AWg\">The ACA \u201cis an adoption by Congress of state criminal laws for areas of exclusive or concurrent federal jurisdiction ____\u201d <em>Manual for Courts-Martial, United States </em>(2002 ed.) [hereinafter <em>MCM], </em>Part IV, para. 60c(4)(c)(ii). The text of the ACA provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6Y\">Whoever within or upon any of the places now existing or hereafter reserved or acquired as provided in section 7 of this title [18 USCS \u00a7 7], or on, above, or below any portion of the territorial sea of the United States not within the jurisdiction of any State, Commonwealth, territory, possession, or district is guilty of any act or omission which, although not made punishable by any enactment of Congress, would be punishable if committed or omitted within the jurisdiction of the State, Territory, Possession, or District in which such place is situated, by the laws thereof in force at the time of such act or omission, shall be guilty of a like offense and subject to a like punishment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13(a) (1996). Thus, the ACA provides for the assimilation and federal prosecution of state law offenses that occur on a federal enclave. <em>United States v. Sadler, </em>29 M.J. 370, 374 (C.M.A.1990) (\u201c[T]he [ACA] permit[s] a servicemember to be tried by a court-martial for violating state penal law at a place within exclusive or concurrent [fjederal jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">However, assimilation of state law offenses under the ACA is constrained by the preemption doctrine, and by how state law offenses are classified, i.e., criminal versus noncriminal offenses. First, the government may charge an assimilated state law offense under clause 3 of Article 134, \u201cprovided federal criminal law, including the UCMJ, has not defined an applicable offense for the misconduct committed.\u201d <em>MCM, </em>Part TV, para. 60c(4)(c)(ii). As explained in the <em>MCM:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-8\">The preemption doctrine prohibits application of Article 134 to conduct covered by Articles 80 through 132. For example, larceny is covered in Article 121, and if an element of that offense is lacking \u2014 for example, intent \u2014 there can be no larceny or larceny-type offense, either under Article 121 or, because of preemption, under Article 134. Article 134 cannot be used to create a new kind of larceny offense, one without the required intent, where Congress has already set the minimum requirements for such an offense in Article 121.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-11\"><em>MCM, </em>Part IV, para. 60c(5)(a); <em>see also United States v. Robbins, </em>52 M.J. 159, 162 (C.A.A.F.1999) (citing <em>Lewis v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 155, 164-66, 118 S.Ct. 1135, 140 L.Ed.2d 271 (1998)) (discussing assimilation and preemption); <em>United States v. Kick, </em>7 M.J. 82, 85 (C.M.A.1979) (explaining preemption).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-12\">Second, where Congress has not legislated with respect to the misconduct at issue, state law offenses may be assimilated under the ACA. However, the ACA \u201cincorporates into federal law only the <em>criminal </em>laws of the jurisdiction within which the [federal] enclave exists.\u201d <em>United States v. Carlson, </em>900 F.2d 1346, 1347 (9th Cir.1990) (internal quotes omitted). While the ACA does not distinguish \u201cbetween criminal and civil punishments, it is generally understood to assimilate only a state\u2019s <em>criminal </em>laws.\u201d <em>United States v. Devenport, </em>131 F.3d 604, 606 (7th Cir.1997) (emphasis added). The U.S. Supreme Court espoused this understanding in <em>United States v. Sharpnack, </em>355 U.S. 286, 291-93, 78 S.Ct. 291, 2 L.Ed.2d 282 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-13\">In <em>Sharpnack, </em>the Court discussed the history and purpose of several versions of the ACA as far back as the original Federal Crimes Act enacted in 1790, and concluded with the most recent version of the ACA enacted in 1948. The Court concluded that the ACA \u201cmade applicable to [federal] enclaves the <em>criminal </em>laws in force in the respective States\u201d and \u201cdemonstrate[d] a consistent [Congressional purpose to apply the principle of conformity to state <em>criminal </em>laws in punishing most minor offenses committed within federal enclaves.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 291, 78 S.Ct. 291 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To underscore the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Sharpnack, </em>the Seventh Circuit stated: \u201cTo extend the reach of the [ACA] to incorporate state offenses that the government of the surrounding state has expressly defined as non-criminal is to stray from the course chosen by Congress.\u201d <em>Devenport, </em>131 F.3d at 608-09; see <em>also United States v. Rowe, </em>599 F.2d 1319, 1320 (4th Cir.1979) (per curiam) (Virginia law allowing license suspension for breathalyzer refusal non-criminal and cannot be assimilated); <em>United States v. Golden, </em>825 F.Supp. 667, 669-71 (D.N.J.1993) (New Jersey speeding law non-criminal and cannot be assimilated).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">Furthermore, following the Ninth Circuit\u2019s conclusion in <em>Carlson, </em>900 F.2d at 1348, \u201cthat a state statute may not be assimilated into the [ACA] when a state has determined that the statute sought to be assimilated is not criminal,\u201d our sister service court, in <em>United States v. Clinkenbeard, </em>44 M.J. 577 (A.F.Ct.Crim.App.1996), <em>pet. denied, </em>46 M.J. 104 (C.A.A.F.1996), set aside and dismissed three specifications that assimilated non-criminal Washington state law traffic offenses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals recognized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-5\">It is clear that the Department of Defense and the Congress of the United States have each adopted the view that a State\u2019s decriminalization of traffic offenses affects the applicability of the [ACA].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-8\">[I]t is [also] clear that the Department of Defense has decided as a matter of policy that a State\u2019s legislative judgment to decriminalize traffic offenses will be respected, and that military violators will be put on the same footing as their civilian counterparts. In furtherance of that policy, the Department has provided a mechanism to ensure continued enforcement of traffic violations without unfairly penalizing violators caught on military installations with concurrent or exclusive federal jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-9\"><em>Clinkenbeard, </em>44 M.J. at 578-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">The enforcement mechanism referred to in <em>Clinkenbeard, id., </em>is the Secretary of Defense\u2019s written policy for traffic and pedestrian control on all United States military installations. As summarized in <em>United States v. Boyer, </em>935 F.Supp. 1138 (D.Colo.1996), the Secretary\u2019s policy \u201cprovides: (1) all state traffic offenses that are criminal shall be assimilated through the ACA; and (2) all non-criminal traffic offenses shall be adopted as the rules for traffic and pedestrian control for the specific installation and be subject to the penalty set forth in 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 318c.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1139-41 (adopted by <em>United States v. Doyle, </em>237 F.3d 950, 952 (8th Cir.2001)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>Section 318e (\u201cPenalty for violation of rules or regulations\u201d) provided: \u201c[Wjhoever violates any rule or regulation promulgated pursuant to [40 U.S.C. \u00a7 318a] shall be fined not more than $50 or imprisoned not more than thirty days, or both.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">\n<em>Non-Criminal Traffic Offenses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">At trial, and before entering pleas, defense counsel made a motion arguing that Specifications 5, 6, and 7 of Charge III reflected an unreasonable multiplication of charges.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Before announcing his findings on the record, the military judge correctly agreed with trial counsel and defense counsel that Specification 6 of Charge III (driving in an improper direction on a one-way roadway or highway) and Specification 7 of Charge III (failing to stop at a posted stop sign) were classified under Virginia law as non-criminal traffic infractions. <em>See </em>Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 46.2-113.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">At the time of appellant\u2019s trial, Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 46.2-113 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-8\">It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any of the provisions of this title [46.2 Motor Vehicles], or any regulation adopted pursuant to this title, or local ordinances adopted pursuant to the authority granted in \u00a7 46.2-1300. Unless otherwise stated, these violations shall constitute traffic infractions punishable by a fine of not more than $200.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-15\">Under Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-8 (\u201cFelonies, misdemeanors and traffic infractions defined\u201d), \u201c[tjraffic infractions are violations of public order as defined in \u00a7 46.2-100 and not deemed to be criminal in nature.\u201d Furthermore, Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 46.2-100 (\u201cDefinitions\u201d) provides: \u201c <em>\u2018Traffic infraction </em>\u2019 means a violation of law punishable as provided in \u00a7 46.2-113, which is neither a felony nor a misdemeanor.\u201d Because the Virginia Code defines the traffic offenses alleged in Specifications 6 and 7 of Charge III as non-criminal, we hold the government was precluded from assimilating those offenses under the ACA.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-16\">Despite the non-criminal nature of the traffic offenses in Specifications 6 and 7 of Charge III, the military judge nevertheless accepted appellant\u2019s guilty pleas to these specifications as provident. Holding that non-criminal traffic offenses cannot be assimilated into federal law under the ACA, we also hold the military judge erred by finding appellant\u2019s pleas provident to Specifications 6 and 7 of Charge III.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, because we find appellant\u2019s misconduct \u2014 in driving the wrong direction on a one-way roadway (Spec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>ification 6) and failing to stop at a posted stop sign (Specification 7) \u2014 constituted part of his reckless driving, we will consolidate this misconduct in Specification 5 of Charge III.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">\n<em>Preempted, Criminal Traffic Offenses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Based on the preemption doctrine,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> appellate counsel agree the government improperly assimilated state law reckless driving offenses (Specifications 4 and 5 of Charge III) because those offenses are preempted by Article 111, UCMJ (\u201cDrunken or reckless operation of a vehicle, aircraft, or vessel\u201d). We agree. Appellate government counsel urge us to affirm violations of Article 111, UCMJ, under the closely-related offense doctrine. We accept the government\u2019s suggestion because we find appellant\u2019s providence inquiry supports convictions for two violations of Article 111, UCMJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">During a providence inquiry, if an accused clearly admits \u2014 based on his factual declarations to the military judge \u2014 that he or she is guilty of a \u201cdifferent but closely-related offense having the same [or a lesser] maximum punishment, we may treat that accused\u2019s pleas of guilty as provident.\u201d <em>United States v. Epps, </em>25 M.J. 319, 323 (C.M.A.1987) (affirming guilty plea to larceny because the providence inquiry established guilt to the closely-related offense of receiving stolen property); <em>see United States v. Hubbard, </em>28 M.J. 203, 205-06 (C.M.A.1989) (stating same regarding same offenses); <em>United States v. Felty, </em>12 M.J. 438, 442 (C.M.A.1982) (affirming guilty plea to escape from custody where providence inquiry demonstrated guilt to escape from confinement, and holding \u201ctechnical variance between the offense alleged and that to which is established from an accused\u2019s own lips does not require setting aside the plea of guilty\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">In Specification 4 of Charge III, the government charged appellant with reckless driving on a parking lot in violation of Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 46.2-864. This section states, in pertinent part;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-11\">A person shall be guilty of reckless driving who operates any motor vehicle at a speed or in a manner so as to endanger the life, limb, or property of any person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-12\">1. On any driveway or premises of a church, school, recreational facility, or business property open to the public; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-13\">2. On the premises of any industrial establishment providing parking space for customers, patrons, or employees----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-15\">In Specification 5 of Charge III, the government charged appellant with reckless driving on a roadway or highway in violation of Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 46.2-852. This section states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-16\">Irrespective of the maximum speeds permitted by law, any person who drives a vehicle on any highway recklessly or at a speed or in a manner so as to endanger the life, limb, or property of any person shall be guilty of reckless driving.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-17\">Under Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 46.2-868, \u201cEvery person convicted of reckless driving ... shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.\u201d Class 1 misdemeanors are punishable by \u201cconfinement in jail for not more than twelve months and a fine of not more than $2,500, either or both.\u201d Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-ll(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b769-18\">These state law reckless driving offenses are preempted by and closely-related to Article 111, UCMJ. Article 111 states, in pertinent part: \u201cAny person subject to this chapter who ... operates or physically controls any vehicle ... in a reckless or wanton manner ... shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.\u201d UCMJ art. 111. The elements of this offense are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>(1) That the accused was operating or in physical control of a vehicle ... and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-4\">(2) That while operating or in physical control of a vehicle ..., the accused:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-5\">(a) did so in a wanton or reckless<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> manner....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-6\"><em>MCM, </em>Part IV, para. 35b. The maximum punishment for a violation of Article 111 is a bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for six months. <em>Id. </em>at para. 35e(2).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">We conclude appellant\u2019s providence inquiry and his stipulation of fact support findings of guilty to two violations of the closely-related reckless driving offense codified in Article 111, UCMJ. First, we are satisfied that the specifications alleging violations of Virginia\u2019s reckless driving laws put appellant on notice that he could be convicted under Article 111 because the elements of both are substantially the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">Second, appellant\u2019s declarations to the military judge, and the stipulation of fact, establish the elements of reckless driving under Article 111. Appellant admitted to the military judge that when he attempted to reenter Fort Eustis on 11 January 2003, a MP recognized and detained him to check his driver\u2019s license status. During this check, appellant fled the scene without permission by speeding down Washington Boulevard, which prompted a police pursuit. During the pursuit, appellant avoided a police roadblock, sped through a traffic circle, drove the wrong way on Washington Boulevard, ran several stop signs, jumped a curb and roadway median, crossed over railroad tracks, struck a MP vehicle, sped through the Post Exchange, Shopette, and bowling alley parking lots, and almost struck several pedestrians.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-14\">Third, because the elements of Va.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-852 and 46.2-864 and Article 111 are substantially the same, we find these offenses \u201cclosely related.\u201d Furthermore, under the circumstances of this ease, we consider the maximum punishment for a violation of Article 111 to be less than that for violations of Va.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-852 and 46.2-864. Under the foregoing analysis we will, therefore, modify Specifications 4 and 5 of Charge III to reflect violations of Article 111, UCMJ.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-15\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b770-16\">We find appellant\u2019s pleas of guilty to Specifications 4 and 5 of Charge III provident as violations of Article 111, UCMJ. Specification 4 of Charge III is amended to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-17\">In that Private El Nathaniel L. Brooks, U.S. Army, did, at Fort Eustis, Virginia, on or about 11 January 2003, drive a motor vehicle in the Fort Eustis Post Exchange and Shopette parking lots in a reckless manner by traveling at a high rate of speed through the parking lots and in a manner so as to endanger the life, limb, and property of other persons, in an at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>tempt to flee from apprehension, in violation of Article 111, UCMJ.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">The court orders that Specifications 6 and 7 of Charge III be merged into modified Specification 5 of Charge III, to read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-6\">In that Private El Nathaniel L. Brooks, U.S. Army, did, at Fort Eustis, Virginia, on or about 11 January 2003, drive a motor vehicle on the highways of Fort Eustis in a reckless manner by driving at an excessive speed, driving in the improper direction on a highway, failing to stop at a posted stop sign, driving over a curb, striking a military police vehicle, and improperly crossing a median and railroad tracks, while attempting to flee from apprehension, and at a speed and in a manner so as to endanger the life, limb, and property of other persons, in violation of Article 111, UCMJ.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">The findings of guilty to amended Specifications 4 and 5 of Charge III are affirmed. The findings of guilty to Specifications 6 and 7 of Charge III are set aside and those specifications are dismissed. The remaining findings of guilty are affirmed. We have considered the remaining assignments of error and find them to be without merit. Reassessing the sentence on the basis of the errors noted, the entire record, and applying the principles of <em>United States v. Sales, </em>22 M.J. 305 (C.M.A.1986), the court affirms the sentence. Appellant will be credited with one additional day of confinement credit against the sentence to confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">Senior Judge SCHENCK and Judge ZOLPER concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b764-11\">. Appellate counsel agree that appellant is entitled to one additional day of confinement credit, and we will order such credit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b766-9\">. \"[A] statute\u2019s title may aid in construing any ambiguities in a statute.\u201d <em>Berniger v. Meadow Green-Wildcat Corp., </em>945 F.2d 4, 9 (1st Cir.1991). The ACA's title, therefore, lends additional support to the argument that Congress\u2019 intent was to limit the ACA\u2019s scope to the assimilation of crimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>nal offenses.

For an opposing view see <em>United States v. White, </em>39 M.J. 796, 803-08 (N.M.C.M.R.1994). In <em>White, </em>the Navy-Marine Corps Court of Military Review rejected the analysis in <em>Carlson, </em>900 F.2d at 1346, and upheld assimilation of Hawaii\u2019s \"open container law.\u201d The <em>White </em>court argued: \"[Djecisions of other federal courts and of state courts are generally persuasive authority only ..., and a state\u2019s interpretation of the adopted statute is not binding on federal courts\u201d for purposes of determining assimilation under the ACA. <em>White, </em>39 M.J. at 804-05. The court further stated that \"while we may give some weight to the state\u2019s characterization of its statutes, we are of the opinion that in the final analysis the application of the [ACA] is a question of the interpretation of federal law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 805. Finally, relying on <em>United States v. Manning, </em>700 F.Supp. 1001, 1003 (W.D.Wis.1988), the <em>White </em>court concluded: \"Congress intended assimilation and enforcement of unpreempted state laws that may be termed 'penal,' 'punitive\u2019 or \u2018criminal,\u2019 but did not intend assimilation to turn on nomenclature or labels.\u201d <em>White, </em>39 M.J. at 805-06. Without gainsaying the reasoning and result in <em>White, </em>we believe a better view is the one espoused by the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals in <em>Clinkenbeard, </em>44 M.J. at 578-79, in which the court recognized the deference Congress and the Department of Defense afford a state\u2019s legislative decision to decriminalize traffic offenses. We find added support for this view in <em>Devenport, </em>131 F.3d at 608, wherein the Seventh Circuit \"declinefd] to upset Wisconsin\u2019s carefully considered decision to classify certain traffic offenses as criminal and others as civil.\u201d By so stating, the Seventh Circuit undercut the argument made in <em>Manning, </em>700 F.Supp. at 1003, upon which the <em>White </em>Court relied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b767-15\">.

Under the circumstances of this case, we do not find that Specifications 4 and 5 of Charge III reflect an unreasonable multiplication of charges.
