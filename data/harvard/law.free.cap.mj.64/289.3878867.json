The sentence adjudged by the court-martial included a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for thirteen months, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade. The convening authority approved the findings and approved that portion of the sentence that provided for a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for thirteen months, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade. The United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed in an unpublished opinion. <em>United States v. Green, </em>No. ARMY 20021126 (A.Ct.Crim.App. Mar. 20, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">On Appellant\u2019s petition, we granted review of the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">WHETHER THE MILITARY JUDGE VIOLATED APPELLANT\u2019S DUE PROCESS RIGHTS WHEN HE SENTENCED HIM BASED UPON HIS PERSONAL RELIGIOUS BELIEFS RATHER THAN LEGITIMATE SENTENCING PRINCIPLES.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">I. JUDICIAL COMMENTS DURING SENTENCING</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">A court-martial has broad discretion to adjudicate the sentence, subject to the punishment limitations set forth in the UCMJ and the <em>Manual for Courts-Martial, </em>United States <em>(MCM). </em>Article 56, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 856 (2000); Rule for Courts-Martial (R.C.M.) 1002. Sentencing information is developed in an adversarial proceeding, subject to evidentiary rules designed for the sentencing process. <em>See </em>R.C.M. 1001; <em>United States v. Mack, </em>9 M.J. 300, 319 (C.M.A.1980); <em>MCM, </em>Analysis of the Rules for Courts-Martial app. 21 at A21-70 (2005 ed.) [hereinafter Drafters\u2019 Analysis]. As part of the sentencing process, the accused may make a sworn or unsworn statement. R.C.M. 1001(c)(2). Although an unsworn statement is not subject to cross-examination by trial counsel or examination by the court-martial, the prosecution may present facts in rebuttal. R.C.M. 1001(c)(2)(C). If a military judge erroneously permits consideration of inadmissible evidence during sentencing, the error is tested for prejudice. <em>See United States v. Hysong, </em>47 M.J. 126, 126 (C.A.A.F.1997); Article 59(a), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 859(a) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">The court-martial must announce the terms of the sentence on the record. R.C.M. 1007. When the sentence is adjudicated by a court-martial panel, the president of the court-martial reads the sentence. <em>See </em>Dep\u2019t of the Army, Pamphlet 27-9, Legal Services, <em>Military Judges\u2019 Benchbook </em>ch. 2, \u00a7 IV, para. 2-5-25 (2002) [hereinafter Benchbook]. When the court-martial is composed of a military judge sitting alone, the military judge reads the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at para. 2-4-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-13\">Although the 1951 <em>MCM </em>authorized the court-martial to include in the record \u201ca brief statement of the reasons for the sentence,\u201d that provision was eliminated in 1969. <em>Compare MCM </em>para. 76.b.(4) (1951 ed.), <em>with MCM </em>para. 76.b.(4) (1969 rev. ed.). According to the Drafters\u2019 Analysis to the 1969 <em>MCM, </em>the provision was deleted to remove the potential for improper command influence that might flow if court-martial panel members felt obligated to justify the panel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>decision to a convening authority. <em>See </em>Dep\u2019t of the Army, Pamphlet 27-2, <em>Analysis of Contents, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, 1969, Revised Edition </em>ch. 13, para. 76.b.(4), at 13-9 (1970) (citing ch. 13, para. 74.f.(3), at 13-4). The Drafters\u2019 Analysis also noted that the 1969 change was not intended to preclude the military judge, in a bench trial, from setting forth reasons for the judge\u2019s decision. <em>See id. </em>at ch. 13, para. 74.f.(4), at 13-14. If the military judge comments on the sentence, the remarks may be reviewed on appeal to determine whether the military judge relied on inadmissible matter in determining the sentence. <em>See United States v. Hill, </em>62 M.J. 271, 275 (C.A.A.F.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">II. APPELLANT\u2019S SENTENCING PROCEEDING</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The prosecution\u2019s sentencing case focused on testimony from Appellant\u2019s victims concerning the details of the offenses and the harm caused by his conduct. The defense sentencing case sought to emphasize the positive aspects of Appellant\u2019s character. During the sentencing proceeding, defense counsel provided the military judge with a number of defense exhibits for identification, including a letter signed by Appellant\u2019s supervisors at a fast food establishment where Appellant held a part-time job. The letter, which described Appellant in very positive terms, observed that Appellant \u201calways talks a great deal about his wife and four children and about his beliefs in God.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Prior to formally introducing the letter into evidence, defense counsel presented the testimony of a noncommissioned officer to demonstrate that several of the complainants had chosen not to make formal statements. The witness also testified that Appellant was' a \u201cgood worker\u201d and that he never personally observed Appellant engage in inappropriate sexual conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">On cross-examination, the witness acknowledged that Appellant had talked \u201cabout being a Christian.\u201d When the trial counsel asked the witness to describe his \u201cfeelings on that,\u201d the defense counsel objected on the grounds of relevance. The trial counsel responded that the line of questioning was relevant because the witness would \u201ctalk about\u201d Appellant \u201cnot being a Christian.\u201d The defense counsel countered that the questioning was \u201chighly prejudicial\u201d and that he did not \u201cwant any court to consider the religious aspects of what is going on in-.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">Although the trial counsel attempted to interject that he was not addressing \u201cthe religious aspect,\u201d the military judge cut him off and directed his comments to defense counsel. The military judge observed that defense counsel had provided him with a document \u2014 the letter marked as a defense exhibit for identification \u2014 that \u201csort of indicates that the accused is a good Christian, God believing person.\u201d After observing that defense counsel did not disagree with his characterization of the letter, the military judge said \u201cbut I\u2019ll tell you what, even good Christians can make mistakes, okay, that\u2019s what the church is for, so I am not going to consider that aspect of it. Whether he\u2019s a good Christian or he\u2019s not a good Christian, okay.\u201d The trial counsel apparently viewed this exchange as a caution against pursuing the subject of religion, and revised his cross-examination to focus on the witness\u2019s opinion of Appellant\u2019s ethics and integrity.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">Subsequently, defense counsel introduced into evidence the letter from the supervisors at Appellant\u2019s part-time civilian job which included the comment that Appellant \u201calways talks a great deal about his wife and four children and about his beliefs in God.\u201d Appellant made an unsworn statement in which he apologized to his victims and his family. He noted the high cost of his conduct, in terms of the cost to his career, his freedom, and his family. He also interjected matters of religion at several points:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-13\">Instead of giving my matters to God and seeking comfort with my wife I went [sic] the people that I was close to, they were the people I worked with daily.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-14\">\u2756 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-15\">God has always been the center of my life but in my moment of distress I fell short of his glory. I pray for his forgiveness as I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>have repented and claimed my rightful place as his servant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-4\">$ $ $ ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-5\">[T]here is no excuse for what I have done and I sincerely apologize but I pray to God that I can have the opportunity to take care of my family and make it up to them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Appellant faced a maximum sentence to confinement of twenty-five years and three months. <em>MCM </em>pt. IV, paras. 17.e., 31.e., 54.e.(1)(A), 62.e., 63.e., 105.e. (2005 ed.). In the quantum portion of the pretrial agreement, which the military judge did not review prior to announcing the sentence, the convening authority had agreed to a confinement cap of forty months if Appellant otherwise fulfilled the terms of the agreement. The prosecution argued for a sentence that would include confinement for five years. Defense counsel argued for a sentence limited to a punitive discharge and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade, with no confinement in light of Appellant\u2019s acceptance of guilt and his otherwise \u201ccredible and honorable service.\u201d The sentence announced by the military judge included thirteen months confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Immediately prior to announcing the sentence, the military judge addressed Appellant to explain \u201cwhy I think the sentence is appropriate for you.\u201d The military judge began with a description of basic sentencing principles, including rehabilitation, punishment, protection of society, preservation of good order and discipline in the military, and deterrence. <em>See Benchbook </em>ch. 2, \u00a7 V, para. 2-5-21, \u00a7 VI, para. 2-6-10. The military judge noted that the \u201cweight I give any or all of these along with the other sentencing matters in this case, rest[s] solely within my discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">The military judge then turned to the harm Appellant\u2019s actions caused his victims, his family, and the Army. In particular, the military judge noted that Appellant abused his leadership role as a noncommissioned officer, caused his victims mental duress, damaged the Army\u2019s reputation, and caused the Army financial detriment because several of Appellant\u2019s victims testified that they would not reenlist.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">In the course of addressing Appellant, the military judge made the comments which are the subject of the present appeal. After describing Appellant as \u201ca predator\u201d who operated \u201cin secret,\u201d the military judge said: \u201cSome of the documents I\u2019ve seen describe you as God fearing, strong in your belief in God. The last time I looked there were 10 commandments. Apparently one of those, which addresses your actions, you must have missed in the reading.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">The military judge characterized Appellant\u2019s crimes as betraying his family and the Army:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-12\">Trust and confidence was placed in you. You abused it. This Army\u2019s not high school, it is not a place for maltreating others. You do unto others as you would expect to be treated. That\u2019s the golden rule. My job is now to set the matter straight. Whatever I do cannot make up for what the soldiers experienced, to include having you as a leader.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-13\">In his concluding remarks, the military judge told Appellant that his actions \u201cweren\u2019t mistakes, these were choices.\u201d He added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A72\">Every choice in life has a repercussion. It kind of reminds me of an old Charlie Daniels saying from a country music song. \u2018You know what the problem [sic] in the world today is? People done gone and put their Bibles away. They\u2019re living by the law of the jungle, not the law of the land.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-14\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b472-15\">Appellant contends that the military judge\u2019s comments: (1) reflected improper consideration of factors not relevant to sentencing; and (2) interjected the personal religious views of the military judge into the sentencing process, establishing an impermissible bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-16\">We review a military judge\u2019s consideration of sentencing factors under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>See United States v. McDonald, </em>55 M.J. 173, 178 (C.A.A.F.2001). We evaluate a claim of judicial bias by considering, in view of the sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>teneing proceeding as a whole, whether a reasonable person would doubt the court-martial\u2019s legality, fairness, and impartiality. <em>United States v. Burton, 52 </em>M.J. 223, 226 (C.A.A.F.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">At the outset, we note that the military judge\u2019s comments during the prosecution\u2019s cross-examination of a defense witness do not demonstrate improper consideration of religion or bias. The military judge stated that he would not consider Appellant\u2019s fealty to religious principles, and the prosecution did not pursue the subject of religion.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">A number of remarks made by the military judge during his explanation of the sentence directly addressed the subject of religion. The military judge observed that Appellant had \u201c[apparently ... missed\u201d one of the \u201c10 commandments\u201d and that Appellant\u2019s conduct reminded him of the lament in a country music song that the \u201cproblem in the world today\u201d is that people have \u201cput their bibles away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Even if we view his references to the \u201cgolden rule\u201d as invoking a nonsectarian ethical concept, <em>see </em>Jeffrey Wattles, <em>The Golden Rule </em>172-74 (1996), the other remarks have a specific religious connotation. The suggestion that Appellant had apparently overlooked one of the \u201c10 commandments\u201d represented a thinly veiled reference to Appellant\u2019s conviction for adultery, an offense specifically denounced in the Decalogue. <em>Exodus </em>20:14; <em>Deuteronomy </em>5:18. The quotations from the country music song expressly invoked a religious text.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">A military judge may not interject his or her personal beliefs into the sentencing process. <em>See United States v. Bakker, </em>925 F.2d 728, 740-41 (4th Cir.1991). An accused, however, has a broad right during allocution to bring aspects of his or her personal life for consideration in extenuation or mitigation. <em>See </em>Drafters\u2019 Analysis app. 21 at A21-69 to A21-71; <em>United States v. Tschip, </em>58 M.J. 275, 276 (C.A.A.F.2003). An accused, for example, may attempt to demonstrate \u201crepentance and readiness for rehabilitation.\u201d <em>See United States v. Warren, </em>13 M.J. 278, 284 (C.M.A.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">Just as an accused during sentencing may seek to depict a positive image by describing adherence to the tenets of a civic organization, an accused, such as the Appellant in this case, may attempt to convince the military judge that his or her religious practices and beliefs demonstrate repentance and readiness for rehabilitation. When the accused does so, the military judge may properly take into account the credibility and context of the accused\u2019s statement. <em>See Warren, </em>13 M.J. at 284. The military judge must ensure that the evidence is considered for the appropriate purpose, and that the military judge does not interject his or her personal religious beliefs into the sentencing process. <em>See Bakker, </em>925 F.2d at 740-41. In assessing the allegations of error in the present case, we take the following considerations into account. First, Appellant, who was convicted of numerous offenses, received a sentence which included confinement for only thirteen months. The adjudged confinement was far less than the authorized maximum of twenty-five years, the prosecution\u2019s request of five years, or the pretrial agreement cap of forty months. In that context, the sentence does not reflect prejudicial consideration of extraneous factors. Second, the subject of religion was not first interjected into the proceedings by the military judge. The defense initially raised the subject when counsel provided the military judge with a document indicating that Appellant would rely on matters of religion in the sentencing case. The defense subsequently interjected the subject of religion repeatedly into the proceedings through the introduction of a document that addressed Appellant\u2019s religion and through Appellant\u2019s unsworn statement. Third, when the prosecution sought to pursue the question of whether Appellant thought of himself as a \u201cgood Christian,\u201d the military judge expressly stated that he would not consider the Appellant\u2019s fealty to his religious tenets as a sentencing factor. Fourth, defense counsel did not object to the military judge\u2019s remarks. While a defense counsel might be reluctant to object to judicial remarks immediately prior to the announcement of the sentence, defense counsel had no reason to be reticent in challenging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>the impartiality of the military judge immediately thereafter if counsel perceived the remarks as reflecting consideration of improper factors or bias. <em>See Burton, 52 </em>M.J. at 226. Finally, we note that the military judge\u2019s sentencing remarks primarily discussed appropriate sentencing considerations, with incidental references to religion. The first two references involved matters of common knowledge, and the third referred to the lyrics of a popular song.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">In context, and in the absence of defense objection, the military judge\u2019s remarks in the present ease reflect a judge attempting to address Appellant\u2019s sentencing case, and do not reflect an effort to interject religion as either a sentencing factor or a matter of bias. <em>Compare Bakker, </em>925 F.2d at 740-41 (trial judge impermissibly interjected his religious beliefs into the proceedings). The military judge\u2019s comments in their entirety evoked established sentencing principles and tied those principles to Appellant\u2019s actions and the effect of those actions on his victims, his family, and the Army. Appellant\u2019s unsworn statement provides a relevant context in which to view the military judge\u2019s comments, most of which were made in response to the unsworn statement. In light of the military judge\u2019s sentencing statement as a whole and the context of his references to religion, we conclude that if the military judge erred, any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">IV.
