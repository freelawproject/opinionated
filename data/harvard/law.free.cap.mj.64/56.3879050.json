Kisala, </em>64 M.J. 50 (C.A.A.F.2006), we hold that the order directing Appellant to receive the anthrax vaccine was a lawful order which he disobeyed in violation of Article 90, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 890.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Additionally, in light of our opinions in <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>63 M.J. 129 (C.A.A.F.2006), and <em>United States v. Allison, </em>63 M.J. 365 (C.A.A.F.2006), this Court holds that even if Appellant was denied his due process right to speedy review and appeal, that error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and no relief is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-24\">Accordingly, the decision of the United States Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b236-19\">. <em>United States v. Rose, </em>61 M.J. 480 (C.A.A.F.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b236-27\">. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 890 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b236-25\">CRAWFORD, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Av1\">(concurring in the result):</p>\n<p id=\"b236-26\">I agree with the affirmance of the findings and sentence. I dissociate myself, however, from this Court\u2019s analysis of appellate delay. This Court\u2019s analysis and conclusion are based on a prospective rule set forth in <em>United States v. Allison, </em>63 M.J. 365 (C.A.A.F.2006) (citing <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>63 M.J. 129 (C.A.A.F.2006)), and its misapplication of the <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972), test. <em>See Moreno, </em>63 M.J. at 144 (Crawford, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
