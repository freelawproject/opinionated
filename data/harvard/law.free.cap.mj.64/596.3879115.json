The military judge\u2019s decision to suppress the trial testimony of Specialist (SPC) Fernando Carrillo is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-16\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b773-17\">Appellee was charged with conspiring with SPC Carrillo to import marijuana from Tijuana, Mexico, possessing ninety-six ounces of marijuana with intent to distribute, and importing ninety-six ounces of marijuana into the United States, in violation of Articles 81 and 112a, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 881 and 912a. At arraignment, appellee\u2019s trial defense counsel moved to suppress evidence seized during a search of a hotel room which appellee occupied. The evidence seized included marijuana, a book bag, zip-lock bags, a digital scale, a box of ammunition, and a 9-millime-ter handgun with a magazine inserted that contained thirteen rounds. Appellee\u2019s defense counsel also moved to suppress derivative evidence including any statements appellee made at the hotel room immediately after the marijuana was seized, the written, sworn statement<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the co-accused, SPC Carrillo, made in response to questioning by special agents from the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command (CID) at Fort Riley, and SPC Carrillo\u2019s future, in-court testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-18\">Deputy Sheriff Willie Wallenberg of Geary County, Kansas, was the only witness who testified during the Article 39a, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 839a, motion hearing. In addition to Deputy Wallenberg\u2019s testimony, the military judge considered the defense motion, government response, and documents attached thereto, including: (1) Deputy Wallenberg\u2019s affidavit; (2) Deputy Wallenberg\u2019s Certificate of Service for Protection from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Abuse Order; (3) Notice of Hearing and Temporary Orders of Protection; (4) summarized transcript of Deputy Wallenberg\u2019s testimony at appellee\u2019s Article 32, UCMJ, hearing; (5) summarized transcript of Deputy Wallenberg\u2019s testimony at SPC Carrillo\u2019s Article 32, UCMJ, hearing; and (6) SPC Carrillo\u2019s written, sworn statement. The military judge also considered the following documents from SPC Carrillo\u2019s case: (1) stipulation of fact; (2) offer to plead guilty, including the quantum portion; (3) report of result of trial; and (4) rights waiver form. Lastly, the military judge considered the summarized transcripts of testimony from SPC Carrillo\u2019s former company commander and CID Investigator Jurina given at SPC Carrillo\u2019s Article 32 hearing. The military judge\u2019s findings of fact for the motion to suppress are consistent with Deputy Wallenberg\u2019s testimony and the other evidence he considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">On 3 April 2006 at 2312, Deputy Wallenberg went to the wrong room (Room 110) at the Red Carpet Inn in Grandview Plaza, Kansas, to serve a Protection from Abuse Order on an African-American male, Phillip Jeffery. When Deputy Wallenberg knocked on the hotel room door, appellee, an African-American male, answered the door. Deputy Wallenberg asked appellee if he was Jeffery, and appellee \u201csaid he was not.\u201d Deputy Wallenberg then asked him for identification from outside the door, and appellee walked back into the room, leaving the door open. While standing outside the door, Deputy Wallenberg smelled the odor of raw marijuana \u201ccoming out of the room,\u201d and believed marijuana might have been in the room at one time.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">When appellee turned to retrieve his identification, Deputy Wallenberg took \u201ctwo to three steps into the room\u201d for \u201c[ojfficer safety reasons.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While in the room, he saw a book bag with zip-lock bags sticking out of it that appeared to contain marijuana. After handcuffing appellee and a female suspect who was also in appellee\u2019s room, Deputy Wallenberg found a box of ammunition inside the book bag, and three empty zip-lock bag boxes in a dresser drawer. No one else was present in the room. Another officer who arrived at the scene located a loaded 9-millimeter handgun containing thirteen rounds under a mattress and a digital scale.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">The Geary County officers went to the hotel manager\u2019s office and discovered that SPC Carrillo rented the room. They then informed the CID, which interviewed SPC Carrillo the next morning at Fort Riley. Investigator Jurina told SPC Carrillo that appellee had been arrested in the hotel room rented in SPC Carrillo\u2019s name. Investigator Jurina advised SPC Carrillo he was suspected of conspiracy and wrongful possession, use, and distribution of a controlled substance, and further advised him of his rights under Article 31(b), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 831(b), and Miranda.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specialist Carrillo acknowledged he understood his rights and agreed to make a statement without the presence of a lawyer. After waiving his rights at 0913 on 4 April 2006, SPC Carrillo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>provided the CID a written, sworn confession at 1300.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">In his confession, SPC Carrillo explained he and appellee were in Mexicali, Mexico, visiting SPC Carrillo\u2019s sick grandmother. Specialist Carrillo drove without appellee to Tijuana, Mexico, and purchased five kilograms (approximately eleven pounds) of marijuana for $1200.00 from an \u201cunknown Mexican drug dealer.\u201d They brought the marijuana into the United States hidden in a speaker box in SPC Carrillo\u2019s car. During the return trip, SPC Carrillo rented a room at the Red Carpet Inn in Kansas for five days. Specialist Carrillo, appellee, and appellee\u2019s female \u201cfriend\u201d stayed in the hotel room for two days. Thereafter, SPC Carrillo returned to Fort Riley and left appellee and the female alone in the room for the remaining three days. Specialist Carrillo and appellee kept the marijuana in the hotel room and smoked one to two ounces. Immediately prior to Deputy Wallenberg\u2019s arrival at the room, they had smoked some amount of marijuana. Specialist Carrillo also explained he and appellee packaged the marijuana in zip-lock bags, and appellee brought a 9-millimeter handgun into the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Subsequently, on 31 July 2006, SPC Carrillo offered to plead guilty. On 7 August 2006, consistent with his pleas, SPC Carrillo was found guilty of possessing marijuana with intent to distribute, importation and use of marijuana, and use of methamphetamines (one specification each), in violation of Article 112a, UCMJ. In SPC Carrillo\u2019s pretrial agreement, he agreed to \u201ctestify truthfully and cooperate with the government in the investigation of and any resulting trial against\u201d appellee, and agreed to do so without a grant of immunity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specialist Carrillo\u2019s pretrial agreement also stated he agreed to \u201cwaive the <em>Defense Motion to Suppress under [Mil. B. Evid.] 311, </em>dated 10 July 2006.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">We also take judicial notice of our own record and the existence and conclusion of court-martial proceedings in SPC Carrillo\u2019s case. <em>See United States v. Lovett, </em>7 U.S.C.M.A. 704, 708, 23 C.M.R. 168, 172, 1957 WL 4455 (1957) (\u201cAn appellate court, however, can take judicial notice of its own records.\u201d); <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>2 C.M.R. 96, 98, 1952 WL 1700 (C.M.A.1952) (noting and citing to \u201cauthority in both service and civilian cases for ... taking judicial notice of the record of trial in another court-martial\u201d); <em>United States v. Moses, </em>11 C.M.R. 281, 285, 1953 WL 2020 (A.B.R.1953) (\u201cThe board of review may take judicial notice of the record of trial in a companion court-martial.\u201d); <em>United States v. Lawrence, </em>1 C.M.R. 248, 252, 1951 WL 1608 (A.B.R.1951) (\u2018We may take judicial notice of our own official records in certain instances.\u201d). Without noting specific facts contained within the record itself, we take judicial notice that on 15 August 2006, SPC Canillo, consistent with his pleas, was convicted at a general court-martial. Specialist Carrillo submitted his case to this court on its merits, and we subsequently affirmed the findings of guilty and the sentence in an unpublished decision. <em>See United States v. Carrillo, </em>ARMY 20060790 (Army Ct.Crim.App. 8 Jan. 2007) (unpub.).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>After receiving evidence and hearing argument on appellee\u2019s suppression motion, the military judge concluded the government had \u201cnot shown by clear and convincing evidence\u201d that Deputy Wallenberg entered the hotel room based on express or implied consent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Specifically, the military judge found \u201cDeputy Wallenberg\u2019s entry into the room was unlawful, because it was without consent, and without probable cause and exigent circumstances.\u201d Furthermore, the primary evidence \u201cwould not have been obtained if the [subsequent,] unlawful search had not been made.\u201d Had Deputy Wallenberg not unlawfully entered the room, the military judge concluded \u201che would [have] left [the scene] and taken no further investigative steps in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">As for the derivative evidence, the military judge held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-5\">[T]he government [did not show] by a preponderance of the evidence that any of [the derivative evidence<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] was not obtained as a result of the unlawful search or that the evidence ultimately would[ have] been obtained by lawful means even if the unlawful search had not been made. Without the unlawful search, Deputy Wallenberg never would[ have] entered the room;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the government would not have the marijuana, because it was not in plain view without the entry into the room. There would have been no arrests and no searches incident to arrest. The government would not have any of the evidence seized from the room. Also, [SPC] Carrillo would never have even been questioned, let alone, waive[d] his rights and confess[ed]. Furthermore, the confession was close in time to the unlawful search.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-12\">There were no intervening circumstances sufficient to cause the taint to be attenuated. Even though [SPC] Carrillo was not informed of all the seized property, he was informed that the accused had-been arrested. That[,] and the offenses of which he was suspected[,] obviously had an impact on his confession. <em>Also, as far as the in-court testimony of [SPC] Carrillo, the government has not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that [SPC] Carrillo would[ have] entered into this pretrial agreement or testified against his interests without the government having the marijuana and his confession. To the contrary, it is extremely unlikely that there would be a pretrial agreement or that [SPC] Carrillo would testify in this case if the government did not have the marijuana or [SPC] Carrillo\u2019s confession. </em>Accordingly, the defense motion to suppress is granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-13\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b776-14\">LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b776-15\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b776-16\">Our court reviews a military judge\u2019s ruling on the suppression of evidence for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Datz, </em>61 M.J. 37, 42 (C.A.A.F.2005). This means that in the course of our review, we conduct a two-part analysis whereby we examine the military judge\u2019s findings of fact using a clearly-erroneous standard and his or her conclusions of law de novo. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>60 M.J. 239, 246 (C.A.A.F.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">When ruling on government interlocutory appeals made pursuant to Article 62(b), UCMJ, our court \u201cmay act only with respect to matters of law.\u201d We may not make additional findings of fact; rather, \u201c[o]n questions of fact, [our] court is limited to determining whether the military judge\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous or unsupported by the record.

However, we review questions of law de novo. <em>Kosek, </em>41 M.J. at 63; <em>United States v.

United States, </em>487 U.S. 533, 536-37, 108 S.Ct. 2529, 101 L.Ed.2d 472 (1988) (quoting <em>Nardone v.

Consequently, the rule \u201coperates as \u2018a judieially[-]created remedy designed to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally through its deterrent effect, rather than a personal [C]onstitutional right of the party aggrieved.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Calandra, </em>414 U.S. at 348, 94 S.Ct. 613).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">The exclusionary rule \u201chas never been interpreted to proscribe the introduction of illegally[-]seized evidence in all proceedings or against all persons.\u201d <em>Stone v.

In deciding whether to suppress \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree,\u201d the Court has further urged: \u201c \u2018The penalties visited upon the Government, and in turn upon the public, because its officers have violated the law must bear some relation to the purposes which the law is to serve.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2164 (quoting <em>Ceccolini, </em>435 U.S. at 279, 98 S.Ct. 1054).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>In other words, in the present case, we must consider the interest protected by the restrictions for unlawful entry (\u201csocial costs\u201d) as well as the deterrence benefits. <em>See id. </em>at 2165-67. The Court has specifically noted that because \u201cthe cost of excluding live-witness testimony often will be greater, a closer, more direct link between the illegality and that kind of testimony is required.\u201d <em>Ceccolini, </em>435 U.S. at 278, 98 S.Ct. 1054. Moreover, \u201cthe exclusionary rule should be invoked with much greater reluctance where the claim is based on a causal relationship between the [Constitutional violation and the discovery of a live witness than when a similar claim is advanced to support suppression of an inanimate object.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 280, 98 S.Ct. 1054.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">\n<em>Exclusionary Rule Applied to Witness Trial Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">In conducting this cost-benefit analysis, the Supreme Court has consistently held: \u201cEven in situations where the exclusionary rule is plainly applicable, [they] have declined to adopt a \u2018per se or \u201cbut for\u201d\u2019 rule that would make inadmissible any evidence, whether tangible or live-witness testimony, which somehow came to light through a chain of causation that began with an illegal arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 276, 98 S.Ct. 1054; <em>see Hudson, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 126 S.Ct. at 2164; <em>Harris, </em>495 U.S. at 17, 110 S.Ct. 1640; <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 910, 104 S.Ct. 3405; <em>Segura v.

Specifically, as the Court reaffirmed in <em>Harris: </em>\u201cAn inquiry into whether a suspect\u2019s statement is properly treated as attributable to a Fourth Amendment violation or to the suspect\u2019s independent act of will,\u201d and sufficiently attenuated, must consider <em>\u201cthe length of time between the arrest and the statement, the presence of intervening circumstances, and the purpose andflagrancy of the violation.\u201d Harris, </em>495 U.S. at 23, 110 S.Ct. 1640 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also United States v. Khamsouk, </em>57 M.J. 282, 292-93 (C.A.A.F.2002) (applying the <em>Brown </em>factors to warrantless entry followed by immediate consent search of belongings, then later inculpatory statement and further search of belongings after Article 31, UCMJ, rights warning given).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-14\">While further rejecting the notion that, \u201cif the road were uninterrupted, its length [is] immaterial[,]\u201d the Supreme Court instead set forth factors for the judiciary to weigh in determining whether to exclude evidence consisting of <em>live-witness testimony </em>derived from unlawful police activity. <em>Ceccolini, </em>435 U.S. at 275, 98 S.Ct. 1054. First, the Court directed lower courts to consider the <em>\u201cdegree of free will exercised by the witness\u201d </em>because \u201c[t]he greater the willingness of the witness to freely testify, the greater the likelihood that he or she will be discovered by legal means and, concomitantly, the smaller the incentive to conduct an illegal search to discover the witness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 276, 98 S.Ct. 1054 (emphasis added). Courts must consider the <em>time lapse </em>\u201cbetween the time of the illegal search and the initial contact with the witness, on the one hand, and between the latter and the testimony at trial on the other.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 279, 98 S.Ct. 1054. Courts must also account for the <em>role of the original illegal law enforcement activity </em>in obtaining the witness\u2019 testimony and the law enforcement\u2019s <em>purpose andflagrancy </em>of that conduct. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>McGuire v. United States, </em>273 U.S. 95, 99, 47 S.Ct. 259, 71 L.Ed. 556 (1927)). Finally, courts must conduct a <em>cost-benefit analysis </em>by comparing the cost on the \u201cevenhanded system of law enforcement\u201d (due to excluding live-witness testimony and \u201cpermanently silencing\u201d a witness) with the beneficial \u201cdeterrent effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 280, 98 S.Ct. 1054.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>We also find persuasive authority from the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>United States v.

In January 1999, police officers seized marijuana and firearms from the apartment of Ellison, a previously convicted felon. In May 2000, the police received an anonymous tip asserting drug activity at Ellison\u2019s apartment, which, at this point, Ellison was sharing with his girlfriend, Stewart, and with Akridge. Police officers arrived at the apartment, engaged in a \u201cknock and talk\u201d at the door, and ultimately conducted an unlawful search. The search resulted in the seizure of marijuana, cocaine, and three loaded handguns. Ellison, Stewart, and Akridge eventually confessed to selling crack cocaine and marijuana. Ellison and Stewart then entered into plea agreements with the government. Although the district court suppressed Akridge\u2019s statement and the evidence seized from the apartment, it did not suppress Ellison and Stewart\u2019s trial testimony. The Sixth Circuit held the district court properly denied Akridge\u2019s suppression motion. <em>Id. </em>at 624.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">In reviewing the circumstances in <em>Akridge </em>\u2014 circumstances similar to those in appellee\u2019s case \u2014 the Sixth Circuit considered the following additional factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-7\">the stated willingness of the witness to testify; the presence of intervening circumstances; the time, place, and manner of the initial questioning of the witness; whether the witness himself was a defendant; whether the illegally-seized evidence was used in questioning the witness; the time between the illegal search and initial contact with the witness; whether investigators knew of the relationship, if any, between the witness and the defendant prior to the illegal search; and whether the police conducted the illegal search intending to find evidence implicating the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b780-10\">The government does not now appeal the military judge\u2019s ruling suppressing the physical evidence seized (following the initial warrantless entry) from the hotel room<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>SPC Carrillo\u2019s written, sworn confession to CID.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The government, however, does assert the \u201cmilitary judge erred by applying a legally unsupportable \u2018but-for\u2019 analysis in deciding to suppress the in-court testimony of SPC Carrillo as a fruit of the illegal search,\u201d and asks this court to overturn that ruling. Therefore, we must only consider whether the military judge properly excluded SPC Carrillo\u2019s trial testimony. Today, we need only address the narrow and precise question of remedy for the unlawful entry into the hotel room. In so doing, we find the military judge misapplied the law. After applying the <em>Ceccolini </em>factors, and balancing the cost of suppression against the deterrent effect of exclusion, we find the factors weigh against excluding SPC Carrillo\u2019s trial testimony. <em>See Akridge, </em>346 F.3d at 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">In the instant case, a lengthy sequence of events resulted in obtaining what would have been SPC Carrillo\u2019s in-court testimony.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Initially, Deputy Wallenberg unlawfully entered the hotel room, conducted a visual protective sweep, a plain view search and seizure, an arrest or apprehension of appellee and appellee\u2019s female friend, and then a search incident to arrest. Nevertheless, we must conduct our own review of the military judge\u2019s conclusions of law without the benefit of the rules and cases upon which he relied because the military judge did not include that information in his ruling. Without specifying the \u201cderivative evidence\u201d to which he refers, the military judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-6\">[T]he government has not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that any of [the derivative evidence] was not obtained as a result of the unlawful search or that the evidence ultimately would[ have] been obtained by lawful means even if the unlawful search had not been made____[T]he government would not have the marijuana---There would have been no arrests and no searches incident to arrest[, and no] ... evidence seized from the room____ Specialist Carrillo would never have even been questioned---- Furthermore, the confession was close in time to the unlawful search. There were no intervening circumstances sufficient to cause the taint to be attenuated. Even though [SPC] Carrillo was not informed of all the seized property, he was informed [of the accused\u2019s arrest]. That[,] and the offenses of which he was suspeeted[,] obviously had an impact on his confession.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-15\">Our review, however, is limited to the evidence of SPC Carrillo\u2019s in-court testimony. In specifically assessing whether to exclude SPC Carrillo\u2019s trial testimony, the military judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-16\">[A]s far as the in-court testimony of [SPC] Carrillo, the government has not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that [SPC] Carrillo would[ have] entered into this pretrial agreement or testified against his interests <em>without </em>the government having the <em>marijuana </em>and his <em>confession. </em>To the contrary, it is <em>extremely unlikely </em>that there would be a pretrial agreement or that [SPC] Carrillo would testify in this case if the government <em>did not </em>have the <em>marijuana </em>or [SPC] Carrillo\u2019s <em>confession.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-17\">(Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The military judge improperly used a \u201cbut-for\u201d causation analysis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>(i.e., \u201cbut-for\u201d the illegally-obtained marijuana and confession, SPC Carrillo \u201cwould [not have] entered into this pretrial agreement or testified against his interest\u201d) rather than applying the factors described above as set forth by the Supreme Court for the judiciary to assess in-court witness testimony as \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d evidence. As the Supreme Court recently stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-4\">[Exclusion may not be premised on the mere fact that a [Constitutional violation was a \u201cbut-for\u201d cause of obtaining evidence .... But even if the illegal entry ... could be characterized as a but-for cause of discovering what was inside, we have \u201cnever held that evidence is \u2018fruit of the poisonous tree\u2019 simply because \u2018it would not have come to light but for the illegal actions of the police.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-5\"><em>Hudson, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 126 S.Ct. at 2164 (quoting <em>Segura, </em>468 U.S. at 815, 104 S.Ct. 3380).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">In assessing whether to suppress in-court witness testimony as \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree,\u201d we must review the free will or willingness of the witness to testily, the time elapsed between the illegal law enforcement conduct and contact with the witness, the purpose and flagrancy of the law enforcement violation, and whether the costs of excluding the testimony outweigh the benefits of the \u201cdeterrent effect.\u201d <em>Ceccolini, </em>435 U.S. at 279, 98 S.Ct. 1054; <em>see Brown, </em>422 U.S. at 600-05, 95 S.Ct. 2254; <em>Akridge, </em>346 F.3d at 626. We find most dispositive the degree of free will SPC Carrillo exercised in cooperating with law enforcement, and the temporal attenuation (time lapse) between the unlawful entry and illegal search and seizure by civilian police officers, SPC Carrillo\u2019s initial 4 April 2006 questioning by the CID, his 31 July 2006 plea agreement, his 7 August 2006 guilty plea trial, and his scheduled testimony at appellee\u2019s 15 August 2006 court-martial. <em>See Ceccolini, </em>435 U.S. at 279, 98 S.Ct. 1054; <em>Akridge, </em>346 F.3d at 631-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-10\">\n<em>Free Will</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b782-11\">The degree of free will SPC Carrillo exercised in agreeing to testify against appellee is significant. Although law enforcement did not have prior knowledge of SPC Carrillo\u2019s relationship with appellee, several factors indicate SPC Carrillo made a voluntary choice to testify. <em>See Stevens, </em>612 F.2d at 1229 (finding live-witness testimony, discovered after exploiting illegal wiretaps, sufficiently voluntary and untainted where testimony rendered after defendant consulted with attorney, entered into plea bargain, and gave incriminatory statement \u201cmore than a month following his arrest\u201d); <em>see also Wong Sun, </em>371 U.S. at 491, 83 S.Ct. 407 (finding admissible a statement made by person unlawfully arrested, released, and who voluntarily returned several days later to make the statement because \u201cconnection between the arrest and the statement had become so attenuated as to dissipate the taint\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>United States v. Beasley, </em>485 F.2d 60, 63-64 (10th Cir.1973) (finding accessory\u2019s live-witness testimony admissible because decision to testify made \u201cthree days after the arrest,\u201d demonstrates \u201chigh degree of probability that she exercised her own volition,\u201d and leads to the conclusion \u201cthat there was no exploitation of the illegal arrest\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>416 U.S. 941, 94 S.Ct. 1946, 40 L.Ed.2d 292 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-12\">Similar to <em>Akridge, </em>appellee now asserts SPC Carrillo\u2019s decision to testify was not of his own free will because he faced \u201cthe Hob-son\u2019s choice of testifying against [appellee] or being exposed to the maximum amount of confinement for his crimes.\u201d Brief for Appellee at 13; <em>see Akridge, </em>346 F.3d at 630. We agree with the <em>Akridge </em>court that <em>Ceccolini </em>instructs otherwise. Quoting <em>Ceccolini, </em>the <em>Akridge </em>court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>Another factor which not only is relevant in determining the usefulness of the exclusionary rule in a particular context, but also seems to us to differentiate the testimony of all live witness' \u2014 even putative defendants \u2014 from the exclusion of the typical documentary evidence, is that such exclusion would perpetually disable a witness from testifying about relevant and material facts, regardless of how unrelated such testimony might be to the purpose of the originally illegal search or the evidence discovered thereby. Rules which disqualify knowledgeable witnesses from testifying at trial are, in the word[s] of Professor McCormick, \u201cserious obstructions to the ascertainment of truth____\u201d C. McCormick, Law of Evidence \u00a7 71 (1954).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 630 (quoting <em>Ceccolini, </em>435 U.S. at 277-78 n. 14, 98 S.Ct. 1054). The <em>Ceccolini </em>Court, relying on this reasoning, held \u201cadmissible at trial [the] testimony of a witness whose identity was disclosed by the defendant\u2019s statement given after inadequate <em>Miranda </em>warnings.\u201d <em>Ceccolini, </em>435 U.S. at 278, 98 S.Ct. 1054 (citing <em>Michigan v. Tucker, </em>417 U.S. 433, 450-51, 94 S.Ct. 2357, 41 L.Ed.2d 182 (1974)). In other words, the appropriate question to ask is, at what point would SPC Carrillo\u2019s agreement to waive his rights upon the advice of counsel and to testify truthfully be considered a matter of exercising his free will? If SPC Carrillo approached law enforcement officers six months after appellee\u2019s trial, after additional advice from counsel, with more detailed, slightly different information regarding appellee\u2019s criminal conduct, would that be considered a result of SPC Carrillo\u2019s exercise of freewill?</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">Specialist Carrillo offered to testify against appellee \u2014 without a grant of immunity \u2014 and made this offer as part his offer to plead guilty entered on 31 July 2006, approximately four months after his 4 April 2006 initial rights waiver and confession to the CID. Specialist Carrillo pleaded guilty on 7 August 2006, and was scheduled to testify, <em>without </em>a grant of immunity, at appellee\u2019s 15 August 2006 court-martial. Specialist Carrillo\u2019s offer to plead guilty and offer to testify without immunity reflects an \u201cindependent act of free will\u201d that breaks the chain of causation between the unlawful entry and SPC Carrillo\u2019s subsequent discovery. <em>Butner, </em>15 M.J. at 143 (quoting <em>Wong Sun, </em>371 U.S. at 486, 83 S.Ct. 407); <em>see United States v. Kaliski, </em>37 M.J. 105, 109-10 (C.M.A.1993);<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>Stevens, </em>612 F.2d at 1229. Specialist Carrillo\u2019s subsequent trial and specific waiver of the motion to suppress, on 7 August 2006, further indicates his exercise of decisional autonomy. <em>See also, United States v. Ramos, </em>42 F.3d 1160, 1164 (8th Cir.1994) (finding, despite Fourth Amendment violation, defendant\u2019s \u201csigning [of a consent-to-search] form was sufficiently an act of free will to purge the taint of the [immediately] preceding illegal detention\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">Although SPC Carrillo\u2019s decision to testify evolved in part with his offer to plea bargain, \u201cthat does not diminish the volition of coming forward.\u201d <em>Stevens, </em>612 F.2d at 1229. If SPC Carrillo had been motivated \u201csolely to avoid prosecution, [he] could have waited for a suppression ruling. Instead, [he] entered [his] plea without challenging the admissibility of the evidence against [him].\u201d <em>Akridge, 346 </em>F.3d at 631. Accordingly, we find SPC Carrillo\u2019s cooperation and agreement to testify at trial resulted from \u201can exercise of [his] free will, and was the \u2018product of detached reflection and a desire to be cooperative.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 630 (quoting <em>Ceccolini, </em>435 U.S. at 277, 98 S.Ct. 1054).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-11\">\n<em>Time Elapsed</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b783-12\">In reviewing time lapses, i.e., \u201cbetween the time of the illegal search and the initial contact with the witness, on the one hand, and between the latter and the testimony at trial on the other,\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> as required by the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Court, we also will consider, as the <em>Akridge </em>court suggests, whether the witness is a co-accused; the time, place, and manner of the witness\u2019 questioning; whether law enforcement officials used the illegally-obtained evidence in questioning the witness; and any intervening circumstances. <em>See Akridge, </em>346 F.3d at 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">Deputy Wallenberg, a <em>civilian </em>police officer, unlawfully entered the hotel room in Grandview Plaza, Kansas, on 3 April 2006 at 2312. On 4 April 2006 at 0913, SPC Carrillo, a co-accused, waived his Article 31, UCMJ, rights and provided <em>military </em>investigators a written, sworn confession at 1300 at Fort Riley. Specialist Carrillo offered to plead guilty on 31 July 2006, and, on 7 August 2006, pleaded guilty, knowingly waiving his initial motion to suppress. Ten hours elapsed between the unlawful <em>civilian </em>police conduct and when SPC Carrillo waived his rights; fourteen hours after the unlawful conduct he confessed to <em>military </em>investigators. Investigator Jurina told SPC Carrillo about appellee\u2019s arrest, but as the military judge found, SPC Carrillo was \u201cnot informed of all the seized property.\u201d Four months elapsed between SPC Carrillo\u2019s 4 April 2006 confession and his 31 July 2006 offer to plead guilty in exchange for a negotiated sentence limitation of confinement for twenty-four months and the dismissal of two charges. An additional seven days passed before SPC Carrillo knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to a contested trial, relinquished his motion to suppress evidence, and pleaded guilty at his 7 August 2006 court-martial. Eight days later, SPC Carrillo was scheduled to testify against appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Certain intervening circumstances may occur during the time lapse between the initial contact with the witness and the trial testimony that result in attenuation of the taint from the original law enforcement illegality. For example, courts have found sufficient attenuation, and therefore admissibility, in subsequent confessions provided to different law enforcement agents in different locations. <em>See Holland v. McGinnis, </em>963 F.2d 1044, 1050-51 (7th Cir.1992) (finding admissible second confession given six hours after beating and coerced confession, to <em>different </em>police officer in <em>different </em>city); <em>United States v. Daniel, </em>932 F.2d 517, 521 (6th Cir.1991) (finding admissible second confession given day after first confession, to <em>different </em>police officer at <em>different </em>location); <em>United States v. Manuel, </em>706 F.2d 908, 912 (9th Cir.1983) (finding admissible confession given eighteen hours after unlawful, though not flagrantly illegal, arrest). In the present case, intervening circumstances attenuating the taint of illegality include the transfer of investigative information from <em>civilian </em>to <em>military </em>law enforcement officials, SPC Carrillo\u2019s written and negotiated offer to plead guilty, and his waiver and acknowledgement before a military judge of his right to plead not guilty. Overall, we find SPC Carrillo\u2019s testimony measurably attenuated from the taint of Deputy Wallenberg\u2019s unlawful entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">\n<em>Law Enforcement Conduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">We now address whether the law enforcement conduct (Deputy Wallenberg\u2019s unlawful entry into the hotel room) involved an improper purpose or a flagrant violation of the Fourth Amendment. <em>See Ceccolini, </em>435 U.S. at 279-80, 98 S.Ct. 1054; <em>Brown, </em>422 U.S. at 603-05, 95 S.Ct. 2254. We find no support for such a conclusion.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> As the military judge found, Deputy Wallenberg\u2019s purpose for taking two or three steps into the hotel room (when appellee turned and walked back into the room to get his identification) was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>\u201cfor Ms own safety.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Furthermore, there is no evidence in the record that Deputy Wallenberg \u201cknew he was committmg a [Constitutional violation[,] and notwithstanding that knowledge, intentionally entered unlawfully in order to pursue a quest for evidence \u2018in the hope that sometMng might turn up.\u2019\u201d <em>Khamsouk, </em>57 M.J. at 293 (quoting <em>Brown, </em>422 U.S. at 605, 95 S.Ct. 2254).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">In determming whether the initial entry into the hotel room was a purposeful or flagrant law enforcement violation of appellee\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights, we must also consider Deputy Wallenberg\u2019s \u201cperception of the situation at the time\u201d and his good faith attempt to serve a Geary County, Kansas, district court protective order late at night and upon a potentially violent recipient. <em>Id. </em>Our superior court has so aptly pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-6\">In the real world of law enforcement, officers are often required to make split-second decisions resulting in choices, wMch, later subject to the frame by frame magnification of appellate review, do not meet Fourth Amendment muster. Nonetheless, decisions taken in good faith, as that term is used in common vernacular, warrant our careful and measured consideration when we assess the purposefulness and flagrancy of police conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">Deputy Wallenberg arrived at appellee\u2019s hotel room, albeit the wrong room, with the good faith mtent to serve a Protection from Abuse Order, and under a mistaken belief that the intended recipient, Phillip Jeffery, was inside. When appellee receded from the open doorway and turned to get Ms identification, Deputy Wallenberg \u201ctook two or three steps into the room.\u201d He took these steps to ensure his own safety from threats m areas of the room he could not initially see. Deputy Wallenberg did not enter the room with the mtent to find evidence against appellee. In fact, although Deputy Wallenberg imtially smelled raw marijuana when outside the door, he specifically did not enter the room because he only thought that \u201cthere might have been marijuana in that room at one time.\u201d Faced with the possibility of uncovering evidence against appellee, Deputy Wallenberg did not enter based on this reason. Therefore, we do not find Deputy Wallenberg\u2019s imtial uMawful entry into the hotel room, as part of a concern for officer safety, \u201cmisplaced, nor evidence of flagrant conduct.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b785-11\">\n<em>Cost-Benefit Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b785-12\">As the Supreme Court stated eighty years ago, and reiterated in <em>Ceccolini: </em>\u201c \u2018A criminal prosecution is more than a game in which the Government may be checkmated and the game lost merely because its officers have not played according to rule.\u2019\u201d <em>Ceccolini, </em>435 U.S. at 279, 98 S.Ct. 1054 (quoting <em>McGuire, </em>273 U.S. at 99, 47 S.Ct. 259). Rather, \u201cin determimng whether mvocation of the [exclusionary] rule is warranted, the Court insists that lower courts strike a balance between \u2018the public interest m determination of truth at trial\u2019 and the \u2018incremental contribution that might [be] made to the protection of Fourth Amendment values____\u2019\u201d <em>Khamsouk, </em>57 M.J. at 292 (quoting <em>Stone, </em>428 U.S. at 488, 96 S.Ct. 3037) (second alteration in original). \u201cBefore we penalize police error, therefore, we must consider whether the sanction serves a valid and useful purpose.\u201d <em>Tucker, </em>417 U.S. at 446, 94 S.Ct. 2357. As the \u201cattenuated connection test ... mark[s] the point of dimimshing returns of the deterrence principle\u201d inherent in the exclusionary rule, we believe the present case reflects that point. Wayne R. LaFave et al, Principals of Criminal Procedure: Investigation 467-68 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-14\">In the present case, a law enforcement officer under the erroneous, although honest, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>belief that he was at the correct hotel room, conducted an initial, warrantless entry with officer safety as his sole concern. We must assess whether suppressing SPC Carrillo\u2019s testimony will deter other officers in doing the same. As the Supreme Court has observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b786-4\">The deterrent purpose of the exclusionary rule necessarily assumes that the police have engaged in willful, or at the very least negligent, conduct which has deprived the defendant of some right. By refusing to admit evidence gained as a result of such conduct, the courts hope to instill in those particular investigating officers, or in their future counterparts, a greater degree of care toward the rights of an accused. Where the official action was pursued in complete good faith, however, the deterrence rationale loses much of its force.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGY\"><em>Tucker, </em>417 U.S. at 447, 94 S.Ct. 2357. Judicial suppression of evidence in this case in all likelihood will not result in an increased possibility of such illegal entries. As the Supreme Court noted: \u2018We are unwilling to believe that officers will routinely and purposely violate the law as a matter of course____ [And] if officers enter without exigent circumstances to justify the entry, they expose themselves to potential civil liability under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Segura, </em>468 U.S. at 812, 104 S.Ct. 3380. Furthermore, it is unlikely that if we suppress SPC Carrillo\u2019s trial testimony, such judicial action will deter law enforcement officials from engaging in warrantless entries (taking two or three steps into a room) to better view their surroundings and ensure officer safety. Thus, we find that \u201c[a]pplication of the exclusionary rule in this situation could not have the slightest deterrent effect on the behavior of an officer such as [Deputy Wallenberg].\u201d <em>Ceccolini </em>435 U.S. at 280, 98 S.Ct. 1054. The cost on an \u201cevenhanded system of law enforcement\u201d of permanently silencing SPC Carrillo is too great \u201cto secure such a speculative and very likely negligible deterrent effect.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">By failing to apply the applicable legal standard in assessing admissibility of live-witness testimony, the military judge in the instant case abused his discretion. <em>See United States v. Youngman, </em>48 M.J. 123, 128 (C.A.A.F.1998) (holding that in analyzing the government\u2019s use of immunized testimony, \u201c[t]he military judge\u2019s use of incorrect legal principles ... constitutes an abuse of discretion\u201d). Based upon our review of the record, we hold the military judge erred in applying the law. Accordingly, the military judge\u2019s ruling regarding SPC Carrillo\u2019s in-court testimony is vacated. The court-martial of Corporal Ricardo Jones Jr. may proceed in accordance with R.C.M. 908(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-10\">Judge ZOLPER and Judge WALBURN concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b773-12\">. Although trial defense counsel did not specifically move to suppress SPC Carrillo's written statement, the statement is part of the derivative evidence obtained from the search of the hotel room.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b774-5\">. The military judge found Deputy Wallenberg's entry was unlawful because it occurred without appellee\u2019s consent (express or implied), without a warrant (arrest or search), and without probable cause and exigent circumstances.
