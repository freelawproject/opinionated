WHETHER THE NAVY-MARINE CORPS COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS LACKED JURISDICTION TO REVIEW THE FINDINGS AND SENTENCE IN APPELLANT\u2019S CASE PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 66(b)(1), UNIFORM CODE OF MILITARY JUSTICE, IN LIGHT OF THE CONVENING AUTHORITY\u2019S UNAMBIGUOUS ACTION THAT DID NOT APPROVE APPELLANT\u2019S ADJUDGED BAD-CONDUCT DISCHARGE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-20\">II. WHETHER THE NAVY-MARINE CORPS COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS ERRED IN ACCEPTING THE NEW CONVENING AUTHORITY\u2019S ACTION AS A COMPETENT CLARIFICATION OF WHETHER THE ORIGINAL CONVENING AUTHORITY HAD INTENDED TO GRANT CLEMENCY.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-21\">III. WHETHER THE NAVY-MARINE CORPS COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS ERRED AS A MATTER OF LAW IN DENYING RELIEF FOR EXCESSIVE POST-TRIAL DELAY.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-22\">Issue I arises from yet another ambiguous convening authority action. In light of our recent holding in <em>United States v. Politte,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we agree with the remedial action taken by the United States Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals when faced with an ambiguous convening authority action. The lower court properly remanded the initial convening authority\u2019s ambiguous action for clarification in accordance with Rule for Courts-Martial (R.C.M.) 1107(g)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>completing its review pursuant to Article 66, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, we answer Issue I in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">We also answer Issue II in the negative. We conclude that no error arose when the lower court accepted an entirely new action by a successor convening authority in place of an ambiguous action by the original convening authority when the original convening authority was unavailable to clarify the intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">As to Issue III, we disagree with the lower court. We hold that Appellant was denied his due process right to speedy review. However, because we conclude this error was harmless, we decline to grant relief under <em>United States v. </em>Moreno,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">A special court-martial before a military judge alone, found Appellant guilty of one specification of conspiracy, two specifications of larceny, and four specifications of forgery.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The military judge sentenced Appellant to ninety days of confinement, forfeiture of $695 pay per month for three months, and a bad-conduct discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">At the time of the convening authority\u2019s action, the original convening authority was unavailable. Although the Commanding Officer, Third Battalion, Third Marine Regiment, referred Appellant\u2019s case to trial, this officer was deployed with his unit to Southwest Asia in support of Operation Enduring Freedom when it was time for the convening authority\u2019s action. Therefore the original convening authority requested the commanding officer of his next superior unit to take action in his place. Colonel J.V. Medina, Commanding Officer, Third Marine Regiment, took the following action on May 30, 2003:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae7\">In the case of Private Travis H. Gosser, U.S. Marine Corps, except for the bad-conduct discharge, the sentence is approved and ordered executed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-16\">The record of trial is forwarded to the Navy-Marine Corps Appellate Review Activity, Office of the Judge Advocate General of the Navy for review by the U.S. Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals pursuant to section 0153(b)(1)(a) of the JAGMAN.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-17\">Shortly after the Navy-Marine Corps court received the record of trial, appellate defense counsel filed a Motion for Relief From Post-Trial Processing Error, arguing that the court had no jurisdiction to hear the case under Article 66, UCMJ. Acting pursuant to R.C.M. 1107(g), the lower court ordered the Judge Advocate General of the Navy to remand the case to the convening authority for corrective action.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-18\">In accordance with this order, Colonel J.J. Patterson, Commanding Officer, Third Marine Regiment and successor in command to Colonel Medina, took the following action on December 14, 2005:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-19\">In the case of [Appellant], Private Travis H. Gosser, U.S. Marine Corps, the sentence to a bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of $695 pay per month for a period of three months, and thirty (30) days confinement is approved; and, except for the bad-conduct discharge, ordered executed. All confinement in excess of thirty (30) days is hereby disapproved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-20\">The convening authority again forwarded the case to the lower court. On review, the Appellant raised only an issue asserting excessive post-trial delay. In a brief opinion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>the lower court held Appellant was not entitled to sentence relief.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Appellant argues the May 30, 2003, convening authority action is unambiguous and disapproves the adjudged bad-conduct discharge. As a result, Appellant argues the lower court lacked jurisdiction to act on the findings and sentence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Our recent holding in <em>Politte </em>controls this issue.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In the present ease, as in <em>Politte, </em>there is surrounding documentation conflicting with the language of the convening authority action. This conflict presents an ambiguity that must be addressed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">When addressing situations that present an ambiguity, we have concluded the proper course of action is to remand for corrective action under R.C.M. 1107(g).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In <em>Politte, </em>we reaffirmed that R.C.M. 1107(g) empowers \u201can authority \u2018acting under\u2019 \u201d Article 66, UCMJ, to instruct a convening authority to issue a corrective action upon a showing of ambiguity.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This is exactly what the lower court did in the instant case. Accordingly, in light of the ambiguity in the original action, the lower court properly took remedial action that resulted in the preparation of a corrected convening authority action.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">Appellant further alleges that, even if the lower court was correct in ordering clarification of the convening authority action, the succeeding convening authority \u201cwas not competent to clarify that issue.\u201d Appellant cites this Court\u2019s holding in <em>United States v. Lower, </em>10 M.J. 263 (C.M.A.1981), as support for the position that the successor convening authority was not competent to clarify the action. In <em>Lower, </em>we held that where a record was devoid of any evidence of communication between successors in authority, we could not accept the current successor\u2019s expression of intent.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In articulating this standard, we \u201c[declined] to lay down a hard rule as to the evidentiary form this need take.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-16\">We conclude <em>Lower </em>is not controlling under the unique facts of this case. <em>Lower </em>was a ease in which a successor convening authority purported to clarify the intent of his predecessor by issuing an action.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The end result was this Court\u2019s holding that where a supervisory authority orders a correction where no effort is made to communicate with the original convening authority to clarify the convening authority\u2019s views, the successor convening authority cannot simply publish a correction reflecting his own views of what his predecessor decided.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-17\">The present case presents a different scenario and a different approach by the convening authority. Rather than simply interpreting his predecessor\u2019s intent as in <em>Lower, </em>the convening authority in this case took an entirely new action. Several factors from the record highlight this point. First, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>staff judge advocate issued a new recommendation, \u201cto assist [the convening authority] in taking [his] action.\u201d Second, the staff judge advocate also followed the procedure for a new action, as he served this new recommendation on defense counsel. Defense counsel, in turn, also treated the recommendation as a new action, as he raised new arguments in favor of clemency, including personal and family considerations and rehabilitation. Third, defense counsel specifically requested a new action in the form of clemency by recommending that the convening authority disapprove the bad-conduct discharge. Finally, we note that in this case, defense counsel offered no objection to the process of taking a new action rather than a mere correction.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">In short, <em>Lower </em>does not answer the specific question posed in this case: may a successor convening authority issue an entirely new action in place of his predecessor when the original convening authority is unavailable to clarify his intent. Under the unique facts of this case, we hold that the lower court did not err in accepting the new convening authority\u2019s clarification and action.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Appellant finally asserts that he was subject to excessive post-trial delay that resulted in a violation of the right to due process on appeal. To assess this question, we turn to <em>Moreno</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which applies a test for excessive post-trial delay based on the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Barker v. Wingo.</em><footnotemark><em>20</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The four <em>Barker </em>factors include: (1) the length of the delay; (2) the reasons for the delay; (3) the appellant\u2019s assertion of the right to timely review and appeal; and (4) prejudice.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The full due process analysis is triggered where the length of delay is facially unreasonable.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">1. <em>Length of the delay</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-13\">The total length of the delay in this case was 1,303 days from sentencing to the Court of Criminal Appeals opinion. Standing alone, this length of time may not rise to the level of \u201cfacially unreasonable.\u201d We note, however, that two periods within this time period are extreme. The convening authority did not issue an initial action until 548 days after sentencing. It then took an additional 141 days to transmit the record for docketing at the Court of Criminal Appeals. We conclude that this is an unacceptable delay in commencing review under Article 66(c), UCMJ. Thus, the length of delay is facially unreasonable and is a circumstance that weighs heavily in the favor of Appellant.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Based on <em>Moreno, </em>we proceed to analyze the remaining <em>Barker </em>factors.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-14\">2. <em>Reasons for the delay</em></p>\n<p id=\"b277-15\">Here, we focus on the degree of the Government\u2019s responsibility for the delay, as well as on any factors \u201cattributable to [Appellant].\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The Government has not presented evidence to explain the two unreasonable processing periods discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-16\">The chronology of events otherwise explains a reasonable action by the lower court to remand the case for clarification and complete plenary Article 66, UCMJ, review. There is no evidence that the length of the delay is directly attributable to Appellant himself.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>Therefore, we view the unreasonable and unexplained delays prior to this case being docketed at the lower court as circumstances that strongly favor Appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">3. <em>Appellant\u2019s assertion of a timely right to an appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">An appellant\u2019s assertion of a right to speedy review is \u201c \u2018entitled to strong evidentiary weight in determining whether the defendant is being deprived of the right.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The Government contends that Appellant did not raise this post-trial delay issue when the lower court first considered his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Indeed, it was not until after the case was remanded for corrective action that Appellant first complained about post-trial delay. In his clemency submission of January 5, 2005, responding to the staff judge advocate\u2019s recommendation on remand, Appellant raised this issue. The Government asserts Appellant\u2019s belated claim weighs in favor of the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Under <em>Moreno, </em>this Court does not apply a waiver theory when an appellant fails to complain about excessive post-trial delay.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> While we conclude Appellant\u2019s silence up until 2005 militates against his belated claim, we weigh this factor against Appellant only slightly.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-14\">4. <em>Prejudice to Appellant</em></p>\n<p id=\"b278-15\">We now address the question of prejudice to Appellant arising from this excessive post-trial delay. In order to prevail on this factor, Appellant must \u201cspecifically identify how he would be prejudiced ... due to the delay. Mere speculation is not enough.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-16\">Appellant contends that because of the excessive delay in his post-trial processing, he was unable to produce documentation to prove he received a discharge from the military that was necessary to apply for college financial aid.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Appellant relies on <em>United States v. </em>Jones,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> and argues that he \u201chad an opportunity for a second chance that was hindered by the unjustified delay in [processing] his ease after he pleaded guilty.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-17\">The Government, on the other hand, asserts Appellant\u2019s claim of prejudice fails absent tangible documentary evidence supporting the need for the form DD-214. We conclude that Appellant has failed to substantiate any claim of prejudice. Appellant relies solely on the assertions of his defense counsel in post-trial clemency submissions to the convening authority. He has provided no substantive evidence from persons with direct knowledge of the pertinent facts, nor is there adequate detail to give the Government a fair opportunity to rebut the contention. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Because Appellant failed to demonstrate any <em>Barker </em>prejudice, this factor weighs against him.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">\n<em>Summary of the Barker factors and relief</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">We conclude that despite the fact that Appellant has failed to show prejudice, a two-year delay in commencing review under Article 66(c), UCMJ, can diminish the public\u2019s perception of the fairness of military justice.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Therefore, our consideration of the four <em>Barker </em>factors leads us to conclude that Appellant was denied his due process right to speedy review and appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">As this due process error is one of constitutional magnitude, we are now obliged to test this error for harmlessness.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> To rebut a showing of error, \u201cthe Government must show that this error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Because we reject Appellant\u2019s clemency claim as evidence of prejudice, we conclude the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">The decision of the United States Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals as to both findings and sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b274-13\">. 63 M.J. 24, 27 (C.A.A.F.2006) (ordering a new convening authority action to address an ambiguity in the initial convening authority action).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b274-14\">.

As in <em>United States v. Politte,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>63 M.J. 24, 27 (C.A.A.F.2006) (Crawford, J., concurring in the result), I concur in the result to allow further action in the case rather than dismissing for a lack of jurisdiction. However, as I indicated in <em>Politte, </em>the original action in that ease had a typographical error. \u201cSeveral factors [would] lead one to the common sense conclusion that there was an administrative oversight in the convening authority\u2019s action that was not consistent with the intent of the convening authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because <em>Politte </em>was a 2-1-2 opinion, I thought the better result was that reached by Chief Judge Gierke. <em>Id. </em>at 27-28. Thus, I concurred in the result. I also agree that <em>United States v. Lower, </em>10 M.J. 263 (C.M.A.1981) is distinguishable based on the unique facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-21\">As to Issue III, I disassociate myself from the Court\u2019s analysis based on <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>63 M.J. 129 (C.A.A.F.2006), and its misapplication of the <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972), test. <em>See Moreno, </em>63 M.J. at 144 (Crawford, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b279-27\">. Counsel at oral argument in <em>Politte </em>indicated that the appellant\u2019s name in that case was pronounced \"polite,\u201d as in being courteous.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b279-22\">EFFRON, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Ao\">(concurring in part and in the result):</p>\n<p id=\"b279-23\">I concur in the lead opinion except for Part III, which addresses post-trial delay. Because any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, we need not reach the question of whether Appellant has suffered a denial of due process from any delay. <em>See United States v. Allison, </em>63 M.J. 365, 371 (C.A.A.F.2006).</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b279-24\">ERDMANN, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AjS\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b279-25\">Because the majority finds ambiguity by going beyond the four corners of this otherwise unambiguous action, I respectfully dissent. <em>See United States v. Politte, </em>63 M.J. 24, 28 (C.A.A.F.2006) (Erdmann, J., dissenting). The action here is not ambiguous. The convening authority did not approve the adjudged bad-conduct discharge. The Court of Criminal Appeals should have reviewed this action and found that it had no statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>authority to conduct further review. I would set aside the decision of the United States Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals and return the case to the Judge Advocate General of the Navy without addressing the remaining issues.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
