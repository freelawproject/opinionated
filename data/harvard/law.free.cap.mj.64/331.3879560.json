Foster entered a plea of not guilty to two specifications of committing indecent acts with a child on divers occasions and one specification of communicating a threat, all in violation of Article 134, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 934 (2000). At the close of the Government\u2019s case, the military judge dismissed one of the indecent act specifications on the grounds that the evidence was factually insufficient. The panel convicted Foster of the remaining two specifications and sentenced him to a dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, reduction to the lowest enlisted grade and confinement for five years. The convening authority approved the sentence and the United States Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the findings and the sentence. <em>United States v. Foster, </em>No. NMCCA 200301262, 2005 CCA LEXIS 322, 2005 WL 2704961 (N.M.Ct.Crim.App. Oct. 18, 2005) (unpublished).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-19\">A military judge\u2019s impartiality is crucial to the conduct of a legal and fair court-martial. <em>United States v. Quintanilla, </em>56 M.J. 37, 43 (C.A.A.F.2001). The military judge may participate actively in proceedings to assure that court-martial members receive the information that they need to determine whether the accused is proven guilty, howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>er, the military judge must take care not to become an advocate for either party. <em>United States v. Ramos, </em>42 M.J. 392, 396 (C.A.A.F.1995). We granted review of this case to determine whether the military judge remained impartial in his conduct of this trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While we do not condone some of the actions taken by the military judge, in the context of the entire trial, the legality, fairness, and impartiality of the court-martial were not put in doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The allegations leading to Foster\u2019s charges involved several instances of inappropriate sexual contact with his six-year-old stepdaughter and his threats to her if she told her mother about the incidents. The Government\u2019s ease relied in large part on the stepdaughter\u2019s testimony and Foster\u2019s defense was that the child\u2019s story was not true. A key component of the defense strategy was the testimony of Dr. Mary L. Huffman, a developmental research psychologist with expertise in evaluating children\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Foster\u2019s claim that the military judge was not impartial centers on the military judge\u2019s treatment of Dr. Huffman. Foster argues that the military judge harbored an inflexible and biased attitude toward Dr. Huffman and displayed contempt for her credentials and testimony and disdain for her area of expertise. He argues that the military judge improperly limited Dr. Huffman\u2019s testimony, engaged in hostile and combative questioning, and discredited her testimony by inaccurately summarizing it in a jury instruction that was not sufficiently detailed or accurate. Foster contends that the military judge, through his treatment of this expert witness, became a partisan advocate for the Government and denied him his right to present a defense. The Government responds that the military judge did not depart from his neutral role but set appropriate parameters on the testimony of the expert, asked questions</p>\n<p id=\"b513-12\">to uncover relevant facts, and tailored the expert witness instructions to give accurate and impartial guidance to the members.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-13\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b513-14\">There is a strong presumption that a military judge is impartial in the conduct of judicial proceedings. <em>Quintanilla, </em>56 M.J. at 44. \u201cWhen a military judge\u2019s impartiality is challenged on appeal, the test is whether, taken as a whole in the context of [the] trial, [the] court-martial\u2019s legality, fairness, and impartiality were put into doubt by the military judge\u2019s actions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 78 (citation and quotation marks omitted); <em>see also United States v. Acosta, </em>49 M.J. 14, 18 (C.A.A.F.1998). We apply this test from the viewpoint of the reasonable person observing the proceedings. <em>Ramos, </em>42 M.J. at 396. Failure to object at trial to alleged partisan action on the part of a military judge may present an inference that the defense believed that the military judge remained impartial. <em>See United States v. Burton, </em>52 M.J. 223, 226 (C.A.A.F.2000) (citing <em>United States v. Hill, </em>45 M.J. 245, 249 (C.A.A.F.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-15\">We will address in turn each of the four alleged instances of partisanship that Foster has raised: (1) the military judge\u2019s improper limitation on Dr. Huffman\u2019s testimony; (2) the military judge\u2019s hostile examination of Dr. Huffman in front of the court-martial members; (3) the instruction to members which failed to identify Dr. Huffman as an expert and inaccurately summarized her testimony; and (4) inappropriate comments made by the military judge outside the presence of the members that demonstrated his bias against Dr. Huffman.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-16\">1. <em>Limitation of Dr. Huffman\u2019s testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-17\">The defense\u2019s pretrial proffer of Dr. Huffman\u2019s testimony reflects that she was being called to \u201ctestify about the effects of multiple interviews on a child, leading ques<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>tions, and improper interview techniques. She will testify these factors can taint a child\u2019s testimony and make the child actually believe something is true that is not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">A key aspect of Dr. Huffman\u2019s work involves the concept of source misattribution error where a child over time has difficulty discerning whether his or her own memory or another\u2019s repeated questioning is the real source of the information. In Dr. Huffman\u2019s view, an analysis of the first interview with the child is crucial in determining whether source misattribution error occurred. The first interview in this case was unavailable for review because the audio and videotape equipment failed. Due to the absence of this record, Dr. Huffman was unable to perform the source misattribution error analysis. As the defense was questioning Dr. Huffman about the interview procedures that were utilized in this case, the Government objected on the grounds that it appeared she was about to opine on the victim\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The military judge convened an Article 39(a), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 839(a) (2000), session outside the presence of the court-martial members to discuss the objection and Dr. Huffman\u2019s testimony. The military judge instructed Dr. Huffman that she could not reveal whether she thought the victim was telling the truth. Dr. Huffman was expressly prohibited from stating that \u201cno one really could get on the stand and say that [the victim] is or isn\u2019t telling the truth.\u201d The rest of Dr. Huffman\u2019s examination, as well as the cross-examination, redirect examination and re-cross examination proceeded without further objection or limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Foster, relying on our decision in <em>United States v. Cacy, </em>43 M.J. 214 (C.A.A.F.1995), asserts that this testimonial limitation deprived him of a critical component of his defense and urges us to see this restriction as evidence of the military judge\u2019s bias against Dr. Huffman. In <em>Cacy, </em>we recognized that an expert may testify about symptoms that are generally found among children who have suffered sexual abuse and whether the child-witness has exhibited these symptoms. <em>Id. </em>at 217. An expert may also testify about patterns of consistency generally found in the stories of victims as compared to patterns in the victim\u2019s story. <em>Id. </em>Although <em>Cacy </em>allows this type of expert testimony in appropriate circumstances, this court has recognized that there is a fine line between admissible testimony in this area and testimony about a victim\u2019s credibility or its functional equivalent, which is not admissible. <em>See id. </em>at 217-18; <em>United States v. Birdsall, </em>47 M.J. 404, 410 (C.A.A.F.1998); <em>United States v. Arruza, </em>26 M.J. 234, 237 (C.M.A.1988); <em>see also United States v. Brooks, </em>64 M.J. 325, 329 (C.A.A.F.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">In this case, Dr. Huffman had no basis upon which she could offer a Cacy-like comparison of typical behavior patterns. Repeatedly during her testimony, she made the point that unless a recording of the first interview was available for review, she would not have the means to assess whether the testimony of the victim was affected by multiple interviews. Since there was no record of the initial interview, Dr. Huffman lacked the case-specific information that she needed to make <em>Cacy-type </em>comparisons. Indeed, she stated expressly that \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can say that there was [source misattribution error] and I don\u2019t think anyone can say that there was not.\u201d <em>Cacy </em>is therefore inapplicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">The military judge ruled that while credibility assessments are a function of the jury, Dr. Huffman could help the members decide what factors they should use to carry out that function. What she could not do was reveal her personal assessment of the child\u2019s credibility. The limitation on her testimony was appropriate and the ruling of the military judge was not erroneous. As we have found that the military judge did not err in his testimonial limitation, there exists no basis upon which a reasonable observer could conclude that the ruling casts doubt upon the court-martial\u2019s legality, fairness, and impartiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">2. <em>The military judge\u2019s examination of Dr. Huffman</em></p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">Following the examination of Dr. Huffman by the counsel for both parties, a member submitted several questions concerning Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Huffman\u2019s review of the case and the concept of source misattribution error. Based on these questions, the military judge conducted an examination of Dr. Huffman. The relevant portion of this exchange is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4B\">Q: Have you ever interviewed [the victim]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">A: I have not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">Q: All right. I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t your intent to gloss over this, but it was kind of glossed over early on in your testimony. I think they were just kind of rushing through to get to the crux of your testimony, but I understood you to say that in preparation for your testimony here today, you reviewed some paperwork but you were primarily interested in the number of times the children were interviewed, something along those lines. Tell me if you will what it is that you reviewed about this case before coming in to testify?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-7\">A. What I typically review would be a videotape\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-8\">Q. No, what have you reviewed in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-9\">A. In this case. I was not \u2014 there was no documentation given to me from the forensic interviewer \u2014 interview that was conducted with [the victim] or [the victim\u2019s brother]. That information was lost so, therefore, I was sent police reports and different things like that, but I \u2014 honestly, I did not even look at that because I\u2019m mostly interested in the forensic interview and there was no documentation on that. So what I asked for was a list of documented interviews and who conducted them. So that\u2019s mostly what I reviewed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-11\">Q: All right. So you had a list of the people involved in conducting interviews?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMc\">A. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-12\">Q. Okay. But you did not review the police report or anything else that had been submitted to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-13\">A. That is correct. I did not review those.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-14\">Q. So you, therefore, do not know what was contained within the police report? A. Right. Because to me, the time delay between when that interview was conducted and what was actually contained \u2014 what was contained in the report, there\u2019s such a delay that even the interviewer could reconstruct how they asked questions, what was asked, what was said, but that wasn\u2019t of value to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-17\">Q. It wasn\u2019t, okay. On cross-examination you did indicate that if a child tells the same story over time, notwithstanding a number of interviews, intervening interviews, that that is not a suggestive interview. None of those interviews would be suggestive, in your opinion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-18\">A. That is correct. But the caveat needs to be said that in that first interview, leading \u2014 which we don\u2019t have documentation on, leading questions, misleading questions, that the child could get clear messages as far as details and what needs to be said, and that that could be false information that\u2019s then maintained from interview to interview. And because I didn\u2019t have that first interview, again, I can\u2019t say, \u201cHere are the original things and here\u2019s how they were carried through.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-19\">Q. Sure. Would it be important to you, for example, to talk to the person who conducted that first interview and determine the types of questions [which] were asked?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-20\">A. No, because they are reconstructing how an interview should be asked and what should \u2014 and I believe most interviewers would know enough [to know that] you shouldn\u2019t ask leading questions, you should ask open-ended questions, but\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-21\">Q. So you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-22\">A. \u2014what actually happened is, we don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-23\">Q. So, in other words, you wouldn\u2019t believe the person if that person told you that, \u201cGee, I asked non-leading questions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-24\">A As a memory expert, years down the road I don\u2019t know that they are going to reconstruct correctly because they\u2019ve interviewed other people since then, and they don\u2019t have documentation from how that interview\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-25\">Q. So you just chose, instead, just to ignore the whole thing, not even inquire as to how that interview is conducted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>A. I would look at it, but I would know that there are going to be memory errors incorporated because it wasn\u2019t conducted\u2014 correctly done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-4\">Q. And that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t read the police report, that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t contact the person or persons who conducted these interviews. Because you assumed there would be errors in how they would report to you how they conducted the interview?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxE\">A. Legally and ethically, I never contact the people that conduct the interview.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\">Q. So you got a list of names of people who conducted interviews with [the victim], you didn\u2019t speak with those people; all you have is names?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">A. Out of less\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-7\">Q. So you know the number of interviews, and a list of the people who conducted the interviews, and that\u2019s it? With regard to the fact of the \u2014 this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-8\">A. That is correct, and then personal communication with defense counsel as far as other facts of the case and what was contained in those other things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-9\">Q. So you don\u2019t know, then, whether there was any source misattribution error at all in this case, do you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-10\">A. I don\u2019t think anyone can say that there was and I don\u2019t think anyone can say that there was not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-11\">Q. Okay. Understand. But you have no basis at all to state that that error that you identified is, in fact, an issue in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqAa\">A. If a forensic interviewer is not careful enough to record the testimony\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-12\">Q. I understand that, but you don\u2019t know that. You don\u2019t know that\u2019s so, in this case, you don\u2019t know if source attribution error is, in fact, an issue in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5V\">A. That we never could know whether it is or isn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-13\">Defense counsel did not object during the military judge\u2019s examination of Dr. Huffman. However, outside the presence of the members he argued that the tone of the questioning might have led the members to think negatively about Dr. Huffman\u2019s preparation for trial or to believe that the military judge did not think highly of Dr. Huffman or feel that her opinion was valid. Defense counsel described the questioning as harsh and combative and broached the possibility of submitting a proposed instruction that specifically addressed the exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-15\">Although the military judge denied that his questioning was harsh and combative, he referenced a generic instruction that he intended to give requiring the members to disregard any of his comments or questions that they thought expressed an opinion about the credibility of a witness or about any issue in the case. The matter of a unique instruction on the nature of the questioning was not raised again and the generic instruction was given with the final instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-16\">On appeal, Foster describes the military judge\u2019s questioning of Dr. Huffman as \u201chostile,\u201d \u201ccombative\u201d and \u201cscathing\u201d and contends that the military judge improperly took on the tone and tenor of a prosecutor. The Government argues that the military judge was acting to ensure that the members had the information they required to assess the nature and value of Dr. Huffman\u2019s testimony. Noting that the defense did not object to the questioning at trial, the Government also argues that the military judge diminished the potential for bias through two curative instructions: one of which addressed the proper use of expert testimony and the other which directed the members to ignore any statements reflecting any personal opinion or bias by the military judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-17\">A military judge \u201ccan and sometimes must ask questions in order to clear up uncertainties in the evidence or to develop the facts further.\u201d <em>Ramos, </em>42 M.J. at 396. Because \u201cjurors are ever watchful of the words that fall from him,\u201d however, \u201ca military judge must be circumspect in what he says to the parties and in how he examines witnesses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and quotation marks omitted). In this regard, the tenor used by the military judge in questioning Dr. Huffman generates concern. Military judges should take care to elicit information in a neutral manner and to avoid the kind of approach reflected in this record that so closely resembles the tenor of cross-examination. <em>See United States v. Clower, </em>23 C.M.A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>15, 18, 48 C.M.R. 307, 310 (1974). Nevertheless, judging from the standpoint of a reasonable observer, we have no difficulty concluding that \u201ctaken as a whole in the context of this trial,\u201d this limited exchange cast no doubt upon the court-martial\u2019s legality, fairness, and impartiality. <em>Ramos, </em>42 M.J. at 396 (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">3. <em>The expert witness instruction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Foster argues that the military judge\u2019s expert witness instruction failed to identify Dr. Huffman as an \u201cexpert\u201d and also failed to accurately summarize her testimony. From the trial\u2019s outset, the military judge informed both counsel that he would not refer to any of the expert witnesses as \u201cexperts.\u201d He explained that he \u201c[did not] like to use the word \u2018expert\u2019 \u201d because he thought \u201cthat puts kind of an imprimatur on the weight to be given to their testimony.\u201d There was no objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">The military judge later gave instructions to the members that described the testimony of the defense\u2019s two experts, Dr. Huffman, a developmental research psychologist, and Lieutenant Commander Steven A. Talmadge Jr., a forensic psychologist, as \u201ceducational testimony.\u201d The testimony of the Government\u2019s expert witness, Dr. Elizabeth Heidt Kozisek, a clinical psychologist, was described as \u201cspecialized testimony.\u201d As to Dr. Huffman, the instruction, in relevant part, read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-8\">You have also heard the testimony of Dr. Mary Huffman and Lieutenant Commander Steven Talmadge who were allowed to testify in this case because their knowledge, skill, training, education and experience in their respective fields may assist you in understanding the evidence or in determining a fact in issue; however, you are not required to accept their testimony or give it more weight than the testimony of any other witness. You should, however, consider their qualifications in determining the weight you will accord their testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-9\">You will recall that Dr. Huffman did not testify about the nature of the pretrial interviews of [the victim] and [the victim\u2019s brother] that were conducted by various individuals in this ease, nor about the types of questions that were used in conducting those interviews. Dr. Huffman did testify that because the videotape recording of a forensic interview of [the victim] by Special Agent Dillard had a blank audio track she was unable to perform an assessment of the types of questions asked during that interview. However, she did provide general information that suggestibility can cause memory errors, that every child is different in this regard with some children being more susceptible to suggestion than others, that age is a factor regarding the degree to which children are susceptible to suggestion, and that the type of questions employed during the interview process is significant in achieving a reliable result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-12\">Dr. Huffman\u2019s testimony was permitted solely for its educational value to provide general information about children\u2019s memory in the courtroom due to repeated interviews and the effects of suggestion on memory to assist you in evaluating the evidence and determining the facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-13\">Using the general educational information supplied by Lieutenant Commander Talmadge and Dr. Huffman, the specific information regarding the clinical evaluations of [the victim and her brother] supplied by Dr. Heidt-Kozisek, your own observations in court, your own experience in dealing with people, and all other factors I mentioned in determining witness credibility, it is your function to determine the credibility of the witnesses, the believability of their testimony and, ultimately, the facts of this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-14\">Before the military judge gave these instructions to the members, both counsel had the opportunity to review the instructions. Defense counsel did not object and in fact agreed that the military judge had summarized the specialized and educational testimony \u201cfairly and accurately.\u201d Government counsel objected to the instructions on several grounds but those objections were over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>ruled by the military judge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Government counsel then requested that the military judge instruct the members that they were not bound by his summaries. The military judge agreed and subsequently amended the Government\u2019s proposed version of that instruction as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-4\">Now, you are not bound by my summary above of the testimony provided by Dr. Heidt-Kozisek, Lieutenant Commander Talmadge and Dr. Huffman. That summary is provided merely to assist you in understanding their testimony. It is not evidence, and it is not intended to be a comprehensive summary of every question asked of these witnesses and their answers to those questions. I again instruct you that you must base the determination of the issues in this case on the evidence as you remember it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Foster argues on appeal that the military judge plainly erred by not giving a more detailed and accurate instruction. While Foster argues that the military judge committed plain error in regard to the expert witness instruction, he does not rely on that alleged error as a basis for reversal in and of itself, but rather as further evidence of the military judge\u2019s partisanship. Under these circumstances we will evaluate the instruction under the test established in <em>Quintanilla </em>for those instances where a military judge\u2019s impartiality is challenged.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See also Acosta, </em>49 M.J. at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Foster does not articulate exactly what the instruction should have said, but his complaint focuses on the military judge\u2019s characterization of Dr. Huffman\u2019s testimony as \u201cgeneral information,\u201d which Foster considers inferior to the military judge\u2019s characterization of the testimony of the Government witness as \u201cspecialized.\u201d Foster asserts that together with the military judge\u2019s examination of Dr. Huffman, the instruction essentially told the members that Dr. Huffman\u2019s testimony was worthless. The Government responds on appeal that the military judge\u2019s instructions were accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">Within certain bounds, military judges can comment upon and summarize evidence admitted in the form of expert witness testimony. Rule for Courts-Martial (R.C.M.) 920(e)(7) states that instructions on findings shall include \u201c[s]uch other explanations, descriptions, or directions as may be necessary and which are properly requested by a party or which the military judge determines, <em>sua sponte, </em>should be given.\u201d In moving beyond benchbook instructions, however, military judges must use caution not to do so in a manner that either places undue emphasis on or minimizes the importance of expert testimony.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Cf United States v. Washington, </em>63 M.J. 418, 425 (C.A.A.F.2006) (\u201cA particular formula is not required in administering an oath or affirmation, although adherence to the benchbook formula will minimize dispute.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-12\">Expert testimony is appropriate where \u201cscientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue____\u201d Military Rules of Evidence (M.R.E.) 702. When an individual testifies under M.R.E. 702, it is precisely because the military judge has found that individual to hold the requisite qualifications of an expert. The members are entitled to be informed of that designation and a military judge must not impose his or her own views to either diminish or enhance that important role. We find that the military judge erred in failing to use the term \u201cexpert\u201d and by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>substituting that term with the terms \u201cspecialized\u201d and \u201ceducational.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Although we find that the military judge erred in this regard, we do not believe that the instructions raise any reasonable doubt about the military judge\u2019s impartiality. <em>See United States v. Cooper, </em>51 M.J. 247, 252 (C.A.A.F.1999). While the military judge\u2019s instructions on expert testimony reflected his personal views as to the value of that testimony, his refusal to use the term \u201cexpert\u201d applied equally to both parties\u2019 witnesses and we are not persuaded that the term \u201ceducational testimony\u201d is critical of Dr. Huffman or prejudicial to Foster\u2019s defense. We conclude that Foster has failed to demonstrate that these unchallenged expert witness instructions affected the trial\u2019s legality, fairness or impartiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">4. <em>Comments made by the military judge outside the members\u2019 presence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Foster argues that comments made by the military judge during an Article 39(a), UCMJ, session further demonstrate his bias against Dr. Huffman. During this hearing, which was held outside the hearing of the members, the military judge made several intemperate statements concerning Dr. Huffman\u2019s experience, ego and the need to control her testimony. While the military judge\u2019s language was inappropriate we do not believe that this personal expression of irritation impacted Foster\u2019s right to a fair trial in light of the fact that the comments were not heard by the court-martial members. <em>See United States v. Reynolds, </em>24 M.J. 261, 264 (C.M.A.1987) (upholding harsh comments used to exercise control over proceedings when given outside the presence of the court members).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">Foster has failed to present sufficient evidence to overcome the strong presumption of a military judge\u2019s impartiality. Although the military judge\u2019s conduct at times departed from judicial propriety, a reasonable observer would conclude that in the context of the whole trial, his actions did not compromise the court-martial\u2019s legality, fairness, or impartiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-12\">\n<em>Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b519-13\">The decision of the United States Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b513-9\">. We granted review of the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-10\">WHETHER THE NAVY-MARINE CORPS COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS ERRED TO THE SUBSTANTIAL PREJUDICE OF APPELLANT WHEN IT RULED THAT THE MILITARY JUDGE DID NOT BECOME A PARTISAN ADVOCATE FOR THE GOVERNMENT, AND THAT THE MILITARY JUDGE\u2019S TREATMENT OF THE DEFENSE EXPERT DID NOT DENY APPELLANT'S RIGHT TO PRESENT A DEFENSE.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b518-7\">. The Government argued: the summary of the Government's expert witness\u2019s testimony should not include a concession that she made in direct examination; Dr. Huffman\u2019s summary should be more specific so that it reflected several particular points that assisted the Government\u2019s case; and finally, the military judge should not use the summaries at all but rather employ the standard expert testimony instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b518-8\">. \"When a military judge\u2019s impartiality is challenged on appeal, the test is whether, taken as a whole in the context of [the] trial, [the] court-martial's legality, fairness, and impartiality were put into doubt by the military judge's actions.\u201d <em>United States v.
