We hold that Appellant has not rebutted the presumption that the order was lawful. In particular, Appellant has not demonstrated that the order relied improperly upon interpretations by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the long-standing approved license to administer this specific Vaccine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">Appellant\u2019s Battalion Commander issued a direct order to Appellant on August 24, 2000, in the presence of the sergeant major, the company commander, and the first sergeant, to receive the anthrax vaccination by the close of business that day. Due to the limited availability of the Vaccine at Fort Bragg at the time, there was difficulty locating a clinic where Appellant would be able to receive the inoculation. A clinic with the Vaccine was not located until after 1600 hours on August 24, 2000. Because it would have been difficult to transport Appellant to the clinic in time to receive the shot prior to the termination of routine clinic hours, the battalion commander and the company commander extended the time for Appellant to comply with the order to August 25, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-15\">On the morning of August 25, 2000, the company commander issued Appellant a written counseling statement reiterating the battalion commander\u2019s order to receive the anthrax vaccination prior to 1700 hours on August 25, 2000. Appellant signed this statement thereby acknowledging his understanding of the order. At the time of the counseling statement, Appellant was told that the Vaccine was available and that the company commander was willing and able to take Appellant to the clinic to receive the Vaccine.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-16\">Appellant refused to receive the Vaccine and was charged with willfully disobeying the lawful order of a superior commissioned officer in violation of Article 90, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 890. Contrary to his pleas, Appellant was convicted of this offense (with the date August 25, 2000, substituted for August 24, 2000). The military judge sentenced Appellant to be reduced to pay grade E-l, confined for thirty days and to be discharged from the service with a bad-conduct discharge. The convening authority approved the sentence as adjudged. The United States Army Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the findings and sentence as approved.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-17\">This Court granted review of the following issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b231-18\">WHETHER THE ORDER THAT APPELLANT SUBMIT TO AN ANTHRAX VACCINATION ON AUGUST 24, 2000, WAS A LAWFUL ORDER UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES AT THAT TIME.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-19\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b231-20\">Long ago this Court recognized the foundational principle of military discipline: \u201cFundamental to an effective armed force is the obligation of obedience to lawful orders.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>Reflecting the authority of this principle, an order is presumed to be lawful, and a subordinate disobeys an order at his own peril.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, a servicemember may challenge the lawfulness of an order at the time it is given or in later disciplinary proceedings.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">This Court has outlined the essential attributes of a lawful order that sustain the presumption of lawfulness to include: \u201c(1) issuance by competent authority -a person authorized by applicable law to give such an order; (2) communication of words that express a specific mandate to do or not do a specific act; and (3) relationship of the mandate to a military duty.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In light of the presumption of lawfulness, long-standing principles of military justice place the burden of rebutting this presumption on the accused.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-14\">In this case, Appellant is attempting to overcome this presumption of the lawfulness of the order to receive the Vaccine. Appellant\u2019s assertion that the order was unlawful has two components. First, Appellant claims that the Vaccine is an investigational new drug or a drug unapproved for its applied use as a vaccine against inhalation anthrax. Second, Appellant claims that the order to receive this investigational new drug violated federal law and was therefore unlawful.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-15\">We conclude that Appellant\u2019s argument fails with regard to both components and address them in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>APPELLANT\u2019S ASSERTION THAT THE VACCINE WAS AN INVESTIGA-TIONAL NEW DRUG OR DRUG UNAPPROVED FOR ITS APPLIED USE</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">To support his argument, Appellant made several allegations regarding the status of the Vaccine. Appellant first asserts that the Food and Drug Administration initiated an investigation into the Vaccine but never issued a final rule approving use of the Vaccine to protect against inhalation anthrax. Second, Appellant asserts that the Vaccine\u2019s manufacturer, working in conjunction with the Department of Defense (DoD), filed an investigational new drug application in 1996.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> According to Appellant, this application proposed to conduct investigations that would support specifically adding \u201cinhalation anthrax\u201d to the Vaccine label.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Appellant also asserts that the Vaccine was and is an investigational new drug unapproved for its applied use \u2014 to protect against inhalation anthrax. In support of this argument, Appellant relies on two successive and related federal district court opinions that issued first a temporary and then a permanent injunction preventing the DoD from subjecting military personnel to involuntary anthrax vaccinations absent informed consent or a presidential waiver.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">The federal district court\u2019s evaluation of the civil remedies differs from our evaluation of the criminal charges that arise in the military context of Appellant\u2019s willful disobedience of a presumed lawful order. The linchpin of this case is the presumed legality of the military order to receive the Vaccine. The district court opinions neither recognize nor address this critical presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">Additionally, on appeal from this decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit noted that the parties \u201cstill dispute whether [the Vaccinej\u2019s original 1970 license takes it outside the definition of a \u2018drug unapproved for its applied use\u2019 within the meaning of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1107(g)(2).\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In noting this disagreement of the parties, the court expressly declined to resolve that issue because it would have no impact on the litigants in the case. Moreover, the D.C. Circuit highlighted that the injunction issued by the district court in 2004, by its own terms, remained in effect until the FDA classified the Vaccine as safe and effective for its intended use. The D.C. Circuit also noted that after the district court issued the permanent injunction, the FDA issued a classification on December 19, 2005.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Therefore, once this classification was issued, the injunction was dissolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-12\">As stated above, there is a presumption that orders are lawful.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Under this presumption, the servicemember challenging the order bears the burden of demonstrating the illegality. Where, as here, we are faced with an order based upon a rule promulgated by an agency outside the normal purview of our Court, we should treat the agency\u2019s administrative determinations with considerable deference.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Given this degree of deference to the determinations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>the FDA, the burden on the servicemember challenging the rule is particularly high.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">The National Institutes of Health (NIH) licensed the Vaccine for use against anthrax in 1970.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In 1972, the authority to license biological drugs shifted to the FDA.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The licenses for drugs approved by the NIH remained effective unless and until the FDA actively decided to suspend or revoke the license.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Vaccine\u2019s license has never been suspended or revoked. Additionally, Appellant has not shown that the license was erroneously granted. He has, therefore, not overcome the presumption that the order to receive the Vaccine was lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">In 1973 the FDA established a two-stage process for reviewing biological products licensed prior to July 1, 1972.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This two-stage process was composed of an advisory review panel, and a request for \u201cdata and views.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">In accordance with this review, the FDA directed an independent panel of nongovernmental scientists and medical personnel to review the safety and labeling of biological products that had been licensed prior to July 1, 1972.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> According to 21 C.F.R. 601.25, the panel was: \u201c(1) to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of biological products for which a license has been issued ... (2) to review the labeling of such biological products, and (3) to advise [the FDA Commissioner] on which of the biological products under review are safe, effective, and not misbranded.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-14\">The Vaccine was included in this review of all biological products licensed prior to July 1972. The expert panel recommended that the Vaccine, originally licensed in 1970, be classified as a Category I product.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> This classification indicates that the Vaccine was safe and effective as labeled. The panel recommended that the Vaccine continue to be licensed on the basis of the evidence of its safety and effectiveness.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-15\">As required by 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 601.25, the proposed rule required public comment, and the FDA received four total comments, none of which addressed the Vaccine.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-16\">In 1996, the Vaccine\u2019s manufacturer submitted an investigational new drug application to the FDA.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The application identified three areas in which the current anthrax license could be modified: (1) the labeling of the Vaccine, (2) the administration method, and (3) the dosage.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> It is important to note that this application is limited to the three listed purposes and had no effect on the original license of the Vaccine or its subsequent recognition as safe and effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-17\">The licensing history reflects that the Vaccine has been licensed as approved for anthrax inoculation since 1970<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> without interruption, revocation, or suspension. More<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>over, the agency approval has been reaffirmed as recently as December 19, 2005.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Therefore, based on the high degree of deference we give to the FDA determination that served as the basis for the order, and in light of Appellant\u2019s failure to demonstrate that the 1970 license was incorrect, modified, or withdrawn, we conclude that Appellant has not carried his burden of demonstrating that the FDA\u2019s classification was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Because Appellant has not established that the Vaccine is an investigational new drug or a drug unapproved for its applied use, the notice requirements of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1107,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> are not implicated by the order to receive the Vaccine. Additionally, Exec. Order 13,139, directing that DoD obtain informed consent from each individual to whom an investigational new drug is to be administered unless the Secretary of Defense can justify a need for a waiver of informed consent from the President,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> is not implicated by the order to receive the Vaccine.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">Therefore, we conclude that the Vaccine is not an investigational drug that would implicate 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1107 or Exec. Order 13,139. Accordingly, Appellant has failed to overcome the presumption of the lawfulness of the orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">III.
