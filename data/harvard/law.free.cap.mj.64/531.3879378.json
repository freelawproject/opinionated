The members sentenced appellant to a dishonorable discharge, confinement for three years, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and reduction to Private El, and the convening authority approved the adjudged sentence. This case is before the court for review under Article 66, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">Appellant claims, <em>inter alia, </em>that the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the findings of guilty of willful dereliction of duty for engaging in sex offenses while he was supposed to be moving or accounting for supplies \u201cin a timely manner\u201d (Specifications 1 and 2 of Charge I) and indecent acts with another (Specification 1 of Charge III). These claims warrant discussion but do not merit relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">The charged offenses stem from appellant\u2019s on-duty sexual activities with a high school student. At the time of the offenses, appellant was a twenty-four-year-old supply technician for the Specializations Program in the Medical Division of the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), an element of the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command at Fort Detrick, Maryland. Appellant\u2019s unit was beginning a renovation project which required moving a large quantity of medical supplies and old equipment from the supply room to either a new warehouse or the USAMRIID basement in order to convert a supply area into office space. According to Major (MAJ) MorrisMagee, chief nurse of the medical division, the task was \u201can ongoing project, because it was extremely large.\u201d In describing appellant\u2019s duties, MAJ Morris-Magee testified that she tasked appellant to assist with removal and relocation of the medical supplies, and \u201cexpected [appellant] to take items to point A and point B, and to return in a timely manner.\u201d When asked whether appellant would have additional tasks upon the completion of an assigned task, MAJ Morris-Magee said, \u2018Yes, we always have something to do.\u201d In addition to the tasks MAJ Morris-Magee assigned to appellant, Sergeant (SGT) Summerville, a wardmaster in appellant\u2019s duty section, testified that he frequently tasked appellant to account for supplies even though SGT Summerville did not directly supervise appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-13\">Appellant\u2019s victim, CC, was sixteen years old at the time of appellant\u2019s offenses. She sought a job as a \u201csummer hire\u201d after her mother, who worked at Fort Detrick, brought her some information about the available opportunities. Major Morris-Ma-gee hired CC to perform \u201clittle odd-and-end jobs in the ward\u201d and to assist with the renovation project as needed. After briefly meeting appellant her first day at work, CC began establishing a working relationship with appellant when \u201cMajor Magee assigned [her] the job to clean out the kitchen area, and [appellant] helped [her] take the kitchen articles to the warehouse.\u201d After completing this project, appellant and CC continued working together on tasks MAJ Morris-Ma-gee assigned. They also communicated electronically after appellant established a Yahoo! instant message account on the computer CC used. Among other topics discussed with appellant, CC told him that she was in high school. Appellant discussed sexuality in his face-to-face and electronic conversations with CC. While CC admitted at trial she was flirtatious with appellant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>she specifically told him \u201cjust because you\u2019re flirtatious doesn\u2019t mean you want to have sex.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">More than one month after CC began her summer job with appellant\u2019s unit, CC and appellant worked on a project that required them to make several trips from an office to a warehouse that several units shared to store equipment. On two occasions, appellant kissed CC while inside the warehouse. On the final trip to the warehouse, CC testified that appellant not only kissed her but \u201che kept shoving [her] hand down towards his pants ____ Then he took out his penis, and he placed [her] hand around his penis and started ejaculating [sic].\u201d Appellant continued to Mss CC, then he put his hand in her pants and inserted his finger into her vagina. CC testified that she did not tell appellant to stop because she was confused and seared and did not know what to do. She said appellant stopped when he thought he heard someone at the warehouse door.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">Later the same day, SGT Summerville instructed appellant to go to the USAMRIID basement, locate certain items of medical equipment, and report their location to him. Sergeant Summerville testified he told appellant to \u201caccount for it \u2014 it wasn\u2019t urgent, \u2018but get to it as soon as you can and just get back with me.\u2019 \u201d According to CC, after appellant received these instructions, he told her he had to go to the basement to find two items for SGT Summerville. She testified she went with appellant to help look for the items, but neither of them could find the equipment. CC further testified she sat on a couch and waited while appellant continued to look for the items. After appellant\u2019s search proved fruitless, CC told appellant they needed to go and turned toward the door to leave. Appellant then approached her from behind, turned her around, Mssed her, and engaged in forcible sodomy with her. CC related these events as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgC\">[W]e started kind of drifting \u2014 like when you slow-dance \u2014 he was drifting me backwards. Next \u2014 after we were drifting, there was a table. I couldn\u2019t see the table, my back was to it. He kind of glided me down on the table and then started \u2014 we were still Mssing, and then he pulled my pants down, and then I said, \u201cWhat are you doing,\u201d and he didn\u2019t say anytWng, he just looked at me. Then he pulled my underwear down, and I said, \u201cWhat are you doing,\u201d and he still didn\u2019t say anything. Then he Mnd of lifted my legs up, and that\u2019s when he placed \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it was before he placed Ms penis in my anus or after, but then I asked him if he had a condom. He shook his head ---- After it started going on for a little while, then I started to feel some pain, and I said, \u201cThat hurts. Stop, that hurts.\u201d Then he slowed down for a little while. After that, he started back up and I just turned over to the side.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-13\">CC testified she was \u201cin disbelief\u201d about what was transpiring during the sodomy and was \u201creally scared.\u201d She said she was not aware that appellant planned to msert Ms penis into her anus and did not consent to this activity. She also said even though she told appellant he was hurting her and asked him to stop, appellant did not stop until \u201cMs head turned toward the door like he\u2019d heard something, and that\u2019s when he stopped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-14\">Subsequently, agents from the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command (CID) questioned appellant about Ms activities with CC and appellant provided two sworn statements. In the first statement, appellant deMed placmg his finger m the victim\u2019s vagina. He also deMed that he placed her hand on Ms penis and moved her hand to begm her masturbating him. TMs sworn statement m-eluded the followmg exchange between the questioning agent and appellant regarding the sex offenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-15\">Q. Why did you do tMs at work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-16\">A. I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-17\">Q. Did you know that it is wrong to engage in this type of activity at work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-18\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-19\">The agents did not ask further questions to ascertain or clarify why appellant believed his activity in the workplace was wrongful. In the second sworn statement to CID, made nineteen days after the first, appellant admitted facts contradictmg Ms prior sworn deMals regarding the indecent acts offense and said: \u201cI then [unbuttoned] my 2nd and 3rd <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>pants buttons exposing my penis. I then placed her hand on my penis and guided her to manually masturbate me. After she started doing this on her own, I then placed my hand down her pants and put my finger into her vagina.\u201d Both sworn statements were admitted at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">At the conclusion of the case on the merits, the military judge provided standard instructions to the members, including advising them of the elements of the offense of willful dereliction of duty. When afforded the opportunity to do so, neither party requested or proposed an instruction defining the phrase \u201cin a timely manner,\u201d as alleged in the specifications; the military judge did not provide one sua sponte.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Law</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Article 66(e), UCMJ, imposes on this court the duty to affirm only those findings of guilty we find correct in law and fact. Therefore, we must conduct an independent, de novo review of the legal and factual sufficiency of the entire record of trial. <em>United States v. Washington, </em>57 M.J. 394, 399 (C.A.A.F.2002). The test for legal sufficiency is whether, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, a rational fact-finder could have found all the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Brooks, </em>60 M.J. 495, 497 (C.A.A.F.2005); <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-19, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). When applying this test, we are bound to draw every reasonable inference from the record in favor of the prosecution. <em>United States v. Blocker, </em>32 M.J. 281, 284 (C.M.A.1991) (citing <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781; <em>United States v. Laboy, </em>909 F.2d 581, 588 (1st Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Hart, </em>25 M.J. 143 (C.M.A.1987), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>488 U.S. 830, 109 S.Ct. 85, 102 L.Ed.2d 61 (1988)). In a factual sufficiency review, however, we do not show such deference to the lower court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">The test for factual sufficiency is whether, after weighing the evidence of record and making allowances for not having personally observed the witnesses, we are convinced of appellant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Turner, </em>25 M.J. 324, 325 (C.M.A.1987). \u201cIn sum, to sustain appellant\u2019s conviction, we must find that the government has proven all essential elements and, taken together as a whole, the parcels of proof credibly and coherently demonstrate that appellant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Gilchrist, </em>61 M.J. 785, 793 (Army Ct.Crim.App.2005) (citing <em>United States v. Roukis, </em>60 M.J. 925, 930 (Army Ct.Crim.App.), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>62 M.J. 212 (C.A.A.F.2005) (summary disposition)).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-12\">Specifications 1 and 2 of Charge I allege that appellant was willfully derelict in his duties<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in violation of Article 92(3), UCMJ. That provision states: \u201cAny person subject to this chapter who ... is derelict in the performance of his duties; shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.\u201d Willful dereliction of duty requires proof of three elements: (1) that the accused had certain duties; (2) that the accused knew of the duties; and (3) that the accused was willfully derelict in the performance of those duties. <em>Manual for Courts-Martial, United States </em>(2002 ed.) [hereinafter <em>MCM], </em>Part IV, para. 16b(3). \u201cWillfully\u2019 means intentionally. It refers to the doing of an act knowingly and purposely, specifically intending the natural and probable consequences of the act.\u201d <em>MCM, </em>Part IV, para. 16e(3)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-13\">Specification 1 of Charge III alleges that appellant committed an indecent act in violation of Article 134, UCMJ. The <em>MCM </em>provides the following elements for the offense of indecent acts with another:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-14\">(1) That the accused committed a certain wrongful act with a certain person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-15\">(2) That the act was indecent; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-16\">(3) That, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>armed forces or was of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-5\"><em>MCM, </em>Part IV, para. 90b.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">\n<em>Dereliction of duty</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">The government charged appellant with two specifications of willful dereliction of duty for departing from his duties to engage in the indecent act and forcible sodomy offenses. The first dereliction specification alleges, in pertinent part, that appellant \u201cwillfully failed to <em>conduct </em>the inventory <em>in a timely manner </em>as it was his duty to do and instead engaged in sexual activity with [CC], a sixteen year old student intern, while on duty, in uniform, and in a government facility.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Similarly, the second specification alleges appellant \u201cwillfully failed to <em>move </em>supplies <em>in a timely manner </em>as it was his duty to do and instead engaged in sexual activity with [CC] while on duty, in uniform, and in a government facility.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Appellant\u2019s challenges focus our attention on the emphasized portions of the specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">The first and second elements of proof for the dereliction offenses are not disputed. Sergeant Summerville gave appellant duties to conduct an inventory, MAJ Morris-Magee directed him to move supplies, and appellant knew of these duties. The issue in this ease concerns the third element: whether appellant was willfully derelict in the performance of those duties. Resolution of this question turns on our determination of: (1) what the object of a \u201cwillful act\u201d must be in order to sustain a conviction for dereliction of duty; (2) and our interpretation of the meaning of the phrase \u201cin a timely manner\u201d as alleged in both specifications. In particular, we must decide whether the phrase \u201cin a timely manner\u201d in this context simply means completing a mission or task by a specified time or also refers to a method and process of proper performance of duty without unauthorized delay. The parties, predictably, take dramatically opposing views concerning the requisite willfulness of the acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-12\">At trial, the defense theory was that appellant was not derelict in his duties during the times he committed the sex offenses because he eventually completed the assigned tasks. Appellate defense counsel expanded on this position in argument before this court, urging that the willfulness required for conviction refers to action by appellant \u201cspecifically intending the natural and probable consequences of the act,\u201d and that appellant must have intended to cause the mission to fail to be guilty of this offense. In support of their theory, counsel offered SGT Summerville\u2019s opinion that the inventory task was <em>completed </em>on time<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and MAJ Morris-Magee\u2019s statement that the <em>overall renovation project </em>was <em>completed </em>on time a month later<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as evidence barring the convictions for dereliction of duty. Counsel further argued the estimated seven to ten minutes appellant stopped performing his duties to engage in each of the charged sex offenses is <em>\u201cde minimis </em>and cannot support the dereliction convictions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AAm\">The government argued before this court that neither specification alleges appellant failed to <em>complete </em>the tasks assigned; rather, the specifications charge willful derelictions for <em>how </em>appellant performed the tasks. The government asserted the willfulness required for a conviction is the deliberate performance of an unauthorized act inconsistent with the performance of duty, regardless of its duration or ultimate consequence on mission completion. That is, when appellant committed intentional acts of sexual misconduct while the assigned missions were in progress, he willfully committed acts \u201cspecifically intending the natural and probable consequences of the act(s)\u201d to be intentional, unauthorized suspended performance and departure from his assigned duties. The government advanced the theory that appellant was willfully derelict in the performance of his duties for the duration of the unauthorized delays. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>find the resolution of the question rests in the plain meaning of the specifications, the law governing response times to orders, and the specific facts of appellant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Had the specifications omitted reference to the timeliness of appellant\u2019s accomplishing his tasks, appellant\u2019s position would be stronger. The specifications, however, allege he failed to perform his duties \u201cin a timely manner.\u201d The inclusion of that language specifically embraced an aspect of appellant\u2019s duties beyond the mere accomplishment of the assigned tasks. The <em>MCM </em>explains \u201cderelict\u201d as follows: \u201cA person is derelict in the performance of duties when that person willfully ... fails to perform that person\u2019s duties or when that person performs them in a culpably inefficient manner.\u201d Part IV, para. 16(e)(3)(C). Willful departures from standards of conduct established in nonpunitive regulations can constitute willful derelictions of duty. <em>United States v. Green, </em>58 M.J. 855, 859 (Army Ct.Crim.App.), <em>pet. denied, </em>59 M.J. 141 (C.A.A.F.2003).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The untimely accomplishment of an assigned task is inconsistent with the duty to accomplish that task. We turn now to the question of whether appellant\u2019s discharge of his duties was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Whether appellant acted \u201cin a timely manner\u201d must be considered in light of the facts of the case. \u201cManner\u201d is defined as \u201c[a] way of doing, being done, or happening.\u201d The Random House College Dictionary, Revised Edition 814 (1982 ed.). In deciding whether appellant\u2019s performance of military tasks was \u201ctimely,\u201d defined as \u201coccurring at a suitable time,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1376, the law regarding time for compliance in the analogous offense of failure to obey a lawful order is helpful. \u201cThe dispositive rule ... is that immediate compliance is required by any order which does not explicitly or implicitly indicate that delayed compliance is authorized or directed.\u201d <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>17 M.J. 1032, 1033 (A.C.M.R.) (citing <em>United States v. McLaughlin, </em>14 M.J. 908 (N.M.C.M.R.1982)), <em>pet. denied, </em>19 M.J. 79 (C.M.A.1984). Immediate initiation of compliance by itself does not satisfy this rule; it is axiomatic that continued, diligent compliance is required. Even in cases where an order arguably authorizes delay, one should consider the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the delay when determining whether appellant complied with the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">In the instant case, appellant deviated from assigned military tasks to commit sex offenses in the work place. At argument, appellant contended the delays were reasonable because they were of short duration, lasting only seven to ten minutes each. We decline to stretch military jurisprudence to such an extent. \u201c[T]he punitive article of dereliction of duty holds a service-member accountable for the nonperformance or faulty performance of duty <em>regardless of its demonstrated effect on a particular military mission.\u201d United States v. Lawson, </em>36 M.J. 415, 422 (C.M.A.1993) (emphasis added). We hold that when examining whether a departure from duty that is not expressly authorized can be the basis of a dereliction charge, one must consider both the basis of the departure and the duration of time devoted to it. Where the basis of the departure is inherently unreasonable, such as the forsaking of one\u2019s military duties to commit a crime, even the briefest detours can constitute derelictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">It is well established that \u201c[a]n act of a servant is not within the scope of employment if it is done with no intention to perform it as part of or incident to a service on account of which he is employed.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 235 (1958). Appellant\u2019s behavior was \u201cmotivated solely by individual desires and serves no purpose of the employer.\u201d <em>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, </em>524 U.S. 775, 794, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>L.Ed.2d 662 (1998) (explaining \u201cfrolic and detour\u201d analysis in vicarious liability for sexual harassment cases). We expressly reject the notion that appellant\u2019s on-duty sex offenses could be considered reasonable delays in the performance of assigned tasks. We find delay in discharging duties in order to engage in felony sex offenses with a civilian Army employee during duty hours and in the military workplace \u2014 especially when the employee is only sixteen years old \u2014 to be patently unreasonable. If we were to categorize activities into those implicitly authorized given the circumstances of an order and those unauthorized under any circumstance, appellant\u2019s on-duty sex offenses with a teenager are at the furthest extreme of the latter category. Appellant\u2019s conduct clearly violates \u201cthe punitive article specifically intended by Congress to ensure the <em>proper </em>performance of duty within the military service.\u201d <em>Lawson, </em>36 M.J. at 422 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">We find appellant abandoned his duties for the time required to engage in the sex offenses. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, we find the court members had ample evidence before them to reasonably conclude the accused was derelict in his duties as alleged. To hold otherwise would reward efficient criminal offenders who intentionally and improperly abandon their duties to violate the law, but are still able to arguably complete their assigned tasks before the time for completion has passed. Sanctioning such conduct would be antithetical to the most basic principles of military service. By appellant\u2019s admission in his sworn statement admitted at trial, he knew departing from the assigned mission to engage in sexual activity in the workplace was wrongful. We agree. <em>Green </em>and <em>Lawson </em>clearly indicate that Congress intended to regulate <em>how </em>soldiers perform their duties. We are satisfied the evidence presented at trial is legally and factually sufficient to establish that appellant\u2019s complete abandonment of his assigned duties in order to eommit criminal acts, however brief in duration, was a willful dereliction of those duties on both charged occasions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">\n<em>Indecent Acts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">Appellant asserts that his digital penetration and fondling of the high school student\u2019s vagina in the shared government warehouse was not indecent under the circumstances. Appellant urges that his act was not sufficiently open and notorious because the door may have been locked and he was in the warehouse with what may have been the only warehouse key. We reject appellant\u2019s assertion. \u201cThe determination of whether an act is indecent requires examination of all the circumstances, including the age of the victim, the nature of the request, <em>the relationship of the parties, </em>and <em>the location </em>of the intended act.\u201d <em>United States v. Rollins, </em>61 M.J. 338, 344 (C.A.A.F.2005) (citing <em>United States v. Brinson, </em>49 M.J. 360, 364 (C.A.A.F.1998)) (emphasis added). In Rollins,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> our superior court held, \u201cThe military has a <em>legitimate interest in deterring and punishing sexual exploitation of young persons by members of the armed forces </em>because such conduct can be prejudicial to good order and discipline, service discrediting, or both.\u201d <em>Rollins, </em>61 M.J. at 345 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">Under the facts of this ease, appellant\u2019s acts were sufficiently open and notorious. He committed the indecent acts during duty hours, in uniform, in a government warehouse shared by multiple units on a military installation. We are skeptical that appellant believed that he had exclusive access to the warehouse. The evidence was in conflict on warehouse access, and appellant stopped his sexual activity at one point when he thought he heard someone entering or attempting to enter the warehouse. Under these circumstances, the evidence is legally and factually sufficient to establish that appellant\u2019s sexual activity with CC was open <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>and notorious. <em>See United States v. Izquierdo, </em>51 M.J. 421, 423 (C.A.A.F.1999) (pinning up a sheet to obscure roommates\u2019 view of sexual activity in barracks room does not negate open and notorious character of conduct). In addition, appellant\u2019s victim was a sixteen-year-old civilian employee working in his duty section at the time of the offenses. The proof in this case establishes the indecency of appellant\u2019s actions under a variety of theories. Thus, it is legally and factually sufficient to establish that appellant committed \u201can indecent act by placing his finger inside [CC\u2019s] vagina while in the basement of ... a warehouse belonging to\u201d the United States Army.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">The remaining assignments of error and the matter raised personally by appellant under <em>United States v. Grostefon, </em>12 M.J. 431 (C.M.A.1982), are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">The findings of guilty are affirmed. The court affirms only so much of the sentence as provides for a dishonorable discharge, confinement for three years, forfeiture of $220.00 per month for thirty-six months,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and reduction to Private El. All rights, privileges, and property, of which appellant has been deprived by virtue of that portion of his sentence set aside by this decision, are ordered restored. <em>See </em>UCMJ arts. 58b(c) and 75(a), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 858b(c) and 875(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">Senior Judge BARTO <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and Judge MAHER concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b710-10\">. An accused may also be punished for the lesser included offense of negligent dereliction of duty if he \u201creasonably should have known\u201d of a duty and then \u201cthrough neglect or culpable inefficiency\u201d was derelict in performance of the duty. Based on the parties' asserted positions at trial that negligent dereliction of duty was not in issue, the military judge did not instruct on that lesser included offense. <em>See </em>Rule for Courts-Martial [hereinafter R.C.M.] 920(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b711-10\">. On cross-examination, SGT Summerville agreed with trial defense counsel that he did not place a specific suspense on completion of the task and opined that the task he assigned to appellant had therefore been completed on time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b711-13\">. Major Morris-Magee agreed, on cross-examination, that the supply-moving project did not have an exact completion date and the unit accomplished the overall office renovation project in a timely manner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b712-6\">. <em>Green </em>characterized derelictions as \" \u2018actions inconsistent with [a] duty,\u2019\" quoting <em>United States v. Shavrnoch, </em>49 M.J. 334, 337 (C.A.A.F.1998). Cadet Green pled guilty to violating a lawful general regulation at the United States Military Academy by possessing drug paraphernalia. The court found the plea improvident because the regulation prohibiting such possession was nonpunitive, but held Cadet Green\u2019s violation of the regulatory duty constituted a willful dereliction. This approach is consistent with our superior court\u2019s analysis of nonperformance-of-duty derelictions in <em>United States v. Lawson, </em>36 M.J. 415, 421 n. 7 (C.M.A.1993) (defining \"derelict\u201d as \"one guilty of neglect of duty\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b713-6\">. Our holding should not be interpreted as encouraging the practice of charging a dereliction of duty every time a soldier commits an offense while on duty. In certain circumstances, such charging could constitute an unreasonable multiplication of charges. <em>See </em>R.C.M. 307(c)(4). We have considered the factors from <em>United States v. Quiroz, </em>55 M.J. 334 (C.A.A.F.2001), and conclude that such is not the case here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b713-13\">. Rollins provided pornography to an eighteen-year-old male and then proposed they masturbate together in a public parking lot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b714-5\">. The convening authority attempted to grant financial relief to appellant\u2019s dependents. It appears that some or all of that act of clemency may not have been effective. The convening authority approved a waiver of the mandatory or \"automatic\" forfeitures triggered by appellant\u2019s sentence to confinement with a punitive discharge. <em>See </em>Article 58b, UCMJ. However, he took no action regarding the forfeitures actually imposed as part of the court\u2019s sentence. The staff judge advocate failed to advise the convening authority to disapprove or modify the <em>adjudged </em>forfeitures in order to create the opportunity to waive automatic forfeitures to benefit appellant\u2019s family. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>62 M.J. 31, 37-38 (C.A.A.F.2005). The convening authority frustrated his own intent because he did not alter the adjudged forfeitures, leaving no money to pay the family. Confusion regarding the various forfeiture provisions is not new. The interactions between adjudged and \"automatic\" or \u201cmandatory\u201d forfeitures \"involved technical and complicated relationships between statutory provisions, made all the more difficult by the tension between the convening authority\u2019s broad discretion over the adjudged forfeitures and restricted discretion over mandatory forfeitures.\u201d <em>United States v. Emminizer, </em>56 M.J. 441, 445 (C.A.A.F.2002). We can effect the convening authority\u2019s intent by approving the reduced amount, considering that he specifically intended to waive forfeitures of $930.00 per month for six months. A soldier in the lowest enlisted grade in 2003 would have received $1,150.80 per month in basic pay.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b714-10\"> Senior Judge Barto took final action in this case prior to his reassignment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
