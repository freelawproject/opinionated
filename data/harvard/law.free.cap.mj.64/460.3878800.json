A military judge sitting alone sentenced Appellant to a bad-conduct discharge, confinement for ninety days and reduction to pay grade E-l. The convening authority approved the sentence as adjudged and the United States Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>No. NMCCA 200300312 (N.M.Ct.Crim.App. Jan. 11, 2006). Upon Appellant\u2019s petition, this Court specified the following issue based on matters raised in his unsworn statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-8\">WHETHER THE MILITARY JUDGE ABUSED HIS DISCRETION BY FAILING TO INQUIRE INTO THE EFFECT THAT APPELLANT\u2019S MEDICAL PROBLEMS HAD ON HIS ABILITY TO APPRECIATE THE NATURE AND QUALITY OR THE WRONGFULNESS OF HIS ACTS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">We conclude that the military judge did not err in this regard and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b641-11\">After the findings of guilty were announced, Appellant, with the assistance of counsel, made an unsworn statement for the military judge\u2019s consideration on sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-15\">The part of the statement relevant to the specified issue states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-16\">Sir, on the 20th of November 2001, I was jumped outside of the Waffle Shop out in town and robbed. I was hit in the head repeatedly with a lead pipe. I suffered two skull fractures, bruising and bleeding of the brain. I woke up several days later out of a coma to find out that I am completely deaf in my left ear, and partially blind in my left eye. I was hospitalized for about a month. Upon returning to my unit from the hospital, I went and saw the division psychiatry [sic] and was diagnosed with bi-polar syndrome because of the incident. After that I was denied convalescent leave and only given eight days annual leave for Christmas. I came back, and that\u2019s when I started to get in trouble.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-17\">After Appellant completed his statement, his defense counsel asked him specific questions regarding the injuries he received as a result of the assault:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-18\">DC: And how long did you stay in the Veterans hospital?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-20\">ACC: I was in the Veterans Hospital for 22 days, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-22\">DC: And what \u2014 did they tell you the extent of the injuries?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-24\">ACC: A contusion to the front of the brain which basically means bruising. The back of my brain was bleeding and swelling. I had an inner skull fracture on my left side, and another skull fracture on the back of my head, sir. I completely lost all my hearing in my left ear, and part of my sight in my left eye, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-26\">DC: And do these injuries still effect [sic] you today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-28\">ACC: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-29\">This concluded Appellant\u2019s unsworn statement, and the hearing proceeded to announcement of the sentence. In response to the specified issue Appellant asserts that the findings and sentence should be set aside for the military judge\u2019s failure to inquire further into Appellant\u2019s statement regarding his diagnosis for bipolar disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">\u201cA military judge\u2019s decision to accept a guilty plea is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Eberle, </em>44 M.J. 374, 375 (C.A.A.F.1996) (citing <em>United States v. Gallegos, </em>41 M.J. 446 (C.A.A.F.1995)). \u201cPleas of guilty should not be set aside on appeal unless there is \u2018a \u201csubstantial basis\u201d in law and fact for questioning the guilty plea.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Prater, </em>32 M.J. 433, 436 (C.M.A.1991)). \u201cIf an accused \u2018sets up matter inconsistent with the plea\u2019 at any time during the proceeding, the military judge must either resolve the apparent inconsistency or reject the plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>44 M.J. 496, 498 (C.A.A.F.1996) (quoting Article 45(a), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 845(a) (2000)); Rule for Courts-Martial (R.C.M.) 910(h)(2). \u201cOnce the military judge has accepted a plea as provident and has entered findings based on it, an appellate court will not reverse that finding and reject the plea unless it finds a substantial conflict between the plea and the accused\u2019s statements or other evidence of record.\u201d <em>Garcia, </em>44 M.J. at 498. \u201cA \u2018mere possibility\u2019 of such a conflict is not a sufficient basis to overturn the trial results.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Prater, </em>32 M.J. at 436).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">As in <em>United States v. Phillippe, </em>63 M.J. 307 (C.A.A.F.2006), of last term, we are again called upon to determine whether the military judge\u2019s duty to inquire further has been triggered by disclosures made during, or subsequent to, the plea colloquy. In <em>Phillippe, </em>we held that \u201cwhen, either during the plea inquiry or thereafter, and in the absence of prior disavowals ... circumstances raise a possible defense, a military judge has a duty to inquire further to resolve the apparent inconsistency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 310-11 (citation omitted). The existence of an apparent and complete defense is necessarily inconsistent with a plea of guilty. This was the case in <em>Phillippe, </em>where early termination of the alleged period of unauthorized absence was raised, presenting an apparent ambiguity or inconsistency with the plea thereby warranting further inquiry. <em>Id. </em>at 311; <em>see also United States v. Pinero, </em>60 M.J. 31, 35 (C.A.A.F.2004); <em>United States v. Reeder, </em>22 C.M.A. 11, 12-13, 46 C.M.R. 11, 12-13 (1972). The question in this case is whether Appellant\u2019s reference to his bipolar condition in the plea context \u201cset[] up matter raising a possible defense,\u201d as in <em>Phillippe, </em>or whether it presented only a \u201cmere possibility\u201d of a defense, as in <em>Prater. Phillippe, </em>63 M.J. at 310-11; <em>Prater, </em>32 M.J. at 436-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">On the one hand, the injuries Appellant describes are as graphic as they are unfortunate. One is tempted, without more, to conclude that injuries of this magnitude must surely raise a possible mental responsibility defense. Moreover, in military law, given that lack of mental responsibility is an affirmative defense, mental health issues bear special status. This is reflected in R.C.M. 706 and Military Rule of Evidence (M.R.E.) 302.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This status in part reflects the recognition that combat and other operational conditions may generate or aggravate certain mental health conditions, such as post traumatic stress disorder. As a result, military judges should take particular care to make sure that considerations of mental health do not put the providence of the plea at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">On the other hand, in this case, Appellant\u2019s assertion that his plea was improvident rests entirely on his unsworn statement, in which he states that he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Thus, unlike the circumstance we encountered in <em>United States v. Harris, </em>61 M.J. 391, 392-94 (C.A.A.F.2005), there was no factual record developed during or after the trial substantiating Appellant\u2019s statement or indicating whether and how bipolar disorder may have influenced his plea. Nor did Appellant\u2019s conduct during the plea inquiry raise concerns that might have suggested to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>the military judge that Appellant lacked the capacity to plead. If so, this might have prompted the military judge to inquire into Appellant\u2019s mental responsibility at the time of the offenses. Moreover, Appellant has not asserted, nor does his statement reflect, that he was unable to appreciate the nature and quality or wrongfulness of his acts as a result of a mental disease or defect. Thus, unlike the situation in <em>Phillippe, </em>where the appellant\u2019s statement raised the possibility of a complete defense of early termination to the charged term of absence, Appellant\u2019s statement without more, did not raise an apparent inconsistency with his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">In such a circumstance, the military judge may reasonably rely on both a presumption that the accused is sane<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the long-standing principle that counsel is presumed to be competent. <em>United States v. Cronic, </em>466 U.S. 648, 658, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984); <em>United States v. Scott, </em>24 M.J. 186, 188 (C.M.A.1987). Moreover, the President has assigned the burden of proving lack of mental responsibility to the accused. R.C.M. 916(b). Thus, when the accused is presenting his sentencing statement through or with the assistance of counsel, the military judge may properly presume, in the absence of any indication to the contrary, that counsel has conducted a reasonable investigation into the existence of the defense. This is particularly so when the matter raised does not in and of itself present an apparent or possible defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Appellant points to our decisions in <em>United States v. Martin, </em>56 M.J. 97 (C.A.A.F.2001), and <em>Harris, </em>61 M.J. at 391, for the proposition that \u201c[t]he military judge must have known that a bipolar disorder was a viable defense for Appellant.\u201d However, these cases establish that bipolar disorder, like other disorders, may exist with enough severity to raise a substantial question regarding the issue of the accused\u2019s mental responsibility. However, the disorder does not negate responsibility in all cases. <em>Martin </em>was a contested ease in which the defense was attempting to carry its burden of proving lack of mental responsibility due to the severity of the accused\u2019s bipolar condition. 56 M.J. at 100-01. Two defense psychiatrists testified that Martin\u2019s condition was severe enough that he was unable to appreciate the nature and quality or wrongfulness of his conduct. <em>Id. </em>Conversely, three government psychiatrists testified that Martin could appreciate the wrongfulness of his acts at the time of the offenses. <em>Id. </em>at 101. The question was whether Martin had carried his burden in proving the defense of lack of mental responsibility by clear and convincing evidence, and we concluded that a reasonable jury could have concluded that he did not. <em>Id. </em>at 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">In <em>Harris, </em>a pretrial examination conducted pursuant to R.C.M. 706 concluded that the accused had not suffered from a severe mental defect or disease and that he had been mentally responsible at the time of the offenses. 61 M.J. at 393. He was subsequently convicted in accordance with his pleas. <em>Id. </em>at 392. After the court-martial, and while Harris was serving his sentence to confinement, another mental health expert concluded that Harris had suffered from bipolar disorder, that this was a severe mental disease at the time of the offenses, and that he could not appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 393. The doctor\u2019s concern was documented in the record, and highlighted by Harris\u2019s behavior of polishing his cell with a sock. <em>Id. </em>Thus, in <em>Harris, </em>the military judge was confronted with two conflicting, confirmed, and documented medical conclusions. These conclusions were the subject of a post-trial session pursuant to Article 39(a), UCMJ,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> after which, notwithstanding the conflicting conclusions, the military judge determined that the previous guilty plea had been entered providently. <em>Id. </em>After the post-trial Article 39(a), UCMJ, session, the convening authority ordered yet another examination pursuant to R.C.M. 706. <em>Id. </em>at 394. That psychiatrist concluded that Harris had suffered from a severe mental disease, i.e., bipolar disorder, at the time of the offenses but that he had been able to appreci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>ate the nature and quality or wrongfulness of his conduct. <em>Id. </em>The issue in the case was whether the conflicting post-trial examinations and related medical evidence, which were themselves in conflict with the pretrial examination, supported a petition for a new trial under R.C.M. 1210(f)(2). <em>Id. </em>at 397. We held that they did and granted the petition for a new trial. <em>Id. </em>at 398-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\"><em>Martin </em>and <em>Harris </em>entailed substantially more than a passing reference to a diagnosis of bipolar disorder.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nor, has Appellant to date offered any indication that his disorder raises a substantial question regarding his mental responsibility. As a result, we conclude that Appellant\u2019s reference to his diagnosis of bipolar disorder, without more, at most raised only the \u201cmere possibility\u201d of a conflict with the plea. Whether a conflict has actually arisen or not, it may be prudent for a military judge to conduct further inquiry when a significant mental health condition is raised during the plea inquiry in light of military law and practice regarding mental health issues and to obviate such issues on appeal. Whether further inquiry is required as a matter of law is a contextual determination. In this case, we hold that the military judge did not abuse his discretion in not doing so.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The decision of the United States Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b641-12\">. The convening authority suspended conflnement in excess of sixty days for twelve months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b642-6\">. R.C.M. 706(a) imposes an obligation not only on defense counsel but also on any commander, investigating officer, trial counsel, military judge or member to notify the officer authorized to order a mental exam when \"there is reason to believe that the accused lacked mental responsibility for any offense charged or lacks capacity to stand trial.\u201d M.R.E. 302(a) provides a limited privilege to the accused who participates in an R.C.M. 706 examination even if a rights warning has been provided under Article 31(b), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 831(b) (2000). These two examples distinguish mental responsibility from other affirmative defenses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b643-11\">. \"The accused is presumed to be mentally responsible at the time of the alleged offense.\u201d R.C.M. 916(k)(3)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"A9m\">. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 839(a) (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b644-9\">. Appellant states in his unsworn statement that after the assault, \"that\u2019s when I started to get in trouble.\u201d However, the record reveals, and Appellant concedes, that he received nonjudicial punishment on October 10, 2001, for an unauthorized absence of twenty days. This was obviously before the assault of November 20, 2001, and was evidence the military judge had before him when Appellant made his unsworn statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b644-15\">. Appellant also claims the reference in his unsworn statement to bipolar disorder raised the issue of his mental capacity at the time bf trial. As stated earlier, the record is devoid of any indicator that would have given the military judge reason to believe that Appellant lacked capacity to stand trial. <em>See </em>R.C.M. 706(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b644-7\">EFFRON, Chief Judge, with whom ERDMANN, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A3Q\">joins (dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">Appellant\u2019s assertion that he suffered from bipolar disorder raised an apparent inconsistency with respect to his plea, thereby triggering the military judge\u2019s duty to conduct a further inquiry. <em>United States v. Phillippe, </em>63 M.J. 307, 309-11 (C.A.A.F.2006). The military judge erred in failing to resolve this inconsistency. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-12\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AIM\">A. The Guilty Plea Process</p>\n<p id=\"b644-13\">Congress has established special procedures to ensure the validity of guilty pleas in the military justice system. Article 45(a), Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 845(a) (2000), provides that the trial court shall enter a plea of not guilty, despite the accused\u2019s guilty plea, if the accused \u201cafter a plea of guilty sets up matter inconsistent with the plea, or if it appears that he has entered the plea of guilty improvidently or through lack of understanding of its meaning and effect....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-14\">Rule for Courts-Martial (R.C.M.) 910(h)(2) underscores the military judge\u2019s obligation by requiring that \u201c[i]f after findings but before the sentence is announced the accused makes a statement to the court-martial, in testimony or otherwise, or presents evidence which is inconsistent with a plea of guilty on which a finding is based, the military judge shall inquire into the providence of the plea.\u201d Our Court has noted the importance of requiring special attention to guilty pleas in the military justice system because \u201c \u2018there may be subtle pressures inherent to the military environment that may influence the manner in which servicemembers exercise (and waive) their rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Phillippe, </em>63 M.J. at 310 (quoting <em>United States v. Pinero, </em>60 M.J. 31, 33 (C.A.A.F.2004)). \u201c \u2018The providence inquiry and a judge\u2019s explanation of possible defenses are established procedures to ensure servicemembers knowingly and voluntarily admit to all elements of a formal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>charge.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Pinero, </em>60 M.J. at 33).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">13. Plea Inquiries Involving Mental Responsibility</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">In a contested trial, the defense of lack of mental responsibility requires the accused to demonstrate that, at the time of the alleged offenses, the accused: (1) suffered from a severe mental disease or defect, and (2) as a result of that disease or defect was unable to appreciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of the charged acts. Article 50a(a), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 850a(a) (2000). In the context of a providence inquiry, however, the responsibility for assessing whether there is reason to believe that the defense may arise rests with the military judge. R.C.M. 706(a) provides in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaA\">If it appears to [the] ... military judge ... that there is reason to believe that the accused lacked mental responsibility for any offense charged or lacks capacity to stand trial, that fact and the basis of the belief or observation shall be transmitted through appropriate channels to the officer authorized to order an inquiry into the mental condition of the accused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">A statement by the accused triggers the military judge\u2019s responsibility to conduct a further inquiry when it raises the possibility that a defense may apply. The accused\u2019s statement need not assert a complete defense. Phil<em>lippe, </em>63 M.J. at 310. Rather, it must only \u201cset[ ] up matter raising a possible defense.\u201d <em>Id.; </em>Article 45(a), UCMJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">Once a statement by the accused raises the possibility that a defense may apply, the military judge has an affirmative obligation to resolve any apparent ambiguity or inconsistency by conducting further inquiry. Article 45(a), UCMJ. If, upon such inquiry, it appears that the accused may have a defense of lack of mental responsibility or may lack mental capacity at the time of trial, the military judge must determine whether to order psychological testing by a sanity board. R.C.M. 706(a); R.C.M. 916(k)(3)(B). This obligation distinguishes lack of mental responsibility from other affirmative defenses. <em>See generally </em>R.C.M. 916(k) (the military judge is not required to assess the need for specialized, nonjudicial evaluation for any affirmative defense except lack of mental responsibility).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">II. APPELLANT\u2019S TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">The charged offenses concerned events that transpired between March 10, 2002, and April 11, 2002. Appellant pled guilty to the charged offenses at a special court-martial before a military judge sitting alone. At the start of the proceedings, the military judge summarized an off-the-record conference conducted under R.C.M. 802, during which the parties discussed \u201cpotential [extenuation and mitigation] evidence requested by the defense, the medical records of the accused, and it not having arrived yet, and what we would do about that.\u201d The record supplies no further information about the medical records, including whether the military judge was informed of their contents and the reasons why counsel thought the medical records would be useful in extenuation and mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-12\">Following the summary of the R.C.M. 802 session, Appellant entered pleas of guilty to all charges and the military judge conducted a providence inquiry. Appellant said nothing during the providence inquiry that would have led the military judge to question his mental capacity or mental responsibility. The military judge accepted Appellant\u2019s pleas as provident and found him guilty of all charges and specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-13\">During the sentencing proceedings, Appellant made an unsworn statement under R.C.M. 1001(c)(2)(C), in which he recounted the injuries he sustained in an assault that occurred on November 20, 2001, approximately four months before the dates of the charged offenses. Appellant stated that he was hit repeatedly in the left side and back of the skull with a lead pipe during the assault. According to Appellant, he lost consciousness after the first blow and fell to the concrete floor. Appellant regained consciousness four or five days after the attack. He spent the next three weeks in the Hunter McGuire Veterans Hospital in recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Appellant\u2019s injuries included an inner skull fracture on the left side of his head, a second fracture on the back of the skull, a contusion to the front of the brain, bleeding and swelling to the back of the brain, complete deafness in his left ear, partial blindness in his left eye, and memory loss. Upon returning to his unit, Appellant met with a psychiatrist and was diagnosed with bipolar syndrome. At the time of the charged offenses, he was awaiting a medical discharge because his injuries prevented him from sufficiently performing his duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">Upon conclusion of the statement, the military judge thanked Appellant. The military judge made no further comment on the statement before proceeding to hear argument on sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">A statement by the accused need not set up a complete defense in order to trigger the obligation of the military judge to conduct a further inquiry. The obligation arises if the statement by the accused \u201c\u2018sets up matter inconsistent with the plea.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Prater, </em>32 M.J. 433, 436 (C.M.A.1991) (quoting Article 45(a), UCMJ).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">In <em>Phillippe, </em>we addressed the issue of \u201cwhether the military judge should have inquired further into the providence of Appellant\u2019s plea, in light of his unsworn statement.\u201d 63 M.J. at 310. We emphasized that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-8\">Even if an accused does not volunteer all the facts necessary to establish a defense, if he sets up matter raising a <em>possible defense, </em>then the military judge is obligated to make further inquiry <em>to resolve any apparent ambiguity or inconsistency. </em>Only after the military judge has made this inquiry can he then determine whether the apparent inconsistency or ambiguity has been resolved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-9\"><em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Prater, </em>32 M.J. at 436) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">Appellant told the military judge that he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. When Appellant made this statement, the military judge was placed on notice that Appellant might suffer from a severe mental disease or defect within the meaning of Article 50a(a), UCMJ. <em>See United States v. Harris, </em>61 M.J. 391, 394, 398 (C.A.A.F.2005); <em>United States v. Martin, </em>56 M.J. 97, 100, 103 (C.A.A.F.2001) (recognizing that bipolar disorder may constitute a severe mental disease or defect). Particularly in the context of Appellant\u2019s description of the assault that he had suffered, his statement fell squarely within the spectrum of matters requiring further exploration by the military judge because it set up a \u201cmatter inconsistent with the plea.\u201d Article 45(a), UCMJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-12\">At this point, the military judge was confronted with two key questions. First, whether Appellant\u2019s bipolar disorder was of sufficient gravity to constitute a severe mental disease or defect. Second, if Appellant did suffer from a severe mental disease or defect, whether that disease or defect caused him to fail to understand the nature and quality or wrongfulness of his acts. Article 50a(a), UCMJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-13\">Once Appellant raised his inconsistent statement, the military judge could have pursued one of three options. First, he could have conducted an inquiry regarding Appellant\u2019s bipolar disorder with Appellant or trial defense counsel that satisfied the military judge that the defense of lack of mental responsibility did not apply. R.C.M. 916(k)(3)(B). If, after conducting such an inquiry, he determined that the defense did not apply, he could resume the sentencing proceedings on the basis that the plea was provident. Second, he could have ordered a sanity board pursuant to R.C.M. 706(a) to explore whether the defense of lack of mental responsibility applied. Third, if the military judge determined that the lack of mental responsibility defense did in fact apply, he could have permitted Appellant to withdraw his plea under Article 45(a), UCMJ, and R.C.M. 910(h)(2) and proceed to trial on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-14\">The military judge erred in failing to adhere to the requirements for a further inquiry under R.C.M. 706(a) and 910(h)(2). As a result, we are not in a position to determine which of the above three options would have been appropriate absent this error. As we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>stated in <em>Phillippe, </em>before a court can determine that the defense in question applies, \u201cthere must be adequate facts on the record.\u201d 63 M.J. at 310 n. 3. Under these circumstances, we should set aside the findings and sentence and authorize a rehearing at which these options could be properly evaluated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
