The adjudged and approved sentence included a dishonorable discharge, confinement for eight years, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, reduction to grade E-l, and a reprimand. The United States Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed. <em>United States v. Terry, </em>No. ACM 35801, 2005 CCA LEXIS 420, at *9, 2006 WL 13166, at *4 (A.F.Ct.Crim.App. Dec. 6, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-23\">On Appellant\u2019s petition we granted review of the following two issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-24\">I. WHETHER THE MILITARY JUDGE ABUSED HER DISCRETION IN DENYING TWO CHALLENGES FOR CAUSE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-26\">II. WHETHER THE MILITARY JUDGE ABUSED HER DISCRETION BY GIVING A CONSTRUC<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>TIVE FORCE INSTRUCTION OVER OBJECTION.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Although we resolve the second issue adverse to Appellant, for the reasons that follow, we decide the first issue in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Appellant was tried by a court-martial consisting of two officers and three enlisted personnel. Two officer members, Major (Maj) H and Captain (Capt) A, indicated during voir dire that they knew family or friends who had been the victims of sexual assaults. Appellant challenged both members for cause. The challenges were denied. We conclude that Maj H properly sat on Appellant\u2019s court-martial. Although Maj H\u2019s wife had been the victim of some form of sexual assault by a family member, the record reflects that Maj H and his wife had not discussed the incident for over five years. Moreover, his wife had reconciled with the family member responsible for the sexual assault, which had occurred ten to twenty years earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">In contrast, we conclude the military judge erred in not granting the challenge for cause against Capt A. Capt A\u2019s experience with rape was pronounced and distinct. A long time girlfriend, whom Capt A may have intended to marry, was raped and became pregnant. The experience caused the girlfriend to break off her relationship with Capt A. Further, the girlfriend named the child after Capt A, indicating the nature of the bond and the continuing feelings between the girlfriend and Capt A. We believe that most persons in Capt A\u2019s position would have difficulty sitting on a rape trial, even given the passage of six years. Further, an objective observer might well have doubts about the fairness of Appellant\u2019s court-martial panel. Applying the liberal grant mandate, the military judge erred in not eliminating such doubts from Appellant\u2019s court-martial at the outset. As we stated in <em>United States v. Clay, </em>the liberal grant mandate exists not just to protect an accused\u2019s right to a fair trial, but also to protect society\u2019s interest, including the interests of the Government and the victims of crime, in the prompt and final adjudication of criminal accusations. 64 M.J. 274, 277 (C.A.A.F.2007). Where military judges consider implied bias and apply the liberal grant mandate on the record, deference is warranted. <em>United States v. Downing, </em>56 M.J. 419, 422 (C.A.A.F.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-12\">As this case illustrates, a prior connection to a crime similar to the one being tried before the court-martial is not per se disqualifying to a member\u2019s service. Capt A\u2019s experience with rape is too distinct to pass the implied bias muster. If there were additional factors that might have swayed the military judge\u2019s determination otherwise, these factors were not placed on the record and subjected to an implied bias analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-13\">THE CONSTRUCTIVE FORCE INSTRUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b477-14\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b477-15\">The facts of the rape offense were set forth in the opinion of the court below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-16\">The appellant was a radiology technician working in the ultrasound department at the Offutt AFB hospital. In December 2002, he performed an ultrasound examination on Airman First Class (A1C) S to check for swelling in her right ovary. During the examination, the appellant talked with A1C S arid told her he was taking classes at a local university. He asked if she would help him with one of his classes by letting him take ultrasound photos of the veins in her arms. She agreed to come into the hospital the next day, a Saturday, and help him with his study. When she arrived at 1200 the radiology clinic was relatively deserted, although it was a reserve training weekend. The appellant led her to the ultrasound examination room by a more circuitous route than they had taken the day before. He began to examine her arms, but then told A1C S that he was having trouble seeing her veins. He asked if he could examine the veins in her legs to see if he could get a better picture. She agreed, and the appellant left the room while she removed her pants and donned a hospital gown. The appellant returned and continued the examination. When he reached her groin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>area, he told her the picture was fuzzy and asked if she would mind removing her panties. She agreed. The appellant left the room again and A1C S removed her panties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-4\">When the appellant returned, he asked if he could take ultrasound pictures of her left ovary, because he needed pictures of female organs and already had pictures of her right ovary. A1C S agreed and placed her feet in the stirrups of the examining table. The appellant inserted an internal probe and continued the examination. When A1C S complained of some discomfort, the appellant apologized and adjusted his examination technique. Next, the appellant asked A1C S if she would mind turning over on her stomach. She complied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-5\">The appellant positioned himself between her legs and continued to manipulate the internal ultrasound probe. He then asked her if she had ever had sex with a black man. She said that she had not. He next asked if she had ever had a one-night stand. She said, \u201cno.\u201d He asked if she ever wanted to have a one-night stand, and she said she wanted to know a person before she \u201cdid anything\u201d with him. Next he asked her what she would do if he had a condom. A1C S heard a \u201ccrinkling sound\u201d turned her head and saw the skin of the appellant\u2019s bare thighs. Then she felt the appellant\u2019s penis penetrate her vagina. At the same time, he pressed his hands on her back and grabbed her breast with his right hand. He told her not to scream. A1C S crawled away from him and got up. She put her clothes on and before she left the appellant told her not to tell anyone what had happened.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-6\"><em>Terry, </em>2005 CCA LEXIS 420, at *2-*4, 2006 WL 13166, at *1.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">At trial, the victim testified, among other things, that at no time did she ever intend on having intimate contact with Appellant. When asked why she did not leave the room she stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-8\">I was just scared, and I felt like if I \u2014 even if I would have done anything I couldn\u2019t have \u2014 the room was so small and it\u2019s like I was trapped in-between the wall and the machine, and he was like in the way of my \u2014 it\u2019s just so cramped in there, you can\u2019t help but feeling enclosed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">At the close of the evidence the defense objected when the military judge indicated that he would provide the members with an instruction on constructive force. This objection was overruled, with the military judge concluding that there was some evidence that raised the issue that Appellant had threatened or intimidated the victim. The following instruction, in relevant part, was then provided to the members:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-11\">Where intimidation or threats of death or physical injury make resistance futile, it is said that constructive force has been applied, thus satisfying the requirement of force. Hence, when the accused\u2019s actions and words or conduct, coupled with the surrounding circumstances, create a reasonable belief in the victim\u2019s mind that death or physical injury would be inflicted on her and that resistance would be futile, the act of sexual intercourse has been accomplished by force.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-12\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b478-13\">Appellant, citing <em>United States v. Simpson, </em>58 M.J. 368 (C.A.A.F.2003), contends that an instruction on constructive force should not have been given because neither his superior rank, position of authority, or physical size were factors on the issue of consent or the lack thereof. It is true that these factors were more at issue in <em>Simpson. </em>However, we need not rely on the factors that might have been relevant in that case in resolving the issue in this ease. It has long been the law with respect to the offense of rape that \u201c[w]here intimidation or threats of death or physical injury make resistance futile, it is said that \u2018constructive force\u2019 has been applied.\u201d <em>United States v. Palmer, </em>33 M.J. 7, 9 (C.M.A.1991). Further, constructive force \u201cmay consist of expressed or implied threats of bodily harm.\u201d <em>United States v. Hicks, </em>24 M.J. 3, 6 (C.M.A.1987). Generally, a military judge is granted considerable discretion in deciding which instructions to give. <em>United States v. Damatta-Olivera, </em>37 M.J. 474, 478 (C.M.A.1993). The military <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>judge will generally instruct on matters that are \u201cin issue.\u201d \u201cA matter is \u2018in issue\u2019 when some evidence, without regard to its source or credibility, has been admitted upon which members might rely if they chose.\u201d Rule for Courts-Martial (R.C.M.) 920(e) Discussion. The record in this case contains \u201csome evidence\u201d that Appellant intimidated the victim into sexual intercourse without consent and that the victim\u2019s perception of this intimidation and her attendant fear were reasonable. Among other things, there was some evidence that Appellant, acting under the guise of an E-5 medical technician in order to gain the victim\u2019s trust for the purported test, lured the victim to an isolated part of the hospital at off-duty hours, that he told the victim \u201cnot to scream,\u201d and that the victim was \u201creally seared.\u201d Thus, we discern no abuse of discretion on the part of the military judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">THE CHALLENGES FOR CAUSE</p>\n<p id=\"ATv\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Appellant contends that the military judge erred in denying his challenges for cause against two members, Maj H and Capt A. In response to voir dire questioning by both the military judge and trial counsel, Maj H indicated that he had a \u201cfamily member, friend, [or] acquaintance [who had] been the victim of ... rape or sexual assault____\u201d The trial counsel pressed Maj H on the specifics and the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWe\">TC: You had also indicated in the response to one of the judge\u2019s questions [that you knew] some type of victim involved in a sex assault that\u2019s an acquaintance, family member, [or] otherwise, can you explain in a little more detail who that was and what that was about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">[Maj H]: I don\u2019t know how to answer that. It was a family member and I\u2019d rather not go into it in open court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-9\">TC: I understand that it\u2019s uncomfortable and difficult ... [but] it\u2019s important for both the government but also for [the accused] to understand what kind of life experience you may have had that you bring to the table.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-10\">[Maj H]: Sure. It was my wife____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-12\">TC: Did this incident occur while she was your wife or before ... ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-13\">[Maj H]: Oh no, it was before, it was her stepfather.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-14\">TC: And this was before you ever knew her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-15\">[Maj H]: Oh, yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-16\">TC: Do you recall about how long ago it was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-17\">[Maj H]: She was still living at home so she must have been 16 or ... maybe 18.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Au4\">TC: [H]ow long have you been married?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZS\">[Maj H]: Ten years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-18\">TC: Has your wife talked to you in any detail about ... this incident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-19\">[Maj H]: At one point, yes, but ages ago, but it\u2019s obviously part of her makeup and her mother\u2019s still married to her stepfather.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-20\">TC: Okay, you say she talked to you about it just one time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-21\">[Maj H]: It probably would have been more than just one time ... it hasn\u2019t come up in five years, but it\u2019s still part of who she is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-22\">TC: How long has it been since you ... have discussed it? Do you think it\u2019s been five years or more?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-23\">[Maj H]: Oh, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-24\">TC: [Do] you have a sense that this [past abuse] affects her life? Have there been times more recently when you\u2019ve seen her act in a certain way and you thought ... that [it] has to do with [her past assault]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjB\">[Maj H]: No, no. In fact, she and her mother both do a form of Indian dance and her stepfather takes pictures and they all went to India together ... she and her mother and stepfather.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-25\">TC: Was there ever a formal allegation made?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-26\">[Maj H]: No, she just left home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-27\">TC: Do you know if your wife has ever disclosed this situation to anyone other than you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-28\">[Maj H]: And her mother, no, probably not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-29\">TC: Knowing about the circumstance ... do you think you have any ... preconcep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>tions about the issue of sex assault or rape or related offenses?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-4\">[Maj H]: No, no, I don\u2019t think so____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">TC: Do you think there\u2019s anything about having heard your wife tell you about this situation that would cause you to not be able to sit fairly and impartially in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">[Maj H]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-7\">TC: Do you think that you\u2019d be able to listen to all the evidence, even if it deals with testimony concerning a sexual assault, and receive and consider all the evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJg\">[Maj H]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">TC: Do you have any doubt at all about whether you\u2019d be able to hear that evidence and consider it and sit fairly and impartially?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-9\">[Maj H]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-10\">TC: Do you think that you can apply any instructions ... that the judge may give you concerning rape or sexual assault?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-11\">[Maj H]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-12\">TC: Any doubt about that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-13\">[Maj H]: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-14\">Capt A indicated during initial questioning that he too had known someone who was a victim of some type of sexual assault. When asked to return to the courtroom for further questioning, Capt A indicated that he had known two victims of assault. He was asked about each:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-15\">TC: Can you explain in a little more detail who [you knew who were victims] and what that involved?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-16\">[Capt A]: [My] [h]igh school ... girlfriend for six years____ [A] guy that was supposed to be a friend of the family raped her, and ... it was her first time ... having intercourse, and she ... became pregnant. And then later on another girlfriend [informed me that] before I met her, she was also raped\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-18\">TC: The first person you talked about, how long ago was it that this incident occurred?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-19\">[Capt A]: This occurred in [19]96 I believe. TC: And you were boyfriend and girlfriend at the time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-20\">[Capt A]: We were on and off for around five, six years....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-21\">[The rape happened] near the end of [the relationship].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-22\">TC: How did you first come to find out about this incident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-23\">[Capt A]: [The victim had terminated our relationship] and she called me up ... to tell me what had happened and the reason [she ended the relationship]____ [She told me that due] to the [rape and] pregnancy she felt guilty ... she felt she was unworthy of being with me and didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with me because of the incident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-26\">TC: What was your reaction when she told you about what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-27\">[Capt A]: I was angry. I was angry at the person that did it obviously____ [T]his was her first type of intercourse, she [had] wanted to wait until she was married so it kind of ruined something that she had saved for her wedding day____ So it got me angry and upset____ I tried to stay in her life, but she pushed me and my family away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-33\">TC: At the point that she told you about this____did you see staying together in a relationship [with her]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-36\">[Capt A]: Yes, I did____ [Though] looking back ... [I don\u2019t know if I meant it or not] ..., I had mentioned to her sister ... [that] \u201cI\u2019m going to marry your sister at some point.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-38\">TC: What\u2019s your contact been like since [19]96?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-39\">[Capt A]: Probably a year we kept in sort of contact. When she gave birth to the baby we kept in kind of close contact. She actually named her son after me, that\u2019s how close we were____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-40\">I\u2019ve been married since late [19]97, and out of respect for my wife I don\u2019t contact any of my old girlfriends.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-41\">TC: How do you feel about that situation and that incident today as you sit here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>[Capt A]: Every incident is different. I view everything for what it\u2019s worth.... I\u2019m impartial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">TC: Can you go ahead and tell me again about the other person that you knew that was raped?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">[Capt A]: I don\u2019t know [about] the incident, I don\u2019t know what happened, how she got raped, I have no clue. I didn\u2019t get into details. We dated for maybe a couple of months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">[She was] more of an acquaintance, and she had mentioned that she had been raped____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-8\">TC: Previous to your relationship?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-9\">[Capt A]: [Yes], well previous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-10\">TC: [Is] there anything about either of those experiences that you think would cause you to not be able to sit fairly and impartially in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-11\">[Capt A]: No, Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-12\">TC: Do you think you\u2019re going to be able to apply that impartially to the law as the military judge instructs you and reach an unbiased finding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-13\">[Capt A]: Yes, Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-14\">TC: Do you have any doubt whatsoever about that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-15\">[Capt A]: No, Sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-16\">Upon the conclusion of voir dire the defense counsel made four challenges for cause. The military judge granted the challenges with respect to two other potential members, one who had \u201cmore than just a passing acquaintance\u201d with the victim, and the other who worried that if he sat on the panel he would have flashbacks to the assault of his daughter, and stated only that he could be impartial \u201cright now\u201d rather than for the duration of the trial process.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-17\">The military judge denied the challenge to Maj H stating that though he \u201cwas [initially] uncomfortable when answering the questions [about his wife\u2019s experiences with sexual abuse] ... as the questioning went on he was [more] forthright in answering____\u201d The military judge also stated that Maj H indicated that he \u201chad no predisposition ... [and] that he could be fair and impartial----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-20\">The military judge also denied the challenge to Capt A using similar reasoning, concluding that she saw no indication that Capt A had any feelings about rape \u201c[that could not be] put aside\u201d so that he could be impartial. Appellant preserved the issue for appeal by subsequently using his peremptory challenge against another member, Colonel H. <em>See United States v. Leonard, </em>63 M.J. 398, 403 (C.A.A.F.2006) (trial defense counsel not required to state that he would use a non-existent peremptory challenge against another member).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-21\">Appellant contends that the liberal grant mandate required the military judge to grant the challenges for cause for both Maj H and Capt A. Appellant further argues that Maj H\u2019s and Capt A\u2019s experiences actually biased them and/or that their experiences presented an implied bias. Appellant asserts that since both should have been removed, their participation in the court-martial denied him a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-22\">The Government argues, among other things, that both Maj H and Capt A affirmed that they could be fair, there were differences between the Appellant\u2019s case and the events described by the challenged members during voir dire, and there was a \u201csignificant time lapse\u201d between the court-martial and the events discussed during voir dire. Further, Capt A \u201conly dated the rape victims.\u201d Finally, \u201ctrial defense counsel declined to inquire into this area of their backgrounds when given the opportunity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-23\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b481-24\">The impartiality of members is a core principle of the military justice system, and \u201cthe sine qua non for a fair court-martial.\u201d <em>United States v. Wiesen, </em>56 M.J. 172, 174 (C.A.A.F.2001) (citation and quotation marks omitted). Its importance is emphasized by the fact that the mandate for disinterested, evenhanded members is echoed across the central sources of military law: the Constitution, federal statutes, regulations and directives, and case law. <em>Leonard, </em>63 M.J. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>399 (citations omitted); <em>see also Downing, </em>56 M.J. at 421 (finding that \u201c[a]s a matter of due process, an accused has a constitutional right, as well as a regulatory right, to a fair and impartial court-martial panel\u201d) (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">A military judge\u2019s determinations on the issue of member bias, actual or implied, are based on the \u201ctotality of the circumstances particular to [a] case.\u201d <em>United States v. Strand, </em>59 M.J. 455, 456 (C.A.A.F.2004). Such determinations are guided by this Court\u2019s longstanding and often-stated holding that challenges for cause are to be liberally granted. <em>Clay, </em>64 M.J. at 277; <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>63 M.J. 129, 134 (C.A.A.F.2006); <em>United States v. Miles, </em>58 M.J. 192, 194 (C.A.A.F.2003); <em>United States v. Youngblood, </em>47 M.J. 338, 341 (C.A.A.F.1997); <em>United States v. White, </em>36 M.J. 284, 287 (C.M.A.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">\n<em>Actual and Implied Bias</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The requirement for impartiality necessitates inquiry into both the actual bias and implied bias of potential members, with each type of bias distinct and reviewed under a different standard. <em>Youngblood, </em>47 M.J. at 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">\u201cThe test for actual bias is whether any bias \u2018is such that it will not yield to the evidence presented and the judge\u2019s instructions.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Napoleon, </em>46 M.J. 279, 283 (C.A.A.F.1997) (citation omitted). The existence of actual bias is a question of fact, and we consequently provide the military judge with significant latitude in determining whether it is present in a prospective member. <em>United States v. Warden, </em>51 M.J. 78, 81 (C.A.A.F.1999). That the military judge, rather than the reviewing court, has been physically present during voir dire and watched the challenged member\u2019s demeanor makes the military judge specially situated in making this determination. <em>Id. </em>(noting that actual bias is viewed \u201csubjectively, \u2018through the eyes of the military judge or the court members\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Napoleon, </em>46 M.J. at 283)).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">In analyzing implied bias, however, appellate courts provide less deference to the military judge. <em>Id. </em>Here, the military judge\u2019s privileged position at trial is less important because the test for implied bias is objective, and asks whether, in the eyes of the public, the challenged member\u2019s circumstances do injury to the \u201cperception of appearance of fairness in the military justice system.\u201d <em>Moreno, </em>63 M.J. at 134 (citations omitted). In considering this question, courts also consider whether \u201cmost people in the same position would be prejudiced [i.e. biased].\u201d <em>Strand, </em>59 M.J. at 459 (citation and quotation marks omitted). Consequently, \u201c \u2018issues of implied bias are reviewed under a standard less deferential than abuse of discretion but more deferential than de novo.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 458 (quoting <em>Miles, </em>58 M.J. at 195).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">\n<em>Was There Actual Bias on the Part of Maj H or Capt A?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">In this case, Appellant claims that given Maj H\u2019s and Capt A\u2019s experiences with the crime of rape, it \u201cwas asking too much of them\u201d to be truly impartial. In her denial of the challenges against both Maj H and Capt A, the military judge emphasized the importance of the demeanor of each member in making her decision. Regarding Maj H, the military judge emphasized that \u201chaving [had] the opportunity to personally observe\u201d Maj H, she was confident based on his \u201cforthright and honest\u201d answers that he could be fair and impartial regardless of his wife\u2019s history with sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-12\">The military judge made a similar finding regarding Capt A, introducing her decision to deny the challenge by stressing that \u201ceach decision [on challenges for cause] is being made on an individual basis [based on my having] watch[ed] each individual talk.\u201d \u201c[After] watching [Capt A] answer the questions,\u201d the military judge believed \u201che was very sincere, very forthright\u201d and she did not see \u201ca demeanor\u201d that would impact his ability to \u201cbe fair and impartial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-13\">That the military judge unambiguously based her findings on her personal examination of witness demeanor brings the decision in line with this Court\u2019s precedents. We have held that \u201cmere declarations of impar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>tiality [on behalf of potential members], are not sufficient by themselves to insure legal propriety.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>13 M.J. 288, 292 (C.M.A.1982). However, \u201c[w]e ... recognize that the military judge is in the best position to judge the sincerity and truthfulness of the challenged member\u2019s responses on voir dire.\u201d <em>Youngblood, </em>47 M.J. at 341 (citing <em>United States v. Daulton, </em>45 M.J. 212, 217 (C.A.A.F.1996)); <em>see also, Miles, </em>58 M.J. at 194-95 (holding that \u201ca challenge for cause for actual bias ... essentially [requires a determination] ... of credibility\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">This Court has frequently addressed the specific concern for the bias at issue here: the potential for actual bias stemming from a member\u2019s exposure to a crime similar to the one to be litigated before them. In our analyses of actual bias resulting from such contact we have been guided by two principles. First, the fact that a member was close to someone who had been a victim of a similar crime is not grounds for per se disqualification. <em>United States v. Velez, </em>48 M.J. 220, 223-24 (C.A.A.F.1998). Likewise, \u201c[m]ere distaste for certain offenses is not automatically disqualifying.\u201d <em>United States v. Schlamer, </em>52 M.J. 80, 92 (C.A.A.F.1999) (citing <em>United States v. Bannwarth, </em>36 M.J. 265, 268 (C.M.A.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Second, regardless of a member\u2019s prior exposure to a crime, it is often possible for a member to rehabilitate himself before the military judge by honestly claiming that he would not be biased. Even in light of a member\u2019s extensive exposure to the same sort of crime that the member is being asked to adjudge at court-martial, we have regularly found the absence of actual bias when the military judge reported that following voir dire she was satisfied with the honesty of the member and convinced that the member was neither \u201cinflexible\u201d nor resistant to the evidence or the military judge\u2019s instructions. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Brown, </em>34 M.J. 105, 111 (C.M.A.1992) (in a case dealing with a sodomy charge, the military judge appropriately denied the challenge against a member whose young son had been the victim of a homosexual assault after \u201cevaluating] and accepting] this prospective member\u2019s ... disclaimer on the basis of a careful examination of this person\u2019s demeanor----\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">Despite this, and the fact that this Court has found members lack bias in cases in which members have themselves been victims of crimes, <em>see, e.g., Daulton, </em>45 M.J. at 217; <em>United States v. Lavender, </em>46 M.J. 485, 489 (C.A.A.F.1997); <em>United States v. Reichardt, </em>28 M.J. 113, 116 (C.M.A.1989); <em>United States v. Porter, </em>17 M.J. 377, 379-80 (C.M.A.1984), we have found actual bias when members have been victims of similar, <em>particularly </em>violent or traumatic crimes, or if other unique circumstances pertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">For instance, in <em>United States v. Smart, </em>this Court held that it was an abuse of discretion to deny a challenge for cause of a member sitting on an armed robbery ease. 21 M.J. 15, 20 (C.M.A.1985). The member had been subjected to robbery at knife-point on at least six occasions, and his father had been robbed at gunpoint, the same crime for which the accused was charged. <em>Id. </em>at 17. Despite the potential member\u2019s assurances to the military judge that he could be impartial, the distress of his repeated robbery and his father\u2019s assault led this Court to \u201cdisagree that this assertion sufficed to permit his inclusion on the panel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">In <em>Miles, </em>this Court found error in a ease concerning wrongful use of cocaine. 58 M.J. at 195. In <em>Miles, </em>the military judge erred when he denied a challenge of a member whose nephew had died due to complications associated with his mother\u2019s prenatal use of cocaine. <em>Id. </em>It was not just the member\u2019s exposure to this misfortune that was determinative, but that the trial counsel himself commented that the event had evidently been traumatic for the member, and that the member had recently written an article for the base newspaper \u2014 due to be published four days after the court-martial was to convene \u2014 recounting his nephew\u2019s story and admonishing readers not to use drugs. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">Without similar exacerbating circumstances present in the stories of either Maj H or Capt A, and in hght of the military judge\u2019s assessment of the members\u2019 demeanor and truthfulness during voir dire, we conclude the military judge did not err in finding an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>absence of actual bias in both Maj H and Capt A. \u201cTheir answers disclaimed any bias or partiality, and we do not fault the military judge for finding that the members exhibited no actual bias.\u201d <em>Youngblood, </em>47 M.J. at 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">\n<em>Possible Implied Bias on the Part of Either Member</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">There are a number of factors in Maj H\u2019s situation that tend to ameliorate his exposure to the crime, dispelling the appearance of implied bias. First, though an exact chronology is not clear from the record, the crime against Maj H\u2019s wife took place at least ten, and perhaps as many as twenty years, prior to the court-martial and, significantly, before Maj H even knew his wife. It was never reported to law enforcement, nor was it cause for his wife to receive any counseling. As a couple they had spoken about the event only a few times, and the subject had not been broached for at least five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Further, Maj H\u2019s mother-in-law remains married to the man who assaulted his wife, and it appears some measure of intra-family reconciliation has been made. Maj H reports that his wife and her stepfather participate in a dancing club together, and shortly before the court-martial, Maj H\u2019s wife, her mother, and her stepfather had even traveled abroad together.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">Finally, taking the record of Maj H\u2019s voir dire as a whole, the military judge\u2019s interpretation of Maj H\u2019s initial discomfort in speaking about his wife\u2019s abuse was justifiably described as emanating from his concern for his wife\u2019s reputation in the community, rather than any distress he personally suffered due to his wife\u2019s experiences.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">Capt A\u2019s situation is different. He reported that he knew two people who were victims of rape. The first was a woman who he had \u201cdated for a couple months ... in college.\u201d Capt A reported that he was not particularly close with the victim, calling her \u201cmore of an acquaintance.\u201d She had been raped \u201cwell previous\u201d to their relationship, and had provided Capt A with no details as to what happened. Capt A had \u201cno clue\u201d about the incident. It appears the impact on Capt A of this rape is attenuated, and we find no implied bias here.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">In contrast, the impact on Capt A of the rape of a longstanding girlfriend is more significant, and that situation \u201coffers facts of clarity and consequence on both sides of the implied bias equation.\u201d <em>Strand, </em>59 M.J. at 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">On the one hand, the rape occurred more than seven years before the court-martial and Capt A had not spoken with the victim for more than six years. Further, Capt A reported that his lack of contact with the victim during this time was not because of uneasiness with what had happened or because of some particularly powerful lingering emotional attachment. Rather, it was \u201cout of respect for [his] wife,\u201d that he did not \u201ccontact any of [his] old girlfriends.\u201d Moreover, Capt A described his relationship with the victim as \u201con and off\u2019 and at the time of the rape the relationship was \u201coff.\u201d Indeed, the victim was not living in the same country as Capt A.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-12\">On the other hand, in regards to this rape, Capt A \u2014 unlike his minimal awareness of the rape of his other girlfriend, or in apparent contrast to Maj H\u2019s sparse knowledge of his wife\u2019s assault \u2014 was familiar with the details of the rape. He was aware of exactly when the crime occurred, the circumstances of who assaulted her, and how the rapist had managed to gain access to her. Further, Capt A was aware of specific aggravating circumstances of the attack, such as the fact that the rape was the victim\u2019s first sexual experience, that the victim had wished to save herself for marriage, and that the rape resulted in a pregnancy and a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-13\">Capt A\u2019s connection to this victim and this crime appear noteworthy and lasting even after their relationship ended. When asked how he felt about the incident by the trial counsel, Capt A expressed that he was incensed, and whether or not their relationship was ongoing at the time of the incident, he was angry that his \u201cvery close friend\u201d had been hurt. Though it is not clear whether Capt A still harbored these feelings or was merely recounting his past emotions to the court, it is likely that given the strength of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>his relationship with the victim he may well have maintained this resentment. In fact, Capt A had been close enough to the victim and her family to have been made a part of her sister\u2019s wedding party. It was at the wedding that Capt A informed the victim\u2019s sister that he was going to marry the victim \u201cat some point.\u201d Finally, Capt A reported that the rape was the reason that the victim broke up with him and that following the assault the victim was wracked by feelings that \u201cshe was unworthy\u201d and she did not want to be with Capt A \u201cbecause of the incident.\u201d Despite this, they kept in close contact through the birth of the victim\u2019s son; indeed, Capt A reported that they were so close that the victim named her son after him. Capt A \u201ctried to stay in her life, but [the victim] pushed [him and his] family away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">Though the military judge was correct in basing her finding of a lack of actual bias on her impressions of Capt A\u2019s demeanor and statements during voir dire, the record does not reflect the application of an objective implied bias test. Indeed, there was no indication that the military judge \u201cintended to address implied bias at all.\u201d <em>Downing, </em>56 M.J. at 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">This Court recognizes that \u201c[t]he military judge may well have intellectually applied the ... test. However, the law is clear in this area____ We do not expect record dissertations but, rather, a clear signal that the military judge applied the right law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">Such an examination would have explicitly brought the distinct features of Capt A\u2019s situation to bear and would have compelled the military judge to \u201csquarely address the essential question [of an implied bias analysis] \u2014 was [she] satisfied that an objective public observer would find [Capt A\u2019s service on the panel notwithstanding his acute involvement with the crime of rape as] consonant with a fair and impartial system of military justice?\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b485-13\">As previously stated, a prior experience with or connection to the crime in question is not per se disqualifying, as the circumstances involving Maj H demonstrate. However, the events described by Capt A go well beyond the circumstances described by Maj H. We have no reason to doubt the military judge\u2019s determination that Capt A was capable of compartmenting his life history and impartially hearing Appellant\u2019s ease. However, applying the liberal grant mandate and cognizant of case law finding \u201cimplied bias \u2018when most people in the same position would be prejudiced,\u2019\u201d <em>Wiesen, </em>56 M.J. at 174 (citations omitted), we hold that the military-judge erred in denying the challenge for cause as to Capt A.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-14\">Whatever Capt A\u2019s individual character and emotional capacity, we believe most people in Capt A\u2019s circumstance would be hard pressed with such a background to sit impartially in a rape case. The totality of circumstances in this ease include the circumstances in which Capt A\u2019s relationship with his longtime girlfriend ended, the suggestion that Capt A would otherwise have married this girlfriend, and the subsequent choice of the girlfriend to name the resulting child after Capt A. In such circumstances, it \u201cwas \u2018asking too much\u2019 of him and the system\u201d for Capt A to sit.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>See Miles, </em>58 M.J. at 195 (citations omitted); <em>Daulton, </em>45 M.J. at 218 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-15\">DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b485-16\">The decision of the United States Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals is reversed and the findings and sentence are set aside.
