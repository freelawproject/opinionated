The plaintiff made out a prima facie case for summary judgment and the defendant failed to produce evidentiary proof in admissible form sufficient to establish the existence of a material issue of fact which requires a trial of the action <em>(see, Zuckerman v City of New York, </em>49 NY2d 557, 562; <em>Richter v Herman, </em>240 AD2d 556; <em>Fresse v City of New York, </em>238 AD2d 374; <em>Xenakis v Waldbaum, Inc., </em>237 AD2d 433).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">The defendant\u2019s remaining contentions are without merit.
