Upon review of the record and defense counsel\u2019s brief, we agree. Defendant entered a knowing, voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty to manslaughter in the second degree and was sentenced to an indeterminate term of 1 to 6 years in prison. His sentence is in accordance with both the plea bargain and the relevant statutory provisions. The judgment is, accordingly, affirmed and defense counsel\u2019s application for leave to withdraw is granted (see, <em>People v Cruwys, </em>113 AD2d 979, <em>lv denied </em>67 NY2d 650).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-9\">Cardona, P. J., Mercure, Crew III, Spain and Carpinello, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed, and application to be relieved of assignment granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
