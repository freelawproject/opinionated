It follows that any right plaintiff may have to share in post-termination net profits, and any concomitant right to discovery of financial information pertinent thereto, must depend on whether his termination was wrongful, i.e., in breach of the partnership agreement <em>(cf., Burnstine v Geist, </em>257 App Div 792). However, the order on appeal should be modified to allow disclosure of financial information for the six-month period immediately following termination, to cover the possibility that income that accrued before termination was deferred until after termination.
