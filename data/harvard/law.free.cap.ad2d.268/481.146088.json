The respondent was admitted to the practice of law at a term of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in the First Judicial Department on July 1, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-3\">Upon the papers filed in support of the motion and the papers filed in opposition thereto, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">Ordered that the branch of the motion which is for reargument is granted, and, upon reargument, the third and fifth decretal paragraphs of this Court\u2019s opinion and order, dated August 16, 1999 (259 AD2d 218), are vacated, and the following decretal paragraphs are substituted therefor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">\u201cOrdered that the respondent, Robert W. Spencer, is suspended from the practice of law for a period of one year, commencing August 16, 1999, and continuing until the further order of this Court, with leave to the respondent to apply for reinstatement no sooner than six months prior to the expiration of the one-year period upon furnishing satisfactory proof that (a) during that period he refrained from practicing or attempting to practice law, (b) he has fully complied with this order and with the terms and provisions of the written rules governing the conduct of disbarred, suspended, and resigned attorneys (22 NYCRR 691.10), and (c) he has otherwise properly conducted himself; and it is further,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">\u201cOrdered that pursuant to Judiciary Law \u00a7 90, during the period of suspension and until the further order of this Court, the respondent, Robert W. Spencer, is commanded to continue to desist and refrain from (1) practicing law in any form, either as principal or agent, clerk, or employee of another, (2) appearing as an attorney or counselor-at-law before any court, Judge, Justice, board, commission, or other public authority, (3) giving to another an opinion as to the law or its application or any advice in relation thereto, and (4) holding himself out in any way as an attorney and counselor-at-law\u201d; and it is further,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Ordered that the motion is otherwise denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\">The granting of leave to reargue in this case is predicated upon the respondent\u2019s expressed remorse, the absence of any personal benefit to the respondent from any of the irregularities in the account, the absence of monetary loss to any clients, the respondent\u2019s implementation of new escrow procedures, the role of the respondent in reporting the theft of a now-former partner to the Grievance Committee, and the firm\u2019s prior arrangement with its bank to cover overdrafts in its escrow account, thereby removing the early warning signs of financial disorder. Under the peculiar circumstances of this case, the imposition of a disbarment was excessive discipline. Mangano, P. J., Bracken, O\u2019Brien, Santucci and Thompson, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
