The People possess broad discretion in deciding what evidence should be presented <em>(see, People v Mitchell, </em>82 NY2d 509; <em>People </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number><em>v Lancaster, </em>69 NY2d 20, <em>cert denied </em>480 US 922), and we find that the Grand Jury indictment was supported by competent eyewitness testimony to the crime. The purportedly exculpatory evidence, <em>i.e., </em>that two victims failed to identify defendant at a lineup, was, under the circumstances presented here, immaterial. Concur\u2014Sullivan, J.
