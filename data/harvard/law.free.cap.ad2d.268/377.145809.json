En route, the automatic braking system engaged. Plaintiff was dispatched to check the hoses between the locomotives. Upon discovering that, in fact, two hoses had decoupled, he prepared to climb up on one locomotive in order to travel through it to reach the location of the decoupling. However, as he started to climb the ladder, one foot slipped on the ballast from which he had stepped toward the ladder, whereupon plaintiff fell backward and he sustained injuries. Plaintiffs entitlement to recover under the Federal Employer\u2019s Liability Act is not in issue, nor do we disturb that verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Boiler Inspection Act (45 USC) \u00a7 23, in effect at the time, states in pertinent part that \u201c [i] t shall be unlawful for any carrier to use or permit to be used on its line any locomotive unless said locomotive, its boiler, tender, and all parts and appurtenances thereof are in proper condition and safe to operate in the service to which the same are put\u201d. Plaintiff offered evidence, countered by defendant\u2019s employee, that the hoses were too short, causing the emergency brake to engage. Plaintiffs theory in support of the Boiler Inspection Act claim is that the condition of the hoses caused the decoupling and the braking, requiring plaintiffs presence at the location where he was hurt. In refusing to submit the claim to the jury, the trial court <em>concluded </em>that <em>the </em>condition of the air hoses was not the causative agent of the injury, which resulted solely from climbing the ladder. However, this, properly, was a factual issue for the jury. Concur\u2014Tom, J. P., Rubin, Andrias and Buckley, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
