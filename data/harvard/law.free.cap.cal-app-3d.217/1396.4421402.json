J.</author>\n<p id=\"APs\">This declaratory relief action, brought by United Services Automobile Association (USAA) against the heirs of Anita Lilly (heirs), tenders the question whether the \u201ceach person\u201d or the \u201ceach accident\u201d provision of a USAA policy of automobile liability insurance limits its liability for damages for which its insured may become legally responsible in the wrongful death action brought by the heirs. The trial court entered judgment that recovery is limited to $100,000 by the \u201ceach person\u201d provision. The heirs appeal, claiming that the $300,000 \u201ceach accident\u201d clause provides the correct limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-10\">We will affirm the judgment. In the published portion of this opinion we read the policy as covering damages for a wrongful death, resulting from an automobile accident, for which USAA\u2019s insured is legally responsible. Since damages for such a death are not measured by bodily injury to the heirs but by the economic consequences of the fatal bodily injury to their relative we conclude that USAA\u2019s liability is governed by the \u201ceach person\u201d clause which limits \u201cdamages for bodily injury sustained by any one person in any one auto accident\u201d to $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-11\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-12\">The facts are few and undisputed. USAA\u2019s insured was involved in an automobile accident in which Harold R. Lilly was injured and his wife, Anita, was killed. Harold Lilly filed a personal injury action and her heirs filed a wrongful death action against the insured. USAA filed this action for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1399\">*1399</page-number>declaratory relief, naming the heirs as defendants, claiming that the policy\u2019s bodily injury liability limit of $100,000 for \u201ceach person\u201d is applicable in each of the two actions. The $100,000 limit, applied to Harold Lilly\u2019s personal injury action, is not at issue. Anita Lilly\u2019s heirs claim the policy\u2019s $300,000 \u201ceach accident\u201d bodily injury liability limitation is the applicable provision of the contract. More precisely they claim the maximum coverage is $300,000 minus the amount paid in the Harold Lilly personal injury action. USAA claims that its maximum liabilities are $100,000 in the personal injury action and $100,000 in the wrongful death action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">The heirs ask us to employ the familiar rule of insurance contract construction that an ambiguity in an insurance policy is to be construed in favor of coverage if semantically permissible. <em>(White </em>v. <em>Western Title Ins. Co. </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 870, 881 [221 Cal.Rptr. 509, 710 P.2d 309], quoting from <em>Reserve Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Pisciotta </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 800, 807-808 [180 Cal.Rptr. 628, 640 P.2d 764].) The necessary condition for invocation of this rule is a material ambiguity in the policy language, i.e., a \u201cmaterial uncertainty in the application of the policy language to the facts upon which the claim of coverage is predicated.\u201d <em>(California State Auto. Assn. Inter-Ins. Bureau </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 855, 859 [223 Cal.Rptr. 246], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-8\">\u201cThe question of meaning is framed by the competing claims of the parties regarding the application of the policy language to the material facts of the case. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(National Auto. &amp; Casualty Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Contreras </em>(1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 831, 836 [238 Cal.Rptr. 627].) They must be \u201ctested against the permissible uses of the language upon which the claims are founded, for the meaning of language is to be found in its usage and the occasion of a usage is an application of the language to particular circumstances.\u201d (Ib<em>id.) </em>In applying this measure we are directed to read the policy \u201cas employing the ordinary usages of its terms as they might be understood by the layman in the context of the policy and the purposes which it serves.\u201d <em>(Travelers Indemnity Co. </em>v. <em>Swearinger </em>(1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 779, 784 [214 Cal.Rptr. 383].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-10\">USAA contracted with the insured to \u201cpay damages for bodily injury . . . for which any covered person becomes legally responsible because of an auto accident.\u201d The policy does not explicitly cover wrongful death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1400\">*1400</page-number>actions. Nor does it define \u201cbodily injury.\u201d Rather it covers damages \u201cfor bodily injury\u201d for which the insured becomes \u201clegally responsible because of an auto accident.\u201d The parties assume that this provision applies to damages recoverable in a wrongful death action and focus their claims upon the policy provisions which limit the amounts payable for such damages. The assumption conceals two different constructions by which the policy is read to encompass the claims of the heirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">The first, assumed by USAA, is that \u201cbodily injury\u201d includes death, the injury suffered by Anita Lilly. In that case the argument is that USAA has become liable for whatever damages its insured has become \u201clegally responsible\u201d because of the death of Anita Lilly, hence for whatever damages are recoverable in a wrongful death action. The second, advanced by the heirs is that \u201cbodily injury\u201d includes the injuries (damages) suffered <em>by them. </em>In that case the policy applies because USAA\u2019s insured is legally responsible for <em>that </em>kind of bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-5\">The term \u201cbodily injury\u201d must be read \u201cas employing [its] ordinary usages ... as they might be understood by the layman in the context of the policy and the purposes which it serves.\u201d <em>(Travelers Indemnity Co., supra, </em>169 Cal.App.3d at p. 784.) Applying that measure to a policy of automobile liability insurance, it would belie the reasonable understandings of its holders if it protected them against damages for all forms of bodily injury to a victim of an automobile accident except the most severe, death.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The measure, however, rules out classifying the <em>kind </em>of damages recoverable for wrongful death as damages \u201cfor bodily injury.\u201d Such damages have been held to include \u201cpecuniary losses,\u201d not only losses of an ascertainable economic value such as loss of household services or earning capacity but also loss of the decedent\u2019s \u201csociety, comfort, care and protection.\u201d  <em>(Krouse </em>v. <em>Graham </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 59, 68 [137 Cal.Rptr. 863, 562 P.2d 1022].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>\n                   Such damages do not sound in \u201cbodily injury.\u201d That is to say, a policy holder would not ordinarily and reasonably understand the term \u201cbodily injury\u201d to include a loss of household services or earning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1401\">*1401</page-number>capacity or the loss of the \u201csociety, comfort, care and protection\u201d of the deceased. For that reason we rule out any construction of the policy which reads \u201cbodily injury\u201d as including an injury for which the heirs might recover in a wrongful death action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">Thus, we read the coverage provision to encompass a wrongful death action, by substitution of \u201cdeath\u201d for \u201cbodily injury\u201d so that it reads that USAA will \u201cpay damages for <em>[death] </em>... for which any covered person becomes legally responsible because of an auto accident.\u201d This readily encompasses damages for wrongful death<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because the \u201cdamages\u201d for which the insured becomes \u201clegally responsible\u201d are the damages recoverable in a wrongful death action. However, since such damages are not damages <em>\u201cfor </em>bodily injury\u201d but damages derivative of the insured\u2019s legal responsibility for the fatal bodily injury, the USAA policy does not cover the heirs on the theory that <em>they </em>suffered bodily injury. These conclusions are of semantic consequence in reading the provisions which limit USAA\u2019s liability for payments within the coverage provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-7\">The payments within the coverage provision are limited by two provisions of the policy. The amount payable for \u201cbodily injury\u201d is limited for \u201ceach person\u201d to $100,000 and for \u201ceach accident\u201d to $300,000.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>The application of these limits is explained in the policy as follows. \u201cThe limit of liability shown in the Declarations for \u2018each person\u2019 for Bodily Injury Liability is our maximum limit of liability for all damages for bodily injury sustained by any one person in any one auto accident. Subject to this limit for \u2018each person\u2019, the limit of liability shown in the Declarations for \u2018each accident\u2019 for Bodily Injury Liability is our maximum limit of liability for all damages for bodily injury resulting from any one auto accident. . . . This is the most we will pay regardless of the number of: . . . [j[] 2. Claims made</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-9\">The \u201ceach person\u201d provision provides that the maximum amount that USAA will pay for \u201call damages for bodily injury sustained by any one person in any one auto accident\u201d is $100,000. The heirs argue that each of them is a person sustaining bodily injury as a result of the accident because they are entitled to bring a wrongful death action pursuant to Code of Civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1402\">*1402</page-number>Procedure section 377 based upon their own independent \u201cpecuniary loss\u201d arising from the death of their relative in the accident. (See <em>Earley </em>v. <em>Pacific Electric Railway Company </em>(1917) 176 Cal. 79, 81 [167 P. 513]; <em>Carr </em>v. <em>Duncan </em>(1949) 90 Cal.App.2d 282, 284 [202 P.2d 855].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">The heirs necessarily construe the words \u201cany one person\u201d as applying to the person suffering the loss (i.e., the heir), rather than to the person directly injured or killed in the accident (Anita Lilly), and necessarily construe \u201cbodily injury\u201d as inclusive of <em>their </em>wrongful death injuries. For reasons partly assessed above this construction is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">The heirs may recover under the policy only insofar as it covers <em>their </em>injuries. But their injuries are included within the policy coverage only because they are founded upon the <em>legal responsibility </em>of USAA\u2019s insured for the wrongful death of their relative resulting from the accident. For the heirs to be entitled to any recovery under the policy the term \u201cdeath\u201d must be read into the policy such that the $100,000 maximum bodily injury limitation is applicable to \u201cdamages for [i.e., arising from] bodily injury [i.e., death] sustained by any one person <em>in </em>any one auto accident.\u201d The person so injured <em>in </em>the accident was Anita Lilly. Thus, the precondition for recovery under the policy also provides for a limitation upon the recovery; the maximum recovery the heirs collectively may recover for their damages resulting from the death of Anita Lilly in the accident is the $100,000 provided in the \u201ceach person\u201d provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-6\">The heirs\u2019 reliance on <em>Abellon </em>v. <em>Hartford Ins. Co. </em>(1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 21 [212 Cal.Rptr. 852] is misplaced. <em>In Abellon </em>a husband was injured in an automobile accident. He brought an action for his injuries. His wife, who was not in the accident, brought an action for loss of consortium resulting from the injuries to her husband in the accident. The policy language provided: \u201c T. The most we will pay for all <em>damages resulting from bodily injury to any one person caused by any one accident </em>is the limit of Bodily Injury Liability shown in this endorsement for \u201ceach person\u201d [$250,000]. 2. Subject to the limit for \u201ceach person,\u201d the most we will pay for all damages resulting from bodily injury caused by any one accident is the limit of Bodily Injury Liability shown in this endorsement for \u201ceach accident\u201d [$500,000].\u2019 \u201d (Italics added.) Hartford argued that under the per person provision applied it was liable for a maximum of $250,000 on the theory that the wife\u2019s loss of consortium was derivative of the husband\u2019s injuries in the accident. The court disagreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-7\">It held that the wife\u2019s claim was subject to the \u201cper occurrence\u201d limitation. That limitation happened to be twice the \u201ceach person\u201d limitation. Its holding is bottomed on the reasoning that she also was a person who could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1403\">*1403</page-number>separately recover \u201cdamages resulting from bodily injury . . . caused by [the] accident\u201d on the theory that her damages, compensable emotional distress\u2014a bodily injury, were caused by the accident. Unlike the contract at issue here, the <em>Abellon </em>contract did not require that the bodily injury subject to the \u201ceach person\u201d limitation be suffered by a person <em>in </em>the accident. As subsequently explained by the same court, \u201cIn <em>Abellon, </em>we held the policy there extended coverage to \u2018 \u201call damages resulting from <em>bodily injury </em>caused by any one accident.\u201d \u2019 [Citation omitted.] Reasoning the [each person] provision did not specifically state that damages must result from bodily injury to one physically present at the accident scene, we held coverage extended to all persons damaged as \u2018a result of bodily injuries sustained in the accident.\u201d\u2019 <em>(Interinsurance Exchange </em>v. <em>Campbell </em>(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 242, 246 [232 Cal.Rptr. 27].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\"><em>Westfield Ins. Co </em>v. <em>DeSimone </em>(1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 598 [247 Cal.Rptr. 291] said that <em>Abellon </em>ruled that \u201cthe wife\u2019s loss of consortium injury could be an independent bodily injury under the insurance policy, if the loss of consortium were accompanied by <em>emotional distress which resulted in bodily injury. </em>\u201d (201 Cal.App.3d at p. 603, original italics.) In <em>Westfield, </em>a wrongful death case, the policy language, similar to that here, provided that $100,000 was the insurance company\u2019s \u201c \u2018maximum limit of liability for all damages for bodily injury sustained by any one person <em>in </em>any one auto accident. . . regardless of the number of. . . Claims made . . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 600, italics deleted and italics added.) And like this case, the decedent\u2019s heirs relied on the policy\u2019s \u201cper occurrence\u201d limitation. Noting that \u201c \u2018California cases have uniformly held that damages for mental and emotional distress, including grief and sorrow, are not recoverable in a wrongful death action\u2019 <em>(Krouse </em>v. <em>Graham </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 59, 72),\u201d <em>Westfield </em>asserted that the rationale in <em>Abellon </em>which led to the court\u2019s ruling that the wife suffered \u201cbodily injury\u201d for purposes of the policy was not applicable to the wrongful death action before it. <em>(Westfield', supra, </em>at p. 603.) The <em>Westfield </em>court rejected arguments paralleling those made here and held that each heir did not have a separate and independent claim for bodily injury under the policy. We agree with that holding.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1404\">*1404</page-number>We conclude that the extent of USAA\u2019s liability to the heirs arising from the death of Anita Lilly is $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">Marler, J., and Davis, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-7\">Appellants\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied May 2, 1990.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1014-7\">That construction is compelled by statute.

Moreover, Insurance Code section 11580.06, subdivision (c) [part of article 2, chapter 1 of part 3] relating to \u201cActions on Policies Containing Liability Provisions,\u201d applicable here, reasonably defines \u201cbodily injury\u201d as \u201cincluding death resulting therefrom.\u201d We note that 3 California Insurance Law &amp; Practice (1989 rev. ed.) section 50.05[2], at page 50-12, notes that \u201cBodily injury [is] defined in most policies in accordance with the Insurance Code [section 11580.06(c)] definition ....
