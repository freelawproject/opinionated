J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqZi\">In two separate actions, plaintiffs, consisting of several state legislators, their constituents, and other elected officials, initiated suit against the Rules Committee of the California State Senate and the Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC), challenging the constitutionality of one portion of an initiative measure dealing with political reform, Proposition 73, adopted at the June 1988 primary election.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">Article IV, section 3 of that measure amended Government Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 89001 to read as follows: \u201cNo newsletter or other mass mailing shall be sent at public expense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-9\">Although the trial court initially found the newly amended statute to be unconstitutional, it reversed its position in a subsequent action brought to enforce the original judgment. Since the appeals from these conflicting rulings involve similar issues and parties, we have consolidated the cases for purposes of our review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">We have concluded that the statute neither interferes with the Legislature\u2019s authority to govern its internal affairs nor burdens the exercise of any fundamental right. We therefore reverse the judgment of the trial court which declared section 89001 to be unconstitutional, and affirm the court\u2019s subsequent ruling upholding the validity of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1065\">*1065</page-number>The facts giving rise to this litigation are undisputed by the parties and may be summarized as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">Prior to its amendment by Proposition 73, former section 89001 prohibited the mailing of newsletters and other mass mailings by or on behalf of any elected officer to a constituent or potential constituent but <em>only after </em>the elected officer had filed either \u201c[t]he nomination documents ... for any local, state, or federal office to be voted upon at an election governed by Chapter 5 . . . of Division 6 of the Elections Code\u201d or \u201c[t]he last document necessary to be listed on the ballot as a candidate for any local, state or federal office to be voted upon at an election not governed by Chapter 5. . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Following the enactment of that statute, the state Legislature developed extensive \u201cnewsletter programs\u201d which involved expenditures from the contingent funds of both the Senate and Assembly for the publication and distribution of mass mailings from legislators to their constituents and other members of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">The \u201cRevised Senate Newsletter Rules\u201d (Rules), effective December 1984, set forth the purpose of the program as follows: \u201cThe Senate Newsletter Program is conducted by the Senate Rules Committee. The purpose of the program is to inform and educate, through direct mail communication the citizens of the state by discussion of the legislative issues, problems, and suggested solutions that are being dealt with in Sacramento. . . . [fl] The Newsletter Program is designed to inform citizens about past, present and future legislative events, as well as provide constituent assistance. . . . [fl] No mailing may be designed or used for \u2018political purposes.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">In keeping with this statement of intent, the Rules contained various restrictions on the format of the newsletters, their substantive content, and the frequency of the mailings. The Rules further required that all proposed mailings be submitted to the rules committee for approval of both form and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>content before being distributed. The Rules Committee of the Assembly promulgated similar rules for its members.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Both before and after the adoption of former section 89001, legislators and other elected officials, at both the state and local level, used publicly funded mass mailings to send a wide variety of written materials to their constituents. According to plaintiffs these mailings have been used by legislators to \u201caddress issues and legislation of special concern to their individual districts and of general concern to the state as a whole, to inform constituents of the activities of their elected representatives and of state government as a whole, to solicit views and comments from their constituents, to mobilize support for, or opposition to, proposed legislation, and to provide information concerning laws, regulations, and various governmental programs. \u201c</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Based upon the total cost of the state newsletter program, the legislative analyst estimated in 1988 that the adoption of Proposition 73\u2019s prohibition against mass mailings by state elected officials would result in savings of approximately $1.8 million annually. Similar savings were also expected at the local level.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">Against this backdrop, a majority of the electorate approved Proposition 73\u2019s limitation on publicly funded newsletter programs at the June 1988 primary election.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Unlike the bulk of statutes enacted by the measure, however, the amended version of section 89001 became effective the day following its passage.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (See Cal. Const., art. II, \u00a7 10, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">Immediately thereafter, the Senate Rules Committee began rejecting requests from senators to send, at public expense, newsletters, questionnaires, and miscellaneous material to their constituents, and other members of the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">In July 1988, several state senators, including plaintiffs Diane Watson, Bill Greene, and Art Torres, and six of their constituents, initiated an action in Los Angeles Superior Court (case No. C691676) against the Rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number>Committee seeking a declaration that section 89001 was unconstitutional. Various other state and local elected officials, including members of the Los Angeles City Council, later intervened in that action as plaintiffs. Assembly Member Ross Johnson, one of the authors of Proposition 73, and Mark Pickens, a nonincumbent seeking election to the Legislature, intervened as defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing in part that the statute infringed on the state Legislature\u2019s authority to govern its internal affairs and control the budget and appropriations process. Plaintiffs further maintained that the newly amended law burdened the exercise of several fundamental rights guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal Constitution, and that Proposition 73 itself violated the California Constitution\u2019s \u201csingle-subject\u201d rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">In February 1989, after hearing extensive argument by the parties, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs declaring section 89001 \u201cunconstitutional and of no force or effect.\u201d Defendants subsequently filed their appeal from that judgment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">Following entry of judgment, the FPPC<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> informed the Legislature that, under the authority of section 3.5, article III of the California Constitution, it would continue to enforce section 89001 until it had been declared unconstitutional by an appellate court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As a result, the Senate Rules Committee rejected all requests for publication and distribution of newsletters and other mass mailings pending the outcome of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">Plaintiffs thereafter sought relief by the filing of a petition for mandate and/or prohibition. Although Division Three of this court summarily denied the request for relief, its order suggested that plaintiffs initiate an action in superior court for injunctive relief against the FPPC.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">Plaintiffs subsequently filed a new and separate complaint (case No. C722189) seeking to enjoin the FPPC from enforcing section 89001 and any interpretative regulations based thereon.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-13\">\u201c(a) To declare a statute unenforceable, or refuse to enforce a statute, on the basis of it being unconstitutional unless an appellate court has made a determination that such statute is unconstitutional; ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>Several months earlier, in December 1988, the FPPC adopted regulation 18901<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> as a means of implementing section 89001. That rule, effective April 12, 1989, essentially provided that newsletters and other mass mailings were <em>not </em>prohibited under the statute so long as they did not \u201cfeature\u201d (i.e., \u201csingle[] out for attention of the reader\u201d) any particular elective officer and were not \u201csent at the request of any elected officer or his or her agent.\u201d The regulation further permitted the mailing of press releases to the media, intra-agency communications, legal notices, announcements of official agency events and other public meetings, telephone directories, and documents \u201csent in connection with the payment or collection of funds\u201d by a governmental agency, including tax bills and checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Plaintiffs took the position that the FPPC in promulgating regulation 18901, had impermissibly rewritten section 89001 by creating numerous exceptions and exclusions not authorized by the clear wording of the statute. At the hearing on plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, the trial court disagreed and ruled that when read in context of its placement in the Government Code and construed according to the FPPC interpretive regulation, the statute was constitutional. The request for injunctive relief was denied. Plaintiffs now appeal from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">In reviewing plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to the constitutionality of the statute, we do not consider or weigh the economic or social wisdom or general propriety of the initiative measure before us. Our sole function is to evaluate section 89001, and the FPPC\u2019s interpretive regulation, in light of established constitutional standards. (See <em>Amador Valley Joint Union High Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 208, 219 [149 Cal.Rptr. 239, 583 P.2d 1281].)</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">As emphasized by our Supreme Court when confronted with a similar task, \u201c \u2018all presumptions and intendments favor the validity of a statute and mere doubt does not afford sufficient reason for a judicial declaration of invalidity. Statutes must be upheld unless their unconstitutionality clearly, positively, and unmistakably appears.\u2019 <em>(In re Ricky H. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 513, 519 [86 Cal.Rptr. 76, 468 P.2d 204]; <em>In re Dennis M. </em>(1969) 70 Cal.2d 444, 453 [75 Cal.Rptr. 1, 450 P.2d 296]; <em>Lockheed Aircraft Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1946) 28 Cal.2d 481, 484 [171 P.2d 21, 166 A.L.R. 701].)\u201d <em>(Calfarm Ins.

The courts of this state have often <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>described the initiative and referendum as articulating one of the most precious rights of our democratic process. \u201c \u2018[I]t has long been our judicial policy to apply a liberal construction to this power wherever it is challenged in order that the right be not improperly annulled. If doubts can reasonably be resolved in favor of the use of this reserve power, courts will preserve it.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Associated Home Builders etc., Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Livermore </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 582, 591 [135 Cal.Rptr. 41, 557 P.2d 473, 92 A.L.R.3d 1038]; see also <em>Fair Political Practices Com. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 33, 41 [157 Cal.Rptr. 855, 599 P.2d 46]; <em>Farley </em>v. <em>Healey </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 325, 328 [62 Cal.Rptr. 26, 431 P.2d 650]; <em>Blotter </em>v. <em>Farrell </em>(1954) 42 Cal.2d 804, 812 [270 P.2d 481].)</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cThe words [of an initiative] must be read in a sense which harmonizes [them] with the subject-matter and the general purpose and object of the amendment, consistent of course with the language itself. The words must be understood, not as the words of the civil service commission, or the city council, or the mayor, or the city attorney, but as the words of the voters who adopted the amendment. They are to be understood in the common popular way, and, in the absence of some strong and convincing reason to the contrary, not found here, they are not entitled to be considered in a technical sense inconsistent with their popular meaning.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] To ascertain the intent of the electorate it is, of course, proper to consider the official statements made to the voters in connection with propositions of law they are requested to approve or reject. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Creighton </em>v. <em>City of Santa Monica </em>(1984) 160 Cal.App.3d 1011, 1018 [207 Cal.Rptr. 78].)</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Bearing in mind the foregoing interpretive aids, we turn first to plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the amended version of section 89001 usurps the state Legislature\u2019s constitutional and statutory authority to govern its internal affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">Article IV, section 7, subdivision (a) of the California Constitution directs that \u201c[e]ach house shall choose its officers and adopt rules for its proceedings.\u201d Plaintiffs maintain that section 89001 violates this exclusive mandate by interfering with various statutory enactments and house rules which allow a contingency fund for legislative expenses (see \u00a7 9126),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>vide for the rules committee to determine how expenditures from that fund are allocated, and establish a newsletter program for legislators to communicate with their constituents.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">As we see it, however, section 89001 does not attempt to regulate the manner in which the Legislature drafts its rules, appropriates its funds, or chooses its officers. The statute merely limits the Legislature\u2019s ability to utilize <em>public funds </em>for mass mailings to constituents and other members of the public. The mere labeling of the \u201cnewsletter program\u201d as an internal procedure of the Legislature does not make it so.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">While there can be no question that both the Senate and the Assembly possess the power to create and administer their own internal affairs, it does not strike us that the newsletter program in either house falls within the exclusive sway of the rulemaking process. These programs extend far beyond the halls of the Legislature and impact virtually every citizen of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">The rulemaking authority is limited to the internal workings of the Senate and Assembly and does not encompass matters which are addressed to the world outside the Legislature. We cannot agree with plaintiffs that section 89001 constitutes an impermissible attempt at rulemaking by the electorate. It is, instead, a valid effort by which the electorate seeks to control the allotment of limited state revenues and reform the electoral process. Said another way, the use of taxpayers\u2019 funds to pay for mass mailings by state legislators is not insulated from external control by article IV, section 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">The limitations provided for in section 89001 are substantially different from the initiative measure struck down in <em>People\u2019s Advocate, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 316 [226 Cal.Rptr. 640], a case upon which plaintiffs principally rely. There, the court held that the Legislative Reform Act of 1983, a statutory initiative measure, was violative of article IV, section 7 because it attempted to regulate the Legislature\u2019s adoption of rules, its selection of officers and employees, and the appointment of committee members. That measure also established, among other things, a formula for the Legislature\u2019s budget and sought to repeal section 9126, the statute granting the Senate Rules Committee the authority to disburse monies from the contingent fund. In declaring the majority of the act unconsti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>tutional, the court observed that \u201cthe people through the electorate have been given the power to make statutes, i.e., the power to make <em>laws </em>for all the people, but not the power to make rules for the selection of officers or rules of proceeding or rules which regulate the committees or employees of either or both houses of the Legislature. These powers . . . are exclusively the province of the houses affected by them.\u201d <em>(People\u2019s Advocate, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>at p. 326, italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">Unlike the initiative measure at issue in <em>People\u2019s Advocate, </em>section 89001 does not attempt to regulate any of the proceedings of either the Senate or Assembly, but merely restricts individual members from using public funds to send self-aggrandizing newsletters.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">We agree with the FPPC that the term \u201cproceedings\u201d as used in article IV, section 7, subdivision (a) does not refer to activities engaged in by individual legislators, but rather to activities by which the Legislature as a whole conducts its business. <em>People\u2019s Advocate </em>does not hold otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">It is hyperbole to say that an initiative which merely prohibits legislators from spending public funds on mass mailings somehow strangles the legislative process as a whole. We take judicial notice of the fact that the state Legislature has not ceased functioning because of the passage of Proposition 73 in June 1988 or its enforcement by the FPPC. The Legislature has continued to fulfill its constitutional obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">Plaintiffs nevertheless insist that the statute interferes with the Legislature\u2019s power to budget and appropriate money under article IV, section 12 of the California Constitution.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> That argument, however, misses the point. Section 89001 as written places no limitation whatsoever on the Legislature\u2019s authority to appropriate funds for its internal operations. It merely curbs individual legislators from using public funds to finance mass mailings to their constituents. Again, <em>People\u2019s Advocate, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>181 Cal.App.3d 316 is inapposite. Under section 89001, the Legislature, as pertains to its internal operations, retains full control over the budget process and may continue to appropriate monies for such purposes as it sees fit. As to the other types of appropriations, article IV, section 12 does not operate to restrict the initiative process set forth in article II, section 8 and which vests the electorate with a power equal to that of the Legislature to enact laws. (Cf. art. II, \u00a7 9, subd. (a); see also <em>Bd. of Osteopathic Examiners </em>v. <em>Riley </em>(1923) 192 Cal. 158 [218 P. 1018]; <em>Carlson </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1072\">*1072</page-number><em>Cory </em>(1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 724 [189 Cal.Rptr. 185].) Moreover, since the prohibition contained in section 89001 may be amended by statutory initiative or by referendum (see \u00a7\u00a7 81012, 85103), the Legislature is not divested of its authority to enact future legislation within its competence. (See Castello, <em>The Limits of Popular Sovereignty: Using the Initiative Power to Control Legislative Procedure </em>(1986) 74 Cal.L.Rev. 491 499, fn. 44.) We decline to follow any suggestion to the contrary in <em>People\u2019s Advocate, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>181 Cal.App.3d at pages 328-329.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>\u201c(e) The Legislature may control the submission, approval, and enforcement of budgets and the filing of claims for all State agencies.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1072\">*1072</page-number>Citing a vast array of state and federal cases, plaintiffs next assert that section 89001 violates numerous fundamental constitutional rights held by them as both elected representatives and as members of the electorate. Despite their broad assertion of such rights, plaintiffs have failed to identify any constitutional right to send newsletters and other mass mailings at public expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Although some of the federal \u201cfranking\u201d privilege cases cited by plaintiffs refer to a legislator\u2019s \u201cconstitutional duty to communicate with and inform their constituents on public matters\u201d <em>(Common Cause </em>v. <em>Bolger </em>(D.D.C. 1982) 574 F.Supp. 672, 677; see also <em>Bowie </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(E.D.Pa. 1972) 351 F.Supp. 628, 631; <em>Hoellen </em>v. <em>Annunzio </em>(7th Cir. 1972) 468 F.2d 522), none hold that the public <em>must </em>finance such communications.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">For the most part, these cases dealt with whether Congress\u2019s <em>statutorily </em>granted franking privilege (see 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 3210) was unconstitutional, or whether it had been abused by the mailing of various types of literature to members of the public. That is not the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">Assuming arguendo that there exists a constitutional duty for legislators to communicate with the electorate on matters of public concern and a corollary right of the electorate to receive such communication, the United States Supreme Court has made it clear that so long as a legislative act is not aimed primarily at suppression of speech the failure \u201cto subsidize the exercise of [such] right does not infringe [that] right.\u201d <em>(Regan </em>v. <em>Taxation with Representation of Wash. </em>(1983) 461 U.S. 540, 549 [76 L.Ed.2d 129, 139, 103 S.Ct. 1997].)</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">We are not here concerned with an enactment that seeks to control the content nor suppress any particular communication between individual legislators and their constituents. The statute does not contain a wholesale prohibition against legislators communicating with their constituents nor does it prevent public officials from receiving information from the electorate on matters of general concern. The principle articulated in <em>Regan </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1073\">*1073</page-number>squarely applies to section 8900 l\u2019s limitation against the use of public funds to finance mass mailings by state legislators.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\">Were the \u201cduty\u201d of a legislator to communicate and the corresponding \u201cright\u201d of members of the electorate to receive such communication equated with the freedom of speech as protected by the First Amendment, the question would immediately arise as to how that right would be enforced and by whom. What form of communication and with what frequency would discharge the duty or satisfy the right. In our opinion there is no such duty or right which can truly be said to enjoy constitutional protection in the manner urged by plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Plaintiffs further contend that limitation of section 89001 impermissibly burdens the rights to freedom of association, to vote, to petition the government for redress of grievances, and to instruct or recall elected representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">This overly broad assertion is merely makeweight in an endeavor to establish that somehow an elected official\u2019s constituents possess an absolute right to receive newsletters and other such communications at public expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">We are further told that the statute\u2019s prohibition against publicly financed mass mailings \u201cimproperly dilutes and interferes with the meaningful exercise of constitutional rights because it prevents those rights from being exercised in a fully informed and effective manner.\u201d None of the cases cited by plaintiffs, however, support the proposition that they advance here.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">The \u201cBill of Rights,\u201d as established in the first 10 amendments to the Constitution, simply bars governmental interference with those rights. It contains no guaranty that the government will monetarily subsidize the exercise of that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">The statute in question neither seeks to \u201cmuzzle\u201d elected officials nor impede the free flow of ideas between the electorate and the Legislature. It in no way diminishes the ability of any class of voters from exercising their right to vote, from petitioning the government, or from otherwise making their beliefs known to their elected representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">Having found that the statute has no real or appreciable impact on any right guaranteed by the state and federal Constitutions, we must also reject plaintiffs\u2019 contention that section 89001 be declared invalid unless its proponents demonstrate that it serves a compelling state interest and that it is narrowly drawn to achieve that end.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1074\">*1074</page-number>That form of analysis is generally reserved for those instances where the contested regulation impacts directly on the content of some restricted communication or directly interferes with the fairness and integrity of the electoral process. (See <em>Canaan </em>v. <em>Abdelnour </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 703, 710-713 [221 Cal.Rptr. 468, 710 P.2d 268, 69 A.L.R.4th 915]; <em>Gould </em>v. <em>Grubb </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 661, 670 [122 Cal.Rptr. 377, 536 P.2d 1337]; <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1972) <em>7 </em>Cal.3d 942, 952 [104 Cal.Rptr. 297, 501 P.2d 537]; see also <em>Common Cause </em>v. <em>Bolger, supra, </em>574 F.Supp. 672, 680-681.) Here, there is no such impact.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">The ballot arguments in favor of and in opposition to the enactment of Proposition 73, in addition to the impartial appraisal of the measure by the legislative analyst, makes it clear that the initiative as a whole sought to reform the electoral process, at least in part, by prohibiting the public subsidy of political campaigns by incumbent officeholders and their challengers alike. As a means of implementing that goal, the measure imposed restrictions on campaign contributions (see \u00a7\u00a7 85200-85202 and 85301-85305), limited honoraria (see \u00a7 85310), prohibited candidates for public office from using state revenues in their election campaigns (see \u00a7 85300), and circumscribed the use of mass mailings by elected officials (\u00a7 89001).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Even a cursory review of these provisions makes it manifest that the majority of the electorate who voted for Proposition 73 intended to control the conduct of both incumbents and those seeking public office by restricting the use of public funds. Section 89001 in particular appears to be directed at removing at least some of the substantial advantages enjoyed by incumbent office holders over their challengers.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This objective is, of course, in keeping with that portion of the Political Reform Act of 1974 which declares: \u201cLaws and practices unfairly favoring incumbents should be abolished in order that elections may be conducted more fairly.\u201d (\u00a7 81002, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">The statute at issue here helps in accomplishing that goal by prohibiting elected officials from using public moneys to perpetuate themselves in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1075\">*1075</page-number>public office. The legitimacy of such an objective is made clear by the Supreme Court\u2019s observation in <em>Stanson </em>v. <em>Mott </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 206, 217 [130 Cal.Rptr. 697, 551 P.2d 1]: \u201cA fundamental precept of this nation\u2019s democratic electoral process is that the government may not \u2018take sides\u2019 in election contests or bestow an unfair advantage on one of several competing factions. A principal danger feared by our country\u2019s founders lay in the possibility that the holders of governmental authority would use official power improperly to perpetuate themselves, or their allies, in office [citations]; <em>the selective use of public funds in election campaigns, of course, raises the specter of just such an improper distortion of the democratic electoral process. \u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">We are convinced that section 89001, by denying elected officials of all political persuasions the advantage of using public funds to put or keep their name before the voters, advances the legitimate state interest in avoiding \u201carbitrary preferment of one candidate over another by reason of incumbency.\u201d <em>(Gould </em>v. <em>Grubb, supra, </em>14 Cal.3d 661, 677.) We also think it clear that the initiative serves the very legitimate aim of conserving limited state revenues by prohibiting the use of public funds for essentially political purposes. These twin goals of the statute constitute a permissible, if not significant, governmental interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Plaintiffs maintain, however, that even if section 89001 advances a compelling interest its scope is too broad to withstand constitutional scrutiny. In support of that argument, plaintiffs insist that the general wording of the statute not only prohibits the distribution of legislative newsletters, but all other forms of mass mailings by the government as well. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Such an interpretation conflicts with the clear intent of the initiative measure as a whole. Nothing in Proposition 73 could have led the electorate to believe that the adoption of the measure would result in a total ban on all mass mailings, including legal notices, tax bills, sample ballots, and college catalogs. As previously discussed, <em>supra, </em>the initiative sought specifically to reform the political process by prohibiting the public subsidy of political campaigns and by attempting to limit some of the advantages enjoyed by incumbent office holders.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">Any contrary interpretation would result in the repeal of countless statutes and regulations that require the mailing of various notices and other documents by governmental agencies. We seriously doubt that the electorate intended such a result by passing Proposition 73. In reaching this conclusion we are, of course, guided by the well-settled rule that \u201c[t]he literal language of enactments may be disregarded to avoid absurd results and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1076\">*1076</page-number>fulfill the apparent intent of the framers.\u201d <em>(Amador Valley Joint Union High Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d 208, 245.)</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">In any event, regulation 18901, promulgated by the FPPC in exercise of the duties imposed upon it by the Political Reform Act of 1974 (see \u00a7 83112), clarifies any ambiguity that may exist in the practical application of the statute. Such regulations are deemed valid so long as they are \u201c \u2018consistent and not in conflict with the statute and reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute.\u2019 ([\u00a7 11342.2].)\u201d <em>(Consumer Union of U.S., Inc. </em>v. <em>California Milk Producers Advisory Bd. </em>(1978) 82 Cal.App.3d 433, 447 [147 Cal.Rptr. 265].)</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Contrary to the argument advanced by plaintiffs, the FPPC has not rewritten section 89001, but has merely interpreted it in a manner consistent with the intent of the electorate in adopting Proposition 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">In keeping with the spirit of the initiative, the regulation merely precludes the public funding of newsletters which feature any particular legislator or other elected official by name. It does not prohibit legislative committees and the like from using state revenues to disseminate information to the public as deemed necessary. We agree with the FPPC that the effect of regulation 18901 is to permit the free flow of necessary government information while reducing the political benefit realized by incumbent elected officials from the sending of newsletters and other such mass mailings. This is totally consistent with the FPPC\u2019s duty to implement the <em>intent </em>and not the <em>literal language </em>of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">Lastly, we consider plaintiffs\u2019 contention that Proposition 73, by including within its provisions the prohibition at issue violated the single-subject requirement of article II, section 8, subdivision (d) of the California Constitution. That provision declares, \u201cAn initiative measure embracing more than one subject may not be submitted to the electors or have any effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">In determining whether a measure embraces more than one subject, our Supreme Court has held on more than one occasion that \u201c\u2018an initiative measure does not violate the single-subject requirement if, despite its varied collateral effects, <em>all of its parts are \u201creasonably germane\u201d </em>to each other,\u2019 and to the general purpose or object of the initiative. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Brosnahan </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 236, 245 [186 Cal.Rptr. 30, 651 P.2d 274], italics in original; see also <em>Fair Political Practices Com. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d 33, 37-43; <em>Amador Valley Joint Union High Sch.

In a more recent discus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1077\">*1077</page-number>sion of the issue, the court emphasized that initiatives encompassing a wide range of diverse measures may withstand challenge so long as their provisions are \u201ceither functionally related to one another or are reasonably germane to one another or the objects of the enactment.\u201d <em>(Harbor </em>v. <em>Deukmejian </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1078, 1100 [240 Cal.Rptr. 569, 742 P.2d 1290]; see also <em>California Trial Lawyers Assn. </em>v. <em>Eu </em>(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 351, 358 [245 Cal.Rptr. 916].)</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">We conclude that the amendment of section 89001 was directly related to the overall aim of Proposition 73. There is a reasonable connection between the prohibition of publicly financed mass mailings by elected officials and the reformation of the political process. No further discussion is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Plaintiffs, however, see something sinister in the fact that neither the ballot title (\u201cCampaign Funding. Contribution Limits. Prohibition of Public Financing.\u201d) nor the ballot arguments contain a direct reference to the ban on mass mailings at public expense. For obvious reasons, article II, section 8, subdivision (d) does not expressly require that <em>every </em>subject of an initiative be stated in its title. <em>(Harbor </em>v. <em>Deukmejian, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 1098; <em>California Trial Lawyers </em>v. <em>Eu, supra, </em>200 Cal.App.3d at p. 358; see also <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Superior </em>(1932) 215 Cal. 58, 62-63 [8 P.2d 467].) Nevertheless, that portion of Proposition 73\u2019s title which declares one of the purposes of the initiative to be \u201cProhibition of Public Financing\u201d directly relates to the amendment of section 89001.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">We also note that in <em>Fair Political Practices Com. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d 33, the Supreme Court found that the Political Reform Act of 1974, the initiative measure which Proposition 73 amended, did not violate the single-subject rule. Included within the provisions of that wide ranging act was former section 89001 which itself prohibited the use of public funds for mass mailings under certain conditions. Those conditions were simply geared to the situation where an incumbent has openly declared an intent to stand for reelection. It would be the ultimate in naivete to suggest that no incumbent can be considered to be seeking reelection until such time as he or she is required to openly declare such intent. Proposition 73 simply changes the time frame in which the already established prohibition is to operate.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">The essence of plaintiffs\u2019 argument is that the electorate, in approving Proposition 73 and its ban on publicly funded newsletters and other mass mailings by elected officials, simply did not realize what it was doing because of the way in which the initiative was worded or because of the placement of the measure\u2019s operative provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number>When Proposition 73 is considered in light of the political and social milieu that existed at the time of its adoption, we are convinced that the voters were not deluded into believing that the measure was something that it was not. The majority that voted for the reforms promised by the initiative undoubtedly concluded that existing methods of campaign financing had been unsuccessful in bringing a measure of equality and fairness to the political process.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">These measures received widespread publicity, some more than others, and were hotly debated in the media. In light of the attention that was focused on this initiative in the days and weeks preceding the election, we cannot presume that the people did not know what they were about in approving the measure.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">\u201cAs succinctly and graphically expressed a number of years ago in a study of the California procedure, \\ . . the initiative is in essence <em>a legislative battering ram </em>which may be used to tear through the exasperating tangle of the traditional legislative procedure and strike directly toward the desired end. Virtually every type of interest-group has on occasion used this instrument. It is deficient as a means of legislation in that it permits very little balancing of interests or compromise, but it was designed primarily for use in situations where the ordinary machinery of legislation had utterly failed in this respect. It has served, with varying degrees of efficacy, as a vehicle for the advocacy of action ultimately undertaken by the representative body.\u2019 (Key &amp; Couch, The Initiative and the Referendum in Cal. (1939) p. 485, italics added.)\u201d <em>(Amador Valley Joint Union High Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equalization, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d 208, 228-229.)</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Although we express no opinion as to the wisdom or utility of Proposition 73 and the amendment of section 89001, we find no constitutional or legal barrier which would prevent the electorate from prohibiting the use of state revenues to fund the publication and distribution of newsletters and other mass mailings by elected officials. Simply put, section 89001 passes constitutional muster.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">The judgment in case No. C691676 declaring section 89001 unconstitutional is reversed, and the order in case No. C722189 denying injunctive relief is affirmed.

This point was emphasized in <em>Common Cause </em>v. <em>Bolger, supra, </em>574 F. Supp. at page 677, where the court observed: \u201c[I]t stands to reason that incumbency alone is a valuable asset to the public official who seeks reelection. An incumbent Member of Congress enjoys a certain \u2018visibility\u2019 among his constituents that a challenger may find difficult or impossible to match. It is also beyond argument that any communication with constituents, whether through local meetings or through the mail or mass media, contributes to such visibility and thus may have a direct effect (however slight) in influencing the outcome of an election. To the extent that the effect is positive from the incumbent\u2019s standpoint, it is undoubtedly detrimental to his challenger\u2019s position. This is so whether the communication is part of an overt campaign effort or made simply in the normal course of a member\u2019s representative function.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
