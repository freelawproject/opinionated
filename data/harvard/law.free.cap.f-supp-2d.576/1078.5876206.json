PERRY, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1116-14\">Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel in the 32 cases listed above have moved to remand each of these cases to state court. It appears to me that the motions are identical or nearly so. In order to rule on these motions efficiently and in a timely manner, I wish to consider them collectively, if possible. I am concerned, however, that some of them may present unique issues requiring individual attention, and I need guidance from plaintiffs\u2019 counsel on whether that is so. I will therefore direct plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to file a summary of the issues presented in the motions to remand. This should be in the form of a short summation, outline, or chart that specifies where each case originated, identifies each party to each case and the citizenship of each party, describes the basis for the remand motion, and sets out whether the issues presented by the motion to remand are the same or different from those presented by the other motions. The filing should specify clearly whether any motion presents unique issues not shared with other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-16\">Additionally, I will order defense counsel to file a single response brief for all cases and plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to file a single reply brief. All of these filings should be made in the main (4:06MD 1811CDP) case only.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-17\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-18\">IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that counsel for the plaintiffs in the above-captioned eases shall, no later than <em>Friday, October 3, 2008, </em>file the summation of the issues presented in the motions to remand described above.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-19\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that defense counsel shall file a single response brief no later than <em>Wednesday, October 15, 2008. </em>The response brief will be limited to thirty pages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-20\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel shall file a single reply brief no later than <em>Monday, October 27, 2008, </em>and this brief shall be limited to fifteen pages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-21\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the documents specified in this order shall be filed in Case No. 4:06MD 1811CDP only.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
