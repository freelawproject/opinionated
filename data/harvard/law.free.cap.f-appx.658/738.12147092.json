Arguing that complete diversity existed at the time of remand between the plaintiffs and Lloyd\u2019s, the only remaining defendant, Lloyd\u2019s contends that the court was without discretion to remand the case. Due to the absence of allegations or evidence that would allow us to conclusively address this claim, we vacate the district court\u2019s remand order and remand the case to district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b759-17\">Because we are concerned not with the merits of this case but with the district court\u2019s jurisdiction to decide it, an abbreviated rendition of the facts will suffice. Joannie Jefferson and other plaintiffs sued various defendants in Louisiana state court for various state-law claims related to asbestos exposure. The plaintiffs eventually amended their complaint to name Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s, London (Lloyd\u2019s) as an additional defendant on the theory that it was liable as an excess insurer. Subsequently, one of the original defendants named the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa, Ltd. (IDC) and another entity as third-party defendants. IDC removed the case to federal district court under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, asserting that it was a \u201cpolitical subdivision, agency or instrumentality\u201d of the South African government.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The propriety of that removal is not in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-18\">Once in federal court, the case was transferred to the court overseeing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>multidistrict litigation on asbestos. That court granted summary judgment in favor of the South African entities and, exercising supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining claims, transferred the case back to the Eastern District of Louisiana. After more defendants were dismissed pursuant to a settlement, Lloyd\u2019s was the sole remaining defendant in the case. The district court then, sua sponte, remanded the matter back to Louisiana state court in accordance with 28 TJ.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c) after asserting that \u201cthe remaining parties in the matter are not diverse.\u201d Lloyd\u2019s timely appealed, arguing that the remaining parties were in fact diverse and the district court thus had no discretion to remand the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Before addressing the merits of this appeal, \u201cwe must first assure ourselves of our jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiffs claim that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d), which provides that \u201c[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal,\u201d prohibits appellate review of the remand order in question here. But as they candidly acknowledge,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> their jurisdictional challenge to this appeal is foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Carlsbad Technology v. HIF Bio, Inc.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In accordance with these decisions, we have consistently exercised appellate jurisdiction to review remand orders in which \u201cthe district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction after first concluding it lacked original subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Our obligation is to \u201cdetermine whether the district court had original subject-matter jurisdiction over the remanded claims,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and we turn to that task.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-13\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b760-14\">\u201cWhether a district court has the discretion to remand a case to state court is a legal question this court reviews de novo.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> When a district court has original subject-matter jurisdiction over a claim, it has no authority to remand the case to state court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-15\">Lloyd\u2019s asserts that the district court lacked authority to remand the suit to state court because there was diversity of citizenship between Lloyd\u2019s, the only remaining defendant in the case at the time the case was remanded, and the plaintiffs. Although the suit was originally removed to federal court on another basis, Lloyd\u2019s continues, diversity of citizenship is now an appropriate basis for subject-matter jurisdiction because the claims against the non-diverse defendants have been dismissed. Jefferson responds that the presence of non-diverse defendants at the time of filing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>is dispositive, and the district court therefore only had supplemental jurisdiction, which it properly declined to exercise.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Two basic principles guide our decision. First, as a general proposition, the dismissal of non-diverse parties may result in diversity jurisdiction, at least in some circumstances. In <em>Newman-Green, Inc. v. Alfonzo-Larrain, </em>the Supreme Court approved the practice of dismissing 'non-diverse defendants under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21 and exercising diversity jurisdiction over the controversy that remains.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Court, in <em>Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis,</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>declined to disturb a judgment in a case that was improperly removed to federal court on diversity grounds despite the presence of non-diverse defendants. As the Court later explained in <em>Grupo Dataflux v. Atlas Global Group, L.P.,</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201c[t]he postsettlement dismissal of the diversity-destroying defendant\u201d in <em>Caterpillar </em>\u201ccured the jurisdictional defect\u201d created by the presence of the non-diverse party.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In neither <em>Newman-Green </em>nor <em>Caterpillar </em>did the absence of complete diversity at the time of filing or the time of removal preclude the later exercise of diversity jurisdiction.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Put differently, the absence of complete diversity at the time of commencement of an action can generally be cured\u2014and diversity jurisdiction established\u2014by the dismissal of non-diverse parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-14\">The plaintiffs argue otherwise, relying on the venerable rule that \u201cthe jurisdiction of the court depends upon the state of things at the time of the action brought.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This rule clearly applies, for example, to a party\u2019s attempts to create diversity with a post-filing change of citizenship,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> to the addition of certain non-diverse parties after a suit is brought in federal court,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and to post-removal diminutions of the amount in controversy.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> But the time-of-filing rule cannot be applied indiscriminately to cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>involving the dismissal of parties, as <em>Newman-Green </em>and <em>Caterpillar </em>indicate. Here, to be sure, the non-diverse parties were not\u2014as in Newman-Green\u2014dismissed pursuant to Rule 21, and we are not\u2014as in Caterpillar\u2014addressing whether to disturb a final judgment. Those cases establish, however, the broader proposition\u2014followed by courts in a number of different contexts\u2014that the complete diversity of remaining parties to an action generally suffices to secure subject-matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In the present case, the district court had an alternate basis of subject-matter jurisdiction at each preceding stage of the litigation: the case was properly removed under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act once the South African entities were added as parties, and the district court properly exercised supplemental jurisdiction once those entities were dismissed. The dismissal of the claims against the non-diverse defendants \u201cconverted\u201d the \u201cless-than-complete diversity which had subsisted throughout the action ,.. to complete diversity.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">The second principle is that \u201cthe propriety of the district court\u2019s remand order is judged at the time of that order, not the time of the original removal.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> At least twice, we have applied this rule to support the exercise of subject-matter jurisdiction on grounds other than those upon which removal was based.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>We have recently applied this maxim to vacate a remand order based on a ground for subject-matter jurisdiction that only arose <em>after </em>the case was removed to federal court. In <em>Firefighters\u2019 Retirement System v. Citco Group Ltd., </em>a case properly removed to federal court based on a related Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, the district court permissively abstained from exercising jurisdiction and equitably remanded the case to state court.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> On appeal, we addressed whether the district court had the discretion to remand in light of the post-removal filing of a Chapter 15 bankruptcy.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> After interpreting the relevant statute to preclude equitable remand of cases related to Chapter 15 bankruptcies, we applied the rule that \u201c[ojnce the district court has assumed jurisdiction over a properly removed case ... [tjhe district court\u2019s authority to remand the case to state court depends on the nature of the district court\u2019s jurisdiction over the claims that comprise the case <em>at the time of the </em>remand.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We therefore vacated the remand order, concluding that although the Chapter 15 filing occurred <em>after </em>removal to federal court, the propriety of the district court\u2019s remand order is judged in this context at the time of remand, not the time of removal.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Similarly, in <em>Sigmon v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>we concluded that even if a case had been improvidently removed to federal court, the district court \u201cacquired jurisdiction, if it did not already exist, when the plaintiffs amended their federal complaint to include an implied cause of action under federal law.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">These principles, taken together, resolve the legal question at the center of this case. Dismissals of non-diverse parties allow for the exercise of diversity jurisdiction, and the propriety of remand in a properly removed case is judged on the basis of the district court\u2019s jurisdiction over the claims remaining at the time of remand, not the time of removal. We thus conclude that the district court had no discretion to remand this case if the remaining parties were diverse at the time of removal.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">We turn to the question of whether the remaining parties are in fact diverse. Due to the posture of this case, that is no simple matter: the case was removed by one of the South African entities under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (which does not depend, of course, on the parties\u2019 citizenship), and the district court remanded the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Lloyd\u2019s without ordering briefing on the matter. The record is thus incomplete in material respects. In particular, while the record suggests that the plaintiffs may be citizens of Louisiana, Texas, or Wisconsin, the citizenship of Lloyd\u2019s remains unclear. Lloyd\u2019s is a citizen of every state in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>it has been incorporated or has its principal place of business.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> It is also, by virtue of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, a citizen of every state in which its alleged insured, Lykes Bros. Steamship Co. (Lykes), is a citizen.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Although the district court\u2019s remand order stated that \u201cthe remaining parties in the matter are not diverse,\u201d we are unable to ascertain the basis for the court\u2019s conclusion in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">On appeal, Lloyd\u2019s avers that Lykes \u201cwas not a citizen of Louisiana, Texas, or Wisconsin\u201d at the relevant time. In support of this conclusion, it states Lykes moved its headquarters from Louisiana to Florida sometime prior to 1995 and that a bankruptcy court confirmed the sale of Lykes to a limited liability company in 1997. That limited liability company, it says, was an indirect subsidiary of a conglomerate that included another company that was in turn bought by a company \u201cheadquartered in Germany\u201d that was merged with a different German company in 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">The factual material offered by Lloyd\u2019s does not suffice to establish whether Lloyd\u2019s and the plaintiffs were diverse at the time of removal.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> First, the series of events described by Lloyd\u2019s ends in 2005, some five years before the case was removed, and is not accompanied by any argumentation connecting those events to Lloyd\u2019s state(s) of citizenship. Second, we must decline to take judicial notice of the post-bankruptcy history of Lykes recounted by Lloyd\u2019s in its brief.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Mostly drawn from a 2005 press release, these facts are not \u201cgenerally known within the trial court\u2019s territorial jurisdiction\u201d and cannot be \u201caccurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The request that we take judicial notice of 1997 bankruptcy proceedings confirming the sale of Lykes to a limited liability company is less problematic,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> but those proceedings do little to establish Lykes\u2019s citizenship at the time the action was removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-12\">It is, of course, the obligation of the party seeking the federal forum to establish subject-matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Here, however, Lloyd\u2019s\u2014the party opposing remand\u2014did not have an opportunity to be heard on the matter before the district court concluded that the remaining parties are not diverse. Because the citizenship of Lloyd\u2019s is not clearly established by the record, we vacate the district court\u2019s remand order and remand to the district court for further proceedings to determine whether it has diversity jurisdiction over the remaining claims.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"pApy\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE the order of the district court and REMAND this case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b759-13\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir.
