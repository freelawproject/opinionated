For the reasons stated in the District Court\u2019s dispositive order, which appears in the appendix, we find no error in the Court\u2019s application of \u00a7 9-11-68. Nor do we find abuse of discretion in the amount the Court awarded appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-15\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b548-16\">OPINION AND ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b548-17\">This matter is before the Court on Defendants OxBlue Corporation, Chandler McCormack, Bryan Mattern and John Paulson\u2019s (together, \u201cOxBlue\u201d) Motion for Attorneys\u2019 Fees and Expenses Pursuant to FRCP 54(d), L.R. 54.2 and O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-11-68 [311] (\u201cMotion\u201d), and Plaintiff EarthCam. Inc.\u2019s (\u201cEarthCam\u201d) Additional Adverse Submissions in Response to the OxBlue Defendants\u2019 Motion for Attorneys\u2019 Fees and Expenses [322] (the \u201cAdditional Adverse\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>1. BACKGROUND<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">On August 1, 2013, OxBlue served an offer of compromise (the \u201cOffer\u201d) to EarthCam in accordance with O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-ll-68(a). (See Mot. at Ex. A).'Earth-Cam did not respond to the Offer within 30 days of service. (Id. at Ex. B). OxBlue, therefore, deemed the Offer rejected under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-ll-68(c). (Id. at 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">On September 22, 2014, the Court entered an Order [292] granting OxBlue\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment on all of EarthCam\u2019s claims. EarthCam thus did not recover anything in this action, and, on March 31, 2015, judgment was' entered in favor of OxBlue [309]. On April 30, 2015, EarthCam filed its Notice of Appeal [313] from the judgment in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">On April 14, 2015, OxBlue filed its Motion seeking attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-11-68. OxBlue argues that, because EarthCam did not recover at least \u201c75 percent of [OxBlue]\u2019s offer of settlement,\u201d OxBlue \u201c[is] entitled to recover reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses incurred by [OxBlue] from the date of the rejection of the offer of settlement through the entry of judgment[.]\u201d O.C.G;A. \u00a7 9-1 1\u201468(b)(Z). EarthCam opposes the Motion on the grounds that: (1) O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-11-68 conflicts with federal law and therefore should not be applied; (2) OxBlue\u2019s Motion is \u201cpremature under the plain language\u201d of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-11-68; and (3) if the Court applies O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-11-68, the application should be limited in scope, taking into account the varied federal and state claims ad counterclaims in this action. (Resp. [316] at 1-2).</p>\n<p id=\"ArR\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">A. Applicability of O.C.G.A \u00a7 9-11-68 in Federal Court</p>\n<p id=\"b549-12\">The Court first addresses whether O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-11-68 applies to this case. EarthCam argues that Fed. R, Civ. P. 68 (\u201cRule 68\u201d) preempts O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-11-68. (See Resp. at 3-7). The Court disagrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-13\">Under the Erie<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> doctrine, a federal court adjudicating state law claims must apply state substantive law and federal procedural law. See Gasperini v. Ctr. for Humanities, Inc., 518 U.S. 415, 427 (1996). This rule applies also where a federal court decides supplemental state law claims. Lundgren v. McDaniel, 814 F.2d 600, 605 (11th Cir. 1987); see also United Mine Workers of Am. v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 726 (1966) (indicating that the Erie doctrine applies to supplemental state claims litigated in federal courts); Mace v. Van Ru Credit Corp., 109 F.3d 338, 346 (7th Cir. 1997) (holding that in reviewing a state claim pursuant to supplemental jurisdiction, federal courts apply state substantive law and federal procedural law). In the Eleventh Circuit, to determine whether state or federal law should be applied to a particular issue, the Court must engage in a multi-part analysis. See Wheatley v. Moe\u2019s Sw. Grill LLC. 580 F. Supp. 2d 1324, 1327 (N.D. Ga. 2008). \u201cThe first step is for the court to determine whether state and federal law conflict with respect to the disputed issue.\u201d Id. (citing Esfeld v. Costa Crociere, S.PA., 289 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir. 2002)). \u201cIf no conflict exists, then the analysis need proceed no further, for the court can apply state and federal law harmoniously to the issue at hand.\u201d Esfeld, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>289 F.3d at 1306-1307. If the laws conflict, the Court must determine whether a congressional statute or Federal Rule of Civil Procedure addresses the disputed issue. Wheatley, 580 F.Supp.2d at 1327 (citing Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S. 460, 469-70, 85 S.Ct. 1136, 14 L.Ed.2d 8 (1965)). \u201cIf a federal statute or rule does directly cover the disputed issue, the court is to apply federal law. If no federal statute or rule is on point, then the court must determine whether federal judge-made law, rather than state law, should be applied.\u201d Id. (internal of quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">In Tanker Mgmt., Inc. v. Brunson, 918 F.2d 1524, 1528 (11th Cir. 1990), the Eleventh Circuit applied a \u201cdirect collision\u201d test to determine whether a Florida statute similar to O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-11-68 conflicted with Rule 68:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-6\">Appellant\u2019s argument in favor of Rule 68 fails initially because Rule 68 is not in \u201cdirect collision\u201d with the portion of F.S.A. \u00a7 45.061 applicable in this case. Rule 68 concerns only interest and offers of judgment, while the Florida statute concerns attorney\u2019s fees, offers of judgment and settlement offers. Thus, the circumstances here are similar to those in <em>Walker v. Armco Steel Corp., </em>446 U.S. 740, 100 S.Ct. 1978, 64 L.Ed.2d 659 [ (citations omitted) ] (1980), in which the Court in a diversity action was asked to determine whether the federal court should follow state law or, alternatively, Fed. R. Civ. P. 3 in deciding when an action is commenced for the purpose of tolling the state statute of limitations. In the course of holding that Oklahoma law controlled, the Court stated: \u201c \u2018[T]he scope of the Federal Rule [is] not as broad as the losing party urge[s], and therefore, there being no Federal Rule which cover[s] the point in dispute, <em>E\u00f1e </em>command[s] the enforcement of state law.\u2019 \u201d 446 U.S. 740, 750, 100 S.Ct. 1978, 64 L.Ed.2d 659 [ (citations omitted) ] (1980) (citing <em>Hanna v. Plumer, </em>380 U.S. 460, 472, 85 S.Ct. 1136, 14 L.Ed.2d 8 [ (citations omitted) ] (1965)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">Tanker, 918 F.2d at 1528.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">In Wheatley, the Court applied Tanker to determine that \u201cRule 68 and O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-11-68 are not in \u2018direct collision\u2019 with one another. Rule 68 is available only to a party defending against a claim, whereas O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-11-68 is available to both plaintiffs and defendants.\u201d 580 F.Supp.2d at 1328. The Court also determined that the two provisions differ in allowing recovery of costs as well as in allowing the offeror to place conditions on the acceptance of an offer of settlement. Id. at 1328-29. The Court noted that \u201cRule 68 authorizes offers of judgment, not offers of settlement, as is the case with O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-11-68.\u201d Id. at 1328. The Court determined that O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-11-68 \u201ccreates a substantive right to attorney\u2019s fees....\u201d Id. at 1329. Because the law is substantive and \u201cdoes not conflict with federal law or rule or procedure, the Court is bound to apply it to this case.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-12\">EarthCam argues that Tanker is not controlling, because it concerns the application of a Florida statute to purely state law claims. While Tanker concerned the application <em>of </em>a Florida statute, EarthCam concedes the statute is similar to O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-11-68. (See Resp. at 4). More importantly, while the holding of Tanker is not controlling in this case, the Court is required to apply Tanker\u2019s \u201cdirect collision\u201d analysis.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In Wheatley, the Court conduct<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>ed this analysis with respect to O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-11-68, and found that it did not conflict with Rule 68. EarthCam has not offered a compelling reason for the Court not to apply this precedent. The fact that both Tanker and Wheatley were \u201cpure diversity case[s],\u201d (Resp. at 5), does not change the analysis. The Erie doctrine applies\u2014and the analysis is identical\u2014where the Court has supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims. See Palm Beach Golf Center-Boca, Inc. v. John G. Sarris, D.D.S., PA, 781 F.3d 1245, 1259 (11th Cir. 2015) (\u201cIt is well established that ... the Erie doctrine also applies to pendent state claims litigated in federal courts.\u201d (internal quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">Accordingly, because O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-11-68 is substantive, and because it does not conflict with Rule 68, O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-11-68 must be applied. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">B. Timeliness of OxBlue\u2019s Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">EarthCam next argues that Ox-Blue\u2019s Motion \u201cis premature under the plain language of the statute.\u201d (Resp. at 2). O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-ll-68(d) states, in relevant part, that \u201cif an appeal is taken from [the] judgment, the court shall order payment of such attorney\u2019s fees and expenses of litigation only upon remitter affirming such judgment.\u201d EarthCam cites two cases, Hall v. 84 Lumber Co., No. CV409-057, 2012 WL 1058875, at *1 (S.D. Ga. Mar 28, 2012) and Wheatley, 580 F.Supp.2d at 1325, in support of its argument that the determination of attorneys\u2019 -fees and expenses must wait until EarthCam\u2019s appeal is concluded. Neither case is controlling, and neither case is directly on point.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-12\">In Hall, the Southern District of Georgia determined that an award of attorneys\u2019 fees under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-11-68 was premature because the court \u201cha[d] yet to enter any final judgment.\u201d 2012 WL 1058875, at *1. The Hall court\u2019s conclusion that an award of attorneys\u2019 fees was premature was \u201creinforced by the requirement that a court may only order payment of fees and expenses after either the judgment has been affirmed on appeal or the time to file an appeal has lapsed.\u201d H. The Hall court, however, did not directly address whether an award of attorneys\u2019 fees is premature if a final judgment has been entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-13\">In Wheatley, the Court noted, in passing, that it had \u201creserved ruling on Defendants\u2019 motion until a final disposition was reached by the Eleventh Circuit.\u201d 580 F.Supp.2d at 1325. The Court did not address its reasons for reserving ruling, and did not address the issue whether a ruling on a motion for attorneys\u2019 fees under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-11-68 is premature prior to a disposition on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-14\">The parties have not cited, and the Court is unable to find, any controlling cases on this issue. The statute states that \u201cthe court shall order payment ... only upon remitter affirming such judgment.\u201d O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-ll-68(d). The plain language of the statute bars the Court from <em>ordering payment </em>until its judgment is affirmed. The statute does not preclude Ox-Blue from filing its Motion, and does not preclude the Court from ruling on it before EarthCam\u2019s appeal is concluded. In the absence of controlling precedent, the Court concludes it is permitted to rule on OxBlue\u2019s motion, but not require payment until EarthCam\u2019s appeal is concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>C. Challenge to Specific Fee and Expense Amounts under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-11-68</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Finally, EarthCam argues that the attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses for which Ox-Blue seeks to be reimbursed should be reduced because: (1) the attorneys\u2019 fees claimed include \u201csubstantial time on work related to the federal question claims\u201d (EarthCam\u2019s copyright infringement and Computer Fraud and Abuse claims, and OxBlue\u2019s copyright infringement and Lan-ham Act claims); (2) the attorneys\u2019 fees claimed \u201cinclude work on Defendant Richard Hermann\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Count VI of EarthCam\u2019s complaint that Mr. Hermann agreed he would absorb\u201d; and (3) the .attorneys\u2019 fees claimed include charges for non-litigation work, which OxBlue\u2019s counsel agreed to exclude.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Additional Adverse at 2-3). The Court considers these arguments separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">1. <em>Federal Question Claims Work</em></p>\n<p id=\"ASv\">The claims asserted by EarthCam in this case rest on claimed intrusions by OxBlue into Plaintiffs computer system to wrongfully obtain information about EarthCam products. On this set of facts, EarthCam asserted federal and state law claims based on the alleged intrusions and claimed resulting damages. These claims, the Court found, failed and were dismissed. EarthCam now seeks to deconstruct the claims alleged to support its argument that a- substantial portion of the attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses claimed by OxBlue were for defending EarthCam\u2019s summary judgment motion on its federal claims. OxBlue argues that the interrelationship of EarthCam\u2019s federal and state claims resulted in all of the work performed to litigate the federal claims on summary judgment applying equally to litigation of EarthCam\u2019s state law claims, thus allowing OxBlue to claim all of the fees and expenses it incurred in this matter from September 1, 2013, to that date judgment was'entered in OxBlue\u2019s favor on all claims. Put another way, OxBlue argues that all work performed was required for the state law and federal law claims in this case and because no work applied to the federal claims alone, all of the attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses charged are reasonable under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-11-68. The amount for which OxBlue is allowed to be compensated under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-11-68 is between these two outlier positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">It is impossible to reconstruct the time allocated to each different claim in a case like this where federal and state claims, arising from the same essential operative facts, substantially overlap and where the litigation activity benefits advocacy on both sets of claims. In the Court\u2019s practice and judicial experience in cases like these, the better' approach is to evaluate what legal services and expenses would have been incurred if EarthCam had not asserted its federal claims, and relied only on its state law causes of action. Considering the contentiousness of this litigation, the level of legal services and fees to litigate the federal claims only moderately added to the litigation activity required in this action after September 1, 2013, and thus a substantial portion of the attorneys\u2019 fees and legal services claimed by OxBlue were incurred to litigate state law-based claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">OxBlue\u2019s \u201cwe are entitled to all the award we claimed\u201d approach itself ignores that it necessarily incurred some attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses that were required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>solely because of the federal law claims EarthCam asserted. The Court agrees that arguments in pleadings relating to Earth-Cam\u2019s federal claims, drafting of a discussion of the legal claims asserted, and a discussion of the facts relating to the federal claims were activities uniquely required by the fact federal claims were asserted. These activities must reasonably be deducted from the attorneys\u2019 fees claims OxBlue asserts.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">The Court reviewed the annotated statements attached to EarthCam\u2019s Additional Adverse and the arguments set out by both parties. Based on this review and applying the Court\u2019s litigation and judicial experience in assessing attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses in civil litigation, the Court concludes that OxBlue\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees and expense claim should be reduced by $23,000 to reflect work reasonably allocated to its litigation of only the federal claims asserted in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">\n<em>2.Hermann Summary Judgment Motion Attorneys\u2019 Fees and Expenses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">EarthCam argues that the Consent Order entered in this action on March 31, 2015, precludes an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses incurred by Defendant Her-mann\u2019s separate counsel. The Court is satisfied that the charges EarthCam challenges were related to OxBlue\u2019s litigation of the claims in which it was involved, and EarthCam\u2019s request to exclude them is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">\n<em>3.Smith Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">OxBlue agrees it is not entitled to be compensated for services performed by Ms. Smith on March 3, 4 and 14, 2014. EarthCam\u2019s request to exclude these fees, in the amount of $1,065.00, is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-12\">\n<em>4.Gregory\u2019s Travel Expenses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AEm\">EarthCam contends OxBlue is not entitled to be compensated for the work and travel performed by an attorney for OxBlue who was employed in OxBlue\u2019s counsel\u2019s Jacksonville, Florida office. EarthCam argues that \u201cclients often do not pay for travel time even for trips required by litigation events such as out-of-state depositions.\u201d (Additional Adverse at 16). OxBlue represents that Gregory\u2019s travel and work was specific to this case and Gregory was assigned to perform it because it was efficient and cost effective to do so. EarthCam\u2019s argument, nitpicking at best, does not provide any basis to exclude the amount claimed for Gregory\u2019s work.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-13\">\n<em>5.Pre-September, I, 2013</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b553-14\">Finally, EarthCam seeks to reduce Ox-Blue\u2019s claim for two transcripts of depositions taken in August 2013, and one meal consumed in August 2013, before OxBlue\u2019s demand under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-11-68 was deemed rejected. OxBlue states that it is \u201cnot seeking to recover attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses that occurred in August 2013,\u201d and does not specifically oppose the reduction of the transcript and meal expense. (Reply [323] at 13). The amounts, totaling $6,931.85, are required to be deducted from OxBlue\u2019s claim for expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-15\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b553-16\">For the foregoing reasons,</p>\n<p id=\"b553-17\">IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendants OxBlue Corporation, Chandler McCormack, Bryan Mattern and John Paulson\u2019s (together, \u201cOxBlue\u201d) Motion for Attorneys\u2019 Fees and Expenses Pursuant to FRCP 54(d), L.R. 54.2 and O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-11-68 [311] is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART, as stated in this Order. After applying the deductions required by this Order, OxBlue is awarded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses in the total amount of $292,611.17.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that enforcement of this judgment is stayed until Plaintiff EarthCam, Inc.\u2019s appeal to the Eleventh Circuit is concluded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b548-9\">, EarthCam filed, on May 1, 2015, its Response in Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Attorneys\u2019 Fees and Expenses [316], The arguments set out in this response are included in the Additional Adverse.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b549-9\">.
