After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-20\">In 1998, Jasperson, a former bankruptcy attorney, incorporated 6215 Development, Inc. (\u201c5215 Development\u201d). 5215 Development was an S corporation that liquidated video stores.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Jasperson was the sole owner. Though 5215 Development was initially profitable, Jasperson claims that it lost $750,262 and $237,596 in 2005 and 2006 respectively. He carried forward those losses on his individual returns for 2008-2010 claiming net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>deductions for those years.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the years 2008-2010, Jasperson claimed NOL carryover deductions of $217,768, $58,855, and $110,080 respectively. Jasperson\u2019s tax returns for the years 2008-2010 reflected those carryover deductions, but he did not attach detailed schedules to his returns explaining the calculations underlying those deductions as is required by 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.172-l(c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">In May of 2013, the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) sent Jasperson a notice of deficiency stating that Jasperson owed $44,341, $21,379, and $26,245 for tax years 2008-2010 and that he was being penalized $8,868, $4,275, and $5,249 for substantially understating his income for those years. The IRS notice of deficiency stated that Jasperson\u2019s NOL deductions for 2008-2010 were disallowed because Jasperson could not substantiate that he incurred a deductible loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">Jasperson challenged the IRS determination in the Tax Court. Although the trial was originally scheduled for May 19, 2014, Jasperson requested a continuance because he needed extra time to provide \u201csufficient documentation ... of 5215 Development Inc.\u2019s operations and losses suffered in years 2005 and 2006.\u201d The Tax Court granted Jasperson\u2019s motion and the trial was held in February 2015.' Despite having nearly an extra year to marshal documents for the trial, Jasperson never provided his individual 2005 or 2006 tax returns, nor any source documents, such as invoices, credit card receipts and statements, bank statements, canceled checks, etc., that would provide direct evidence of 5215 Development\u2019s purported losses in 2005 and 2006. Instead, Jasperson provided secondary information, like charts prepared by his accountants, that were supposedly based on source documents\u2014but those source documents were never provided to the IRS or the court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b984-9\">The Tax Court sustained the IRS determinations. First, it determined that Jas-person did not provide any evidence that he properly followed the Internal Revenue Code\u2019s (\u201cIRC\u201d) requirements for carrying forward NOLs, and as a result, could not utilize them in the 2008-10 returns. Second, it determined that the accuracy-related penalties were appropriate because Jasperson failed to show that he gave accurate financial information to his tax preparers, and thus, he could not claim his substantial understatements were good-faith mistakes. We affirm both determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-11\">We review the Tax Court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and conclusions of law de novo. <em>Creel v. Comm\u2019r, </em>419 F.3d 1135, 1139 (11th Cir. 2005); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 7482(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>A.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">In order to carry forward a NOL from a previous year, a taxpayer must comply with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 172(b). Section 172(b)(1)(A)(i)-(ii) requires that a taxpayer first carry back the NOL two years from the loss year, and then, if the loss is not absorbed in the preceding two years, carry forward the remaining NOL to each year subsequent to the loss year for up to twenty years until the NOL is gone. In other words, for Jasperson to have properly carried forward his alleged NOL from 2005, he would have first had to carry back his loss to 2004, then 2003, then carry the NOL forward to 2006, then 2007, etc. The IRC does allow a taxpayer to waive the carryback requirement, but \u201c[s]uch election shall be made in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary, and shall be made by the due date ... for filing the taxpayer\u2019s return for the taxable year of the net operating loss for which the election is to be in effect.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 172(b)(3). The regulations that set forth the manner the election must be made require that it \u201cbe made by a statement attached to the return (or amended return) for the taxable year\u201d and that it \u201cshall indicate the section under which the election is being made and shall set forth information to identify the election, the period for which it applies, and the taxpayer\u2019s basis for entitlement for making the election.\u201d 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.9100-12T(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">Jasperson did not provide his tax returns from 2005 or 2006 to the Tax Court, the supposed years his NOLs took place. As such, there is no basis to assume that he properly waived the carryback requirement. <em>See Gatlin v. Comm\u2019r, </em>754 F.2d 921, 923 (11th Cir. 1985) (the burden is on the taxpayer to \u201ccome forward with evidence to support his entitlement to [a] deduction and the amount of that entitlement.\u201d). And Jasperson has provided virtually no evidence regarding his finances for 2004 and 2003 to determine whether he carried his 2005 and 2006 NOLs back. Even the secondary evidence he provided is essentially silent on tax years 2003 and 2004.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The only witness other than Jasperson who was involved with 5215 Development during those years testified that he did not even know if the company was profitable in 2003. As a result, we cannot say the Tax Court clearly erred by holding that Jas-person failed to prove that he carried back his supposed 2005 and 2006 NOLs or that he validly waived the carryback requirement even if he could prove the NOLs took place..</p>\n<p id=\"b985-12\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-13\">Similarly, we cannot disturb the Tax Court\u2019s determination that the IRS correctly assessed penalties against Jas-person for substantially understating his income tax for 2008-2010. A taxpayer has substantially understated his income tax if the deficiency is greater than $5,000 or 10% of the tax required to be shown on the return for the taxable year. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6662(d)(1). Jasperson does not challenge that the deficiency determinations for 2008-2010 are greater than $5,000 Instead, he argues that he meets an exception the IRC provides for understating income tax\u2014that the taxpayer acted with \u201creasonable cause\u201d and in \u201cgood faith.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6664(c)(1). The burden is on the taxpayer to demonstrate \u201creasonable cause\u201d and \u201cgood faith\u201d once the IRS has shown a substantial understatement. 26 C.F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>\u00a7 1.6664-4(a). Jasperson claims that his reliance on the outside accountants meets the exception. He is wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">Reliance on a tax professional can be the basis for meeting the \u201creasonable cause\u201d and \u201cgood faith\u201d exception, but the taxpayer must demonstrate that he provided accurate information to the tax professional. <em>Neonatology </em>Assocs., <em>P.A. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>115 T.C. 43, 99 (2000), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>299 F.3d 221 (3d Cir. 2002); <em>cf. Gustashaw v. Comm\u2019r, </em>696 F.3d 1124, 1139 (11th Cir. 2012) (In order to avail himself of the \u00a7 6664(c) exception because of reliance on a tax professional\u2019s advice, \u201cthe taxpayer must show that the advice was based on \u2018all pertinent facts and circumstances\u2019 \u201d (quoting 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.6664-4(c)(l)(i))). Jasperson provided no evidence that his accountants had accurate information. As mentioned previously, he provided no source documentation to substantiate any of his 2005 and 2006 losses. An accountant who worked for the firm that prepared both 5215 Development\u2019s and Jasperson\u2019s individual returns testified at trial that the accounting firm did not \u201caudit the numbers\u201d Jasperson provided, meaning that it did only minimal due diligence. The accounting firm relied on Jasperson and 5215 Development to provide accurate information, and since this Court, no less than the Tax Court, has no basis to assume that the information provided was accurate, Jasperson has not carried his burden to show his reliance on an outside tax professional meets the \u201creasonable cause\u201d and \u201cgood faith\u201d exception. Accordingly, the judgment of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b983-18\">.
