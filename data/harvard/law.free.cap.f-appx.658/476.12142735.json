We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b497-16\">In October 2008, Michel pled guilty to one count of possession with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B) (Count 1), one count of possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base (crack cocaine), in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u2022\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A) (Count 2), one count of knowingly using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug-trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) (Count 3), and. one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g), 924(e) (Count 4). Applying the 2008 Sentencing Guidelines Manual, the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) grouped Counts 1, 2, and 4 together and noted the Guidelines sentence for Count 3 was the statutory term of imprisonment. The probation officer determined Michel was responsible for the equivalent of 2,291 kilograms of marijuana. Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)(3), the base offense level for that amount was 32; because the crime included cocaine base, however, the probation officer applied a two-level reduction, resulting in a base offense level of 30. Michel received a three-level reduction for his acceptance of responsibility, resulting in a total offense level of 27. He had three criminal-history points; therefore, he was assigned a criminal-history category of II.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-17\">With his total offense level of 27 and criminal-history category of II, Michel\u2019s Guidelines sentencing range for Counts 1, 2, and 4 was 78 to 97 months of imprisonment. Michel was subject to two mandato<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>ry-minimum sentences: a mandatory-minimum sentence of 10 years (120 months) for Count 2 and a mandatory-minimum sentence of 5 years (60 months) for Count 3 to run consecutive to any other imprisonment term. Consequently, Michel\u2019s total Guidelines sentencing range for all four counts was 180 months of imprisonment. In January 2009, the district judge sentenced Michel to a total term of 180 months of imprisonment, consisting of 120 months each for Counts 1 and 2, to be served concurrently, and 60 months each for Counts 3 and 4, to be served concurrently with, each other and consecutive to the imprisonment sentences for Counts 1 and 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">In November 2015, Michel filed a pro se \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion requesting a sentence reduction based on Amendment 782 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which reduced the base offense levels for most drug offenses. The judge appointed the federal public defender to represent Michel, directed the U.S. Probation office to file a report on Michel\u2019s eligibility for relief under Amendment 782, and ordered the government to show cause why Michel\u2019s sentence should not be reduced. The probation officer filed a report stating Michel was not eligible for a sentence reduction under Amendment 782, because he was subject to a mandatory-statutory penalty in excess of the Guidelines sentencing range. The government filed an opposition to Michel\u2019s motion and agreed with the probation officer that Michel was ineligible for relief. The public defender did not supplement Michel\u2019s pro se \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. The judge concluded he lacked authority to grant Michel\u2019s motion, because Amendment 782 had no effect since Michel was sentenced to a statutory-mandatory-minimum sentence that exceeded his Guidelines sentencing range. Accordingly, the judge denied Michel\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">For the first time on appeal, Michel argues the statutory-mandatory-minimum penalties in the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 (\u201cFSA\u201d) must be applied in conjunction with the retroactive Guidelines amendments. In a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, Michel contends a district judge must apply the FSA statutory-mandatory-minimum sentences for crack-cocaine crimes in assessing a defendant\u2019s eligibility for a reduction under Amendment 782, even if the defendant was sentenced prior to the effective date of the FSA and subject to a higher mandatory-minimum-imprisonment sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">We generally review de novo a district judge\u2019s conclusions about the scope of his legal authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Colon, </em>707 F.3d 1255, 1258 (11th Cir. 2013). Arguments not raised in district court, however, are reviewed only for plain error. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>694 F.3d 1192, 1195 (11th Cir. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">Under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district judge may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence if his Guidelines range has been lowered by a retroactively applicable amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)). Such a reduction is not authorized, however, when the retroactive amendment reduces the defendant\u2019s base-offense level but does not alter his sentencing range. <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 376 (11th Cir. 2012). If the amendment does not actually lower the- defendant\u2019s Guidelines sentencing range \u201cbecause of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision,\u201d such as a statutory-mandatory-minimum sentence, the judge may not reduce the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>Id. </em>(quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A))). Consequently, a defendant whose Guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>lines imprisonment sentence was based on a statutory-mandatory minimum is not eligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The FSA, which became effective on August 3, 2010, reduced statutory-mandatory-minimum sentences for crack-cocaine crimes in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b). <em>Id. </em>at 377; FSA, Pub. L. No. 111-220 \u00a7 2(a), 124 Stat. 2372 (2010). The Supreme Court has held the FSA lower mandatory-minimum sentences could be applied to defendants who were sentenced after enactment of the FSA, even if their crime was committed prior to the effective date of the FSA. <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>567 U.S. -, -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 2326, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012). The Court did not state the FSA should apply retroactively to defendants sentenced prior to its effective date. Instead, the Court noted \u201cin federal sentencing, the ordinary practice is to apply new penalties to defendants not yet sentenced, while withholding that change from defendants already sentenced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 132 S.Ct. at 2335.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">In <em>Berry, </em>on appeal from denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, we explained the FSA could not serve as a basis for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), because it is not a Guidelines amendment promulgated by the Sentencing Commission. <em>Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 377. Even assuming the defendant\u2019s argument the FSA applied retroactively to defendants sentenced prior to enactment of the FSA could be raised in a \u00a7 3582(e)(2) proceeding, we held that argument failed because <em>Dorsey </em>confined application of the FSA to offenders sentenced <em>after </em>the effective date of the FSA. <em>See id. </em>at 377-78 (\u201cWe agree with every other circuit to address the issue that there is no evidence that Congress intended the FSA to apply to defendants who had been sentenced prior to the August 3, 2010 date of the Act\u2019s enactment.\u201d (citation, internal quotation marks, and alteration omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">Michel\u2019s argument fails because it is foreclosed by our <em>Berry </em>decision. <em>Berry </em>held the FSA cannot serve as a basis for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2); even if it could, the FSA mandatory-minimum sentences do not apply to defendants like Michel, who were sentenced prior to its effective date. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the district judge did not plainly err in failing to apply the FSA mandatory-minimum sentence in Michel\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding or in concluding Michel was ineligible for relief under Amendment 782 and \u00a7 3582(c)(2), because his sentence was based on a statutory-mandatory-minimum sentence that exceeded his Guidelines sentencing range. <em>Id. </em>at 376; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
