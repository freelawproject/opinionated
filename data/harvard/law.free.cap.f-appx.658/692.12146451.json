He argues that his right to trial by an impartial jury was violated due to a prejudicial comment by a prospective juror during voir dire. Marr\u00f3n asserts that the prospective juror\u2019s remark\u2014i.e., she worked in the criminal department at a courthouse and thought that Marr\u00f3n \u201cmight have visited at one point or another\u201d and \u201clooked familiar\u201d\u2014tainted the jury pool and precluded the empaneling of an impartial jury. Marr\u00f3n also contends that the district court wrongly denied his motion for a mistrial or should have investigated further whether the jury panel was contaminated by the remark.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Marr\u00f3n attacked the impartiality of the jury in the district court and did not intentionally forgo his right to challenge whether the jury was tainted. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). We review the district court\u2019s determinations as to juror impartiality, the scope and method of voir dire, and the manner of addressing possible jury misconduct for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Hinojosa, </em>958 F.2d 624, 631 (5th Cir. 1992); <em>United States v. Chiantese, </em>582 F.2d 974, 978 (5th Cir. 1978); <em>United States v. Gerald, </em>624 F.2d 1291, 1296 (5th Cir. 1980). Likewise, we review the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for mistrial for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>963 F.2d 693, 699 (5th Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Marr\u00f3n has not shown that the empaneled jury was partial or that the district court abused its discretion in resolving his attacks on the impartiality of the jury or denying his motion for a mistrial. <em>See Hinojosa, </em>958 F.2d at 631; <em>Ramirez, </em>963 F.2d at 699. The prospective juror\u2014 who was dismissed for cause because she repeatedly stated that she could not fairly judge the case\u2014did not state conclusively that Marr\u00f3n appeared at the courthouse or specify that the purpose of any appearance was related to an ongoing criminal case or a prior conviction; thus, the risk presented by the comment was, at most, attenuated. <em>See United States v. Delval, </em>600 F.2d 1098, 1102 (5th Cir. 1979). The comment was not presumptively prejudicial, express an opinion about the facts or merits of the instant case, or insinuate Marron\u2019s guilt. There also is no indication that any presumptively impartial juror, <em>see United States v. Ruggiero, </em>56 F.3d 647, 652 (5th Cir. 1995), was influenced by the remark or that the comment affected the ability of any empaneled juror to decide the case on the trial evidence. <em>See Patton v. Yount, </em>467 U.S. 1025, 1035, 104 S.Ct. 2885, 81 L.Ed.2d 847 (1984); <em>United States v. Warren, </em>594 F.2d 1046, 1049 (5th Cir. 1979). The district court, which was in the best position to evaluate the impact of the remark, reasonably determined that the comment did not give rise to potential prejudice and, therefore, no further questioning was necessary to decide whether the impartiality of the jury was compromised. <em>See Hinojosa, </em>958 F.2d at 631; <em>United States v. Garcia-Flores, </em>246 F.3d 451, 458 (5th Cir. 2001). Because Marr\u00f3n has not shown that his right to be tried by an impartial jury was violated, we need not address his contention that the alleged error implicates a structural defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">Also, Marr\u00f3n asserts that the prosecutor made impermissible comments during closing arguments. He asserts that the prosecutor\u2019s suggestion during rebuttal that defense counsel\u2019s argument\u2014which highlighted alleged failings in the Government\u2019s investigation\u2014was reminiscent of \u201cthat old saying, \u2018The greatest trick the devil ever pulled is convincing the world that he didn\u2019t exist,\u2019 \u201d improperly injected religion into the case and attacked the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>character of defense counsel. Because Marr\u00f3n did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s remarks, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Gracia, </em>522 F.3d 597, 599-600 (5th Cir. 2008); <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>482 F.3d 781, 785 (5th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">Marr\u00f3n has not shown that the prosecutor\u2019s closing remarks were clearly improper or cast serious doubt on the correctness of the verdict. <em>See Thompson, </em>482 F.3d at 785. The remarks, considered in context, were not an invocation of religion or a personal attack on defense counsel. By contending that counsel was emphasizing extraneous issues, the prosecutor intended to highlight the perceived weakness in Marron\u2019s defense and note his inability to undermine the inculpatory evidence. <em>See United States v. Strmel, </em>744 F.2d 1086, 1089-90 (5th Cir. 1984). The prosecutor\u2019s reference to the \u201cdevil\u201d was rhetorical rather than an improper religious reference or a targeted attack; the prosecutor did not directly refer to counsel or Marr\u00f3n or depict them as demonic but quoted a purported aphorism that the prosecutor believed to embody his argument that the jury should not be distracted by irrelevant issues. Even if the prosecutor\u2019s remark was erroneous, Marr\u00f3n cannot show an effect on his substantial rights because the isolated and indirect remark was connected 'to counsel\u2019s argument that the jury should focus on the relevant evidence; any prejudicial effect of the remark was mitigated by the district court\u2019s instructions to the jury; and the evidence against Marr\u00f3n was sufficiently substantial that the remark would not cast serious doubt on the correctness of the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See Thompson, </em>482 F.3d at 785.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b712-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
