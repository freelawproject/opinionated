While her appeal was pending, Stone submitted new evidence in support of her application including\u2014in pertinent part\u2014CED Mental Health Center records dated <em>from 14 </em>December 2012 to 27 June 2013 (\u201cCED Records\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On appeal, Stone contends that the Appeals Council erred by refusing to consider this new evidence solely because the CED Records were dated after the ALJ\u2019s decision. Stone argues that, had this new evidence been considered properly, it would refute the ALJ\u2019s finding that Stone\u2019s depression was no severe impairment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-15\">\u201cWith a few exceptions, the claimant is allowed to present new evidence at each stage of th[e] administrative process, including before the Appeals Council.\u201d Washington v. Soc. Sec. Admin., Comm\u2019r, 806 F.3d 1317, 1320 (11th Cir. 2015) (quotation omitted). Where the evidence submitted by the claimant is \u201cnew, material, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>and chronologically relevant,\u201d the Appeals Council is required to consider it. Id. We review de novo whether the newly submitted evidence satisfies the \u201cnew, material, and chronologically relevant\u201d standard. Id. at 1321. \u201c[W]hen the Appeals Council erroneously refuses to consider evidence, it commits legal error and remand is appropriate.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">New evidence is chronologically relevant if \u201cit relates to the period on or before the date of the administrative law judge hearing decision.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.70(b), 416.1470(b). Under certain circumstances, medical examinations conducted after the ALJ's decision may still be chronologically relevant, if they relate back to a time on or before the ALJ\u2019s decision. Washington, 806 F.3d at 1322-23. Evidence is \u201cmaterial\u201d when it is \u201crelevant and probative so that there is a reasonable possibility that it would change the administrative result.\u201d Milano v. Bowen, 809 F.2d 763, 766 (11th Cir. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">As an initial matter, the CED Records themselves are no part of the certified administrative record and, thus, are not before this Court on appeal. See Cherry v. Heckler, 760 F.2d 1186, 1193 (11th Cir. 1985) (\u201cA reviewing court is limited to [the certified] record in examining the evidence.\u201d). Our review is limited, instead, to Stone\u2019s summary of the contents of the CED Records.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">After review, we conclude that the Appeals Council committed no error in refusing to consider the CED Records. First, Stone has failed to demonstrate that the CED Records are chronologically relevant. Stone\u2019s summary of the CED Records includes only complaints and diagnoses that were made after the ALJ\u2019s decision. That Stone was diagnosed with \u201crecurrent\u201d major depressive disorder is not enough, in and of itself, to demonstrate that the records are chronologically relevant. For instance, the summarized records include no express reference to Stone\u2019s condition or symptoms before the ALJ\u2019s decision. And nothing evidences that the CED provider making the \u201crecurrent\u201d diagnosis reviewed or relied upon Stone\u2019s past medical records in making that diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">The summarized CED Records note only that Stone suffered from depression for the past \u201c10 years/possibly longer\u201d: the records provide no detail about the nature or severity of Stone\u2019s past history of depression. Thus, to the extent that this portion of the CED Records may relate back to a time on or before the ALJ\u2019s decision, it is cumulative of other evidence already considered by the ALJ. Stone has not argued otherwise: in support of her Rule 59 motion, Stone stated only that the CED Records were \u201cconsistent with\u201d and \u201csubstantiated the evidence of depression\u201d in the record. Because the ALJ already considered similar evidence of Stone\u2019s history of depression,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> no reasonable possibility exists that this statement in the CED Records would have changed the result of the proceedings. See Milano, 809 F.2d at 766.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">Although the CED Records indicate that Stone suffered from potentially disabling depression as things stood on 14 December 2012, records from Holistic Pain Management reported that Stone denied having depression symptoms during her January, August, and September 2012 visits. Absent evidence about when Stone\u2019s depression worsened, the CED Records say nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>about Stone\u2019s condition on or before the ALJ\u2019s decision. Cfi Hearings, Appeals, and Litigation Law Manual for the Social Security Administration, I\u20148\u20143\u20146(B) (\u201cEvidence is not related to the period at issue when the evidence shows ... [a] worsening or the condition or onset of a new condition after the date of the ALJ decision.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Contrary to Stone\u2019s argument on appeal, the Court\u2019s opinion in Washington does not demand a remand in this case. Unlike the new evidence at issue in Washington, the CED Records contain no indication that the CED provider reviewed or had access to Stone\u2019s past medical records. In Washington, we also determined the new evidence was chronologically relevant in part because nothing evidenced that the claimant\u2019s cognitive abilities had declined in the months between the ALJ\u2019s decision and the newly-submitted medical examination. 806 F.3d at 1322. The CED Records, however, demonstrate a worsening of Stone\u2019s depression symptoms between the time of the ALJ\u2019s decision and December 2012, when Stone was first diagnosed with recurrent major depressive disorder. This case is thus significantly different from the \u201cspecific circumstances\u201d involved in Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The Appeals Council committed no error in refusing to consider the CED Records. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b572-8\">. Stone raises no substantive argument challenging the district court\u2019s denial of her Rule 59 motion; that issue is abandoned. See Access Now, Inc. v. Sw. Airlines Co., 385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir. 2004)<em>.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b572-10\">, Stone does not challenge the Appeals Council\u2019s consideration of her newly-submitted school records or Holistic Pain Management records, nor does she contend that the CED Records have a bearing on her alleged impairments other than on her depression.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b572-18\">.On appeal, Stone does not contend that the ALJ\u2019s decision\u2014based on the record before the ALJ as of 26 October 2012\u2014was unsupported by substantial evidence. That argument is deemed abandoned. See Access Now, Inc., 385 F.3d at <em>1330.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b573-8\">. The record before the ALJ evidenced\u2014and the ALJ found\u2014that Stone suffered from medically determinable depression. Based on a review of Stone\u2019s medical record, Dr. Estock opined that Stone\u2019s depression was well controlled with medication and caused no severe limitation on Stone\u2019s ability to perform activities of daily living or to maintain social functioning, concentration, persistence, or pace.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
