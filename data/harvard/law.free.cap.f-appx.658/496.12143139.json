Quintanilla raises two arguments on appeal: (1) the sentence appeal waiver in his plea agreement is unenforceable because the government breached the plea agreement by breaking a promise made during the plea' colloquy; and (2) the district court erred in enhancing Quintanilla\u2019s offense level by two levels, per U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, and refusing to reduce his offense level by two levels, per U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(17) and 5C1.2(a)(2),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> after finding that Quintanilla possessed a firearm in connection with the offense. After careful review, we decline to enforce the appeal waiver and affirm Quin-tanilla\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-15\">We review the validity of a sentence appeal waiver provision <em>de novo. United States v. Johnson, </em>541 F.3d 1064, 1066 (11th Cir. 2008). Generally, we will enforce an appeal waiver that was made knowingly and voluntarily. <em>United States v. Bushert, </em>997 F.2d 1343, 1350-51 (11th Cir. 1993). To establish that the waiver was made knowingly and voluntarily, the government must show either that (1) the district court specifically questioned the defendant about the waiver during the plea colloquy, or (2) \u201cit is manifestly clear from the record that the defendant otherwise understood the full significance of the waiver.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1351.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-16\">Here, we decline to enforce the appeal waiver. Putting aside the question of whether the government breached the plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>agreement, the government has not shown that the waiver was made knowingly and voluntarily.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>While the magistrate judge, who conducted Quintanilla\u2019s plea colloquy read out loud the terms of the waiver during the colloquy, she did not specifically question Quintanilla about the waiver or confirm that he understood what' those terms meant. Moreover, Quintanilla\u2019s response to the magistrate judge\u2019s explanation of the waiver, \u201cOkay,\u201d does not clearly show that he understood the magistrate judge\u2019s explanation, and the government has not identified parts of the record that make \u201cmanifestly clear\u201d his understanding of the full significance of the waiver. Therefore, the government has not shown either of the two routes under <em>Bushert </em>for establishing the validity of the waiver. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">And because the government has briefed Quintanilla\u2019s guidelines challenges, we neither burden nor prejudice the government by enforcing the waiver. <em>Cf. United States v. Bascomb, </em>451 F.3d 1292, 1294 (11th Cir. 2006) (\u201c[Requiring the government to file a brief where there has been a valid appeal waiver undermines the interests of both the government and defendants generally.\u201d). We therefore do not enforce the sentence appeal waiver in Quintanilla\u2019s plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">Turning to the merits, Quintanilla argues that no evidence supports the district court\u2019s finding that he possessed a firearm in connection with the offense. As a result, he asserts, the court erred in applying the two-level enhancement for possession of a firearm, per U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), and in refusing to apply a two-level reduction for meeting the safety-valve criteria, per U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(17) (providing for a two-level reduction if the defendant meets the five requirements set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(a)). One of the five requirements under \u00a7 501.2(a) is that the defendant not have \u201cpossessed] a firearm ... in connection with the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">Quintanilla was a sergeant with the Miami Springs Police Department. Near the end of 2014, he began having conversations with a confidential source working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The source told Quintanilla that he was a drug trafficker who imported cocaine shipments through the Miami International Airport. Quintanilla agreed to help.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">In November 2014, the source told Quin-tanilla about an upcoming shipment of ten kilograms of cocaine that the source planned to sell in the City of Miami Springs. Quintanilla helped choose a date and location for the planned drug deal. On December 5, 2014, Quintanilla, while on duty, met the source at the agreed-upon location, a grocery store parking lot, where the source showed Quintanilla fake cocaine and indicated that it was being sold for $250,000. Quintanilla then left the parking lot for a brief period while the sale was completed. Later, Quintanilla told the source that he left the parking lot to distract a police detective he had seen in the area. After the sale, Quintanilla, in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>patrol car, followed the source\u2019s car to a shipping facility, where the source said the drug proceeds would be dropped off in order to be laundered elsewhere. Quintan-illa was paid $2,500 for his assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Before sentencing, Quintanilla\u2019s revised presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d) calculated his offense level using the drug-trafficking guideline, \u00a7 2D1.1, because Quintanilla committed his extortion offense for the purpose of facilitating a drug offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Cl.l(c)(l). Under the drug-trafficking guideline, a two-level en-' hancement was added because \u201ca dangerous weapon (a firearm) was possessed.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). In his objections to. the PSR, Quintanilla did not dispute that he possessed a firearm, \u2018but he asked for a two-level reduction under \u00a7\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(17) and \u00a7 501.2(a)(2) because, he contended, his possession of a firearm was not in connection with the offense. In a second addendum to the PSR, the probation officer disagreed with Quintanilla that a two-level reduction was applicable \u201cbecause the defendant, while armed, provided protection for and escorted drug-proceeds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Quintanilla pressed his \u00a7 501.2(a)(2) argument at sentencing, contending that his service firearm, though possessed, had no connection to the offense. Sentencing Hr\u2019g Tr. at 4 (Doc. 37) (stating that \u201cthe firearm was not used in furtherance of any of the crime .and that it does not preclude him from the benefits of \u00a7 501.2(a)(2)\u201d); <em>id, </em>at 5 (\u201cThe firearm happened to be present on him, but there is no evidence that it was used in furtherance of the crime.\u201d); <em>id. </em>(\u201cThere was never any circumstance in which that weapon was ever involved in any way or took part in the case itself. He was in a vehicle. There was never any circumstance where it was [employed] or used in furtherance of the crime. Again, my client pled to a bribery case.\u201d). Over Quintanilla\u2019s objections, the district court agreed with the probation officer and found that Quintanilla possessed the firearm in connection with the drug offense. The court applied the \u00a7 2Dl,l(b)(l) enhancement but did not apply the \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(17) reduction. The district court sentenced Quintanilla to 108 months of imprisonment, at the low end of his guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">We review a district court\u2019s factual findings, including a finding that a defendant possessed a firearm, for clear error.. <em>United States v. Carrillo-Ayala, </em>713 F.3d 82, 87 (11th Cir. 2013); <em>United States v. Stallings, </em>463 F.3d 1218, 1220 (11th Cir. 2006). The district court\u2019s legal interpretations of the Sentencing Guidelines are reviewed <em>de novo. Carrillo-Ayala, </em>713 F.3d at 87. While we review <em>de novo </em>the legal standard that the district court applies, we generally review for clear error the court\u2019s application of the standard to a detailed fact pattern. <em>Id. </em>at 87-88. We will not' find clear error unless we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>United States v. White, </em>335 F.3d 1314, 1319 (11th Cir. 2003).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">Under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), a defendant\u2019s offense level is increased by two levels \u201c[i]f a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed.\u201d To prove that the enhancement applies, the government bears the burden of showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, either \u201cthat th\u00e9 fire<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>arm was present at the site of the charged conduct or ... that the defendant possessed a firearm during conduct associated with the offense of conviction.\u201d <em>Stallings, </em>463 F.3d at 1220; <em>United States v. Hunter, </em>172 F.3d 1307, 1309 (11th Cir. 1999). If the government meets its burden, \u201cthe eviden-tiary burden shifts to the defendant, who must demonstrate that a connection between the weapon and the offense was \u2018clearly improbable.\u2019\u201d <em>Stallings, </em>463 F.3d at 1220 (quoting <em>United States v. Audain, </em>254 F.3d 1286, 1289 (11th Cir. 2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Section \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(17) likewise implicates a defendant\u2019s possession of a firearm, providing for a two-level decrease in the offense level if, among other criteria listed in \u00a7 5C1.2(a), the defendant \u201cdid not ... possess a firearm or other dangerous weapon ... <em>in connection with the of</em>fense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u25a0\u00a7 5C1.2(a)(2) (emphasis added). We have held that possession \u201cin connection with\u201d means something more than possession, so a defendant may possess a firearm, for purposes of \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), without possessing the firearm \u201cin connection with the offense,\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(2). <em>Carillo-Ayala, </em>713 F.3d at 89-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Where a defendant who possessed a firearm seeks the protection of the safety valve, \u00a7 5C1.2(a) (in this case, by way of \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(17)), \u201cthe district court must determine whether the facts of the case show that a connection between the firearm and the offense, though possible, is not probable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91. The defendant may negate proof of a connection by a preponderance of the evidence, or the government may preclude relief by proving the fact of a connection by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">A sufficient \u201cconnection\u201d between the firearm and the offense may be shown if the firearm is in proximity to drugs or if the firearm facilitates or has the potential to facilitate the drug offense. <em>Id. </em>at 91-96. Facilitation, in turn, includes \u201cemboldening an actor who had the ability to display or discharge the weapon, ... serving as an integral part of a drug transaction as in a barter situation, ... instilling confidence in others who relied on the defendant, or serving as a \u2018badge of office\u2019 to help the defendant avoid detection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). For example, we have concluded that an INS agent\u2019s possession of a firearm while escorting a drug courier through an airport facilitated the offense because the firearm\u2019s presence increased the chances for successful drug trafficking, both by instilling confidence in the drug courier and \u201cdiminishing] the likelihood that someone [would] look at him suspiciously.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 94-95 (discussing the facts of <em>Audain, </em>254 F.3d at 1289).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">We analyze the provisions of \u00a7 2Dl,l(b)(l) and \u00a7 501.2(a)(2) by reference to the defendant\u2019s relevant conduct. <em>See Stallings, </em>463 F.3d at 1220; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 emt. n.3 (the term \u201coffense\u201d for \u00a7 501.2(a)(2) means .\u201cthe offense of conviction and all relevant conduct\u201d). So although Quintanilla\u2019s offense of conviction was Hobbs Act extortion, we evaluate the application of the two guideline provisions based on his relevant conduct, which includes his facilitation of what he believed to be a transaction involving ten kilograms of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">Here, the district court did not err in applying \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) or in refusing to apply \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(17). First, the court did not clearly err in finding that Quintanilla possessed a firearm during conduct relevant to the offense. <em>See Stallings, </em>463 F.3d at 1220. Quintanilla was an on-duty police officer during relevant conduct. He also did not dispute factual statements in the second addendum to the PSR stating that he was \u201carmed\u201d during conduct related to the December 5, 2014, cocaine transaction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>so he is deemed to have admitted those facts for purposes of sentencing. <em>See United States v. Bennett, </em>472 F.3d 825, 832 (11th Cir. 2006) (\u201cA sentencing court\u2019s-findings of fact may be based on undisputed statements in the [PSR].\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 833-34 (\u201cBennett failed to object to the facts of his prior convictions as contained in his [PSR] and addendum to the [PSR] despite several opportunities to do so; thus, he is deemed to have admitted those facts.\u201d). Indeed, far from objecting to the fact of his possession of a firearm, Quintanilla, through counsel, admitted multiple times during the sentencing hearing, recounted above, that he possessed a firearm during conduct relevant to the offense. Therefore, the facts adequately establish that Quin-tanilla possessed a firearm during the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Second, the district court did not clearly err in finding that Quintanilla\u2019s possession of the firearm was in connection with the offense, because the firearm facilitated or had the potential to facilitate the offense. <em>See Carillo-Ayala, </em>713 F.3d at 87-88, 95-96. The record shows that Quintanilla admitted that he had agreed to provide cover and protection for a drug- trafficker transporting ten kilograms of cocaine. In particular, during the plea colloquy, Quintanilla agreed with the prosecutor\u2019s statement that he had \u201cagreed he would watch over the drug transaction in the City of Miami Springs and protect the confidential information source from something going wrong.\u201d Plea Hr\u2019g Tr. at 35 (Doc. 29). Acting on that agreement, Quintanilla, while armed, met with the source on the planned date of the drug sale and then followed the source as the source drove with the drug proceeds to another location.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Based on these facts, Quintanilla\u2019s firearm facilitated or had the potential to facilitate the offense because it was available for use as a weapon in order to protect the confidential source \u201cfrom something going wrong,\u201d most notably while the source drove, purportedly, with a substantial amount of drug proceeds. <em>See Carrillo-Ayala, </em>713 F.3d at 95-96. For similar reasons, the firearm had the potential to facilitate the offense by instilling confidence in the person who hired Quintanilla for protection. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">In sum, Quintanilla\u2019s possession of a firearm while providing cover and protection for a drug transaction was sufficient to show both possession of a firearm, \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), and possession of a firearm in connection with the offense, \u00a7 501.2(a)(2). Accordingly, the district court did not err in calculating Quintanil-la\u2019s guideline range. We therefore affirm Quintanilla\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b517-11\">. All guidelines references are to the 2014 version of the Guidelines Manual.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b518-7\">. The government notes that Quintanilla challenged the appeal waiver on only the ground that the plea agreement was breached, and it limits its arguments to the breach issue. But it is the <em>government's </em>burden to show that the appeal waiver was made knowingly and voluntarily, and it has not done so here, no matter what Quintanilla argued. <em>See Bushert, </em>997 F.2d at 1351. Because the only remedy Quintanilla requested for the government\u2019s alleged breach was invalidation of the waiver and we decline to enforce the waiver here, we need not and do not decide whether the government breached the plea agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b519-7\">. Quintanilla did not object to the district court\u2019s application of the \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) firearm-possession enhancement on the grounds he raises on appeal, so we would normally review for plain error only. In any case, he preserved his interrelated challenge under \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(2), and our inquiry into both guidelines is substantially the same, Accordingly, we do not apply plain-error review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
