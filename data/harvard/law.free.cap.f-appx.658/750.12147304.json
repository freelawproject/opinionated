The Government moves for summary affirmance and, alternatively, for an extension of time to file its brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-23\">There is no merit to Sides\u2019s contention that the use of a prior felony conviction both as the necessary predicate for his felon-in-possession offense and to increase his criminal history category constitutes double counting prohibited by the Sentencing Guidelines. \u201c[T]he Guidelines do not prohibit double counting except when the particular Guideline at issue expressly does so.\u201d <em>United States v. Luna, </em>165 F.3d 316, 323 (5th Cir. 1999). <em>In United States v. Hawkins, </em>69 F.3d 11, 14-15 (5th Cir. 1995), we held that the Guidelines permit the district court to consider a defendant\u2019s prior felony convictions in calculating both his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(l) and his criminal history category. \u201cBecause one of the elements of the crime of possession of a firearm under \u00a7 922(g)(1) [is] that the defendant have a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>prior felony conviction, one of [the defendant\u2019s] convictions must be used in calculating his offense level.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Sides correctly acknowledges that <em>United States v. Alcantar, </em>733 F.3d 143, 145-46 (5th Cir. 2013), forecloses his argument, based on <em>Nat\u2019l Fed\u2019n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 2566, 183 L.Ed.2d 450 (2012) <em>(NFIB), </em>that \u00a7 922(g) is unconstitutional facially and as applied to him because it regulates conduct that falls outside of the Government\u2019s power to regulate commerce. As we explained, <em>NFIB </em>\u201cdid not address-the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g)(1), and it did not express an intention to overrule the precedents upon which our cases\u2014and numerous other cases in other circuits\u2014relied in finding statutes such as \u00a7 922(g)(1) constitutional.\u201d <em>Alcantar, </em>733 F.3d at 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">Finally, Sides correctly concedes that our decision in <em>United States v. Dancy, </em>861 F.2d 77, 81-82 (5th Cir. 1988), forecloses his argument that his charging document fails to allege the proper <em>mens rea </em>for a felon-in-possession offense. In <em>United States v. Rose, </em>587 F.3d 695, 705 (5th Cir. 2009), we explained that <em>Dancy </em>is still good law even after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Flores-Figueroa v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 646, 129 S.Ct. 1886, 173 L.Ed.2d 853 (2009), on which Sides relies. Sides asserts that <em>Dancy </em>should be overruled, but one panel of this court may not overrule the decision of another absent a superseding en banc or Supreme Court decision. <em>United States v. Lipscomb, </em>299 F.3d 303, 313 &amp; n.34 (5th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and its alternative motion for an extension of time to file its brief is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b770-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
