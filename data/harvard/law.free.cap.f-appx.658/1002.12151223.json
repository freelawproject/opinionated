Jermaine R. Revere lost parts of two fingers and suffered other serious wounds during the assault, and proceeding <em>pro se, </em>he seeks damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against four prison officials, Warden J. Derrel Hart, Lt. Jerry T. Waters, and Sgts. Donnie Bussey<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Larry R. Perry. Revere alleges that each official, in violation of the Eighth Amendment, was deliberately indifferent to the substantial risk of serious harm he faced, as a member of a gang, Gangster Disciples, and the hands of Hispanic inmates.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rather than keeping him out of harm\u2019s way, they left him exposed to the assault that occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-21\">The District Court, concluding that the evidence taken in the light most favorable to Revere failed to show that any of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>four officials violated the Eighth Amendment as alleged, granted the four officials summary judgment. Revere appeals the judgment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">We review the summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>considering the facts and drawing all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, Revere. <em>Mann v. Taser Iwt\u2019l, Inc,, </em>588 F.3d 1291, 1303 (11th Cir. 2009). Revere\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim is based for the most part on his fear, as expressed to each of the four officials individually, of being housed amongst Hispanic inmates. Revere related on deposition precisely what he said to these officials; thus, in setting out the salient facts, we focus primarily on his testimony. We begin, however, with a brief description of WSP and the circumstances that led to Revere\u2019s incarceration there.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-6\">WSP opened in 1990 as a \u201cTier I &amp; II Facility\u201d designed to house 1546 inmates. The facility consists of eight housing units with 50 double cells in each, an Infirmary of 12 beds, a Segregation unit with 150 beds, and a Fast Track Unit of four dormitories of 54 beds each.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The prison\u2019s staff includes a CERT Team charged with maintaining order,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The inmates incarcerated at WSP are \u201cclose security offenders with behavioral problems,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that was so during the times relevant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-11\">The assault occurred during Revere\u2019s second incarceration at WSP. Revere was sent to WSP the first time on April 22, 2010, while serving a sentence of 23 years imposed by the DeKalb County Superior Court for manslaughter.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He stayed at WSP until March 9, 2011, when he was released on parole. A little over five months later and still on parole, he killed a man with a knife while stealing two motor vehicles, and was indicted by a Fulton County grand jury for murder and theft by taking.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On November 9, 2011, while incarcerated at Jackson State Prison, the DeKalb County Superior Court revoked his parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-12\">Revere was held at Jackson State Prison until Thursday, June 7, 2012, when he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>transferred to WSP.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Revere arrived at WSP on a bus with 14 other prisoners. As he was getting off the bus, the sergeant in charge of CERT\u2019s gang task force, recognizing that he had been at WSP before, approached him and said \u201cthings have changed,\u201d that Sgt. Ivey, a CERT officer, was \u201cno longer with us.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As Revere testified on deposition, \u201c[i]t was very well known who I was and who I\u2019m affiliated with.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1025-5\">I was more like a mediator between the Gangster Disciples and the CERT team as far as like when things transpired. They said I could bring some type of peace offering to the situation. So it was well known who I was\u2014 [I]t was numerous occasions that I can pinpoint ... I\u2019ve spoken to Warden Hart. I\u2019ve spoken with Warden Holden about certain situations. And they have pulled me out of my cell and put me in the office and was like, well, what\u2019s the situation. What\u2019s the status on this situation? Can you handle this situation?.... I\u2019m like a mediator or advisor on both ends.... [t]he Gangster Disciples and the warden and prison staff.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">The intake process began with the prisoners\u2019 shaving and taking a shower under the supervision of the same CERT sergeant and an officer member of the gang task force. When Revere removed his shirt, the sergeant noticed his Gangster Disciples (\u201cGD\u201d) tattoos, which covered much of his arms and torso, including a GD 360. Lt. Berry, who oversaw the CERT operation, happened to be present at the time and told the sergeant that the 360 tattoo indicated that Revere held a high rank in the GD.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The sergeant told Revere that a week or so ago, in late May, some Hispanic and GD inmates had \u201cgone to war\u201d over an incident in Building G and that two GDs had been stabbed and hospitalized.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> He was referring to assaults that had occurred on May 29 and 30 in Building G.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-16\">After showering, the 15 new inmates were taken to the dining hall for lunch. From there, they went to the infirmary for a physical exam. That done, the CERT sergeant gave them their cell assignments. Informed that he would be housed in Building H-l, Revere objected. The sergeant replied that no other cells were available, but that on Monday, \u201cwe\u2019ll see what we can do.\u201d After receiving their housing assignments, the inmates were led as a group to their respective cells. Of the group, 13 were black, three of whom were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>GD members, Revere, Leach and an unnamed inmate; one was white, an inmate named Clint, also a GD member, and one was Hispanic named Casper.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">Revere was assigned to cell 17 in Building H-l. His cellmate was a black man named Mack.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Rashad Leach, a GD Revere had known at Jackson State Prison and had arrived at WSP with him, was assigned to cell 18, adjacent to cell 17. His cellmate was a black Muslim. Of the 50 prisoners in H-l, 15 were black. They included two \u201cCrips\u201d and three GDs, Revere, Leach and Tyler Cowan,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> who was assigned cell 10 on the lower level. And two prisoners were white,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The rest were Hispanic.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1026-5\">Around 5:00 p.m. that day, after Revere had settled into his cell, a meeting took place there. Present in addition to Revere, were Leach, Cleve, a GD who worked in the laundry, and one of the two Crips in H-l. They discussed the fight that had taken place between GD and Hispanics in Building G in late May.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The meeting ended with the chow call for dinner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">On the way to the dining hall, Revere encountered Solo Rider, a GD housed in Building G. Rider told him that after it \u201c \u2018went down\u2019 \u201d in G (referring to the GD encounter with the Hispanics on May 29 and 30), all the GD in H \u201cwent on the door,\u201d i.e., refused housing, and were placed in \u201csegregation.\u201d Revere told Rider that he couldn\u2019t do that because there were no more cells available in segregation.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> At the dining hall, Revere met Sg. Bussey, whom he knew from his earlier incarceration at WSP. He complained to Bussey about being housed in H-l with \u201call these Hispanics,\u201d that the CERT Sergeant told him to wait till Monday to request a different cell assignment.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Bussey said he\u2019d have to wait.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> On leaving the dining hall, Revere encountered Lt. Waters and voiced the same complaint. Waters said he couldn\u2019t \u201chelp\u201d him.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1026-14\">On June 12, Lt. Waters, who was chair of the Classification Committee, interviewed Revere about his housing. Once again, Revere complained about complained about his cell assignment. Waters, noting that Revere was able to work, said he would see about relocating him to Building M, a Fast Track dormitory.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> On June 13, two counsellors came to H-I on a routine visit. Revere told them that he and one other GD were housed in a building full of Hispanics, and that he was trying to get relocated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-15\">Two days later, on Thursday, June 14, Revere spoke to Warden Hart, while Hart, Warden Holden and a CERT team of a sergeant and two officers were conducting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>a random inspection.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Revere said to Hart, \u201cmy understanding [is that] the [GD] and the Hispanics are at war right now.... [m]e and one of my brothers [are] in here by ourselves.\u201d Is there \u201cany way possible\u201d to \u201cmove us out of here?\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> After acknowledging Revere\u2019s gangster status, Hart told him that when \u201c \u2018/all decide to bring a truce, that\u2019s when y\u2019ll come to me. Until then, talk to ... classification.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">At some point after Revere returned to WSP, Cowan explained to him what had occurred between the GD and Hispanic inmates in Building G on May 29 and 30. In Revere\u2019s words, Cowan related \u201c[t]he history of the whole incident.\u201d It \u201c[a]ll ... started over a phone,\u201d he said.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Revere\u2019s reaction was, \u201cWe got to stick together.... They got the upper hand in here.... We just need to be careful.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">After discussing the situation with Co-wan, Revere called his mother and stepfather and then, on June 19, he phoned the GD \u201cGovernor,\u201d \u201cSpike,\u201d who was \u201cover all the GD\u201d in Georgia, including those imprisoned.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The Governor, in turn, called the \u201cIC at Ware State Prison, ... the overseer of the GDs at the compound.\u201d Revere spoke to the IC, Trent, the next day, June 19. Trent told him that \u201che sent some brothers up there to talk to the warden. He said, \u2018don\u2019t panic_just relax and everything will be all right.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Revere called the Governor again, who said, \u201cI had a brother talk to them.... Just be patient. Be calm_everything will be all right.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-21\">On June 25, Warden Hart, a \u201cvisitor\u201d from the Georgia Department of Corrections, and a CERT team consisting of two lieutenants and three officers<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> performed an inspection, an \u201caudit,\u201d in H-l.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Lt. Berry led the CERT team of three officers.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> They searched cell 19 (next to Leach\u2019s cell 18), which housed \u201cNando\u201d and \u201cMarco,\u201d found two \u201cmachetes\u201d and the makings for two more and confiscated them.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-22\">The next day, June 26, Revere went to the chow hall for breakfast at 6:30 a.m.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> After breakfast, he returned to his cell and slept. Around 10:00 a.m., Mack awoke him to say that \u201csomebody just wet up [a Hispanic] on the wall.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> He rolled over and went back to sleep. Soon, Leach entered the cell and told Revere to \u201cget up.... These folks are looking crazy.\u201d He said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>that \u201ca Blood\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> named Bald in H-2 told him \u201cto w\u00e1ke you up.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Revere got up, walked out of his cell, and observed \u201ctwo Hispanics holding up a third Hispanic while he unscrewed the little gray box that\u2019s over the control booth ... right by the showers.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Revere thought they were \u201cfixing to hide their phones.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">By this time all inmates were up. The floor sergeant came and announced an inspection. After Revere returned to his cell to straighten it out, he \u201cwent [downstairs to the lower level] and got Cowan.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Revere then returned to his room, brushed his teeth and washed his face. Meanwhile, the floor sergeant was ordering the inmates to \u201cstand by for inspection.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Not more than three minutes later, Leach\u2019s cellmate, the \u201cMuslim,\u201d told .him, \u201c\u2018go and help your brother.\u2019 \u201d Revere then saw that \u201cLeach was getting stabbed_They had him pinned to the wall in his room.... I\u2019m by Leach\u2019s room and I\u2019m steady getting hit.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> So I\u2019m fighting back.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> At that point, Revere heard, \u201c \u2018Brother, help me.\u2019 \u201d \u201cI see Leach go up under the bed.... And ... they couldn\u2019t get to him, so they came at me.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1028-7\">Revere ran past cell 20 to the steps that led to the control booth, getting hit in the back and neck as he ran. He got down the steps and fell against the wall. He \u201cturned around in time to throw [his] hand by to block [his] face,\u201d and his finger came off.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> The \u201cnext thing\u201d he knew, the door to the control \u201cpop[ped] open,\u201d and he ran through the door to safety.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1028-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-15\">Prison officials have an Eighth Amendment duty to \u201ctake reasonable measures to guarantee the safety of the inmates.\u201d <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 526-27, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 3200, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984); <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 832, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 1976, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). This duty is such that an official\u2019s \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to an inmate\u2019s \u201csubstantial risk of serious harm\u201d at the hands of another inmate violates the Eighth Amendment. <em>Farmer </em>at 828, 114 S.Ct. at 1974. To prove a violation, two requirements must be met. \u201cFirst, the alleged deprivation must be, objectively, \u2018sufficiently serious.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 834, 114 S.Ct. at 1978. \u201c[T]he inmate must show that he is incarcerated under conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe second requirement follows from the principle that \u2018only the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain implicates the Eighth Amendment.\u2019... [The] prison official must have a \u2018sufficiently culpable state of mind.\u2019_ [T]hat state of mind is one of \u2018deliberate indifference\u2019 to inmate health or safety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArL\">[A] prison official cannot be found liable under the Eighth Amendment for deny<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>ing an inmate humane conditions of confinement unless the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety; the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference. This approach comports best with the text of the Amendment as our cases have interpreted it. The Eighth Amendment does not outlaw cruel and unusual \u201cconditions\u201d; it outlaws cruel and unusual \u201cpunishments.\u201d An act or omission unaccompanied by knowledge of a significant risk of harm might well be something society wishes to discourage, and if harm does result society might well wish to assure compensation. The common law reflects such concerns when it imposes tort liability on a purely objective basis.... But an official\u2019s failure to alleviate a significant risk that he should have perceived but did not, while no cause for commendation, cannot under our cases be condemned as the infliction of punishment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 837, 114 S. Ct. at 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-6\">With these principles in hand, we consider Revere\u2019s claims against the four officials. His separate claims against Lt. Waters and Sgts. Bussey and Perry fail for lack of any evidence establishing that official was deliberately indifferent to the risk of harm Revere allegedly faced or that if there was a risk, that the official drew the inference that it in fact existed. On June 7, he encountered Bussey in the dining hall and Waters on leaving the hall and complained to each about being housed in H-l with \u201call these Hispanics,\u201d but nothing more. On June 12, when Revere met with Waters for the classification interview, he reiterated the complaint. Water\u2019s response was that he would try to have him reassigned to Building M. That seemed to satisfy Revere. On deposition, Revere mentioned Sgt, Perry only once. He saw Perry after he spoke to Warden Hart. Perry was \u201cplacing some benches inside the dorm area.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> And that was all. In sum, the evidence, taken in the light most favorable to Revere, fails to make out the Eighth Amendment claim alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-10\">The evidence bearing on Revere\u2019s claim against Warden Hart is more extensive, but it also fails to establish a constitutional violation. When Revere spoke to Hart on June 14 while Hart and a CERT team were conducting inspections and referred to the war between the GD and Hispanic inmates, Hart was well aware of what Revere was referring to\u2014the assaults that occurred in Buildings G-l and G-2 on May 29 and 30. He had received the Department of Corrections incident reports, which described the assaults in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-11\">The Incident Report of the May 29 assault disclosed that at 9:40 p.m. that day, two black inmates, Jerome Singleton, and Jeremy Saffold, entered the cell of an Hispanic inmate, Rodolfo Santiago, in Building G-l and asked him for his cell phone. Santiago refused to give it to him, so he was beaten by Singleton, Saffold and two other black inmates, Derrick Dorsey and Thomas Green.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The stolen phone was recovered in a search of the cell of a fifth black inmate, Marcus Stephens.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> A search of the dorm revealed three weapons and 11 pieces of metal, all in the common area.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Earlier in the day, inmate Dorsey assault<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>ed Ignacio Meza, a Hispanic inmate.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Both Santiago and Meza received medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">The May 30 incident occurred in Building G-2. At 2:42 p.m., a fight broke out between several black and Hispanic inmates. The fight was in retaliation of the assault that took place in Building G-l the day before. Twelve inmates were involved, and nine weapons were recovered. Several were treated for 'injuries. The inmates were handcuffed, and Buildings G and H were locked down.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">Warden Hart was aware that Revere was one of the GD leaders and had served considerable time at WSP. Moreover, and as Revere testified, he was aware that Revere\u2014during his previous incarceration at WSP\u2014had served as a \u201cmediator\u201d of inmate disputes. It was therefore reasonable for Hart to tell Revere to negotiate a truce with the Hispanic inmates. If that didn\u2019t satisfy Revere, Hart told him to \u201ctalk to ... classification,\u201d which had the authority to move him to a different cell. Nothing happened between his conversation with Revere on June 14 and June 26 that would have put Hart on notice that Revere was in imminent danger of the assault that eventually occurred.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1030-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1023-12\">.
