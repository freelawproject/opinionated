Carr responded \u201cwhat, what the fuck\u201d and pointed at her home, saying, \u201cI live here. This is my home.\u201d Carr did not realize at the time that Cadeau was a police officer. As she entered her home, Officer Cadeau ran through her garage, grabbed her, and shoved her head into a car. Both Carr and Gibson were arrested and taken to jail. They were released the next day, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>charges against them were later dismissed. The couple soon sued Officer Cadeau, the City of Atlanta, Atlanta\u2019s police chief, and the organizers of Flux Festival, a public arts event that was taking place next to where Carr and Gibson were arrested. Carr and Gibson alleged that Officer Ca-deau arrested them without either probable cause or a warrant and in retaliation for Carr\u2019s speech. All the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which the district court denied. Officer Cadeau alone appealed that order. We affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">\u201cGovernment officials performing discretionary functions are entitled to qualified immunity \u2018insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u2019\u201d Hartley v.

The allegations in the complaint are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Carr and Gibson live in the Castleberry Hill neighborhood of downtown Atlanta. On the evening of October 5, 2013, the street in front of their home was closed to car traffic for a public arts event called the Flux Festival. The City of Atlanta had granted a permit for the event and arranged for off-duty police officers to provide security. Carr and Gibson were returning from the Flux Festival late at night when they heard Officer Cadeau tell them to get off the street. Officer Cadeau did not identify himself as a police officer. At the time Officer Cadeau yelled at them, Carr and Gibson were walking about 20 to 30 feet from the entrance to their home. Carr responded \u201cwhat, what the fuck.\u201d She then pointed at her door and said, \u201cI live here. This is my home.\u201d The couple then continued walking toward their home.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">When they reached their home, Gibson\" began to open the garage door by entering a code into a keypad next to the door. As he entered this code, \u201ca bright flashlight was shined into his face.\u201d Gibson looked around the street but couldn\u2019t see who was holding the light. He then walked through the garage door and hit the button to close the door behind -him. Once he entered the garage, he saw that Officer Cadeau was in the garage chasing his wife into their home. Officer Cadeau began \u201cgrabbing Plaintiff Carr and twisting her arm violently behind her, shoving her head-first into a parked car in the garage, then dragging her backwards, passing Plaintiff Gibson, out onto the street area.\u201d Officer Ca-deau then told another police officer to arrest Gibson \u201cwhile continuing to drag Plaintiff Carr to his police vehicle where she was arrested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">Carr and Gibson were both taken to the Atlanta City Jail and held until the next morning. Both Carr and Gibson were eventually given citations for violations of the City of Atlanta\u2019s municipal code. Carr\u2019s citation charged her with disorderly conduct while under the influence, and Gibson\u2019s charged him with disorderly conduct. When the couple appeared in court to answer their citations, the charges were dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>missed. Carr alleges that she suffered loss of liberty, reputational damage, humiliation, physical injuries, and lost wages, as well as medical costs. Gibson alleges that he suffered loss of liberty, reputational damage, humiliation, and emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Carr and Gibson first claim that Officer Cadeau violated their Fourth Amendment rights when he entered their home and arrested them without probable cause. Officer Cadeau claims that he is protected by the doctrine of qualified immunity because he had \u201carguable probable cause\u201d to arrest the couple. See Scarbrough v. Myles, 245 F.3d 1299, 1302 (11th Cir. 2001) (\u201c[A]ll that is required for qualified immunity to be applicable to an arresting officer is arguable probable cause to believe that a person is committing a particular public offense.\u201d (quotation omitted)). At the time Carr and Gibson were arrested, \u201cour binding precedent clearly established ... that an arrest made without arguable probable cause violates the Fourth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d Skop v. City of Atlanta, Ga., 485 F.3d 1130, 1143 (11th Cir. 2007). Arguable probable cause exists \u201cwhere reasonable officers in the same circumstances and possessing the same knowledge as the Defendant ] could have believed that probable cause existed to arrest.\u201d Lee v. Ferraro, 284 F.3d 1188, 1195 (11th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Officer Cadeau makes several arguments for why he had arguable probable cause to arrest Carr and Gibson. First, he argues that he had arguable probable cause because Carr and Gibson did not obey his order to get off the street. This argument fails. As an initial matter, the complaint alleges that Carr and Gibson did not know who told them to get off the street. The complaint reveals nothing about whether Officer Cadeau had a valid basis to suspect that Carr and Gibson were intentionally disobeying a police officer. And even if we could assume that Officer Cadeau had a sufficient basis to believe that Carr and Gibson knew that it was a police officer who was ordering them off the street, the complaint alleged that Carr and Gibson immediately obeyed this order. Specifically, the complaint said that the couple \u201cwalked in a peaceful and lawful manner directly to the automatic garage door adjacent to the sidewalk to the residence.\u201d And Officer Cadeau acknowledges in his appeal brief that he \u201cfollowed Ms. Carr to her residence after she ... continued walking toward her home.\u201d We fail to see how Officer Cadeau could have thought Carr and- Gibson were disobeying his command to get off the street when he admits that they immediately left the street and walked to their home. According to Officer Cadeau\u2019s own account of the events leading up to the arrest, Carr and Gibson obeyed his command.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">Officer Cadeau next says arguable probable cause arose from the fact that Carr replied \u201cwhat, what the fuck\u201d and \u201cI live here\u201d when told to get off the street. According to Officer Cadeau, these words show that Carr <em>\u201cadmittedly </em>refused to comply with his request to get out of the road.\u201d But again, Officer Cadeau admits that Carr and Gibson <em>did </em>immediately comply with his \u201crequest to get out of the road\u201d by walking into their home. Also, Carr\u2019s comments in no way \u201cadmitted!) ]\u201d that she wouldn\u2019t \u201ccomply with [Officer Cadeau\u2019s] request to get out of the road.\u201d Carr indicated where her home was and then walked out of the road and into her home. This is entirely consistent with what Officer Cadeau told them to do. Even if we assumed that a pedestrian\u2019s failure to obey a command from an unknown source can serve as the basis for an arrest, the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>before us here shows that Carr and Gibson obeyed Officer Cadeau\u2019s command.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Also, to the extent Officer Cadeau is arguing that the substance of Carr\u2019s verbal \u201cwhat, what the fuck\u201d and \u201cI live here\u201d reply alone served as a basis to arrest her, this is .precisely what Carr and Gibson say violated their First Amendment rights. The First Amendment very clearly protects \u201c[t]he freedom of individuals verbally to oppose or challenge police action without thereby risking arrest.\u201d City of Houston, Tex. v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 462-63, 107 S.Ct. 2502, 2510, 96 L.Ed.2d 398 (1987); see also id. at 461, 107 S.Ct. at 2509 (\u201c[T]he First Amendment protects a significant amount of verbal criticism and challenge directed at police officers. Speech is often provocative and challenging. But it is nevertheless protected against censorship or punishment, unless shown likely to produce a clear and present danger of a serious substantive evil that rises far above public inconvenience, annoyance, or unrest.\u201d) (quotation omitted and alteration adopted). Officer Cadeau does hot argue that he perceived \u201ca clear and present danger of a serious substantive evil that rises far above public inconvenience, annoyance, or unrest.\u201d Id. at 461,107 S.Ct. at 2509. And nothing in the complaint suggests this to be the case. Carr\u2019s verbal response to Officer Cadeau did not establish arguable probable cause to arrest her.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Officer Cadeau next says arguable probable cause arose from the fact that Gibson \u201cadmits that while Officer Cadeau was attempting to arrest Ms. Carr, he (Mr. Gibson) \u2018pressed the close button for the garage door, causing the garage door to begin to close.\u2019 \u201d According to Officer Ca-deau\u2019s appeal brief, this \u201cclosed Officer Cadeau into the property\u201d and gave rise to arguable probable cause. First, it is not clear'how Gibson closing his garage door could furnish the probable cause for Officer Cadeau to enter the couple\u2019s home or try to seize Carr, since Officer Cadeau did both those things well before Gibson pressed his garage door button. Even for Gibson\u2019s arrest, Officer Cadeau\u2019s argument doesn\u2019t add up, Gibson never \u201cclosed Officer Cadeau into the property.\u201d By the time Gibson was arrested, Officer Cadeau knew that he was never trapped in the garage. As the complaint alleges, \u201cthe garage door automatically reopened itself\u2019 when Officer Cadeau dragged Carr under the closing door. The record before us does not reveal how Gibson closing his garage door could have furnished arguable probable cause for either Gibson\u2019s arrest or Carr\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Officer Cadeau ordered Carr and Gibson off of a road where they were lawfully walking. When Carr spoke up in protest, Officer Cadeau chased her into her home without identifying himself, grabbed her, shoved her head against a car, dragged her outside, and then had her husband arrested as well. At least that\u2019s what this complaint alleges. And we must treat these allegations as true for now. We agree with the district court that a reasonable officer would not have believed there was probable cause for an arrest based on the facts as alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">Carr and Gibson also claim that Officer Cadeau violated their First Amendment right to freedom of speech by arresting them in retaliation for what Carr said to Officer Cadeau. \u201cThis Court and the Supreme Court have long held that state officials may not retaliate against private citizens because of the exercise of their First Amendment rights.\u201d Bennett v. Hendrix, 423 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir. 2005). Officer Cadeau argues that he did not violate any clearly established law and relies on this language from Redd v. City of Enterprise, 140 F.3d 1378 (11th Cir. 1998):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-11\">Because we hold that the officers had arguable probable cause to arrest [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>plaintiff] for disorderly conduct, we must hold that the officers are also entitled to qualified immunity from the plaintiffs\u2019 First Amendment claims. When a police officer has probable cause to believe that a person is committing a particular public offense, he is justified in arresting that person, even if the offender may be speaking at the time that he is arrested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Apu\">Id. at 1383.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">As an initial matter, Officer Ca-deau\u2019s argument that Carr simply happened to \u201cbe speaking at the time that [s]he [wa]s arrested,\u201d id. undermines his separate argument that Carr\u2019s verbal response gave him probable cause to arrest her. Officer Cadeau is arguing both that there was no Fourth Amendment violation because Carr\u2019s verbal statement was the reason he could arrest her and also that there was no First Amendment claim because that statement was <em>not </em>the reason he arrested her. These arguments are in conflict. In any event, Carr and Gibson have not alleged that they simply happened to be speaking at the time they were arrested for otherwise valid reasons. Rather, their claim is that Officer Cadeau chased them into their garage and arrested them in retaliation for Carr\u2019s protected speech. This court\u2019s precedent provides that \u201cthe law was clearly established at the time of [Officer Cadeau\u2019s] alleged actions that retaliation against private citizens for exercising their First Amendment rights was actionable.\u201d Bennett, 423 F.3d at 1255. We agree with the distinct court that the complaint alleges a violation of a clearly established First Amendment right.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Carr and Gibson also filed state law claims against Officer Cadeau. Officer Ca-deau moved to dismiss these claims based on the Georgia law doctrine of official immunity, which requires proof of \u201cactual malice\u201d or \u201cactual intent to cause injury\u201d in lawsuits against state officials for injuries arising from official conduct. Ga. const, art. 1, sec. II, par. IX(d). Carr and Gibson argue that they have pleaded \u201cactual malice.\u201d Indeed the complaint repeatedly alleged that Officer Cadeau acted with \u201cactual malice\u201d and \u201cdeliberate intent to do wrong\u201d in assaulting and arresting them. And they also alleged specific facts suggesting that Officer Cadeau chose to assault and arrest them because of what Carr said to him. Further, they alleged facts suggesting that Officer Cadeau had no reason to arrest them other than these comments. This was enough to survive a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">The district court correctly denied the motion to dismiss. From the face of the complaint, Officer Cadeau is not protected by either qualified immunity under federal law or official immunity under Georgia law.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
