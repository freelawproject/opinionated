(\u201cZenith\u201d), which, as the plan\u2019s former third-party administrator, performed accounting services for the plan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In their complaint, the appellants claimed that Zenith breached its fiduciary duties to the plan, as set forth in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1104(a)(1), and engaged in self-dealing, as defined in \u00a7 1106(a)(1), when it convinced the trustees to convert the plan\u2019s accounts from the cash-based accounting method to the accrual-based method;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> mishandled the conversion so that it allocated more funds (approximately $1.4 million) to participant accounts than the plan had in total assets; and failed to inform the trustees of the error for approximately seven years. The district court granted Zenith\u2019s motion to dismiss, concluding that the complaint failed to state a claim for breach of f\u00edducia-ry duties or self-dealing under ERISA because Zenith was not a fiduciary of the plan, and, in any event, the claims were time-barred pursuant to the six-year statute of limitations in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1113(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-10\">On appeal, the appellants argue that: (1) the district court erred in finding their allegations were insufficient to establish Zenith was a fiduciary within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(21)(A); (2) even if Zenith was not a fiduciary, the district court erred in dismissing their self-dealing claim, which was alternatively based on Zenith\u2019s status as a party in interest; and (3) the district court\u2019s statute-of-limitations ruling was erroneous. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-11\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim de novo, accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Am. Dental Ass\u2019n v. Cigna Corp., 605 F.3d 1283, 1288 (11th Cir. 2010). We also review the district court\u2019s application of ERISA\u2019s statute of limitations, which is a question of law, de novo. Witt v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 772 F.3d 1269, 1274 (11th Cir. 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-12\">To survive a motion to dismiss, a plaintiff must plead facts sufficient to \u201craise a right to relief above the speculative level.\u201d Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). \u201cWhile [the] complaint ... does not need detailed factual allegations, [the] plaintiff\u2019s obligation to provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>action will not do.\u201d Id. (quotations, citation, and alteration omitted). \u201cThreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.\u201d Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">\u201cIn every ease charging breach of ERISA fiduciary duty ... the threshold question is not whether the actions of some person employed to provide services under a plan adversely affected a plan beneficiary\u2019s interest, but whether that person was acting as a fiduciary (that is, was performing a fiduciary function) when taking the action subject to complaint.\u201d Pegram v. Herdrich, 530 U.S. 211, 226, 120 S.Ct. 2143, 147 L.Ed.2d 164 (2000). An entity performs a fiduciary function under ERISA when it: (1) \u201cexercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of [an ERISA] plan\u201d; (2) \u201chas any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of [the] plan\u201d; or (3) \u201cexercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of [plan] assets.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(21)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">Proof, of an entity\u2019s fiduciary status \u201cmay come from the plan document, but can also come from the factual circumstances surrounding the administration of the plan, even if these factual circumstances contradict the designation in the plan document.\u201d Hamilton v. Allen-Bradley Co., Inc., 244 F.3d 819, 824 (11th Cir. 2001). The fiduciary function is not an \u201call-or-nothing concept,\u201d and a defendant is only a 'fiduciary to the extent that he exercises discretionary authority \u201cwith respect to the particular activity at issue.\u201d Cotton v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co., 402 F.3d 1267, 1277 (11th Cir. 2005) (quotations omitted). A third-party administrator that performs purely ministerial functions, such as calculating benefits, maintaining participant records, and communicating with participants, is not a fiduciary within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(21)(A). 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2509.75-8 (D-2); Cotton, 402 F.3d at 1279 (holding insurer\u2019s allocation of premium payments, analysis of policy performance, and communications with participants constituted \u201cministerial policy-related services\u201d that did not \u201crender [the insurer] a fiduciary\u201d); Baker v. Big Star Div. of the Grand Union Co., 893 F.2d 288, 290 (11th Cir. 1989) (\u201ca plan ad, ministrator who merely performs claims processing, investigatory, and record keeping duties is not a fiduciary\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-8\">The district court concluded that Zenith\u2019s alleged activities as third-party administrator were ministerial, rather than discretionary, in nature, and they thus did not give rise to fiduciary responsibility under ERISA. The court noted that, while Zenith allegedly recommended that the plan convert to the accrual method, the complaint alleged that the plan made the change only after the trustees voted on the recommendation. In other words, the complaint made clear that Zenith lacked discretionary authority to make the change on its own. The court found that the remainder ' of Zenith\u2019s alleged activities\u2014 which involved re-calculating participant benefits based on the trustees\u2019 decision to change accounting methods, reconciling accounts, and sending notices to participants\u2014amounted to purely ministerial functions that did not give rise to fiduciary status.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-9\">The appellants dispute this determination, first arguing that Zenith exercised discretion giving rise to fiduciary responsibility when it: (1) independently made the decisions necessary- to implement the change to the accrual method; (2) decided on two occasions to delay the preparation and distribution of annual participant ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>count statements; (3) delegated some of its accounting duties to Clack, which the trustees had separately contracted to perform other accounting services; and (4) failed to inform the trustees about its mishandling of the conversion to the accrual method. However, to the extent Zenith may have exercised some discretion in carrying out these actions, that discretion did not give rise to fiduciary responsibility. Rather, these actions related to the performance of purely ministerial functions, like the \u201c[c]alculation of benefits\u201d and the \u201c[preparation of employee communications material.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2509.75-8 (D-2). Indeed, none of the appellants\u2019 allegations established that Zenith had authority to make decisions that affected the plan, outside the purely ministerial functions the trustees instructed it to perform. See Useden v. Acker, 947 F.2d 1563, 1575 (11th Cir. 1991) (noting an entity \u201cwill not be considered a fiduciary if [its] discretion is sufficiently limited by a pre-existing framework of policies, practices and procedures\u201d); see also Reich v. Lancaster, 55 F.3d 1034, 1048-49 (5th Cir. 1995) (\u201cTo be [a] fiduciarfy], [an entity] must exercise discretionary authority and control that amounts to actual decision making power.\u201d); Martin v. Feilen, 965 F.2d 660, 669 (8th Cir. 1992) (holding accountants were fiduciaries, where they not only provided professional accounting services, but also recommended transactions, structured deals, and provided investment advice to such an extent that they exercised effective control over the plan\u2019s assets).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">As for the appellants\u2019 allegation that Zenith failed to inform the trustees of its accounting errors\u2014thereby usurping the trustees\u2019' discretionary authority to manage the plan\u2019s accounts\u2014the complaint, notably, did not allege that Zenith, itself, took any discretionary action concerning the errors. The complaint alleged only that, once the errors came to light, the trustees made all decisions concerning corrective action, including hiring a forensic accountant to analyze the problem, instructing Zenith to reconcile participant accounts, and then instructing Zenith to ask participants with negative account balances to repay the overages. Accordingly, the district court did not err in concluding that Zenith did not exercise or have discretion with regard to the management or administration of the plan that gave rise to fiduciary duties under ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-8\">The appellants next say that, even if Zenith did not exercise or have discretion over the management or administration of the plan, it was a fiduciary since it \u201cexercise[d] ... authority or control respecting management or disposition of [the plan\u2019s] assets.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(21)(A)(i).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The appellants point to allegations that Zenith \u201caccounted] for the Plan\u2019s funds, including the inflow of funds, ... maintained] the Plan\u2019s funds, ... calculated] participant accounts[,] and determined] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>benefit eligibility.\u201d But these allegations all relate to Zenith\u2019s role in accounting for the plan\u2019s assets; they do not show that Zenith exercised authority or control over the assets. For example, they do not allege that Zenith took plan assets into its possession or wrongfully paid plan assets over to participants, itself, or others. Cf. Coldesina, 407 F.3d at 1133 (concluding accountant was a fiduciary, not based on his preparation of plan financial documents, but because he received contributions from the plan, deposited the funds into his business account, and wrote checks on behalf of the plan); Guyan, 689 F.3d at 798 (concluding third-party administrator was a fiduciary based on its authority to write checks on the plan account, its control over where plan funds were deposited and how and when they were disbursed, and its use of the funds for its own purposes); Srein, 323 F.3d at 221-22 (concluding trustee was a fiduciary since it accepted insurance policy proceeds belonging to the plan and erroneously distributed the proceeds to a non-plan customer). While the complaint alleged that the plan\u2019s funds were incorrectly paid out to plan participants based on Zenith\u2019s errors, it did not allege that the funds were ever under Zenith\u2019s authority or control or that Zenith, itself, wrongfully paid out the funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-4\">The appellants also assert that Zenith had check-writing authority for the plan, and it thus had actual authority or control over the plan\u2019s assets. However, while courts have based ERISA fiduciary status on an entity\u2019s check-writing authority, see Coldesina, 407 F-3d at 1134 (\u201cacting as a signatory on behalf of a plan can indicate fiduciary control\u201d); IT Corp., 107 F.3d at 1421 (\u201cThe right to -write checks on plan funds is \u2018authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets.\u2019\u201d), here the complaint alleged only that Zenith \u201cbill[ed] the Trustees for the time [it] spent correcting [its] mistakes\u201d and \u201cwent so far as to write a check on the Plan\u2019s account made payable to itself and submit that check to the Chairman of the Board of Trustees for his signature.\u201d These allegations fail to show that Zenith had check-writing authority for the plan. Rather, they indicate that Zenith was not a signatory on the plan\u2019s bank account and it could not dispose of plan assets without the trustees\u2019 approval. Accordingly, the district court did not err in concluding that Zenith was not an ERISA fiduciary and in dismissing the breach-of-fiduciary-duties count for failure to state a claim under ERISA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b991-8\">Finally, the appellants argue that, even if Zenith was not a fiduciary, the district court erred in dismissing their self-dealing claim, which was based, not just on Zenith\u2019s alleged status as a fiduciary, but also on its undisputed status as a party in interest.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The appellants recognize that ERISA\u2019s self-dealing provision, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1106(a)(1), reads as a direct prohibition on the fiduciary.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, they maintain that, pursuant to Harris Trust &amp; Sav. Bank v. Salomon Smith Barney, Inc., 530 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>U.S. 288, 248-49, 120 S.Ct. 2180, 147 L.Ed.2d 187 (2000), a fiduciary\u2014such as the trustees in this case\u2014may maintain an action against a party in interest\u2014such as Zenith\u2014even if the suit is based on the fiduciary\u2019s own mistake or wrongdoing. Even assuming that the complaint stated a claim for self-dealing against Zenith under \u00a7 1106(a)(1), we agree with the district court that the claim was time-barred under the six-year statute of limitations in 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1113(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">As alleged in the complaint, the self-dealing claim was based on Zenith\u2019s \u201crecommendation that the Trustees convert the Plan to accrual accounting,\u201d which the appellants alleged Zenith had done \u201cout of self-interest, rather than in the best interests of the Plan.\u201d As the district court noted, the complaint alleged that Zenith recommended conversion to the accrual method in May 2004 and that Zenith made the errors in the conversion process shortly thereafter, sometime before the trustees\u2019 August 26, 2004 board meeting. The appellants filed the complaint on June 10, 2014\u2014nearly ten years after the events on which the self-dealing claim was based. The claim was thus untimely by approximately four years.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">The appellants maintain that the self-dealing claim was timely pursuant to Tibble v. Edison Int\u2019l, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 1823, 1828, 191 L.Ed.2d 795 (2015), in which the Supreme Court held that \u00a7 1104(a)(1) imposes upon ERISA fiduciaries a continuing duty to monitor investments they have selected for an ERISA plan and to remove investments that no longer serve the plan\u2019s interests. The Supreme Court explained that, when the plaintiff alleges a breach of the duty to monitor, ERISA\u2019s six-year limitations period begins to run, not from the time the fiduciary selected the investments at issue, but from the time the applicable facts and circumstances gave rise to a duty to monitor and alter the investments. See id. at 1829.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-8\">On appeal, the appellants argue that Zenith was unqualified to perform the accounting services the trustees contracted it to perform, and, as a party in interest, it had a continuing duty to disclose to the trustees its incompetency and the errors it made in converting the plan\u2019s accounts to the accrual method. However, the appellants did not plead that the self-dealing claim was based on an on-going duty to disclose. And, even if they had, Tibbie does not support a conclusion that Zenith, as a party in interest, had any such duty. Tib-bie addressed the duty of an ERISA fiduciary to monitor investments it selects for an ERISA plan. The Court\u2019s holding was rooted in the common law of trusts, which is the basis for ERISA\u2019s fiduciary duties, and which imposes a duty on trustees to \u201cmonitor investments and remove imprudent ones.\u201d Id. at 1828-29. The Tibbie Court did not\u2014as the appellants acknowledge\u2014address the scope of an ERISA party in interest\u2019s duties with regard to the prohibited transactions enumerated in \u00a7 1106(a)(1). The appellants have pointed to no source of law that supports a conclusion that, under \u00a7 1106(a)(1), an ERISA party in interest has an ongoing duty of disclosure\u2014either in general, or specifically related to the party\u2019s incompetence or errors\u2014and we are aware of none. Accordingly, the self-dealing claim could not be based on any failure to disclose. Rather, the claim was based on Zenith\u2019s recommendation to convert to the accrual method and its conversion errors, which occurred more than six years before the appellants filed their complaint. The district court thus did not err in deeming the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>self-dealing claim time-barred.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b988-8\">.

The appellants assert that this Court has not decided whether discretion is a prerequisite to fiduciary status for an entity that exercises authority or control over the \"management or disposition of [plan] assets.\u201d They assert, citing Guyan Int'l, Inc, v Prof'l Benefits Adm'rs, Inc., 689 F.3d 793, 798 (6th Cir. 2012); Chao v.

We need not decide the question here, because, even assuming discretion is not a prerequisite, we conclude that the complaint failed to establish that Zenith exercised authority or control over the plan\u2019s assets.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b991-5\">. Because we conclude that the district court properly dismissed the breach-of-fiduciary-duties count for failure to state a claim under ERISA, we do not address the court\u2019s alternative statute-of-limitations ruling on that count.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b991-6\">. ERISA defines a \"party in interest\u201d to include \u201ca person providing services to [an ERISA] plan.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(14)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b991-9\">.Section 1106(a) provides that \"[a] fiduciary with respect to a plan shall not cause the plan to engage in a transaction, if he knows or should know that such transaction constitutes a direct or indirect[:] ... furnishing of goods, services, or facilities between the plan and a party in interest; or ... transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of a party in interest, of any assets of the plan.,..\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1106(a)(1)(C), (D).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b993-14\">.

However, the appellants have not\u2014in either the district court or on appeal\u2014proffered any allegations they would have added to the complaint to address the \"perceived deficiencies.\u201d Accordingly, we fail to see how amendment would have helped the appellants and we discern no abuse of discretion by the district court in denying their request for leave to amend.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
