Core Construction, a general contractor for a condominium development, sued Crum &amp; Forster for allegedly breaching its duties to defend and indemnify Core Construction as an additional insured on a commercial general liability insurance policy issued to its subcontractor, Patnode Roofing, Inc. The district court ruled that Crum &amp; Forster owed no duty to defend or indemnify because the action against Core Construction to recover the costs of repairing and replacing roofing installed incorrectly by Patnode did not constitute \u201cproperty damage\u201d under the insurance policy. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">After Core Construction relinquished control of the condominium development to a homeowners association, Hurricane Wilma damaged several roofs in the development. The association and its insurer, Empire Indemnity Insurance Company, discovered that the roofing had been installed incorrectly by Patnode. Empire paid for the damages and, in exchange, the association assigned its claims against Core Construction and its subcontractors, including Patnode, to Empire. The assignment provided that it pertained to \u201cthe damages and defects sustained by the roofs of ... 24 buildings\u201d and that it was \u201crestricted to the damages to the roofs ... arising from [their] faulty construction and development.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">Empire sued Core Construction, Pat-node, and other subcontractors in a Florida court for negligence, breach of express and implied warranties, and violations of building codes. Core Construction was a named insured on a general commercial liability insurance policy that Crum <em>&amp; </em>Forster had issued to Patnode. Core Construction requested a defense from Crum <em>&amp; </em>Forster, which it refused to provide. Crum <em>&amp; </em>Forster determined that' a claim for reimbursement for defective work by Pat-node did not constitute \u201cproperty damage,\u201d which its policy defined as \u201c[p]hysical injury to tangible property, including all resulting loss of use of that property.\u201d Empire later settled with Core Construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">In the meantime, Core Construction filed a complaint in the district court that Crum &amp; Forster had breached duties owed Patnode to defend and indemnify Core Construction as an additional insured. Crum &amp; Forster and Core Construction filed cross motions for summary judgment. Crum <em>&amp; </em>Forster argued that Core Construction was not an additional insured. Alternatively, Crum &amp; Forster argued that the claim asserted against Core Construction in the underlying state action did not involve \u201cproperty damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">The district court granted the motion of Crum <em>&amp; </em>Forster for summary judgment and denied the motion filed by Core Construction. The district court ruled that, \u201ceven assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Core Construction was an additional insured under the CGL poliefy],\u201d Crum <em>&amp; </em>Forster was not obligated to defend or indemnify Core Construction in an action that did not involve \u201cproperty damage,\u201d which the Supreme Court of Florida had explained in <em>United States Fire Insurance Co. v. J.S.U.B., Inc., </em>979 So.2d 871 (Fla. 2007), and <em>Auto-Owners Insurance Co. v. Pozzi Window Co., </em>984 So.2d 1241 (Fla. 2008), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>requires damage to tangible property other than defective work. Empire did not make \u201cany allegations that Patnode\u2019s (allegedly faulty) work resulted in \u2018property damage,\u2019 as ... defined in the 2005 Policy,\u201d the district court determined, because the complaint \u201conly asserted that the roofs had been damaged, rather than asserting that the roofs had caused damage to other elements of\u2019 the buildings. \u201cBecause Crum <em>&amp; </em>Forster had no obligation to defend Core Construction,\u201d the district court ruled that the insurer \u201calso has no duty to indemnify....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a summary judgment. <em>Amerisure Mut. Ins. Co. v. Auchter Co., </em>673 F.3d 1294, 1295 n.2 (11th Cir. 2012). Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Core Construction argues that Crum &amp; .Forster was obligated to provide a defense in the state action filed by Empire. The complaint in that action, Core Construction contends, alleged that the defective installation of roofing by its subcontractor caused \u201cproperty damage.\u201d Core Construction argues that the district court failed to consider the complaint in conjunction with the written assignment and with documents that described the damage to the condominiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">In the policy that Crum <em>&amp; </em>Forster issued, \u201cproperty damage\u201d is defined as \u201cphysical injury to tangible property.\u201d And we must interpret the language of the policy consistent with Florida law. <em>See Amerisure, </em>673 F.3d at 1300. The Supreme Court of Florida has concluded that \u201cproperty damage\u201d involves \u201cdamage beyond the faulty workmanship or defective work.\u201d <em>J.S.U.B., </em>979 So.2d at 889. The \u201cfaulty workmanship or defective work ... [must] damage[] the otherwise nondefec-tive completed project.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As a result, there is no coverage for \u201cproperty damage\u201d when a claim seeks solely \u201cthe costs of repairing and replacing the actual defects in .., construction.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">We have held that a claim for the costs to repair and replace a roof was not covered as \u201cproperty damage\u201d in a commercial liability policy like the one issued by Crum &amp; Forster. <em>Amerisure, </em>673 F.3d at 1306. In <em>Amerisure, </em>the insurer for a general contractor assumed the defense in an action by the owner of an inn to recover the costs of repairing and replacing roof tiles that were installed improperly and that later dislodged and damaged other roof tiles. <em>Id. </em>at 1296. Because the owner did not allege that the inn suffered any \u201cdamage beyond the faulty workmanship\u201d and sought \u201csolely to remedy the installation of a defective component, which ... [was] the roof <em>as a whole,\u201d </em>we concluded that the owner\u2019s claim did not constitute \u201cproperty damage\u201d under the commercial liability policy. <em>Id. </em>at 1307-09. We reached that conclusion based on the distinction the court had drawn in <em>J.S.U.B., </em>979 So.2d at 890, \u201cbetween a claim for the cost of repairing the subcontractor\u2019s defective work, which <em>is not </em>covered under a CGL policy, and a claim for repairing the structural damage to the completed project caused by the subcontractor\u2019s defective work, which <em>is </em>covered.\u201d <em>Amerisure, </em>673 F.3d at 1306 (internal citation marks, brackets, and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">The complaint that Empire filed against Core Construction alleged a claim for the cost of repairing and replacing a roof that had been installed improperly by its subcontractor. Empire alleged that \u201cthe roofs of the condominiums were negligently and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>improperly constructed and, due to the companies\u2019 negligence in using \u201cdeficient and substandard tile installation procedures and practices,\u201d Empire had \u201cto repair and replace the roofs of the condominiums resulting in damages in excess of $2,500,000.\u201d In its counts for breach of express and implied warranties, Empire alleged that the \u201cdefect in the condominiums ... caused the total loss of the condominiums roofs\u201d and that the companies had been \u201ctimely notified of the loss of the condominiums and[, despite being] given the opportunity to honor their warranties,\u201d they \u201cfailed and refused to\u201d do so. And in its count about the violation of building codes, Empire alleged that it had \u201cbeen required to repair and replace the latently defective roofs of the condominiums resulting in damages in excess of $2,500,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Crum <em>&amp; </em>Forster owed no duty to provide a defense to Core Construction because the complaint against it did not allege a claim for \u201cproperty damage.\u201d Empire failed to allege that the defective installation of roofing caused \u201cphysical injury to tangible property\u201d such that there was \u201cdamage to the completed project caused by the subcontractor\u2019s defective [roofing] work,\u201d <em>Amerisure, </em>673 F.3d at 1306, or that the defective work \u201ccaused the roof to fail in such a way as to allow the elements to damage other components of the project,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1297. Empire, like the owner of the inn in <em>Amerisure, </em>\u201cnever alleged that any part of the [buildings or development] other than the roof was damaged by the defective roof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1307.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Core Construction argues that the complaint alleged \u201cproperty damage\u201d in three ways, but its arguments fail. First, Core Construction argues that the complaint \u201calleged [there] was a catastrophic total loss of the condominiums,\u201d but the complaint alleged that there was a \u201ctotal loss of the condominiums roofs\u201d and that the \u201crepair and replacement of] the roofs of the condominiums resulted] in damages.\u201d Although Empire alleged that it gave \u201ctimely notice of the loss of the condominiums,\u201d as the district court stated, that \u201clanguage is too vague\u201d to allege damage independent of the repair and replacement of the roofs. Second, Core Construction argues that the written assignment that Empire attached to the complaint \u201cestablished] that the alleged roof defects not only caused, but increased, other storm damage,\u201d but the assignment was explicitly \u201crestricted to the damages to the roofs ... arising from [their] faulty construction and development.\u201d Third, Core Construction argues that \u201cEmpire\u2019s reference to [expert reports and other] documents established] .additional property damage,\u201d but Empire alleged that it \u201cprovided copies of\u2019 the documents to the companies in an unsuccessful attempt to resolve the dispute. It was not enough, as Core Construction and its amici contend, for the complaint to \u201cindieat[e] there may have been covered damage,\u201d because \u201can insurance company\u2019s duty to defend an insured is determined solely from the allegations in the complaint against the insured, not by the true facts of the cause of action against the insured _\u201d <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Steinberg, </em>393 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir. 2004); <em>see Jones v. Fla. Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019, Inc., </em>908 So.2d 435, 443 (Fla. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-3\">IY.
