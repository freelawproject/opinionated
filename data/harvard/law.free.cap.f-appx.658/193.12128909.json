Giwa, federal prisoner # 05322-122, pleaded guilty in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada to 14 counts alleging various <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>fraud-related offenses. He was sentenced to 150 months of imprisonment. He appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition, in which he challenged his classification by the Bureau of Prisons. That classification, he argued, was based on an incorrect criminal history score in his presentence investigation report (PSR). He also claims, on appeal, that the district court did not address his request for relief under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s dismissal of a \u00a7 2241 petition de novo. <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 451 (5th Cir. 2000). Despite Giwa\u2019s attempt to reframe his argument as one directed at the execution of his current sentence, his challenge to the PSR\u2019s criminal history calculation is clearly directed at an error that allegedly occurred at sentencing. Ordinarily, a challenge to errors occurring at trial or sentencing must be brought in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Id. </em>Section 2255(e) permits a federal prisoner to challenge the legality of his conviction or sentence in a \u00a7 2241 petition only when the remedy in \u00a7 2255 \u201cis inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). To meet the requirements of the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e), Giwa had to show that his claim was (i) \u201cbased on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that [he] may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d and was (ii) \u201cforeclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in [his] trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Giwa has not made the required showing. Giwa\u2019s claim fails the first prong of the <em>Reyes-Requena </em>test because he did not argue in the district court, nor does he argue here, that his current federal conviction was for a nonexistent offense. <em>See </em>243 F.3d at 903-04. Giwa does not otherwise challenge the district court\u2019s determination that he failed to make the showing necessary to proceed under the savings clause. <em>See id. </em>at 904. Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed Giwa\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction. Also, Giwa\u2019s complaint that the district court erred by not holding an evidentiary hearing is without merit, as no hearing was required here. <em>See Ellis v. Lynaugh, </em>873 F.2d 830, 840 (5th Cir. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">Although the district court did not explicitly address Giwa\u2019s purported Rule 36 motion, Giwa\u2019s claim is nevertheless unavailing. The changes that Giwa requested be made in his PSR did not involve mechanically correcting a clerical error or an error arising from an oversight or omission. Rather, Giwa asked the district court to make a substantive change to the calculation of his criminal history score in the PSR, which is not something that was the result of clerical mistake or oversight. <em>See United States v. Buendia-Rangel, </em>553 F.3d 378, 379 (5th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b213-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
