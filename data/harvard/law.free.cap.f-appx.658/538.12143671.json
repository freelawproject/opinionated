For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-18\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b559-19\">Plaintiff Ybarra applied for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income benefits under Titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401-34 (2012); <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1381-1388f. Ybar-ra alleged disability as a result of back pain, issues with his right shoulder, hypertension, and depression. After Ybarra\u2019s administrative claims were twice denied, he requested a hearing before an Administrative Law Judg\u00e9 (\u201cALJ\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>After conducting the Social Security Administration\u2019s five-step sequential review process, <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)-(f) (2012), the ALJ found that Ybarra was not disabled. Ybarra\u2019s shoulder and back issues, hypertension, and depression were \u201csevere\u201d impairments (step two), but these impairments did not meet or equal the SSA\u2019s listed criteria for disability (step three). The ALJ assessed Ybarra\u2019s residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) and found that he could perform a range of unskilled, medium work, but that he was unable to perform his past work as a janitor, delivery driver, or warehouse-material handler (step four). The ALJ determined, however, based in part on testimony by a vocational expert (\u201cVE\u201d), that there existed job's in the national economy, such as kitchen helper, industrial or laboratory cleaner, or industrial cleaner and sweeper, that Ybar-ra could perform (step five).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">The Appeals Council denied Ybarra\u2019s request for review, and the district court affirmed the agency\u2019s decision. Ybarra timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">In Social Security appeals, we review <em>de novo </em>the determination of a district court that the ALJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Wilson v. Barnhart, </em>284 F.3d 1219, 1221 (11th Cir. 2002) (per curiam) (citing <em>Falge v. Apfel, </em>150 F.3d 1320, 1322 (11th Cir. 1998)). We also review <em>de novo </em>the legal principles on which the ALJ\u2019s decision is based. <em>Moore v. Barnhart, </em>405 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir. 2005) (per curiam) (citing <em>Chester v. Bowen, </em>792 F.2d 129, 131 (11th Cir. 1986) (per curiam)).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">\u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance. It is such relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Bloodsworth v. Heckler, </em>703 F.2d 1233, 1239 (11th Cir. 1983) (citing <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 1427, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971)). In deciding whether substantial evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s decision, we may not \u201cdecide facts anew, reweigh the evidence, or substitute our judgment for that of the [Commissioner.]\u201d <em>Dyer v. Barnhart, </em>395 F.3d 1206, 1210 (11th Cir. 2005) (per curiam) (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1240 n.8 (11th Cir. 2004)). If the Commissioner\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, it is conclusive, even if the evidence preponderates against it. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (2012); <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158-59 (11th Cir. 2004) (per curiam) (citing <em>Martin v. Sullivan, </em>894 F.2d 1520, 1529 (11th Cir. 1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">Ybarra argues that the ALJ improperly determined that he was not fully credible. Credibility determinations are the province of the ALJ, and will not be overturned unless not supported by substantial evidence. <em>Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1212. Here, the AlLJ\u2019s finding was supported by substantial evidence, Ybarra\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with his medical records in several places. He testified that he had not worked after March 2010, but according to his medical records, he was employed after this date. He testified that physical therapy did not help, but his medical records detail improvement in his symptoms. He testified that his physician recommended surgery, but this is not substantiated by the record.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The ALJ\u2019s find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>ing that Ybarra was not fully credible was supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Ybarra next argues that the ALJ erred in discounting the opinion of Ybar-ra\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Hamlet Hassan (\u201cDr. Hassan\u201d). In determining the weight to give a physician\u2019s opinion, the ALJ should consider the relationship between the physician and the claimant (treating and examining physicians being given more weight); the extent to which medical evidence supports the opinion; the opinion\u2019s consistency with the record as a whole; the physician\u2019s specialization; and other relevant factors. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(c), 416.927(c) (2012). An ALJ may not discount a treating physician\u2019s opinion without articulating good cause for doing so. <em>See Winschel v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>631 F.3d 1176, 1179 (11th Cir. 2011). Acceptable reasons for discounting the opinion of a treating physician are that it is conclusory; it is unsupported by medical evidence; it is inconsistent with the record as a whole; or other evidence supports a contrary finding. <em>See Crawford, </em>363 F.3d at 1159 (holding that treating physician\u2019s testimony was properly discounted when it was inconsistent with physician\u2019s own treatment reports and the record as a whole and appeared to be based on patient\u2019s subjective complaints); <em>Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1241 (holding that treating physician\u2019s testimony was properly discounted when it was inconsistent with physician\u2019s treating notes and claimant\u2019s testimony). Here, the ALJ pointed to inconsistencies between Dr, Hassan\u2019s opinion and his treatment notes and inconsistencies between the opinion and the notes of other treating physicians. Accordingly, the ALJ\u2019s decision to discount Dr. Hassan\u2019s opinion was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">Ybarra argues that the ALJ\u2019s RFC was not supported by substantial evidence because there were inconsistencies between the ALJ\u2019s own conclusions at different stages of the sequential evaluation. Ybarra first argues that the RFC did not take into account the ALJ\u2019s step-two finding that Ybarra\u2019s severe right-shoulder pain constitutes a severe impairment. This argument is without merit. A conclusion that an impairment is \u201csevere\u201d for the purposes of step two of the enquiry does not dictate the outcome at step four.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number><em>Moore, </em>405 F.3d at 1213 n.6 (\u201c[T]he mere existence of [severe] impairments does not reveal the extent to which they limit [the] ability to work or undermine the ALJ\u2019s determination_\u201d). Here, the ALJ relied on evidence from Ybarra\u2019s medical reports that Ybarra\u2019s shoulder impairment did not significantly affect his activities of daily living, could be managed with pain medication, and had only a limited effect on his range of movement. The ALJ took the impairment into account by limiting Ybar-ra to medium work. With regard to Ybar-ra\u2019s shoulder impairment, the RFC was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">Ybarra also alleges that the RFC did not take into account the findings of the ALJ (at step three<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>) that Ybarra had \u201cmoderate\u201d limitations in both social functioning and ability to maintain concentration, pace, and persistence. Ybarra further alleges that the ALJ credited, but the RFC did not take into account, the findings of the state\u2019s psychological expert, Dr. Sally Rowley (\u201cDr. Rowley\u201d), that he had \u201cmoderate\u201d limitations in his ability to take criticism from supervisors and to make plans independently. These arguments are meritless. The RFC limited Ybarra to sustaining concentration for two-hour periods on \u201cshort, simple instructions\u201d and to an occupation \u201cwith only occasional contact with co-workers and the general public on routine matters.\u201d There is substantial record evidence to support this determination. Notably, Dr. Rowley reported that Ybarra could \u201cattent [sic] for 2 hour intervals\u201d and \u201cc[ould] do [simple, routine repetitive tasks] with reduced social contact.\u201d The RFC adequately accounted for both the ALJ\u2019s and Dr. Rowley\u2019s findings of mental limitations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">Ybarra\u2019s allegation that hypothetical question posed by the ALJ to the VE was defective also fails. At step five, the burden is on the Commissioner to prove that other jobs that the claimant is able to perform exist in the national economy. <em>Wolfe v. Chater, </em>86 F.3d 1072 (11th Cir. 1996) (citing <em>Francis v. Heckler, </em>749 F.2d 1562, 1566 (11th Cir. 1985)). \u201cIn order for a [VE\u2019s] statement to constitute substantial evidence, the ALJ must pose a hypothetical question which comprises all of the claimant\u2019s impairments.\u201d <em>Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1180 (quoting <em>Wilson, </em>284 F.3d at 1227). Here, Ybarra does not dispute that the hypothetical question took into account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>all the limitations found in the RFC. Consequently, Ybarra\u2019s contention fails because the criticisms that he aims at the hypothetical question are identical to those leveled at the ALJ\u2019s RFC, and, as discussed above, the RFC is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Ybarra also accuses the ALJ of \u201cplaying doctor\u201d in discounting Dr. Has-san\u2019s opinion. The ALJ may not make medical findings herself, <em>see Marbury v. Sullivan, </em>957 F.2d 837, 840 (11th Cir. 1992) (per curiam), but it is her responsibility to resolve conflicting medical opinions. <em>See Watson v. Heckler, </em>738 F.2d 1169, 1172 (11th Cir. 1984) (per curiam). Here, the ALJ did not usurp the role of a physician. Rather, she weighed the credibility of Dr. Hassan\u2019s opinion in light of other record evidence, and she used the reports of Ybarra\u2019s physicians and Dr. Rowley\u2019s opinion in coming to a determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Ybarra also contends that the ALJ erred in failing to develop a full and fair record by not ordering a consultative examination. The ALJ has an obligation to develop a full and fair record. <em>Ellison v. Barnhart, </em>355 F.3d 1272, 1276 (11th Cir. 2003) (per curiam). However^ the ALJ is not obliged to order a consultative examination when the record contains sufficient evidence to support a determination. <em>See Doughty v. Apfel, </em>245 F.3d 1274, 1281 (11th Cir. 2001); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1519a (2012). Here, as discussed above, even after the ALJ discounted Dr. Hassan\u2019s opinion, there was sufficient evidence in the record to support the ALJ\u2019s finding and the ALJ was not required to order a consultative examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Because the ALJ applied the correct legal standard and her findings are supported by substantial evidence, the decision of the district court must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b560-7\">. Plaintiff cites a Social Security Ruling, SSR 96-7p, 1996 WL 374186 at \u215c1 (July 2, 1996), for the proposition that \"[a]n individual\u2019s statements about the intensity and persistence of pain or other symptoms or about the effect the symptoms have on his or her ability to work may not be disregarded <em>solely </em>because they are not substantiated by medical evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>dence,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *1 (emphasis added). But here, as discussed, the ALJ articulated other grounds for not crediting Ybarra\u2019s testimony supported by evidence in the record, as required by SSR96-7p. <em>See id. </em>at *2,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b561-7\">. Plaintiff is correct that the ALJ relied on Ybarra\u2019s deferral of steroid injections without considering whether Ybarra might have deferred the injections because he could not afford them. This was inappropriate. <em>See Henry v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>802 F.3d 1264, 1269 (11th Cir. 2015) (holding that ALJ committed reversible error in failing to consider whether a claimant\u2019s failure to seek treatment was due to his financial circumstances); SSR 96-7p, 1996 WL 374186 at *7-8 (\u201d[T]he adjudicator must not draw any inferences about an individual\u2019s symptoms and their functional effects from a failure to seek or pursue regular medical treatment without first considering any explanations that the individual may provide, or other information in the case record, that may explain infrequent or irregular medical visits or failure to seek medical treatment.... For example: ,.. The individual may be unable to afford treatment_\u201d), While Ybarra did not offer this explanation, it was clear from the record that he was uninsured when he deferred steroid injections. However, the ALJ's determination as to Ybarra's credibility was amply supported by other substantial evidence, unlike in <em>Henry, </em>where it appears that the sole reason for discounting the claimant\u2019s credibility was his failure to seek treatment. <em>See </em>802 F.3d at 1269. Accordingly, we will not disturb the ALJ\u2019s credibility determination because it was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b561-12\">. At step two, the ALJ must determine whether the claimant has severe impairments, <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(H). At step four, the AU is required to determine the claimant\u2019s RFC. See 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iv).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b562-8\">. At step three, the ALJ must determine whether the claimant meets or equals the listed criteria for qualifying as disabled. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(a)(4)(iii); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(d) app. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b562-9\">. This conclusion is entirely consistent with our holding in <em>Winschel. </em>In <em>Winschel, </em>we held that the VE\u2019s answer to the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical question did not constitute substantial evidence at step five when that question omitted the moderate limitations regarding concentration, persistence, and pace that the AU had found. 631 F.3d at 1180. However, here (as discussed) the RFC and hypothetical question accounted for the limitations that the AU had previously found, even if they did not use precisely the same language. <em>Cf. Brothers v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>648 Fed. App\u2019x 938, 939 (11th Cir. 2016) (\u201cThe [ALJ] was not required to refer to supervisors when the residual functional capacity assessment and the hypothetical question included a restriction on [the claimant's] social interaction in the workplace.\u201d). And Dr. Rowley's opinion supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that the RFC and hypothetical question were consistent with Ybar-ra\u2019s limitations. <em>Cf. Jarrett v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>422 Fed.Appx. 869, 872 (11th Cir. 2011) (\u201c[A]n ALJ's hypothetical restricting the claimant to simple and routine tasks adequately accounts for restrictions related to concentration, persistence and pace where the medical evidence demonstrates that the claimant retains the ability to perform the tasks despite concentration deficiencies.\u201d) (citing <em>Winschel, </em>631 F.3d at 1181).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
