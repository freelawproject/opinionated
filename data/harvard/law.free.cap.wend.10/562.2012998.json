S. </em>374, \u00a7 66, it appearing that the sum bid at the sale had been paid to the plaintiff in the execution under which the property was sold. Mr. Justice Sutherland was of opinion that where a deed merely was to be executed, and no money to be collected or other act to be done, that security was not necessary, and he accordingly granted a rule appointing the clerk of Columbia county to execute the deed, without requiring security to be given by him.</summary>\n<opinion><p id=\"b562-3\">ALBANY,</p><p id=\"AThH\">Aug. 1833.</p><p id=\"b562-10\">Where an appointment is made of a person to execute a deed under a sheriff\u2019s sale, in the case of the death of the sheriff and no nnder sheriff, security from such person is not necessary, where nothing remains to be done but to execute the deed.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
