In April 2002, Harris filed a petition in the Court of Appeals for Richland County for a writ of habeas corpus to compel his immediate release from prison. Harris claimed that his conviction and sentence were void because no proper criminal complaint had ever been filed against him before he was indicted. The court of appeals dismissed the petition because a writ of habeas corpus \u201cis not available to challenge the validity or sufficiency of an indictment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">{\u00b6 2} In his appeal as of right, Harris contends that the court of appeals erred in dismissing his petition. We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-13\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cAny defect caused by the alleged failure to file criminal complaints or the claimed impropriety of the municipal court\u2019s assumption of jurisdiction over the rape charges is not cognizable in habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Mitchell </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 453, 454, 727 N.E.2d 905. Harris was convicted and sentenced upon an indictment, and his trial court had the requisite jurisdiction to try, convict, and sentence him on the charged offense. <em>State ex rel.
