State Farm, </em>Nos. 2001-1474 and 2001-1867</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">{\u00b6 1} On November 6, 1994, Christina Hillyer, daughter of plaintiff/appellant, Martin Hillyer, was a passenger in a vehicle when she was fatally injured in an accident. Martin Hillyer filed a claim for uninsured (\u201cUIM\u201d) coverage under a homeowner\u2019s policy issued to him by defendant/appellee, State Farm Fire and Casualty Company. When State Farm denied the claim, Hillyer filed this action for declaratory judgment. Hillyer asserted that the residence-employee exception to the policy exclusions qualified the policy as a motor vehicle liability insurance policy. Therefore, according to Hillyer, State Farm had been obligated under R.C. 3937.18(A) to offer UIM coverage as part of the policy. Because State Farm had not offered the coverage, he asserts, it exists as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">{\u00b6 2} The trial court awarded summary judgment to State Farm, and the Eighth District Court of Appeals affirmed. The appellate court, relying on <em>Davidson v. Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 262, 744 N.E.2d 713, held that the policy at issue provided only incidental automobile liability coverage, which was not enough to invoke the requirement of R.C. 3937.18(A). The court of appeals subsequently determined that its decision was in conflict with <em>Wodrich v. Farmers Ins. of Columbus, Inc. </em>(May 21, 1999), Greene App. No. 98CA103, 1999 WL 317448.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">{\u00b6 3} This cause is now before this court upon our determination that a conflict exists (case No. 2001-1867), and pursuant to the allowance of a discretionary appeal (case No. 2001-1474).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\"><em>Lemm v. The Hartford, </em>No. 2001-1786</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">{\u00b6 4} On March 21, 1997, plaintiffs/appellants, Ernest and Alice M. Lemm, were injured in an automobile accident. The Lemms settled with the tortfeasor\u2019s liability insurance carrier for the policy limits. Thereafter, the Lemms sought UIM coverage through their homeowner\u2019s policy issued by The Hartford. When The Hartford denied the claim, the Lemms filed for declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">{\u00b6 5} The trial court granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs, declaring that UIM coverage existed under the homeowner\u2019s policy as a matter of law. The appellate court upheld the summary judgment award, specifically finding that the homeowner\u2019s policy issued by The Hartford was a motor vehicle liability policy subject to the requirements of former R.C. 3937.18. The appellate court, relying on <em>Selander v. Erie Ins. Group </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 541, 709 N.E.2d 1161, concluded that the policy expressly provided liability coverage arising from the use of automobiles subject to motor vehicle registration and used on public highways.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">{\u00b6 6} The Franklin County Court of Appeals found that its decision was in conflict with <em>Davis v. Shelby Ins. Co. </em>(2001), 144 Ohio App.3d 468, 760 N.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>855. Although the Lemms want the judgment upheld, they first filed here the order certifying a conflict. They are therefore \u201cconsidered the appellant[s]\u201d under S.Ct.Prac.R. IV(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">{\u00b6 7} This cause is now before this court upon our determination that a conflict exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\"><em>Panozzo v. Allstate Insurance Co., </em>No. 2001-1955</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">{\u00b6 8} On January 28, 1988, plaintiff/appellant, James Panozzo, was injured when he was struck by a vehicle driven by an uninsured motorist. He sought uninsured motorist (\u201cUM\u201d) coverage under his homeowner\u2019s policy issued by Allstate. Allstate denied the claim. Panozzo filed this action for declaratory judgment. The trial court held that the policy in question was not a motor vehicle liability policy for purposes of R.C. 3937.18. Therefore, the court held, Allstate had not been required to provide UM coverage, and there was no coverage as a matter of law. The court awarded summary judgment to Allstate. The court of appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">{\u00b6 9} This cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\"><em>Burnett v. AMEX Assurance Co., </em>No. 2001-1977</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">{\u00b6 10} On July 27, 1997, plaintiff/appellant, Dorothy D. Burnett, was struck and injured by an automobile. She collected benefits under the tortfeasor\u2019s liability policy and also UIM benefits under her own motor vehicle policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-11\">{\u00b6 11} Burnett subsequently filed this action for UIM benefits under her tenant\u2019s policy issued by defendant/appellee AMEX Assurance Company, claiming that benefits arose as a matter of law. The trial court awarded summary judgment in favor of the defendant. The court of appeals, relying on its decision in <em>Hillyer v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. </em>(Aug. 2, 2001), Cuyahoga App. No. 79176, 2001 WL 898424, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-12\">{\u00b6 12} This cause is now before this court pursuant to the allowance of a discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b621-14\">{\u00b6 13} In each of these cases, the appellant is seeking UM/UIM coverage under the residence-employee clause of a homeowner\u2019s policy. Appellants contend that the homeowner\u2019s policies expressly provide automobile liability coverage against liability to residence employees injured in the course of employment, making them motor vehicle policies for purposes of former R.C. 3937.18. Because UM/UIM coverage was not offered, the appellants assert that it must be provided as a matter of law. For the reasons that follow, we hold that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>residence-employee clause in an insurance policy that provides coverage incidental to home ownership does not convert the policy into a motor vehicle policy subject to the mandates of former R.C. 3937.18.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">{\u00b6 14} Former R.C. 3937.18 provided that \u201c[n]o automobile liability or motor vehicle liability policy of insurance insuring against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury or death suffered by any person arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state with respect to any motor vehicle registered or principally garaged in this state\u201d unless both uninsured and underinsured motorist coverages are provided.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">{\u00b6 15} Therefore, the issue is whether these insurance policies constitute motor vehicle liability policies for purposes of former R.C. 3937.18. Our analysis begins with the language of the insurance contract. <em>Davidson v. Motorists Mut. Ins. Co., </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 264, 744 N.E.2d 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">{\u00b6 16} Each of the four policies at issue is labeled a homeowner\u2019s policy or an analogous tenant\u2019s policy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We will refer to all of them generally as homeowner\u2019s policies. This title, however, is not determinative, because it is the type of coverage provided, not the label affixed by the insurer, that determines the type of policy. <em>Selander v. Erie Ins., </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 545, 709 N.E.2d 1161. Therefore, we look at the contents of the policies for the type of coverage they provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">{\u00b6 17} Each policy at issue expressly insures against property damage to personal property owned or used by the insured. This coverage, however, expressly excludes motor vehicles that are licensed for use on public highways.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Each policy also insures against personal liability of the insured for accidents or injuries. This coverage, however, expressly excludes liability for bodily injury or property damage arising out of intentional or willful acts, business pursuits, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>\u201cdamage arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use, loading or unloading of * * * a motor vehicle owned or operated by or rented or loaned to any insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">{\u00b6 18} The policy makes an exception from these exclusions for liability to residence employees. The \u201cresidence employee\u201d is defined as \u201can employee of an insured who performs duties, including household or domestic services, in connection with the maintenance or use of the residence premises. This includes employees who perform similar duties elsewhere for you. This does not include employees while performing duties in connection with the business of an insured.\u201d The exception states, \u201cThis exclusion does not apply to bodily injury to a residence employee arising out of and in the course of the residence employee\u2019s employment by an insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">{\u00b6 19} Appellants contend that, like the policy at issue in <em>Selander, </em>the policies at issue here provide express liability coverage against liability to residence employees who are injured by automobiles in the scope and course of their employment. In <em>Selander, </em>the general business policy provided liability coverage in limited form for hired, nonowned vehicles. According to the appellants, the residence-employee clauses subject these policies to former R.C. 3937.18 because \u201c[w]here motor vehicle liability coverage is provided, even in limited form, uninsured/underinsured coverage must be provided.\u201d <em>Selander v. Erie Ins., </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 544, 709 N.E.2d 1161.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">{\u00b6 20} The defendants, however, contend that <em>Davidson v. Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. </em>applies because the motor vehicle liability coverage in these policies, like that in <em>Davidson, </em>is remote and incidental. <em>Davidson </em>held that the mere fact that a policy affords some incidental liability coverage for certain motor vehicles not subject to registration and not for use on public highways does not convert the policy into a motor vehicle liability policy for purposes of UM/UIM coverage. 91 Ohio St.3d at 270, 744 N.E.2d 713. Defendants contend that these policies do not generally provide coverage for motor vehicles. The residence-employee exception merely extends liability coverage for accidents involving an employee who is injured in the course of domestic employment. Thus, the coverage arises because of the employee\u2019s employment by the insured homeowner, not because a motor vehicle is involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">{\u00b6 21} In <em>Davidson, </em>we distinguished <em>Selander </em>by focusing on the type of coverage each policy provided. <em>Selander </em>involved a business liability policy issued to a partnership. The policy generally excluded coverage for automobiles; however, it provided some automobile liability coverage for claims of vicarious liability arising from the use of unspecified hired or nonowned vehicles used in the course of the business. Because the business policy provided some liability coverage in limited circumstances, we held that UM/UIM coverage must be provided. <em>Selander, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 544-545, 709 N.E.2d 1161. The policy in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number><em>Davidson </em>was a homeowner\u2019s policy that excluded liability coverage resulting from the use of motor vehicles generally, but provided some limited motor vehicle liability coverage for a narrow class of motor vehicles excepted from the policy\u2019s general exclusions. Id., 91 Ohio St.3d at 267, 744 N.E.2d 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">{\u00b6 22} The appellants argue that <em>Davidson </em>should be distinguished on the basis that it involved recreational motor vehicles not subject to registration and for use off public roads. They contend that because the residence-employee provision covers standard motor vehicles, it should be compared to <em>Selander. </em>However, the descriptive factors in <em>Davidson </em>\u2014 whether the vehicle was subject to registration and designed for use on a public road \u2014 did not alone support our opinion in <em>Davidson </em>or differentiate it from <em>Selander. </em>We looked to the <em>type </em>of coverage each policy provided. The appellate court in <em>Lemm v. The Hartford </em>(Oct. 4, 2001), Franklin App. No. 01AP-251, 2001 WL 1167585, misinterpreted our use of the word \u201cincidental\u201d in <em>Davidson. </em>The coverage in <em>Davidson </em>was not incidental merely because it involved recreational vehicles. Instead, it was incidental primarily because coverage of those vehicles was remote from and \u2022insignificant to the type of overall coverage the policy provided. Plaintiffs\u2019 narrow perspective misses the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">{\u00b6 23} Like the policy in <em>Davidson, </em>the policies at issue expressly exclude liability coverage for injuries arising from the use of motor vehicles. The residence-employee exception allows liability coverage when an employee is injured in any manner while in the course of employment, whether or not a motor vehicle is involved. If coverage arises under this exception, it is because the residence employee was injured, not because a motor vehicle was involved. The use of a motor vehicle is merely incidental to coverage against liability to the residence employee. Therefore, we hold that <em>Davidson </em>applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">{\u00b6 24} We agree with the analysis of the Cuyahoga County Court of Appeals in <em>Panozzo v. Allstate Ins. Co. </em>(Sept. 13, 2001), Cuyahoga App. No. 79083, 2001 WL 1075772, that \u201cthe defining characteristic of coverage is the person injured [the residence employee], not the fact that a motor vehicle was involved.\u201d \u201c[T]he fact that an automobile may be involved is incidental to coverage * * Id. Therefore, the policies at issue are not subject to the requirement of former R.C. 3937.18(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">{\u00b6 25} This result comports with R.C. 4509.01 et seq., Ohio\u2019s motor vehicle financial-responsibility statute. The policies at issue were not intended to satisfy the statutory requirement of financial responsibility against liability arising from the ownership or operation of vehicles used for transportation on the highway. See <em>Delli Bovi v. Pacific Indemn. Co. </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 343, 345, 708 N.E.2d 693. \u201cCommon sense alone dictates that neither the insurer nor the insured bargained for or contemplated that such homeowner\u2019s insurance would cover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>personal injuries arising out of an automobile accident that occurred on a highway away from the insured\u2019s premises.\u201d <em>Davidson, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 269, 744 N.E.2d 713.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AF-\">Friedman, Domiano &amp; Smith Co., L.P.A., Stephen S.
