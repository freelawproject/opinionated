On March 31, 1999, ODS commenced a formal investigation of Fiorini and various companies that he controlled or with which he was affiliated. After March 31, 1999, ODS obtained approximately 32 written complaints from investors relating to the Fiorini investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-12\">{\u00b6 2} On January 22, 2002, James McNair, a reporter for relator, Cincinnati Enquirer, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, Inc., requested that ODS and its commissioner, respondent Deborah Dye Joyce, provide him with \u201ccopies of complaints submitted to the division by investors in George Fiorini, Fiorini Agency, IGW Trust, The Standard Trust, Guardian Investments and Standard Pacific Power <em>&amp; </em>Energy, and Sanitec.\u201d In the request, the Enquirer asserted that it was requesting the copies \u201c[u]nder provisions of Ohio public records law, Sec. 143.43 [sic, 149.43] of the Ohio Revised Code.\u201d The Enquirer also cited <em>State ex rel. Beacon Journal Publishing Co. v. Maurer </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 54, 741 N.E.2d 511, in support of its request.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-13\">{\u00b6 3} On January 28, 2002, ODS denied the Enquirer\u2019s request for copies of complaints. ODS claimed that the requested records were governed by R.C. 1707.12 and that R.C. 1707.12 prohibited the disclosure of the records.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-14\">{\u00b6 4} On February 21, 2002, the Enquirer filed this action for a writ of mandamus to compel respondents, ODS and Commissioner Joyce, to make the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>requested records available \u201cfor inspection and copying in accordance with R.C. 149.43(B), and for any other relief deemed just and proper by the Court, including but not limited to an award of attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d Respondents filed a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">{\u00b6 5} The parties attempted to settle the matter through mediation, but in April 2002, after the parties were unable to resolve their dispute, the case was returned to the regular docket. We subsequently granted an alternative writ and issued a schedule for the presentation of evidence and briefs. 95 Ohio St.3d 1476, 2002-Ohio-2492, 768 N.E.2d 1183.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">{\u00b6 6} This cause is now before the court for consideration of the parties\u2019 request for oral argument and for consideration of the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Oral Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">{\u00b6 7} We deny the parties\u2019 joint motion for oral argument. The parties\u2019 briefs are sufficient to resolve the issues raised, and this case does not involve a substantial constitutional issue, a conflict between courts of appeals, or complex issues of law or fact. <em>State ex rel. Woods v. Oak Hill Community Med. Ctr., Inc. </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 459, 460, 746 N.E.2d 1108. This case is governed by (1) the uncontroverted evidence that the requested records were obtained through the ODS investigation, (2) the construction of R.C. 1707.12(B) in light of its legislative purpose, and (3) precedent. No oral argument is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">Mandamus</p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">{\u00b6 8} The Enquirer asserts that it is entitled to the requested writ of mandamus under R.C. 149.43, Ohio\u2019s Public Records Act. For the following reasons, the Enquirer\u2019s assertions lack merit, and we deny the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-12\">{\u00b6 9} We have held that \u201c[bjecause the General Assembly enacted R.C. 149.43 subsequent to R.C. 1707.12, and never manifested an intent that the two provisions be coextensive in either the original enactment or any successive amendment, <em>R.C. 1707.12 is the sole provision governing information collected by the Ohio Division of Securities.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>State ex rel. Dublin Securities, Inc. v. Ohio Div. of Securities </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 426, 627 N.E.2d 993, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-13\">{\u00b6 10} The plain language of R.C. 1707.12 prohibits the disclosure of the complaints against Fiorini and his affiliated companies. R.C. 1707.12(B) prohibits the inspection of information obtained by ODS through any investigation by persons other than those specifically excepted therein:</p>\n<p id=\"b401-14\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cInformation obtained by the division <em>through any investigation </em>shall be retained by the division and <em>shall not be available to inspection </em>by persons other than those having a direct economic interest in the information or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>transaction under investigation, or by a law enforcement officer pursuant to the duties of his office.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">{\u00b6 12} The uncontroverted evidence introduced by respondents establishes that the requested complaints were \u201cobtained * * * through the Fiorini investigation.\u201d In addition, no evidence was presented to show that the Enquirer has a \u201cdirect economic interest\u201d in the requested records. Therefore, R.C. 1707.12(B) prohibits disclosure of the requested records.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">{\u00b6 13} In addition, even if we assume, as relator suggests, that the requested complaints include <em>unsolicited </em>complaints, R.C. 1707.12(B) still prohibits their disclosure because all of the complaints were received after the ODS investigation began.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">{\u00b6 14} In construing a statute, our paramount concern is the legislative intent in enacting the statute. <em>State ex rel. Cincinnati Post v. Cincinnati </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 540, 543, 668 N.E.2d 903. We first look at the statutory language, according the words used their usual, normal, or customary meaning. <em>State ex rel. Besser v. Ohio State Univ. </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 535, 539, 721 N.E.2d 1044.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">{\u00b6 15} Here, the word \u201cthrough\u201d as used in the R.C. 1707.12(B) phrase \u201cobtained by the division through any investigation\u201d has several customary meanings, including \u201cduring the entire period of\u2019 and \u201cas a result of.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) 2384. Understandably, respondents ODS and its commissioner favor the former definition, which would include within the statutory exemption unsolicited complaints received following the initiation of an investigation, whereas the Enquirer favors the latter definition, which would not include unsolicited complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">{\u00b6 16} We adopt the interpretation advanced by ODS and its commissioner. As noted previously, our paramount concern in construing R.C. 1707.12(B) is the legislative intent in enacting the statute. The Ohio Securities Act (R.C. Chapter 1707), which is also known as the Ohio Blue Sky Law, was enacted to \u201cprevent the fraudulent exploitation of the investing public through the sale of securities.\u201d <em>In re Columbus Skyline Securities, Inc. </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 495, 498, 660 N.E.2d 427; <em>Fehrman v. Ohio Dept. of Commerce, Div. of Securities </em>(2001), 141 Ohio App.3d 503, 510, 751 N.E.2d 1089. That purpose is best served by keeping complaints concerning possible securities violations confidential once an investigation has been initiated. As cogently observed by respondents, if we were to adopt the Enquirer\u2019s interpretation, complaints would be available to any member of the public, including the target of the ODS investigation. \u201c[I]t was hardly the legislative intent of R.C. 1707.12 to place investigatory files in the hands of a subject under investigation.\u201d <em>Dublin Securities, </em>68 Ohio St.3d at 432, 627 N.E.2d 993. We therefore construe R.C. 1707.12 to avoid this unreasonable result. R.C. 1.47(C).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AJqm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Graydon, Head &amp; Ritchey L.L.P., John C. Greiner and John A. Flanagan, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b403-11\">Betty D. Montgomery, Attorney General, Michael R. Gladman and Lisa Wu Fate, Assistant Attorneys General, for respondents.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">{\u00b6 17} This result is also consistent with precedent. In <em>Dublin Securities, </em>68 Ohio St.3d 426, 627 N.E.2d 993, we held that R.C. 1707.12(B) shielded unsolicited complaints to ODS. Here, the evidence is even clearer than it was in <em>Dublin Securities </em>that the unsolicited complaints that are the subject of the request for copies were not received by ODS until <em>after </em>it had initiated an investigation against Fiorini and his affiliated companies. Even the dissent in <em>Dublin Securities </em>noted that the requested records in that case would have been exempt from disclosure under R.C. 1707.12(B) if \u201can active investigation was under way at the time the Division received the document in question.\u201d Id. at 433, 627 N.E.2d 993 (Pfeifer, J., dissenting). It is uncontroverted that this occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">{\u00b6 18} Finally, the cases cited by the Enquirer are inapposite. Those cases interpret R.C. 149.43 instead of R.C. 1707.12. See <em>State ex rel. Beacon Journal Publishing Co. v. Maurer </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 54, 741 N.E.2d 511; <em>State ex rel. Cincinnati Enquirer v. Hamilton Cty. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 374, 662 N.E.2d 334. And in <em>Maurer, </em>in which we held that police incident reports are public records that do not constitute confidential law enforcement investigatory records, we emphasized that police \u201cincident reports initiate criminal investigations but are not part of the investigation.\u201d <em>Maurer, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 56, 741 N.E.2d 511. By contrast, a telephone call initiated the investigation of Fiorini here and not the requested complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">{\u00b6 19} Based on the foregoing, R.C. 1707.12 governs the Enquirer\u2019s request for records, and R.C. 1707.12(B) prohibits the disclosure of the requested records. We therefore deny the writ of mandamus. By so holding, we need not address respondents\u2019 alternative argument that the requested records also constitute exempt confidential law enforcement investigatory records and trial preparation records under R.C. 1707.12(C). See <em>Dublin Securities, </em>68 Ohio St.3d at 428, 627 N.E.2d 993.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Writ denied.</p>\n<judges id=\"b403-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnigk, F.E.
