The court of appeals affirmed the conviction and death sentence. <em>State v. Bey </em>(Sept. 19, 1997), Lucas App. No. L-94-003, 1997 WL 586693. We also affirmed his conviction and death sentence. <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number><em>Bey </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 487, 709 N.E.2d 484, certiorari denied (1999), 528 U.S. 1049, 120 S.Ct. 587, 145 L.Ed.2d 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>Subsequently, the court of appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision to deny Bryant-Bey\u2019s petition for postconviction relief. <em>State v. Bryant-Bey </em>(June 16, 2000), Lucas App. No. L-97-1425, 2000 WL 770131. We refused to accept Bryant-Bey\u2019s appeal of that decision. <em>State v. Bryant-Bey </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 1440, 736 N.E.2d 902.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">{\u00b6 3} On October 17, 2001, Bryant-Bey filed an application with the court of appeals to reopen his direct appeal pursuant to App.R. 26(B) and <em>State v. Murnahan </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 60, 584 N.E.2d 1204, alleging ineffective assistance of his appellate counsel in the appeal of his murder and robbery convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">{\u00b6 4} Under App.R. 26(B)(5), \u201c[a]n application for reopening shall be granted if there is a genuine issue as to whether the applicant was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel on appeal.\u201d The court of appeals denied Bryant-Bey\u2019s application to reopen his appeal because Bryant-Bey had not shown good cause for filing the application more than 90 days after journalization of the appellate judgment, as is required by App.R. 26(B)(1). The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">{\u00b6 5} The two-pronged analysis found in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, is the appropriate standard by which to assess whether Bryant-Bey has raised a \u201cgenuine issue\u201d as to the ineffectiveness of appellate counsel in his request to reopen under App.R. 26(B)(5). <em>State v. Sheppard </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 329, 330, 744 N.E.2d 770; <em>State v. Spivey </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 24, 25, 701 N.E.2d 696; <em>State v. Reed </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 534, 534-535, 660 N.E.2d 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cTo show ineffective assistance, [defendant] must prove that his counsel were deficient for failing to raise the issues he now presents and that there was a reasonable probability of success had he presented those claims on appeal.\u201d <em>Sheppard, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 330, 744 N.E.2d 770, citing <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph three of the syllabus. Moreover, to justify reopening his appeal, Bryant-Bey \u201cbears the burden of establishing that there was a \u2018genuine issue\u2019 as to whether he has a \u2018colorable claim\u2019 of ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal.\u201d <em>Spivey, </em>84 Ohio St.3d at 25, 701 N.E.2d 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">{\u00b6 7} We have reviewed Bryant-Bey\u2019s assertions of deficient performance by appellate counsel and find that Bryant-Bey has failed to raise \u201ca genuine issue as to whether [he] was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel on appeal\u201d as required by App.R. 26(B)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">{\u00b6 8} In discussing his second proposition of law, Bryant-Bey argues that he had good cause for the late filing of his application for reconsideration under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>App.R. 26(B). Our disposition of Bryant-Bey\u2019s appeal on the merits negates any need to decide that issue. Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"and-dedup-0\">Julia R. Bates, Lucas County Prosecuting Attorney, and Craig T.
