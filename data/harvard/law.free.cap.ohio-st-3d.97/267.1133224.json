Baker, was hurt on the job in 1993. His application for workers\u2019 compensation benefits was initially denied by appellee, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>Industrial Commission of Ohio, which concluded that claimant was not an employee, but rather an independent contractor, and therefore exempt from these benefits. This finding precipitated a six-year administrative and legal battle in which claimant\u2019s employment status and the specification of medical conditions related to his accident were hotly debated. Litigation ended on November 2, 1999, when appellee\u2019s staff hearing officer denied the employer\u2019s appeal of the district hearing officer\u2019s allowance of a workers\u2019 compensation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">{\u00b6 2} On January 18, 2000, claimant moved for permanent total disability compensation (\u201cPTD\u201d). He submitted the July 28, 1999 report of Dr. Stephen Altic, who stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cIt is also my opinion that this patient was totally disabled between the date of injury September 26, 1993 through September 26, 1994. Based upon my examination, medical records provided, and the patient\u2019s history it is also my opinion that Mr. Baker is permanently and totally impaired from performing any gainful remunerative employment since September 26, 1994 directly as a result of these injuries as described.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">{\u00b6 4} The commission granted claimant\u2019s application and commenced PTD as of July 28, 1999, the date of Dr. Altic\u2019s report. Seeking an earlier start date, claimant sought a writ of mandamus from the Court of Appeals for Franklin County. Finding some evidence to support the commission\u2019s decision, the court denied the writ. This cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">{\u00b6 5} It is uncontroverted that some evidence supports the July 28, 1999 PTD start date chosen by the commission \u2014 Dr. Altic\u2019s report of the same date. The claimant nevertheless advocates a start date of September 27, 1994, based on Altic\u2019s statement \u2014 in the July 28, 1999 report \u2014 that claimant had been permanently and totally disabled since September 26, 1994. We reject claimant\u2019s position for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">{\u00b6 6} First, the commission alone determines the weight and credibility of the evidence before it. <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 20-21, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936. Here, the commission rejected Dr. Altic\u2019s proffered 1994 date because there was no evidence that Dr. Altic had seen or treated claimant in 1994. To the contrary, claimant\u2019s own PTD application states that Dr. Altic first saw claimant in December 1999. Moreover, Altic\u2019s selection of a September 27, 1994 start date coincides more with the termination date of temporary total disability compensation than it does with anything of a medical nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">{\u00b6 7} Second, claimant\u2019s proposed date conflicts with R.C. 4123.52\u2019s statute of limitations, which forbids compensation for disability existing more than two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>years prior to application therefor. Claimant filed for PTD on January 18, 2000. Consequently, compensation before January 18,1998, is unauthorized.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ase-dedup-0\">Reinhard, Zamora &amp; Bates Co., L.P.A., and Charles Zamora, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b477-10\">Betty D. Montgomery, Attorney General, and Daniel M. Hall, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">{\u00b6 8} Claimant contends that the six years that it took to get the claim allowed and the conditions therein finalized justify the abandonment of the evidentiary and statutory impediments to his proposal. This assertion lacks merit. First, there is no authority for the proposition that application of the statutory conditions for PTD is subject to some sort of time line. Second, any attempt to equate this case to those in which application of a pertinent rule or regulation was excused because of administrative delay fails. Unlike the delay in <em>State ex rel. Johnston v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp. </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 463, 751 N.E.2d 974, for example, this delay is not attributable to the commission\u2019s lack of diligence in processing an application. The six years between application and allowance were attributable to protracted litigation. There is, therefore, no justification for abandoning the controlling law in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">{\u00b6 9} The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b477-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
