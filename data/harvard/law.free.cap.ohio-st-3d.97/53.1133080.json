Reynolds, was hurt while working for Thrift Stores of Ohio, Inc. Claimant quit his job on March 25, 1999, and appellant Industrial Commission of Ohio denied further temporary total disability compensation (\u201cTTC\u201d), finding that claimant had voluntarily left his former position of employment, following <em>State ex rel. Baker v. Indus. Comm. </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 561, 722 N.E.2d 67 <em>(\u201cBaker I\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>{\u00b6 2} Within days of the commission\u2019s decision, <em>State ex rel. Baker v. Indus. Comm. </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 376, 732 N.E.2d 355 <em>(\u201cBaker II\u201d), </em>was decided. That case, on reconsideration, vacated the prior decision, which had prohibited TTC for anyone who voluntarily left the former position of employment. <em>Baker II </em>instead stated that a claimant who leaves a former position of employment for another job becomes eligible again for TTC if the industrial injury removes the claimant from the later job.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">{\u00b6 3} Citing <em>Baker II, </em>claimant immediately \u2014 and unsuccessfully \u2014 moved for reconsideration. The Court of Appeals for Franklin County, on claimant\u2019s petition in mandamus, ordered the commission to reconsider the claim. It did not, however, order further proceedings pursuant to <em>Baker II. </em>It instead directed the commission to reconsider the issue of voluntariness \u2014 a finding claimant had not contested before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">{\u00b6 4} This cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">{\u00b6 5} Before <em>Baker II, </em>all claimants who voluntarily left their former jobs forever forfeited eligibility for TTC. Today, permanent forfeiture is limited to those whose decision to leave the former position of employment ultimately translates into a voluntary departure from the entire work force. <em>State ex rel. Wagers v. Indus. Comm. </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 218, 754 N.E.2d 777. For those who leave for different employment, renewed eligibility hinges on a single element: Was the claimant removed from later employment by the industrial injury?</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">{\u00b6 6} Because <em>Baker II </em>was issued just days after the commission\u2019s present order denying TTC, claimant\u2019s request for reconsideration was neither unexpected nor inappropriate. Two things, however, were: (1) the commission\u2019s denial of reconsideration and (2) the court of appeals\u2019 reason ordering the commission to vacate that denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">{\u00b6 7} The commission asserts that reconsideration was inappropriate because claimant never alleged subsequent employment at the administrative hearing. This begs the question of why he would. Before <em>Baker II, </em>subsequent employment was irrelevant. Once voluntary departure was ascertained, inquiry ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">{\u00b6 8} The court of appeals did not discount the commission\u2019s reasoning and did not feel that an order to consider the question of subsequent employment was necessary. It did, however, order further consideration of the voluntary character of claimant\u2019s departure. This was neither necessary nor appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">{\u00b6 9} Administratively, the claimant did raise the issue of voluntariness. The commission, in turn, concluded that departure was indeed voluntary. Claimant sought reconsideration of the denial of TTC that accompanied that finding, and his motion is the best evidence that the assessment of voluntariness was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>being further contested. That motion listed <em>Baker II </em>as the <em>sole </em>basis for requesting reconsideration. Moreover, claimant\u2019s repeated assertion of <em>Baker II </em>as controlling was valid only if separation from employment was voluntary. A finding otherwise rendered <em>Baker II </em>inapplicable.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AIH\">Gibson &amp; Robbins-Penniman and J.

Hartranft, Assistant Attorney General, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">{\u00b6 10} We therefore agree with the court of appeals that reconsideration by the commission is necessary, but for the aforementioned reasons. In light of <em>Baker II, </em>exploration is necessary as to whether claimant\u2019s injury removed him from later employment. The matter of voluntariness is deemed final. We therefore vacate the judgment of the court of appeals and grant a writ ordering the commission to consider claimant\u2019s eligibility in light of <em>Baker II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Writ granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b263-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, F.E.
