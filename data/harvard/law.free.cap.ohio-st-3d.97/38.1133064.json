(\u201cOA\u201d), makes high-precision products for the military, automotive, and aerospace industries. After the pieces are cast, they undergo rigorous testing and inspection. Machining and milling are sometimes required.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">{\u00b6 2} In 1982, appellee, Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation, inspected OA\u2019s plant to determine the appropriate manual classifications for OA\u2019s risk for purposes of fixing OA\u2019s premium rate. The report discussed various foundry activities and noted that the plant had a machine shop that was physically separated from the castings manufacturing plant. Employees who worked in the machine shop had a payroll that was segregated from the others for premium purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">{\u00b6 3} The report made two relevant assignments. Manual classification number 3085 was assigned to employees doing actual casting and foundry w\u00f3rk. Classification number 3632 \u2014 with a lower basic premium rate \u2014 was assigned to those working in the machine shop.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">{\u00b6 4} In October 1996, the bureau did a premium audit on OA. The audit revealed:</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cRisk [OA] has not had a machine shop at its foundry for the last three years since all its machine shop work is done at its sister company. Risk\u2019s controller admits that it does not have any cost accounting processing under a machine shop account or any direct labor assigned to a machine shop account classification. Both the safety manager (Rocco Paladino) and the controller (Mike Fornick) admit that the machine shop has been closed down at this location for three years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">{\u00b6 6} Manual classification number 3632 was therefore discontinued from OA\u2019s premium calculation, resulting in a higher rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-12\">{\u00b6 7} OA contested these findings, arguing that its business had not changed since the 1982 audit/inspection that had added number 3632 to OA\u2019s risk. On December 9,1997, the matter was heard by the bureau\u2019s adjudicating committee. It concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"b247-13\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c[E]mployer\u2019s primary line of business is that of an aluminum foundry and * * * the molding, finishing, and core room operations are incidental thereto, and therefore the employer should be classified under Manual No. 3085 * *</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>{\u00b6 9} OA appealed and was heard by the bureau administrator on February 5, 1998. The adjudicating committee\u2019s findings and order were affirmed. On February 19, 1998, another plant inspection occurred. The inspector remarked:</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cNCCI [National Council on Compensation Insurance, Inc.] states that the inspection process is incidental to the foundry. Although this employer\u2019s inspection process is more extensive than the manufacturing process, NCCI does not appear to make allowances for these operations to be separately classified. <em>There was no apparent need for the machine shop classification.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">{\u00b6 11} On April 6, 1998, the administrator mailed his order affirming the adjudicating committee order. OA took no further action.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">{\u00b6 12} On November 16, 1998, the bureau sent a letter to OA confirming that number 3632 had been \u201cdeactivated\u201d on OA\u2019s State Fund policy effective January 1, 1998. The next day, the bureau sent OA another letter, stating that 3632 was deactivated from July 1, 1994 through July 1, 1997. It also said, however, that 3632 was reinstated as of November 17, 1998. There was no explanation of the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">{\u00b6 13} OA filed a complaint in mandamus in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County. Around the same time, OA received further bureau correspondence informing it that 3632 had been reactivated effective January 1, 1999. Again, no explanation accompanied this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">{\u00b6 14} On February 29, 2000, the bureau moved the court of appeals for leave to supplement the record with a February 14, 2000 bureau letter to OA explaining that the November 17 letter had contained an error, i.e., that 3632 had never been \u201creinstated.\u201d The letter attributed the mistake in part to a computer glitch and in part to OA\u2019s continued use of number 3632 in its payroll reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">{\u00b6 15} The court of appeals granted the motion, prompting OA\u2019s motion to supplement the record with two affidavits from OA employees denying that the machine shop had ever been moved. OA\u2019s request was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">{\u00b6 16} This cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">{\u00b6 17} Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution authorizes the board to \u201cclassify all occupations, according to their degree of hazard * * Implemented by what is now R.C. 4123.29(A)(1), the result is the Ohio Workers\u2019 Compensation State Fund Insurance Manual. The manual is based on the manual developed by NCCI and has hundreds of separate occupational classifications. See Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-04, Appendix A. It also specifies the basic rate that an employer must pay, per $100 in payroll, to secure workers\u2019 compensation for its employees. See Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-02(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>{\u00b6 18} Currently at issue are classification numbers 3085 and 3632. The former is very specific, governing nonferrous metal foundries. The latter is basically a catchall provision for machine shops. It is entitled \u201cMachine Shop NOC [Not Otherwise Classified],\u201d which means that it applies \u201conly if no other classification more specifically describes the insured\u2019s business.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-08(C)(2)(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">{\u00b6 19} In 1982, the bureau designated OA\u2019s postcasting machining, i.e., grinding, filing, heat-treating, etc., as 3632 activities. In 1996, a bureau audit found insufficient on-site postcasting activities to continue assigning 3632 as a separate classification. This conclusion was based on three things: (1) the absence of a separate and distinct machine shop (as contrasted with 1982), (2) statements from two plant officials that the machine shop had relocated, and (3) OA\u2019s lack of any cost-accounting processes or direct labor assigned to a machine-shop account. It is around these points that our controversy revolves.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">{\u00b6 20} OA has an uphill battle from the outset. That is because \u201c[t]he bureau is afforded a \u2018wide range of discretion\u2019 in dealing with the \u2018difficult problem\u2019 of occupational classification.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Roberds, Inc. v. Conrad </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 221, 222, 714 N.E.2d 390, quoting <em>State ex rel. McHugh v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1942), 140 Ohio St. 143, 149, 23 O.O. 361, 42 N.E.2d 774. Thus, we have \u201cgenerally deferred to the [bureau\u2019s] expertise in premium matters\u201d and will find an abuse of discretion \u201conly where classification has been arbitrary, capricious or discriminatory.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Progressive Sweeping Contrs., Inc. v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp. </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 393, 396, 627 N.E.2d 550. We find that the present declassification was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">{\u00b6 21} All activities relevant to this inquiry occur after the aluminum has been cast. The 1998 plant inspection indicated that extensive postcasting inspection and testing were done on the high-precision pieces OA produces. It also stated that \u201csome orders require machining and milling.\u201d OA argues that these activities fall under 3632 both definitionally and because they mirror those so classified in 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">{\u00b6 22} In describing some of the activities that can fall under 3632, the manual states:</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">{\u00b623} \u201cMetal castings, forgings, bars, rods, flats, tubing, angles, pipe and pipe fittings, chains, sockets, gears, shafting, pulleys, hardware, sheet metal and some lumber and paint may be used. A variety of processes may be involved such as boring, turning, planing, shaping, milling, drilling, punching, grinding, tapping, threading, shearing, bending, forming, riveting, welding, painting, inspecting and testing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">{\u00b6 24} Undoubtedly, inspecting, testing, and various machining processes are included within the scope of classification number 3632. OA, however, misses two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>key points. First, the provision uses the term \u201cmay\u201d not \u201cmust,\u201d negating any claim of mandatory inclusion. Second, the manual\u2019s scope provision for 3632 opens as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cCode 3632 applies to the manufacture or repair of machines as well as general job machining. It must be emphasized that Code 3632 is an NOC classification and is applied to operations only when such operations are not specifically contemplated by another manual classification(s).\u201d NCCI Scopes of Basic Manual Classifications (Jan. 2001) 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">{\u00b6 26} That point is again stressed near the close of the description of 3632\u2019s scope:</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cCertain Code 3632 operations are designated as \u2018not otherwise classified\u2019 (NOC). These NOC operations shall apply to an insured only when no other classification more specifically describes the insured\u2019s operations.\u201d Id. at 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">{\u00b6 28} Contrary to OA\u2019s representation, the postcasting activities at issue may well be contemplated by number 3085, eliminating 3632 applicability. As explained in the NCCI Scopes Manual, Code 3085 \u201cis applied to foundries engaged in the manufacture of castings from brass, aluminum or other nonferrous metals * * *. The classification includes wood or metal pattern making, core and mold making, melting of the non-ferrous metals in furnaces and the pouring of the molten metal into molds. After the castings are cooled they generally receive <em>some machining </em>to remove burrs or imperfections. The finished castings are then <em>inspected, </em>packed and shipped.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">{\u00b6 29} Given this language, we do not find that the bureau abused its discretion in classifying postcasting functions under the general number 3085. Because it is not unreasonable, we defer to the bureau\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">{\u00b6 30} OA also challenges the presence of \u201csome evidence\u201d to support the bureau\u2019s findings. We reject this challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">{\u00b6 31} The 1982 classification of OA\u2019s machine shop under 3632 was premised on three things: (1) a physically separate machine shop, (2) payroll segregation of the machine shop from the foundry, and (3) the apparent volume of work occurring in the shop. The 1996 declassification was based on changes to one and three. That audit report found that most of the postcasting machining was being done elsewhere \u2014 so much so that what remained was deemed incidental and included in the main foundry activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-12\">{\u00b6 32} The 1996 report was based on, among other things, statements from two plant officials, Mike Fornick and Rocco Paladino, indicating that the machine shop had closed three years earlier. Most of the criticism leveled at this report and these statements is that they did not conform to the Rules of Evidence. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>fails because the Rules of Evidence do not apply to this bureau proceeding. R.C. 4123.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">{\u00b6 33} Equally important, the probity of these two statements is enhanced by two things: (1) the 1997 hearing challenging the 3632 deletion, at which Fornick was present, and (2) the bureau\u2019s 1998 in-plant inspection. Both events presented opportunities for OA to establish its continued entitlement to the 3632 classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">{\u00b6 34} These two missed opportunities also undermine OA\u2019s assertion that it was prejudiced by the court of appeals\u2019 refusal to allow OA to supplement the record with affidavits from Fornick and Paladino. These affidavits deny that the bulk of postcasting machining had been moved. Fornick, however, had already had the chance at the 1997 hearing to rebut the earlier statement that had been attributed to him, and he apparently either did not try or was not successful. So, too, is the case with the 1998 inspection. That evaluation obviously confirmed what Fornick allegedly said in 1996. To exclude an affidavit that attempted to contradict what an auditor had already visually confirmed was not improper. Accordingly, the court of appeals\u2019 denial of OA\u2019s motion to supplement was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">{\u00b6 35} OA is also highly critical of the court of appeals\u2019 consideration of the February 14, 2000 letter that describes the November 17, 1998 and September 16, 1999 letters as mistakes, asserting procedural and evidentiary irregularities. This argument seems irrelevant given the lack of reliance placed upon the letter by the court of appeals. Equally important, the letter simply expressed what the facts already suggested \u2014 that the November 1998 and September 1999 letters reinstating number 3632 were erroneously generated.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">{\u00b6 36} OA overlooks the circumstances surrounding these documents. When the bureau conclusively removed classification 3632 from OA\u2019s risk assessment in the spring of 1998, OA did nothing to contest that determination. Then, out of the blue, came a November letter \u2014 the first of two \u2014 reinstating 3632 without explanation. Considering the vigorous contention over the issue, this letter should have raised a red flag with OA. OA instead decided to gamble on this fortunate turn of events rather than inquire as to what generated this surprising reversal. Thus, contrary to OA\u2019s representation, the 2000 letter presented little that could be realistically considered new. As the magistrate wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cThe letter of November 16, 1998, is consistent with the investigation and audit reports of 1996 and 1998, respectively. The unexplainable letter which is not based on any evidence in the record was generated by the BWC on November 17, 1998. That letter reactivated manual classification M3632 without giving any explanation whatsoever. In fact, that letter could not have provided any explanation for reactivating manual classification M3632 because there simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>is no evidence in the record to substantiate any rationale for the BWC to reactivate manual classification M3632. With or without the additional evidence submitted by the BWC explaining that the letter of November 17, 1998 was generated in error, there is no other conclusion to which anyone could come to [sic] but that the November 17,1998 letter was generated in error.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b252-10\">Buckley, King &amp; Bluso, Robert F. Deacon and M. Scott Young, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AuP\">Betty D. Montgomery, Attorney General, and Gerald H. Waterman, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">{\u00b6 38} OA\u2019s final procedural objection is directed at the court of appeals\u2019 decision to allow the bureau to amend its answer once the bureau realized that the two mistakenly sent letters might imply an admission that OA had a machine shop over the contested period.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">{\u00b6 39} Civ.R. 15(A) directs that leave to amend \u201cshall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d The bureau accurately observes that \u201c[t]he true facts of this case do not reveal any prejudice whatsoever to [OA], other than its not being able to place reliance upon a faulty sentence in a letter generated by computer glitch.\u201d Accordingly, leave to amend was not granted in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">{\u00b6 40} The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b252-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
