She received temporary total disability compensation (\u201cTTC\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">{\u00b6 2} In February 1999, a peripheral nerve stimulator was permanently implanted in claimant\u2019s left leg. Relief, however, was intermittent, prompting her attending physician, Dr. Michael Stanton-Hicks, to recommend surgical revision of the leads on her stimulator.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">{\u00b6 3} In the meantime, claimant\u2019s employer, appellant, Value City Department Stores, moved appellee Industrial Commission of Ohio to terminate claimant\u2019s TTC based on the February 21, 2000 report of Dr. Paul C. Martin, which stated his opinion that claimant had reached maximum medical improvement (\u201cMMI\u201d). On June 12, 2000, a commission district hearing officer (\u201cDHO\u201d) denied further TTC based on Dr. Martin\u2019s report. That order was administratively affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">{\u00b6 4} On August 17, 2000, in response to Dr. Stanton-Hicks\u2019s proposal to revise the leads in claimant\u2019s peripheral nerve stimulator, Dr. Martin wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cIt would be my medical opinion that if the leads have been altered or changed due to the scarring and resulting difficulty in placing these leads, it would be appropriate [that] the leads be revised in order to provide the maximum benefit from this particular procedure. It is my opinion [that] this is a reasonable request and should be allowed under this claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">{\u00b6 6} Surgery was accordingly authorized and claimant then moved to reinstate her TTC, submitting Dr. Martin\u2019s letter in support. This prompted an October 17, 2000 letter from Dr. Martin, which explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b396-12\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cAs noted in my previous report and associated addendum, it was my medical opinion [that] the requested treatment consisting of an additional procedure to revise the placement of leads for the peripheral nerve stimulator was appropriate in this particular case.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-13\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cIt should be noted [that] this is simply a readjustment of the leads in order for the peripheral nerve stimulator to maintain a maximum degree of effectiveness. This particular procedure will not result in any further functional or physiologic improvement in Ms. Lunsford\u2019s overall condition, but will be important in order for her to maintain a maximum degree of improvement. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>readjustment of the leads do [sic] not have an effect on her condition with respect to the issue of maximum medical improvement as it is simply a procedure to maintain such a state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">{\u00b6 9} Two days later but still before the surgery, a DHO denied renewed TTC, finding that \u201c[n]othing has occurred as of the date of this hearing * * * to make Claimant currently temporarily and totally disabled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">{\u00b6 10} Claimant appealed, supported by an October 27, 2000 report from Dr. Stanton-Hicks, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cThe patient * * * is currently awaiting revision of her peripheral nerve stimulator. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c * * * Ms. Lunsford is unable to ambulate any great distance because of symptoms in the left lower extremity and, as stated above, is awaiting scheduled surgery on 11/28/00.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cFollowing surgical revision, it is expected that after a short convalescence of four weeks, the patient can commence physical therapy with a view to regaining function in the extremity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">{\u00b6 14} On November 28, 2000, claimant had the surgery. On December 15 of that year, the staff hearing officer vacated the DHO\u2019s order and ordered TTC:</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c[The order is] based upon Dr. Stanton-Hicks\u2019 C-9 report dated 6/6/2000. Dr. Stanton-Hicks indicates claimant is temporarily totally disabled and he requested surgery. The surgery was authorized on 8/25/2000, per MCO report dated 8/25/2000. Claimant underwent the surgery on 11/28/2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cDr. Martin\u2019s 10/17/2000 report is noted, but not found persuasive. Dr. Martin opines the claimant\u2019s condition has reached maximum medical improvement, despite the surgical procedure. The Staff Hearing Officer relies upon Dr. Stanton-Hicks\u2019 report dated 10/27/2000 and Dr. Martin\u2019s 8/17/2000 report regarding the surgical procedure and finds claimant\u2019s condition has not reached maximum medical improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-13\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cThus, the Staff Hearing Officer finds, based upon Dr. Stanton-Hicks\u2019 reports, [that] claimant has demonstrated she became temporarily totally disabled on 6/12/2000. Temporary total compensation is ordered reinstated effective 6/12/2000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-14\">{\u00b6 18} Value City\u2019s appeal was denied. Value City then sought a writ of mandamus from the Court of Appeals for Franklin County to compel the commission to vacate its findings and deny TTC. Value City asserted that there was no evidence to support the commission\u2019s decision. The court disagreed and denied the writ, prompting Value City\u2019s appeal to this court as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-15\">{\u00b6 19} A previous finding of MMI does not foreclose later TTC if there is a worsening of the allowed conditions from which they may again improve. <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number><em>ex rel. Bing v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 424, 575 N.E.2d 177; <em>State ex rel. Conrad v. Indus. Comm. </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 413, 727 N.E.2d 872. The commission made this finding in the case before us, prompting debate over whether there was evidence to support it. Upon review, we indeed find some evidence to support the commission\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">{\u00b6 20} The commission is solely responsible for weighing and interpreting evidence. <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936. When evidence is susceptible of differing interpretations as to MMI, the commission does not abuse its discretion in selecting one interpretation over the other. <em>State ex rel. Copeland Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 238, 559 N.E.2d 1310. In this case, pain and increasing difficulty in ambulation precipitated a request to have the leads replaced on claimant\u2019s peripheral nerve stimulator. In this regard, Dr. Martin stated on August 17, 2000, that \u201cit would be appropriate [that] the leads be revised in order to provide the maximum benefit from this particular procedure.\u201d The commission interpreted this as evidence that claimant\u2019s condition had not attained MMI. We find this interpretation to be within the commission\u2019s prerogative.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">{\u00b621} We reach the same conclusion with regard to Dr. Stanton-Hicks\u2019s October 27, 2000 report. There, he stated, \u201cFollowing surgical revision, it is expected that after a short convalescence of four weeks, the patient can commence physical therapy with a view to <em>regaining </em>function in the extremity.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Again, we find no abuse of discretion in the commission\u2019s finding that this statement was evidence that claimant\u2019s condition could again improve.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">{\u00b622} Value City decries reliance on any of Dr. Stanton-Hicks\u2019s reports, arguing that under <em>State ex rel. Zamora v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 17, 543 N.E.2d 87, the rejection of Dr. Stanton-Hicks\u2019s April 26, 2000 report at the June 2000 DHO hearing precludes further reliance on any of his reports. This is an improper reading of <em>Zamora. Zamora </em>precludes reliance on a report once that report has been rejected. It does not preclude reliance on reports by an author simply because one of the author\u2019s reports has been rejected, as was the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">{\u00b6 23} We accordingly find that the commission\u2019s order was supported by some evidence. The judgment of the court of appeals is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b398-10\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
