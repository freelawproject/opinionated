Ross of Avon, Ohio, Attorney Registration No. 0061243, be publicly reprimanded for having violated Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G) (failing to cooperate in an investigation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>professional misconduct). Upon review of the record, we adopt the board\u2019s findings and recommendation.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AB_\">Fauver, Keyse-Walker <em>&amp; </em>Donovan and John L. Keyse-Walker, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Atu\">William T. Doyle, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">{\u00b6 2} Relator, Lorain County Bar Association, charged respondent with failure to cooperate in a disciplinary investigation by a complaint filed with the board on January 29, 2001. A panel of the board heard the cause, found the violation of Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G), and recommended a public reprimand. The panel determined that while the issue of respondent\u2019s conduct in his representation of a client was no longer before it, respondent\u2019s conceded failure to respond promptly or at all to information requests constituted a dereliction of his professional obligations. In making its recommendation, the panel considered respondent\u2019s lack of a prior disciplinary record, numerous character references, service to the community,\" and remorse.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">{\u00b6 3} The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings and recommendation. We agree with the board that a public reprimand is appropriate. Respondent is therefore publicly reprimanded for having violated Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G). Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b433-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
