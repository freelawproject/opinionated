In 1968, he was granted permanent total disability compensation (\u201cPTD\u201d), which continued until his death from related causes in 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">{\u00b6 2} After receiving death benefits, appellant widow-claimant, Ruth J. Miller, sought a scheduled loss award under R.C. 4123.57(B) for her decedent\u2019s total loss of use of his legs. That motion was brought pursuant to R.C. 4123.60, which permits payment of an award to dependents that \u201cdecedent would have been lawfully entitled to have applied for * * * at the time of his death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">{\u00b6 3} Appellee Industrial Commission of Ohio denied the award, reasoning that the decedent had no lawful entitlement to R.C. 4123.57(B) compensation at the time of his death, since dual payment of PTD and scheduled loss benefits was prohibited to claimants injured before November 16,1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">{\u00b6 4} The Court of Appeals for Franklin County denied claimant\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus ordering the compensation, prompting her appeal to this court as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">{\u00b6 5} R.C. 4123.58(C) specifically permits payment of both PTD and scheduled loss compensation under R.C. 4123.57(B) (formerly 4123.57[C]) for the same injury. Before 1973, however, both statutes said nothing on the topic of concurrent payment. Am.Sub.H.B. No. 417, 135 Ohio Laws, Part I, 1699-1706.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">{\u00b6 6} Pre-1973 claimants have been governed by <em>State ex rel. Benton v. Columbus &amp; S. Ohio Elec. Co. </em>(1968), 14 Ohio St.2d 130, 43 O.O.2d 238, 237 N.E.2d 134, which held that the two benefits could not be paid in the same claim. Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus. Having been denied scheduled loss compensation as a result of her decedent\u2019s PTD awards, claimant insists that <em>Benton </em>has been significantly modified \u2014 if not completely overruled \u2014 by <em>State ex rel. Martin v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1978), 55 Ohio St.2d 18, 9 O.O.3d 10, 377 N.E.2d 1000, and <em>State ex rel. Doughty v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 736, 576 N.E.2d 801. That is the issue now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">{\u00b6 7} Two types of compensation in three guises are integral to our analysis. First, R.C. 4123.57(B) (formerly [C]) provides a compensation schedule for the loss of enumerated body members, designating the number of weeks of compensation according to which body part is lost. Originally interpreted as confined to loss by amputation \u2014 with the obvious exception of hearing and sight \u2014 scheduled loss benefits now cover loss of use as well. <em>State ex rel. Walker v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 402, 12 O.O.3d 347, 390 N.E.2d 1190, overruling <em>State ex rel. Bohan v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1946), 146 Ohio St. 618, 33 O.O. 92, 67 N.E.2d 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-12\">{\u00b6 8} The second type of compensation is PTD, contained in two forms in R.C. 4123.58. There is vocational PTD, where the allowed conditions either alone or with nonmedical disability factors render the claimant unable to do sustained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>remunerative work. <em>State ex rel. Stephenson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 167, 31 OBR 369, 509 N.E.2d 946. There is also statutory PTD, in which a claimant is deemed permanently and totally disabled \u2014 irrespective of the claimant\u2019s actual ability to work \u2014 due to the loss of two enumerated body parts. R.C. 4123.58(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">{\u00b6 9} These types of compensation variously influence <em>Benton, Martin, </em>and <em>Doughty. Benton, </em>which underlies the denial of compensation in the claim at issue, involved an employee who was statutorily deemed permanently and totally disabled after both hands were amputated. He was then denied scheduled loss benefits administratively and at the court of appeals. We affirmed on two bases, both of which we reexamine at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">{\u00b6 10} First, the court in <em>Benton </em>stated that claimants \u201ccannot receive concurrent compensation for twice the amount of compensation permitted under Section 4123.57(C), Revised Code, in addition to the benefits provided by Section 4123.58, Revised Code.\u201d 14 Ohio St.2d at 133, 43 O.O.2d 238, 237 N.E.2d 134. Two difficulties emerge from this reasoning. First, if this statement meant that a claimant cannot receive compensation for both hands under R.C. 4123.57(C), that is clearly untrue. Second, regardless of whether R.C. 4123.57(C) permitted an award for one or two hands, there is no reason why receipt of PTD would be inconsistent with that scheduled loss award.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">{\u00b6 11} <em>Benton </em>also held that the claimant was foreclosed from R.C. 4123.57(C) benefits because he had never been partially disabled, and therefore he \u201cnever came within the purview of\u2019 R.C. 4123.57. Id. at 133, 43 O.O.2d 238, 237 N.E.2d 134. Instead, he had been totally disabled from the moment of injury. This reasoning might work if R.C. 4123.57(C) and <em>statutory </em>PTD are viewed as having the same compensatory purpose. Both presume disability without requiring proof of it, with the distinction lying only in the perceived extent of disability \u2014 PTD is for total disability, while R.C. 4123.57(C) is not. From this perspective, one could argue that receipt of both types of compensation constitutes double recovery for a single injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">{\u00b6 12} We have, however, always viewed PTD and partial disability compensation \u2014 including R.C. 4123.57(C) \u2014 as having different goals. Total disability benefits, whether temporary or permanent, compensate for the loss of earnings or earning capacity. <em>State ex rel. Gen. Motors Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 278, 282, 71 O.O.2d 255, 328 N.E.2d 387; <em>State ex rel. Ashcraft v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1987), 34 Ohio St.3d 42, 44, 517 N.E.2d 533. In contrast, partial disability benefits have been compared to damages and are awarded irrespective of work capacity. <em>Gen. Motors Corp., </em>42 Ohio St.2d at 282, 71 O.O.2d 255, 328 N.E.2d 387. Using this rationale, the sequence of disability \u2014 i.e., whether R.C. 4123.57(C) benefits are requested before or after PTD \u2014 is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>{\u00b6 13} While <em>Benton\u2019s </em>logic may be unclear, the majority\u2019s regret at the conclusion it felt compelled to reach is not:</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cThis obviously unjust result, whereby a claimant\u2019s award is measured by the fortuity of the events contributing to his disability, is compelled by the unperceptiveness of the controlling legislation.\u201d 14 Ohio St.2d at 133, 43 O.O.2d 238, 237 N.E.2d 134.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">{\u00b6 15} Perhaps in this spirit, the court next addressed the problem in <em>Martin, </em>ten years later. A pre-1973 claimant like Benton, Martin received R.C. 4123.57(C) benefits for an above-the-knee amputation. He later received vocational PTD, from which his earlier R.C. 4123.57(C) compensation was deducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">{\u00b6 16} Claimant objected to the deduction, and this time both types of compensation were allowed. <em>Martin\u2019s </em>reasoning, unfortunately, however, was just as flawed as <em>Benton\u2019s. Martin </em>emphasized that claimant\u2019s amputation was clearly compensable under the schedule of R.C. 4123.57(C), attempting to distinguish it from <em>Benton </em>on that basis. That distinction, however, fails because, despite <em>Martin\u2019s </em>language to the contrary, Benton\u2019s loss was fully compensable under that statute as well. <em>Martin </em>also states that \u201c[n]owhere in the body of the <em>Benton </em>opinion is it specifically held that an employee cannot receive concurrent compensation for an injury under R.C. 4123.57(C) and 4123.58 where he otherwise qualifies.\u201d 55 Ohio St.2d at 20, 9 O.O.3d 10, 377 N.E.2d 1000. That is misleading. While the <em>body </em>of the opinion indeed does not make that statement so explicitly, <em>Benton\u2019s </em>syllabus paragraph two <em>dearly </em>states that these benefits cannot both be paid for the same injury. <em>Benton, </em>14 Ohio St.2d 130, 43 O.O.2d 238, 237 N.E.2d 134. In fact, <em>Martin, </em>four paragraphs later, acknowledged the. syllabus:</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cThis court is aware of the broad language found in paragraph two of the syllabus of <em>Benton </em>which, when read alone, supports the proposition that a claimant cannot receive compensation under both R.C. 4123.57(C) and 4123.58. However, that paragraph must be read in conjunction with the entire syllabus and supporting facts of the case. When read in this context, it is clear that the <em>Benton </em>holding does not prevent claimant in this cause from receiving his previously awarded benefits under R.C. 4123.57(C).\u201d 55 Ohio St.2d at 21, 9 0.0.3d 10, 377 N.E.2d 1000.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">{\u00b6 18} This reasoning is also vulnerable to attack. Reading <em>Benton </em>\u201cin conjunction with the entire syllabus and [its] supporting facts\u201d neither distinguishes <em>Benton </em>nor frees <em>Martin </em>from <em>Benton\u2019s </em>holding. <em>Benton </em>is crystal clear in its pronouncement, which is why the case continues to haunt claimants to this day.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">{\u00b6 19} This court\u2019s most recent struggle with <em>Benton </em>occurred in <em>Doughty, </em>61 Ohio St.3d 736, 576 N.E.2d 801. There, another pre-1973 claimant lost the use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>his right leg and was granted vocational PTD. Ten months later, a new claim was allowed for his left leg. The left leg continued to deteriorate, resulting in its eventual amputation.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AKe\">Thompson, Meier <em>&amp; </em>Dersom and Adam H. Leonatti, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b630-13\">Betty D. Montgomery, Attorney General, and Dennis L. Hufstader, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee Industrial Commission of Ohio.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">{\u00b6 20} After that condition was allowed, claimant unsuccessfully sought R.C. 4123.57(C) compensation for the left leg. The court of appeals denied a writ of mandamus to order the compensation, and claimant appealed here. We ordered the commission to pay R.C. 4123.57(C) compensation. This time, we properly distinguished <em>Benton, </em>stressing that \u2014 unlike <em>Benton </em>\u2014 the condition for which Doughty received R.C. 4123.57(C) compensation was not the same condition for which he was paid PTD. To refuse R.C. 4123.57(C) compensation \u201cwould be to leave him uncompensated for his left leg amputation which arose and occurred after his PTD award. Such a result defeats the goal of workers\u2019 compensation to compensate claimants for their injuries.\u201d 61 Ohio St.3d at 739, 576 N.E.2d 801.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">{\u00b6 21} The crux of the current controversy, however, stems from this statement in <em>Doughty: </em>\u201c[T]o the extent that <em>Benton </em>can be read as inconsistent with the present case and the fairly well-settled law from which our opinion today derives, <em>Benton </em>is overruled.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">{\u00b6 22} The widow-claimant here contends that this declaration invalidates <em>Benton </em>and removes it as the sole impediment to receipt of both types of compensation. This argument is tenuous. <em>Doughty </em>overruled <em>Benton only </em>to the extent that it was inconsistent therewith. Given, however, that <em>Benton </em>was wholly distinguishable from <em>Doughty, </em>and therefore not controlling in <em>Doughty, </em>the two cases had no common ground on which there could be any inconsistency.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">{\u00b6 23} Nevertheless, our analysis and further consideration of this issue, as explained above, persuade us that <em>Benton </em>is unsound. Accordingly, <em>Benton </em>is hereby overruled, and we grant a writ of mandamus ordering the commission to grant the widow-claimant\u2019s application for scheduled loss benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">{\u00b624} The judgment of the court of appeals is reversed, and the writ is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">Judgment reversed and writ granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b630-11\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
