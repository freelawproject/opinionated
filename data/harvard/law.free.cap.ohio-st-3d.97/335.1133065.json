Maher died shortly thereafter while being flown to the hospital. Defendant-appellant, David L. Myers, who had been seen walking with Maher in the direction of the railroad tracks shortly before her body was discovered there, was indicted for the murder of Maher. The case was declared nolle prosequi in February 1991. Two years later, Myers was reindicted for the murder of Maher and was subsequently found guilty of aggravated murder and sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">{\u00b6 2} On August 3, 1988, Amanda Maher, and her boyfriend, Glenn Smith, went to the Five Points Tavern, a.k.a. Leahy\u2019s, in Xenia following an afternoon of house-hunting for themselves and their daughter, Sarah. The couple had a few drinks and left Five Points at around 7:30 p.m. to attend the Greene County Fair. They arrived back at Five Points around 9:30 to 10:00 p.m., and Smith resumed drinking while shooting pool with Lee Weimer, the bartender on duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-13\">{\u00b6 3} Between 10:30 and 11:00 p.m. that night, David Myers arrived at Five Points and played pool and drank with Smith. Smith recognized Myers as an occasional customer of the tavern from Smith\u2019s work there as a weekend bartender. During this time, Myers remarked to Smith about the Mickey Mouse shirt Maher was wearing, to the effect that he wanted to play with Mickey\u2019s ears or nose because he liked where they were positioned on the shirt. Smith admonished Myers that he did not appreciate the remark. Smith left the bar for about fifteen minutes to get fresh air, then came back and resumed drinking and shooting pool with Myers.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-14\">{\u00b6 4} Sometime after midnight, Smith and Maher left to go to the nearby Round Table bar. Myers asked to come along, and the three drove over to the Round Table in Smith\u2019s car. After arriving at the bar, Maher went inside, but Smith \u201chad a few more words\u201d with Myers before they went in. Smith was upset with Myers about sexual remarks he was making about Maher. After Myers and Smith went inside, Smith got \u201ckind of rowdy\u201d while drinking whiskey slammers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>with Myers. Teresa Mellotte, the bartender on duty that night at the Round Table, warned Smith to quit or she would ask him to leave. Smith threw his glass to the floor, and when he refused to leave, Mellotte phoned the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">{\u00b6 5} Smith became belligerent with two Xenia police officers, Patrolmen Daniel Savage and Richard E. Rinehart, who arrived on the scene at approximately 1:15 a.m. The officers escorted Smith outside, where Savage handcuffed him and placed him under arrest. He then explained to Maher what was going to happen with Smith. Maher asked whether she could have Smith\u2019s wallet, and Smith allowed Savage to retrieve it from his back pocket to give to Maher. Smith also allowed Savage to retrieve what Smith thought were his car keys. Maher discovered shortly thereafter that none of the keys she received fit Smith\u2019s car. At that point, Myers approached Savage and told him, \u201cI will make sure she gets home. I will take care of her.\u201d Myers also told Smith in the back of the patrol car, \u201cI will take care of her, Glenn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">{\u00b6 6} Savage took Smith to the county jail while Rinehart followed in his patrol car. Rinehart left the jail at 1:23 a.m. and resumed his patrol duties. Meanwhile, Maher and Myers reentered the Round Table looking for Smith\u2019s car keys. Maher borrowed a flashlight from Mellotte in order to look for the keys in the parking lot. Charles Van Hoose, a bar patron at the Round Table, noticed that Myers had his arm around Maher, reassuring her that he would take care of everything. When Van Hoose looked out the tavern door while buying another beer, he saw Myers and Maher walk across the tavern parking lot toward Home Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">{\u00b6 7} Also at this time, Officer Rinehart was in his police car on patrol and saw Myers and Maher walking northwest on the sidewalk along Home Avenue toward South Detroit Street. He testified that he saw Maher approximately three hundred yards from the spot where she was eventually discovered, barely alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">{\u00b6 8} At 2:10 a.m., Lee Weimer looked out the door of the Five Points Tavern and saw Myers, alone, getting into his car and driving away. Around 2:15 a.m., Myers entered the Round Table, ordered a drink from Mellotte, and went straight to the restroom for several minutes. Don Hilderbrand was one of the few patrons left in the bar. Earlier, he had seen Smith break the glass and get arrested. He also had seen Myers and Maher leave the bar together approximately twenty minutes after Smith\u2019s arrest. When Myers came out of the restroom, Hilderbrand asked Myers \u201cif he got any [sex]\u201d from Maher. Myers responded that \u201che tried, but she wasn\u2019t willing and he just dropped her off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">{\u00b6 9} At approximately 3:00 a.m., Jennifer Berry was walking home with a friend when she came upon \u201ca girl laying [sic] on the tracks\u201d gasping for air. Berry and the friend ran to her house, talked the situation over, and called the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>police. Officer John Waldren was first on the scene after receiving a dispatch for \u201ca female down in the area\u201d of Railroad Street. The officer called out to her but could only hear moans and groans. The woman, later identified as Maher, had a shirt pulled up around her neck with no other clothing on. Officer Savage, who was in the area nearby investigating a burglary, also heard the police dispatch and ran down to the railroad tracks. Savage did not recognize Maher from his earlier encounter with her at the Round Table bar. He noticed what he thought was a cinder on the right side of Maher\u2019s face. He suddenly realized that a railroad spike had been driven into her head. He also noticed that little blood was coming out of that wound.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">{\u00b6 10} Maher was rushed to Greene Memorial Hospital but died shortly after 6:00 a.m. while being life-flighted to Miami Valley Hospital. Robert D. Setzer, an agent of the BCI Crime Scene Search Unit, went to the Greene Memorial Hospital, where Maher\u2019s body had been returned, and performed tape lifts on Maher\u2019s hands and pubic area for evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">{\u00b6 11} Dr. Justin G. Krause, the Greene County Coroner, observed most of the autopsy performed by a Dr. Mannarino. Dr. Krause testified that Maher had sustained two fractures to her jaw as the result of a blunt force injury and noted that some knitted material wrapped tightly around her throat caused an abrasion on her neck. He further opined that Maher\u2019s forehead wounds were caused by an attempt to drive a railroad spike into her forehead. The spike driven into Maher\u2019s right temple acted as a plug that permitted only minimal bleeding. Fingernail mark patterns on Maher\u2019s neck indicated that the perpetrator had sustained an injury to his right ring finger. Myers suffered such an injury in a motorcycle accident one month prior to the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">{\u00b6 12} During the autopsy, three stones were removed from Maher\u2019s vaginal canal through her abdominal cavity. The three stones were approximately the same size and measured roughly seven centimeters by four centimeters, and one-half centimeter around. Dr. Krause opined that it was likely that the stones were inserted in Maher\u2019s vaginal canal after she was unconscious. Maher died of severe head trauma, produced by a penetrating railroad spike through her right temple, and attempted strangulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">{\u00b6 13} Xenia police apprehended Myers later on the afternoon of August 4, but he denied killing Maher. Myers claimed that he had last seen Maher on her hands and knees looking for car keys in the Round Table parking lot. A search of Myers\u2019s Ford Mustang pursuant to a warrant resulted in the discovery of wallets belonging to Maher and Smith stuffed inside a glove under the front passenger seat. While Myers was being booked at the county jail, he remarked to Deputy Sheriff Thomas A. Adkins, \u201cTom, man, cocaine will make you do anything. It will make you do anything to get it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>{\u00b6 14} On August 8, 1988, the grand jury indicted Myers on one count of aggravated murder. A death penalty specification alleged that Myers had committed the aggravated murder during a robbery. On February 1, 1991, the prosecuting attorney entered a nolle prosequi on the murder indictment against Myers. Around one month later, Myers was arraigned on eleven counts of forgery. On April 22, 1991, he pled guilty to the forgery charges and was sentenced to three years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">{\u00b6 15} After the nolle prosequi, Greene County authorities continued investigating the Maher murder case. On February 12, 1993, Myers was arraigned upon reindictment in the Maher murder on a charge identical to that declared nolle prosequi in February 1991. Over the next few years, Myers\u2019s case was continued repeatedly at his request. The trial court overruled several defense motions to dismiss the case on speedy trial grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">{\u00b6 16} Finally, on January 9, 1996, a jury trial began, which lasted nearly a month. At trial, Mark Timmons, a fellow inmate of Myers in 1989, testified that he had overheard Myers discussing his case with another inmate at the county jail. In two conversations, Myers had talked of being with Maher around the railroad tracks.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">{\u00b6 17} David Tincher was incarcerated in the same county jail cellblock as Myers during August 1988. Myers said to Tincher out of the blue, \u201cThey couldn\u2019t get me on a rape.\u201d Myers also asked Tincher whether he had ever \u201cput three rocks in a girl.\u201d Tincher responded that he had not, and Myers stated that he had. Tincher knew nothing of Maher\u2019s murder, except that it involved a railroad spike. A few days later, Tincher asked Myers, \u201cWhy a railroad spike?\u201d Myers replied, \u201cBecause it was handy.\u201d After that, Myers told Tincher, \u201cDon\u2019t ever try to drive nothing through nobody\u2019s forehead. * * * He said it won\u2019t go, but he said it went through the temple.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">{\u00b6 18} Also during trial, three expert witnesses testified on behalf of the state regarding the foreign hair found on Maher. BCI forensic scientist Michelle Yezzo opined that she was 100 percent certain that the hair was a human pubic hair from a Caucasian. Yezzo found similarities and differences in her comparison of pubic hair samples provided by Myers. However, she could neither confirm nor eliminate Myers as the donor of the pubic hair and suggested that the prosecutor\u2019s office submit the pubic hair to another lab for further analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">{\u00b6 19} Forensic scientist Larry M. Dehus analyzed the foreign pubic hair and found that the microscopic characteristics \u201cwere identical to the microscopic characteristics found in the known hair sample\u201d from Myers. Forensic scientist Richard Bisbing also analyzed the foreign pubic hair and found it \u201cindistinguishable microscopically\u201d from the pubic hair sample provided by Myers.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>{\u00b6 20} Dr. Edward Blake, a forensic serologist, subjected the foreign pubic hair to DNA analysis. Using the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) method, Dr. Blake concluded that the foreign pubic hair bore the same \u201cDQ Alpha genotype\u201d as the known sample from Myers. He further testified that such a genotype is found in approximately two percent of the Caucasian population of North America.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">{\u00b6 21} During the state\u2019s case in chief, Myers\u2019s civil deposition was read into the record. This deposition had been taken in 1992 by attorneys for the Greene County Prosecuting Attorney in connection with a federal lawsuit filed by Myers after the murder charges against him were dismissed in February 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">{\u00b6 22} Deborah Reagin was the final witness to testify for the state. Reagin asserted that Myers had offered her a ride home after she had had a fight with her boyfriend in a Xenia bar in February 1986. Reagin testified that Myers had raped her in a cemetery before dropping her off at her dorm in Yellow Springs. Myers later entered an <em>Alford </em>plea to sexual battery, was found guilty, and was sentenced to six months in jail and five years\u2019 probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">{\u00b6 23} The defense called 19 witnesses, and the state countered with 4 rebuttal witnesses. After deliberation, the jury found Myers guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">{\u00b6 24} At the mitigation hearing, Myers took the stand and subjected himself to cross-examination. Myers claimed that he had not killed Maher and asserted that the witnesses testifying against him were lying about his involvement. Myers\u2019s mother, ex-wife, and current wife, among others, testified on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">{\u00b625} The jury recommended death, and the court imposed a sentence of death. At the sentencing hearing, the court noted that it had received a victim impact statement from Maher\u2019s family but asserted that that statement did not affect its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-11\">{\u00b6 26} Upon appeal, the court of appeals affirmed the convictions and death sentence. The cause is now before the court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">{\u00b6 27} Appellant has raised 32 propositions of law. We have reviewed each and have determined that none justifies reversal of appellant\u2019s conviction for aggravated murder or his death sentence. We have also independently weighed the aggravating circumstance against the evidence presented in mitigation and reviewed the death penalty for appropriateness and proportionality. For the reasons that follow, we affirm appellant\u2019s convictions and death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-13\">\n<em>Due Process: Pre-Indictment Delay</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b547-14\">{\u00b6 28} In Proposition of Law 2, Myers contends that the prosecution unduly delayed filing the second murder indictment against him in order to gain a tactical advantage. Myers asserts that the nolle prosequi allowed the state to gain a tactical advantage by delaying his trial for over four years. Myers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>contends that this delay allowed the state to discourage the testimony of a key defense witness, Kim Grimes, and to hire additional experts to bolster Michelle Yezzo\u2019s hair analysis. Myers argues that the delay prejudiced his right to due process under <em>United States v. Marion </em>(1971), 404 U.S. 307, 92 S.Ct. 455, 30 L.Ed.2d 468, and <em>State v. Luck </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 150,15 OBR 296, 472 N.E.2d 1097, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">{\u00b6 29} Myers\u2019s arguments are not well taken. Defense counsel was convinced of Myers\u2019s innocence and implored the prosecutor to investigate Gregory Grimes and Terrance Rogers as suspects in the Maher murder. Prosecutor William Schenck considered defense counsel\u2019s entreaties and decided to nolle prosequi the murder case in February 1991, and to undertake further investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">{\u00b6 30} Myers fails to demonstrate prejudice in being unable to locate Kim Grimes, the ex-wife of Gregory Grimes. While the first indictment was pending, Kim Grimes told authorities that her ex-husband claimed to have been present at Maher\u2019s murder and had implicated himself and another person in her death. Gregory Grimes was called as a defense witness, and admitted that he \u201cmight have\u201d told his ex-wife that he killed Maher. Grimes asserted that he did so out of anger at his ex-wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">{\u00b6 31} It does not appear to us that the state delayed the case for more analysis of the foreign pubic hair found on Maher because Yezzo\u2019s determination was \u201cunfavorable.\u201d Yezzo testified that the pubic hair exhibited \u201csimilarities and differences\u201d when compared to samples provided by Myers, but Yezzo could not conclusively designate him as the donor. Such a finding by Yezzo was not necessarily \u201cunfavorable,\u201d as Myers contends. Yezzo did not exclude Myers as the donor of the hair, but did exclude all other known suspects to the murder, including Grimes and Rogers. Moreover, the additional experts hired to analyze the pubic hair did not cause any preindictment delay, since all such testing had been completed well before the case was nolled in 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">{\u00b6 32} Contrary to Myers\u2019s arguments, we find that the delay in this case resulted from defense requests and from the court\u2019s efforts to ensure that the right suspect was brought to justice. Since Myers fails to demonstrate that the state improperly delayed his trial, we overrule Proposition of Law 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">\n<em>Speedy-Trial Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b548-10\">{\u00b6 33} In seven separate propositions of law (6 through 12), Myers contends that his right to a speedy trial pursuant to the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, Section 10, Article I of the Ohio Constitution, and R.C. 2945.71 was infringed.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\">{\u00b6 34} Under R.C. 2945.71(C)(2), the state is required to bring a defendant to trial on felony charges within 270 days following arrest. Each day the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>is held in jail in lieu of bail on the pending charge is counted as three days. R.C. 2945.71(E). The time computation may be tolled by provisions in R.C. 2945.72, including delays necessitated by motions raised by the accused, and the period of any continuance requested by the accused, or any reasonable continuance granted other than upon the request of the accused. R.C. 2945.72(E), (H).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">{\u00b6 35} In Proposition of Law 6, Myers argues that the nolle prosequi entered in 1991 was undertaken ex parte and was therefore invalid. However, in our view, the nolle prosequi was entered by the state in part based on defense arguments that there was insufficient proof and that further investigation of other suspects was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">{\u00b6 36} The period between a dismissal of charges without prejudice and the filing of a subsequent indictment premised upon the same facts is not counted for purposes of computing the speedy-trial time period set forth in R.C. 2945.71 et seq. <em>State v. Broughton </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 253, 581 N.E.2d 541, paragraph one of the syllabus. Although Myers was in jail during most of the time between the nolle prosequi and his reindictment on February 4, 1993, his imprisonment resulted from his conviction on 11 counts of forgery in a wholly unrelated matter. Hence, Proposition of Law 6 is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">{\u00b6 37} In Proposition of Law 7, Myers contends that he was not brought to trial within 270 days of his arrest as required by R.C. 2945.71(C)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">{\u00b6 38} In computing the time in this case in conformity with the speedy-trial statute, Myers is not entitled to the triple-count provision of R.C. 2945.71(E) for the time he was held in jail, since a probation detainer was placed against him the day after his August 4,1988 arrest. <em>State v. Martin </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 207, 10 O.O.3d 369, 383 N.E.2d 585; <em>State v. Phillips </em>(1990), 69 Ohio App.3d 379, 381, 590 N.E.2d 1281.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">{\u00b6 39} The original trial date was set for November 7, 1988, then moved up by the trial court to October 31, 1988. Under R.C. 2945.71(C), time ran against the state from Myers\u2019s arrest on August 4 until October 14, 1988, when Myers moved for a continuance, and the trial was moved to January 23, 1989. This amounts to a 71-day delay. Although Myers was incarcerated from the time of his arrest, the triple-count provisions of R.C. 2945.71(E) do not apply, because on August 5, 1988, the day after Myers\u2019s arrest, a probation detainer was placed on him and he was held pursuant to that detainer rather than on the \u201cpending charge\u201d of the Maher murder. In order to be entitled to the triple-count provision, a defendant must be held on the \u201cpending charge.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-11\">{\u00b6 40} Myers next moved for a continuance on December 15, 1988, which the trial court granted, delaying the trial until April 3, 1989. Upon Myers\u2019s motion, the trial was again continued until May 8, 1989. At this juncture, the number of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>days chargeable to the state remains at 71. See R.C. 2945.72(H) (continuances granted at defendant\u2019s request are not chargeable to the state).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">{\u00b6 41} On March 24, 1989, the state moved for a continuance, which was granted until June 12, 1989. On June 7, the state moved for another continuance, getting an extension until September 5, 1989. It is these two state-requested delays that Myers challenges as unreasonable and therefore chargeable to the state under R.C. 2945.72(H) (only \u201creasonable\u201d delays sought by state are not chargeable to state).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">{\u00b6 42} The first continuance was requested so that the state could conduct further forensic testing on a foreign pubic hair found on Maher\u2019s body. Testing had already shown that similarities existed between this hair and the sample provided by Myers. But the state had been advised that a new form of DNA testing would enhance the identifiability of the hair. The state wished to have these further tests performed by the \u201cmost qualified\u201d expert in the country, who worked out of California. This expert had an immovable 12-week backlog of cases, necessitating the state\u2019s request for a continuance. It would be difficult to characterize this request as unreasonable. The foreign hair was a crucial item of evidence, and the new, more sophisticated DNA test might prove vital to the state\u2019s case. It was even conceivable that the test might have excluded Myers as the source of the foreign hair. Thus, the request for the continuance was not unreasonable and cannot be charged against the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">{\u00b6 43} The second continuance challenged by Myers was requested by the state on June 7, 1989. The state set forth two reasons for its request. First, through no fault of the state, the California DNA testing had been delayed and the results would not be available until mid-July 1989. Second, the state claimed not to have received any discovery from the defense, which had been ordered by the court with a deadline of May 23. With only five days remaining until the scheduled trial date, the state argued that it could not properly prepare for trial without the discovery materials. The defense objected to the delay but did not deny that it had failed to provide the necessary discovery. Moreover, the defense conceded at the motion hearing that it might want to conduct its own tests on the hair depending on what the California results were. Since those results were expected in mid-July, it was reasonable for the court to provide extra time should these additional defense tests be desired.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">{\u00b6 44} Moreover, during this period between May 8, 1989 and September 5, 1989, Myers had many motions pending, including motions to suppress eyewitness identification, a motion to quash search warrant, and a motion to suppress all evidence. Thus, the defendant himself contributed to the delay. See R.C. 2945.72(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>{\u00b6 45} Thus, the continuances challenged by Myers were reasonable. The trial was properly continued until September 5, 1989, and the delay shall not be charged against the state. The total days charged to the state as of September 5, 1989, is still 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">{\u00b6 46} On August 29, 1989, Myers moved for another continuance, which was granted until November 27, 1989. This delay must be charged to the defense. The defense moved for a further continuance on November 2, 1989, as a result of which the trial was delayed until April 16, 1990. In its entry granting the continuance, the court stated that \u201cDefendant has waived his right to a speedy trial and the time does not count against the State.\u201d The defendant himself, with counsel present, agreed to this delay in open court.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">{\u00b6 47} In an entry dated March 9, 1990, the trial court noted that Myers had notified the court that he desired new counsel and that two attorneys had stated to the court that they might be able to represent Myers. Myers retained them on March 23,1990, a mere three weeks before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">{\u00b6 48} On April 17, the day after trial was to begin, the court entered an order continuing the trial until October 9, 1990. It is unclear from the record who requested this delay, but Myers concedes in his brief to this court that it is chargeable to the defense as it is \u201cclear\u201d that it was necessitated by his retention of new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">{\u00b6 49} For reasons not clear from the record, trial did not begin on October 9, 1990, as scheduled. Instead, at a hearing on October 17, 1990, the court stated that the trial would be continued until March 3, 1991. At that hearing, defense counsel concurred with the delay, stating that \u201cthat\u2019s a date that is easily acceptable.\u201d So the most that could be charged against the state would be the unexplained delay between October 9 and 17, adding 8 days to the total of 71 for a new total of 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-12\">{\u00b6 50} On February 1, 1991, the case was nolled, and as explained in our discussion of Proposition of Law 6, the time between dismissal and reindictment two years later is not chargeable against the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-13\">{\u00b6 51} On April 12, 1991, Myers\u2019s probation detainer was terminated and he was released. On April 22, 1991, Myers pled guilty to 11 unrelated forgery charges and was sentenced to three years in prison. He was reindicted on the Maher aggravated murder charge on February 4, 1993, and the warrant for his arrest was returned the next day. Myers was in the Dayton Correctional Center at the time of his rearrest, serving his sentence on the forgery charges. For this reason, Myers is not entitled to the triple-count provisions of R.C. 2945.71(E) (triple count applies only to days accused is held on \u201cpending\u201d charge). Myers was ordered released on bond on February 22,1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>{\u00b6 52} Trial on the Maher charge was set for March 1, 1993. The period between February 5 and February 25, 1993, is chargeable to the state, adding another 20 days to the total, which now stands at 99 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">{\u00b6 53} On February 26, 1993, Myers moved for a continuance, which was granted until October 12, 1993. Myers moved to vacate that trial date on September 13, 1993, and trial was moved to January 24, 1994. On January 3, 1994, a hearing was held in which the defense agreed to a further continuance until July 11, 1994. At a hearing on June 22, 1994, Myers personally informed the court that he desired to change counsel again and that the July 11 trial would have to be further delayed. Myers\u2019s new counsel agreed to a new trial date of October 11,1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">{\u00b6 54} On September 12, 1994, Myers moved for a further continuance. The trial court moved the trial date to February 27, 1995. Myers asserts that this continuance should not be charged against him, because the entry granting it does not specifically state that he requested it. Myers cites <em>State v. Geraldo </em>(1983), 13 Ohio App.3d 27, 13 OBR 29, 468 N.E.2d 328. However, contrary to the statement in <em>Geraldo, </em>this court has never required that the entry identify the defendant as the requesting party. Thus, the fact that the entry did not list Myers as the requesting party is irrelevant since the record shows that it was Myers who specifically requested this delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">{\u00b6 55} On January 26, 1995, Myers requested yet another delay, which was denied. On February 24, 1995, on the eve of trial, Myers filed a waiver of his speedy trial rights until September 11, 1995, and the trial was continued until that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">{\u00b6 56} On August 11, 1995, Myers moved for another continuance, which was granted until either October 16, 23, or 30, 1995, depending on defense counsel\u2019s availability due to another trial. Based on counsel\u2019s unavailability, Myers requested another continuance on September 25, 1995, which was granted until either November 13, 20, or 27, or December 4,1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">{\u00b6 57} On November 11, 1995, Myers filed an affidavit of disqualification against the trial court judge, which automatically divests the judge of jurisdiction to proceed until the matter is resolved by this court. R.C. 2701.03(D)(1). Thus, the trial proceedings were suspended, and any delay is not chargeable to the state. This court announced its denial of the affidavit of disqualification on November 30, 1995, at which point the running of the speedy-trial period resumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">{\u00b6 58} In accordance with an order of the trial court on August 18, 1995, defense counsel had been submitting regular \u201cstatus reports\u201d informing the court of the progress of other trials that defense counsel was litigating. Myers had agreed at a hearing on that date to delay his own trial until these other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>proceedings were concluded. Upon the receipt of each report, the trial court would set a new hearing date, based upon defense counsel\u2019s estimate of when these other trials would end. On November 17, 1995, based on a status report filed that day, the court rescheduled the trial for either December 11 or 18, 1995. For reasons that are not clear from the record, the trial date was once again extended by entry of the court to January 2,1996. This is the date on which trial finally commenced. Because it is not clear who requested this continuance or the reason behind it, the 15-day delay from December 18, 1995 to January 2, 1996, must be charged to the state. Thus, the number chargeable to the state rises to 114 days, well within the limit imposed by R.C. 2945.71(C)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">{\u00b6 59} Myers\u2019s argument that his statutory speedy-trial right was violated is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">{\u00b6 60} In Proposition of Law 8, Myers asserts that an accused does not waive his statutory speedy-trial rights by not filing a motion for discharge. Myers complains that the court of appeals erroneously held that he waived any objection to any continuances granted after October 6, 1995, since he failed to file any additional motions for discharge on speedy-trial grounds after that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">{\u00b6 61} We disagree. As explained above, Myers was brought to trial within the strictures of the speedy-trial statutes, R.C. 2945.71 et seq. The issue is therefore moot. However, even if delays after October 6, 1995, were chargeable to the state, Myers was still brought to trial within the 270-day statutory timeframe, as the period between October 7, 1995 and January 2, 1996, is only 87 days, bringing the total to 186 (excluding the 15-day delay in that period that was already charged to the state).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">{\u00b6 62} In Proposition of Law 9, Myers argues that several of the journal entries granting delay in this case were insufficient because they did not specify the party requesting the continuance. In support, Myers relies on <em>State v. Geraldo, </em>13 Ohio App.3d 27, 13 OBR 29, 468 N.E.2d 328. However, as explained above, this court has never required such identification in the journal entry. Moreover, the record in this case indicates the party requesting the continuance and the reason behind the request. Where the trial record affirmatively demonstrates the necessity for a continuance and the reasonableness thereof, such a continuance will be upheld. <em>Aurora v. Patrick </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 107, 109, 15 O.O.3d 150, 399 N.E.2d 1220. Unlike the situations in <em>State v. Mincy, 2 </em>Ohio St.3d 6, 2 OBR 282, 441 N.E.2d 571, and <em>State v. Lee </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 208, 2 O.O.3d 392, 357 N.E.2d 1095, also cited by Myers, none of the questioned continuances was ordered by the trial court <em>sua sponte. </em>Even though a few journal entries were not specific, Myers\u2019s statutory right to a speedy trial was not infringed.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>{\u00b6 63} In Proposition of Law 10, Myers contends that substantive motions he filed did not toll the statutory speedy trial time limit when the running of time had already been tolled pursuant to a previously granted motion for a continuance. As discussed above, Myers was brought to trial within the 270-day statutory time limit. Proposition of Law 10 is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">{\u00b6 64} In Proposition of Law 11, Myers asserts that his constitutional rights to a speedy trial under both the United States Constitution and the Ohio Constitution were violated by periods of unnecessary delay by the state. In <em>Barker v. Wingo </em>(1972), 407 U.S. 514, 530, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101, the United States Supreme Court set forth a balancing test to determine whether trial delays are reasonable under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The following factors are to be considered: \u201cLength of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant\u2019s assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">{\u00b6 65} In reviewing the first <em>Barker </em>factor, we find that the length of delay between Myers\u2019s first arrest on August 4, 1988, and his trial on January 2, 1996, encompassed approximately seven years and five months. However, the two-year period between the nolle prosequi and Myers\u2019s reindictment should not weigh against the state. Contrary to Myers\u2019s arguments, the state investigated other suspects in this crime at defense counsel\u2019s urging. Nothing suggests that the state sought the nolle prosequi in bad faith in order to give the prosecution more time to bolster its case against Myers. See <em>United States v. MacDonald </em>(1982), 456 U.S. 1, 7, 102 S.Ct. 1497, 71 L.Ed.2d 696. Almost all of the other delays, totaling nearly four years, were attributable to continuances requested by Myers, except the approximately four-month period during which the state requested continuances to complete forensic testing on the foreign pubic hair, including DNA analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">{\u00b6 66} Subtracting the two-year delay attributable to the nolle prosequi and the four years attributable to Myers\u2019s requested continuances, the trial was delayed for approximately one year and five months. A delay of less than one and one-half years in bringing the defendant to trial in a complex capital murder case is barely sufficient to be \u201cpresumptively prejudicial,\u201d which ordinarily triggers a constitutional speedy-trial analysis and inquiry into the remaining <em>Barker </em>factors. <em>Doggett v. United States </em>(1992), 505 U.S. 647, 652, 112 S.Ct. 2686, 120 L.Ed.2d 520, citing <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 530-531, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101. Under the circumstances of this case, the length of delay should not weigh against the state for constitutional speedy-trial analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">{\u00b6 67} Under the second <em>Barker </em>factor, the reason for delay, the request by the state to complete forensic testing on the pubic hair does not appear to have been made in bad faith or to overcome an \u201cunfavorable report\u201d as Myers asserts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>The forensic testing by Michelle Yezzo that prompted further testing of the pubic hair by the state is more properly considered inconclusive than unfavorable. Moreover, as discussed, the overwhelming majority of delays in bringing Myers to trial were occasioned by defense requests. This factor should not weigh against the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">{\u00b6 68} The third <em>Barker </em>factor weighs in favor of Myers, given the number of motions wherein he asserted, however erroneously, that his statutory speedy-trial rights had been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">{\u00b6 69} Last, Myers\u2019s claim that he was prejudiced by the delays under the fourth factor of <em>Barker </em>is not persuasive. Myers claims that the delays in his trial caused Kim Grimes to be unavailable as a witness, and thus prevented him from eliciting testimony implicating someone other than himself as the killer. However, as discussed under Proposition of Law 2, the defense could have offered at trial Kim Grimes\u2019s allegedly damaging testimony from a pretrial hearing under Evid.R. 804(B)(1). It did not. Also, Grimes\u2019s ex-husband Gregory admitted during his testimony that he \u201cmight have\u201d told his ex-wife that he killed Amanda Maher. Moreover, the defense called several other witnesses whose testimony tended to implicate Gregory Grimes or Terrance Rogers as the murderer(s). Thus, the fourth <em>Barker </em>factor does not indicate prejudice to Myers in his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">{\u00b6 70} In balancing the four <em>Barker </em>factors in this case, we hold that Myers was not denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial. Accordingly, we overrule Proposition of Law 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">{\u00b6 71} In his final speedy-trial proposition, Myers claims in Proposition of Law 12 that the probation detainer was never properly served on him. Therefore, he asserts that the triple-count provisions of R.C. 2945.71(E) must apply for days he spent in jail awaiting trial. Myers waived any argument concerning the validity of the probation detainer by failing to raise the issue before the trial court. See, e.g., <em>State v. Kinley </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 491, 496, 651 N.E.2d 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">{\u00b6 72} Based on the foregoing, Myers was not denied either his statutory or constitutional rights to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">\n<em>Suppression Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">{\u00b6 73} In Proposition of Law 14, Myers asserts that he was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s failure to suppress the following statement that he made to Deputy Tom Adkins: \u201cTom, man, cocaine will make you do anything. It will make you do anything to get it.\u201d Myers asserts that the statement should have been excluded under Evid.R. 403(A), because its probative value was substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>{\u00b6 74} Before admitting this testimony, the trial court held a suppression hearing away from the jury. The court found that the statement was ambiguous and not necessarily an admission of cocaine use by Myers, and therefore not an inadmissible \u201cother act\u201d under Evid.R. 404(B). The trial court concluded that the statement had considerable probative value because a permissive inference arose therefrom that cocaine may have been Myers\u2019s motive for robbing the victim. The court rules that this probative value outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice to Myers.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">{\u00b6 75} A trial court has broad discretion in the admission of evidence, and this court will not disturb such rulings absent an abuse of discretion. See <em>State v. Maurer </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 265, 15 OBR 379, 473 N.E.2d 768. An abuse of discretion connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies that the court\u2019s attitude was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 157, 16 O.O.3d 169, 404 N.E.2d 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">{\u00b6 76} Here, the trial court did not abuse its discretion. Myers\u2019s statement is relevant, as it supports a reasonable inference that he murdered Maher while robbing her for money to buy cocaine. Any prejudice resulting to Myers cannot be considered \u201cunfair,\u201d as it was freely made, was not the result of police questioning, and was not coerced.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">{\u00b6 77} In Proposition of Law 21, Myers contends that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to suppress evidence seized from his automobile pursuant to warrant, because the affidavit requesting the warrant omitted facts or made a false statement that would have caused the magistrate to refuse to issue the warrant. See <em>Franks v. Delaware </em>(1978), 438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667. Here, the trial court overruled Myers\u2019s motion to suppress wallets belonging to Maher and Smith that police discovered under the front passenger seat of his automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">{\u00b6 78} An affidavit supporting a warrant enjoys a presumption of validity. <em>State v. Roberts </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 170, 16 O.O.3d 201, 405 N.E.2d 247. In order to overcome the presumption, the defendant has \u201cthe task of supporting his allegations by more than conclusional accusations, or the mere desire to cross-examine.\u201d Id. at 177, 16 O.O.3d 201, 405 N.E.2d 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">{\u00b6 79} Myers claims that police falsely described in the affidavit a vehicle alleged to have been seen at the murder scene as a \u201clight-colored vehicle.\u201d At the suppression hearing, Detective Keith Linkhart testified that Gregory Grimes variously described a car he saw near the murder scene as \u201clike a Road Runner * * *, yellow with black stripes,\u201d and as \u201clight color, possibly yellow.\u201d Don Hilderbrand told Det. Linkhart that Myers drove a \u201cpale cream colored car.\u201d When Det. Linkhart drove Grimes around the area of the murder scene, Grimes described a \u201clight pale yellow or cream vehicle.\u201d Detective David Greene, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>affiant on the request for the search warrant, testified that Det. Linkhart had told him that Grimes described the vehicle near the murder scene as a \u201clight colored vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">{\u00b6 80} Given such testimony, Myers fails to demonstrate that a false statement was made in the affidavit under <em>Franks, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in overruling Myers\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">\n<em>Biased Grand Juror</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">{\u00b6 81} In Proposition of Law 20, Myers contends that his second grand jury indictment was tainted with bias in violation of Section 10, Article I of the Ohio Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Myers claims that his right to an impartial, unbiased grand jury was violated, since one of the grand jurors revealed that he or she had worked at Five Points Tavern and was familiar with Myers\u2019s carrying a knife into the bar. The grand juror recalled that this had happened seven or eight years previously, and described it as \u201creally scary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">{\u00b6 82} Myers never raised this issue before the trial court, and thus has waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Slagle </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 597, 604, 605 N.E.2d 916. To constitute plain error it must appear that \u201cbut for the error, the outcome of the trial clearly would have been otherwise.\u201d <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">{\u00b6 83} Beyond his bare allegations of bias, Myers does not demonstrate how the grand juror was biased or incapable of carrying out the duties of a grand juror in a fair and impartial manner. Nor does Myers demonstrate that the brief statements of the grand juror influenced the grand jury\u2019s decision to indict Myers. Absent such a showing of bias or influence, we do not find the indictment to be defective. See <em>State v. Thomas </em>(1992), 80 Ohio App.3d 452, 456, 609 N.E.2d 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">{\u00b6 84} In addition, the grand jury also heard testimony from Debbie Reagin that Myers had used a knife to coerce her to perform oral sex and sexual intercourse with him in February 1986. Thus, the fact that Myers had carried a knife was not something revealed solely by one grand juror. Moreover, the grand juror in issue was one of nine members of that panel, and only seven votes are needed to indict. Crim.R. 6(F). Accordingly, it cannot be said that but for the one grand juror Myers would not have been indicted. Proposition of Law 20 is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-12\">\n<em>Voir Dire Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b557-13\">{\u00b6 85} In Proposition of Law 29, Myers argues that his death sentence should be vacated based on flaws in the voir dire. First, Myers asserts that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>court erroneously excused two prospective jurors for cause based on their anti-death penalty views. Myers contends that the court erroneously applied the standard in <em>Wainwright v. Witt </em>(1985), 469 U.S. 412, 105 S.Ct. 844, 83 L.Ed.2d 841, instead of the more strict standard in R.C. 2945.25(C). However, this court has consistently upheld use of the <em>Wainwright </em>standard in the death qualification of jurors. See, e.g., <em>State v. Wilson </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 381, 388, 659 N.E.2d 292. A review of the voir dire of both excused jurors, Archer and Knepper, indicates that their death penalty views \u201cwould prevent or substantially impair the performance of\u2019 their duties as jurors. <em>State v. Rogers </em>(1985), 17 Ohio St.3d 174, 17 OBR 414, 478 N.E.2d 984, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">{\u00b6 86} Second, Myers claims that the trial court erred in not excusing prospective jurors Hill and Lupfer for cause, since they were \u201cautomatic\u201d death penalty jurors under <em>Morgan v. Illinois </em>(1992), 504 U.S. 719, 112 S.Ct. 2222, 119 L.Ed.2d 492. Myers contends that the failure of the trial court to excuse these jurors for cause forced him to use up two peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">{\u00b6 87} However, the voir dire does not indicate that these jurors would have automatically voted for the death penalty. Prospective juror Hill acknowledged that his questionnaire answers were strongly pro-death penalty, but stated that he had changed his perspective: \u201cI would have to really consider hard before I sentenced a man to death even though I don\u2019t have a problem with that.\u201d Likewise, prospective juror Lupfer retreated from any hint of being an \u201cautomatic\u201d death penalty juror: \u201cI will be as fair and as honest as I possibly could be. * * * <em>Disregarding my feelings of capital punishment. </em>* * * I honestly think I could be a fair person.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">{\u00b6 88} Moreover, the court did allow the defense to ask such questions of these jurors on voir dire. In so doing, the trial court avoided committing reversible error under <em>Morgan. State v. Williams </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 1, 6, 679 N.E.2d 646.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">{\u00b6 89} Last, Myers\u2019s complaint that the court erred in not allowing the defense to qualify jurors on their ability to consider specific mitigating factors is not well taken. <em>\u201cMorgan </em>does not require judges to allow individual voir dire on separate mitigating factors.\u201d <em>State v. Wilson, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 386, 659 N.E.2d 292. Proposition of Law 29 is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">\n<em>Evidentiary Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"aos-dedup-0\">Exclusion of Relevant Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">{\u00b6 90} In Proposition of Law 1, Myers argues that the trial court abused its discretion in not allowing him to call the prosecuting attorney and his former defense counsel to testify concerning why the original indictment was nolled in 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>{\u00b6 91} \u201cThe admission or exclusion of relevant evidence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>State v. Sage </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 173, 31 OBR 375, 510 N.E.2d 343, paragraph two of the syllabus. Even relevant evidence may be excluded under Evid.R. 403(A) if its \u201cprobative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.\u201d See, also, <em>State v. Combs </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 278, 284, 581 N.E.2d 1071.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">{\u00b6 92} Myers sought testimony from Greene County Prosecuting Attorney William Schenck during the guilt phase to discover the reasons why he dismissed the murder case in 1991. Essentially, Myers wanted Schenck to testify as to the relative strength of his case against Myers as of 1991. Yet the trial court relied on <em>State v. Today\u2019s Bookstore, Inc. </em>(1993), 86 Ohio App.3d 810, 817, 621 N.E.2d 1283, in disallowing such testimony as \u201cneither probative nor material.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">{\u00b6 93} In all likelihood, the prosecutor would not have dismissed the case in 1991 if he had believed that he could obtain a conviction against Myers. Defense counsel were free to address that issue during opening and closing arguments. In our view, the exclusion of this testimony did not amount to an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">{\u00b6 94} During the mitigation phase, Myers sought to have his former counsel, Paul Dennis Pusateri, testify as to why the case was nolled in 1991, ostensibly to show that there was doubt as to Myers\u2019s guilt. The trial court limited Pusateri\u2019s testimony to the contents of 1988 crime reports filed by Xenia police relating to the general area of the murder scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">{\u00b6 95} The trial court declined Myers\u2019s request to instruct the jury on residual doubt, but stated that defense counsel was free to argue it. Defense counsel argued that Myers was not the killer and attempted to implicate Gregory Grimes or Terrance Rogers as the murderer. Under these circumstances, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in limiting Pusateri\u2019s testimony during the mitigation phase. The decision to limit this testimony was not unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">\u201cLover Boy\u201d Photo</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">{\u00b6 96} In Proposition of Law 4, Myers asserts error in the trial court\u2019s admission of photographs which show him at the time of his arrest wearing a shirt that bore the inscription \u201cLover Boy.\u201d Defense counsel objected to the photos at the guilt phase, but the photographs were admitted into evidence during both phases of trial. Myers contends that the photographs allowed the jury to infer that he was a sexual predator or sexual deviant. Myers further claims that a cumulative prejudicial effect was created by the photographs, since there was evidence that Myers had been convicted of sexual battery several years before, and had fathered a child when he was 14 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>{\u00b6 97} Here, the police officers who arrested Glenn Smith outside the Round Table bar identified Myers from these photo exhibits as the person who told them that he would take Maher home. The photographs were relevant to corroborate identity and thus assisted the trier of fact. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting these photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Myers\u2019s Civil Deposition</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">{\u00b6 98} In Proposition of Law 18, Myers argues that the trial court erred in permitting the reading of his civil deposition to the jury because it contained three irrelevant and prejudicial matters: (1) the psychiatric evaluation of Myers, (2) the nightmares Myers had after August 4, 1988, and (3) the illegitimate child Myers fathered when he was 14 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">{\u00b6 99} After the original murder charges were nolled in February 1991, Myers filed a federal civil rights action against the Greene County Prosecuting Attorney in January 1992. The attorney representing the prosecutor deposed Myers as part of that lawsuit. During Myers\u2019s capital murder trial, the state offered the deposition into evidence to the extent that it dealt with the facts of the murder case. The parties agreed as to which portions of the deposition would be read and agreed that any portion dealing with Myers\u2019s drug use would be redacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">{\u00b6 100} Notably, Myers did not object to any of the matters he now terms irrelevant and prejudicial. Therefore, he has waived all but plain error. <em>Slagle, </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 604, 605 N.E.2d 916. The three matters complained about did not affect the outcome of Myers\u2019s trial. For instance, the fact that Myers suffered nightmares after August 4, 1988, could as easily be attributed to his being unjustly accused, as it could be attributed to a guilty conscience. Any error in this vein was not plain error. <em>State v. Webb </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 325, 335, 638 N.E.2d 1023.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">\n<em>\u201cOther Acts\u201d Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">{\u00b6 101} In Proposition of Law 3, Myers argues that the trial court erred in allowing \u201cother acts\u201d evidence that unfairly prejudiced him. In particular, Myers complains about testimony from Deborah Reagin that Myers had met her at a Xenia bar, then drove her to a cemetery and raped her.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-11\">{\u00b6 102} Under Evid.R. 404(B), \u201c[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d The exception allowing the evidence \u201cmust be construed against admissibility, and the standard for determining admissibility of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>such evidence is strict.\u201d <em>State v. Broom </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 277, 533 N.E.2d 682, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">{\u00b6 103} \u201cThe admission or exclusion of relevant evidence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Sage, </em>31 Ohio St.3d 173, 31 OBR 375, 510 N.E.2d 343, paragraph two of the syllabus. Thus, we review the trial court\u2019s decision by an abuse-of-discretion standard. See <em>State v. Finnerty </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 104, 107, 543 N.E.2d 1233; <em>State v. Hymore </em>(1967), 9 Ohio St.2d 122, 128, 38 O.O.2d 298, 224 N.E.2d 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">{\u00b6 104} We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Reagin\u2019s testimony. That evidence related to Myers\u2019s identity in that it established a modus operandi on the part of Myers. <em>State v. Jamison </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 182, 552 N.E.2d 180, syllabus; <em>State v. Hutton </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 36, 40, 559 N.E.2d 432. A modus operandi is admissible because \u201cit provides a behavioral fingerprint which, when compared to the behavioral fingerprints associated with the crime in question, can be used to identify the defendant as the perpetrator.\u201d <em>State v. Lowe </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 527, 531, 634 N.E.2d 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">{\u00b6 105} The acts leading up to Reagin\u2019s rape and Maher\u2019s murder were very similar. Both times, Myers went to a Xenia bar where he saw a young woman and her male companion get into an argument. In both instances, after the male companion left the woman at the bar alone, Myers assured the woman that everything would be fine and offered to give her a ride home. In each instance, Myers left the bar alone with the young woman, took her to a secluded area where he used a weapon, and sexually assaulted the victim. The difference in the sexual assaults was that Maher apparently resisted, which resulted in her murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">{\u00b6 106} Accordingly, we overrule Proposition of Law 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">\n<em>Victim-Impact Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">{\u00b6 107} In Proposition of Law 13, Myers claims that the state presented improper victim-impact evidence during trial. Specifically, Myers complains that the prosecutor referred to the victim during opening statement as \u201cthe mother of an infant daughter.\u201d Myers further claims error in the introduction and use of a photo of Maher holding her daughter, several photos of the daughter, Sarah, and photos of Maher\u2019s ankle where a tattoo with Sarah\u2019s name is depicted. Myers objected to the picture of Maher with her daughter but did not accept the state\u2019s offer to crop the photo so that only Maher\u2019s face showed. Thus, Myers has no right to complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">{\u00b6 108} Myers further objected to the admission of any photos of the victim\u2019s family in a pretrial motion. The trial court denied that portion of the motion. The photos of Maher holding her daughter were the only photos the state could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>find that portrayed Maher before she was murdered. The photos aided other witnesses in identifying her. The photos of the tattoo were necessary to help identify Maher as the victim, since her face was disfigured. The three photos of Sarah Maher were in the billfolds belonging to Maher and Smith found under the front seat of Myers\u2019s car. \u201cEvidence relating to the facts attendant to the offense * * * is clearly admissible during the guilt phase.\u201d <em>State v. Fautenberry </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 435, 440, 650 N.E.2d 878.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">{\u00b6 109} All of the evidence cited by Myers as victim-impact evidence was admissible. Moreover, none of the evidence here involved the usual type of victim-impact evidence where a member of the victim\u2019s family testifies at the close of the sentencing phase. None of this evidence was outcome-determinative. We reject Proposition of Law 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">\n<em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">{\u00b6 110} In Proposition of Law 15, Myers submits that his convictions must be reversed because they were supported by insufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">{\u00b6 111} In reviewing a record for sufficiency, \u201c[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus, following <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560. \u201c[T]he weight to be given the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses are primarily for the trier of the facts.\u201d <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">{\u00b6 112} Here, the evidence is sufficient to establish Myers\u2019s guilt of the crimes of which he was convicted. The last time Maher was seen alive by several witnesses, she was with Myers. When Myers left the Round Table with Maher, they were seen walking together in the area where she was later found dying. Approximately an hour and a half before Maher was found lying next to the railroad tracks, Det. Rinehart saw her with Myers approximately 300 yards from that spot.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">{\u00b6 113} Myers was seen alone getting into his car across from the Five Points Tavern at 2:10 a.m. He drove back to the Round Table, ordered a drink and immediately went into the restroom. After coming out of the restroom, Myers acknowledged that he tried to have sex with Maher, but that \u201cshe wasn\u2019t willing\u201d and he \u201cjust dropped her off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">{\u00b6 114} When Smith was arrested outside the Round Table, Det. Savage took Smith\u2019s wallet out of his back pocket and gave it to Maher. Myers told Savage he would \u201ctake care of\u2019 Maher and make sure she got home. Later on the day of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>the murder, police found Smith and Maher\u2019s wallets stuffed in a glove under the front passenger seat of Myers\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">{\u00b6 115} Forensic testing showed that a foreign pubic hair found on Maher\u2019s body was microscopically identical to known samples from Myers. The DNA genotype of the pubic hair was found to be the same as that of Myers, and that genotype is found in only two percent of the Caucasian population in North America. The same testing eliminated Glenn Smith as the donor of the hair, as well as Gregory Grimes and Terrance Rogers, who Myers contends were the actual killers.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">{\u00b6 116} While in jail following his arrest, Myers was overheard by inmate Mark Timmons stating that he was with Maher near the railroad tracks and that he left her there. On the day of his arrest in 1988 while being booked, Myers exclaimed to a sheriffs deputy: \u201cTom, man, cocaine will make you do anything. It will make you do anything just to get it.\u201d During the weeks following his arrest in 1988, Myers asked fellow inmate David Tincher if he had ever \u201cput three rocks in a girl.\u201d Myers stated that he had. Tincher asked Myers \u201cwhy a railroad spike\u201d? Myers responded that \u201cit was handy.\u201d Myers then told Tincher not to attempt to drive anything through somebody\u2019s forehead because it won\u2019t go, but that \u201cit went through the temple.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">{\u00b6 117} Maher\u2019s autopsy revealed three rocks placed in her vaginal canal, a forehead wound consistent with someone trying to penetrate a railroad spike through it, and a spike through her right temple. In addition, Dr. Krause, the county coroner, opined that the fingernail marks found on Maher\u2019s neck were consistent with marks made by someone who had sustained an injury to his right ring finger. Myers injured his right ring finger in a motorcycle accident exactly one month before Maher\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">{\u00b6 118} Based on the foregoing, there was sufficient evidence to support Myers\u2019s convictions. We reject Proposition of Law 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">\n<em>Jury Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">{\u00b6 119} In Proposition of Law 16, Myers claims error in the court\u2019s refusal to instruct on residual doubt. Myers concedes that this court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. McGuire </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 390, 686 N.E.2d 1112, syllabus, eliminated residual doubt as a mitigating factor. He asserts, however, that <em>McGuire </em>should not be applied retroactively, in spite of this court\u2019s holding that it may be so applied. See <em>State v. Bey </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 487, 509, 709 N.E.2d 484. Moreover, Myers\u2019s assertion that substantial evidence showed that Grimes and Rogers killed Amanda Maher is not borne out in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">{\u00b6 120} In Proposition of Law 17, Myers contends that the court\u2019s instructions on reasonable doubt during both phases of trial, based on the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>definition of R.C. 2901.05, constitute reversible error. However, use of the statutory definition of reasonable doubt in jury instructions has been uniformly upheld. See, e.g., <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, paragraph eight of the syllabus; <em>State v. Moore </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 22, 37, 689 N.E.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">{\u00b6 121} In Proposition of Law 23, Myers asserts that the instruction on purpose and intent improperly shifted the burden of proof to the accused. Myers further contends that including the term \u201cforeseeable\u201d in the instruction essentially undercut the requirement that the jury find specific intent to cause the death.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">{\u00b6 122} Myers\u2019s claims of error are not well taken. A very similar instruction on causation was upheld in <em>State v. Jalowiec </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 220, 230-231, 744 N.E.2d 163. Moreover, the court properly instructed the jury on purpose and intent before the instruction on causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">{\u00b6 123} The overall charge clearly indicated that the burden was on the state to prove specific intent to kill, and that the jury was required to find specific intent to kill before it could convict Myers of aggravated murder. Also, the court\u2019s instruction on purpose and causation was similar to the instructions upheld in <em>State v. Burchfield </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 261, 611 N.E.2d 819, and <em>State v. Frazier </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 323, 331, 652 N.E.2d 1000. Including the term \u201cforeseeable\u201d in the instruction did not constitute reversible error because other instructions given by the trial court limited any prejudicial effect. <em>State v. Getsy </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 180, 196, 702 N.E.2d 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">\n<em>Gruesome Photographs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">{\u00b6 124} Myers argues in Proposition of Law 25 that he was prejudiced by the admission of 45 cumulative and gruesome photographs of the victim\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">{\u00b6 125} Under Evid.R. 403 and 611(A), the admission of photographs is left to a trial court\u2019s sound discretion. <em>State v. Landrum </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 107, 121, 559 N.E.2d 710; <em>Maurer, </em>15 Ohio St.3d at 264, 15 OBR 379, 473 N.E.2d 768. Nonrepetitive photographs in a capital case, even if gruesome, are admissible if the probative value of each photograph outweighs the danger of material prejudice to the accused. Id. at paragraph seven of the syllabus; <em>State v. Morales </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 252, 257-258, 513 N.E.2d 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">{\u00b6 126} Myers did not object to the admission of any photograph during the guilt phase and, therefore, has waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Williams </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 112, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-12\">{\u00b6 127} Nine of the photographs admitted were of Maher\u2019s naked body, three depicted wounds to her forehead, fifteen showed her facial wounds, five portrayed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>injuries to her neck, seven were of the removal of the stones from her vaginal canal through her abdomen, and six showed injuries on her arms and legs.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">{\u00b6 128} All of the photos illustrated the coroner\u2019s testimony describing Maher\u2019s injuries and helped to prove the killer\u2019s intent and the lack of accident or mistake. These photos also gave the jury an \u201cappreciation of the nature and circumstances of the crimes.\u201d <em>State v. Evans </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 231, 251, 586 N.E.2d 1042. Nine of the photographs appear to be duplicative of other autopsy photographs. However, these repetitive photographs did not affect the outcome of Myers\u2019s trial. Nor did the trial court commit error by admitting the other 36 photographs since the probative value of each one outweighed any prejudicial impact. Likewise, no abuse of discretion is apparent in the admission of a limited number of the original 45 photographs during the mitigation phase, even though Myers did object to their admission. Proposition of Law 25 is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">\n<em>'Victim-Impact Statement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">{\u00b6 129} In Proposition of Law 19, Myers contends that the trial court committed per se constitutional error during the sentencing hearing in considering the victim-impact statement from Maher\u2019s family that included a statement that Myers \u201cshould pay for that [the murder] with his own life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">{\u00b6 130} After the jury had recommended death and been discharged, the trial court convened the sentencing hearing on March 1,1996. The court stated that it had received and reviewed a victim-impact statement from Maher\u2019s family. The court then stated that \u201cthe statement has not provided any information that would in any way affect the Court\u2019s decision in this case. However, the Court is aware and very aware of the information contained in the victim impact statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">{\u00b6 131} Absent an indication that the trial court considered the victim-impact evidence in arriving at its sentencing decision, the admission of such evidence is not reversible error. <em>Fautenberry, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 438, 650 N.E.2d 878. Moreover, this court will presume that a trial court considered only the relevant, material, and competent evidence in arriving at its judgment, unless the contrary affirmatively appears from the record. <em>State v. Dennis </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 421, 433, 683 N.E.2d 1096; <em>State v. Clemons </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 438, 448, 696 N.E.2d 1009.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-11\">{\u00b6 132} In our view, the trial judge clearly stated that the victim-impact statement provided nothing \u201cthat would in any way affect the Court\u2019s decision in this case.\u201d Moreover, the fact that the court further observed that it was \u201cvery aware\u201d of the contents of the victim-impact statement does not suggest that the court considered the family\u2019s sentencing recommendation in arriving at its sentencing decision. Therefore, we overrule Proposition of Law 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>\n<em>Right of Allocution</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">{\u00b6 133} In Proposition of Law 24, Myers submits that he was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s denial of his right of allocution provided under Crim.R. 32(A)(1). Myers asserts that he was improperly denied the opportunity to rebut the relevance of the information in the victim-impact statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">{\u00b6 134} Crim.R. 32(A) provides that before imposing sentence in a criminal trial, the trial court shall \u201caddress the defendant personally and ask if he or she wishes to make a statement in his or her own behalf or present any information in mitigation of punishment.\u201d This court has noted that the penalty phase in a capital case is not a substitute for defendant\u2019s right of allocution. <em>State v. Reynolds </em>(1998), 80 Ohio St.3d 670, 684, 687 N.E.2d 1358. However, in <em>Reynolds, </em>we found no prejudicial error in the trial court\u2019s failure to ask the defendant whether he wished to make a statement, because that defendant had already made an unsworn statement, and presented a personal letter to the court during the mitigation phase, and had defense counsel make a statement on his behalf. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">{\u00b6 135} Recently, we held the provisions of Crim.R. 32(A) to be mandatory in both capital and noncapital cases, absent invited error or harmless error. <em>State v. Campbell </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 320, 738 N.E.2d 1178, paragraph two of the syllabus. The trial court\u2019s failure to personally address Myers prior to sentencing and allow him to make a statement constituted error under <em>Reynolds </em>and <em>Campbell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">{\u00b6 136} However, similar to <em>Reynolds, </em>the defendant here exercised the right to speak on his own behalf during the mitigation phase and subjected himself to cross-examination. This testimony encompassed over 200 pages of the mitigation phase transcript. Among other things, Myers testified that the jury was wrong because he did not commit the murder, and that anyone who implicated him in the murder was lying.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">{\u00b6 137} Thus, since Myers did in fact personally appeal for his life before the trial judge through his sworn testimony, the court\u2019s failure to specifically advise him of his right of allocution prior to sentencing was harmless error under <em>Reynolds </em>and <em>Campbell. </em>Accordingly, Proposition of Law 24 is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">\n<em>Readmission of Trial Exhibits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b566-11\">{\u00b6 138} Myers claims in Proposition of Law 32 that the trial court erred in readmitting trial exhibits during the mitigation phase. Myers\u2019s failure to raise this issue before the court of appeals waives it before this court. <em>State v. Williams, </em>51 Ohio St.2d 112, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364, paragraph two of the syllabus. In any event, the trial court may properly allow repetition of much or all that occurred in the guilt phase pursuant to R.C. 2929.03(D)(1). <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number><em>DePew </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 275, 282-283, 528 N.E.2d 542; <em>State v. Woodard </em>(1993), 68 Ohio St.3d 70, 78, 623 N.E.2d 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">{\u00b6 139} Here, the prosecution offered a \u201cpared-down list\u201d of trial exhibits to be readmitted during the mitigation phase. A reduced number of photographs were offered for readmission and the trial court allowed both sides to argue for or against readmission before it admitted the photographs during the mitigation phase. Given the court\u2019s careful consideration of which trial exhibits were to be readmitted, Myers\u2019s claims of prejudice are not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">\n<em>Prosecutorial Misconduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">{\u00b6 140} In Proposition of Law 5, Myers alleges that the prosecution engaged in misconduct during closing argument of both phases of trial and thereby deprived him of a fair trial. However, whether improper remarks constitute prosecutorial misconduct requires analysis as to (1) whether the remarks were improper and (2) if so, whether the remarks prejudicially affected the accused\u2019s substantial rights. <em>State v. Smith </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14, 14 OBR 317, 470 N.E.2d 883. The touchstone of analysis \u201cis the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.\u201d <em>Smith v. Phillips </em>(1982), 455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">{\u00b6 141} Myers first complains that the state improperly argued to the jury that he was guilty due to his alleged bad acts and character traits. Myers cites comments by the prosecutor that his prior sexual battery plea was relevant to this case, that he told Tincher that he had inserted three rocks into a woman\u2019s vagina, and that he told Deputy Adkins that \u201ccocaine will make you do anything to get it.\u201d However, Myers\u2019s failure to object to these comments waived all but plain error. Moreover, the comments cited by Myers constituted fair comment on evidence properly admitted at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">{\u00b6 142} Myers next submits that the prosecutor argued that he was guilty due to his association with criminals. Here, the prosecutor reminded the jury about the testimony of jailhouse informant David Tincher. The comment that \u201c|i]fs the kind of man that David Myers would talk to\u201d hardly appears to be a plea to the jury to find Myers guilty because of an association with a criminal. Isolated comments by a prosecutor are not to be taken out of context and given their most damaging meaning. <em>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo </em>(1974), 416 U.S. 637, 647, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431; <em>State v. Hill </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 195, 204, 661 N.E.2d 1068.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-11\">{\u00b6 143} Myers also cites a comment by the prosecutor on the fact that Myers drove a railroad spike into Maher\u2019s head: \u201cThis establishes pure unadulterated intent to kill. That\u2019s not even an issue in this case.\u201d Again, Myers did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>object. We find that the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury that it was required to find specific intent to kill ameliorated any potential error.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">{\u00b6 144} Next, Myers cites five instances where he claims that the prosecutor misrepresented critical facts during closing argument or misstated the testimony of witnesses. Myers failed to object to any of these alleged misstatements. Moreover, all of the complained-of comments were fair inferences that could be drawn by the jury, based on the testimony of the state\u2019s witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">{\u00b6 145} Myers also contends that the prosecutor improperly appealed to the jurors\u2019 emotions: \u201cAmanda had no justice in those last moments of her life. Now, in death, she asks for justice in her absence. * * * Surely on August 4th, 1988, Amanda Maher\u2019s time to die had not arrived.\u201d While these comments were theatrical, the prosecution is entitled to a certain degree of latitude in summation. <em>State v. Liberatore </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 583, 589, 23 O.O.3d 489, 433 N.E.2d 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">{\u00b6 146} Myers claims that the prosecutor improperly denigrated defense counsel by commenting that the evidence presented by defense counsel \u201cin some cases * * * was almost a snow job.\u201d This isolated, unobjected-to comment, however, was only marginally denigrating, and was not close in scope or scale to the comments we found improper in <em>State v. Keenan </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 402, 405-406, 613 N.E.2d 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">{\u00b6 147} Next, Myers contends that the prosecutor improperly argued non-statutory aggravating factors during penalty-phase closing argument. Myers points out that the prosecutor argued that the jury had to \u201cdetermine what mitigation in this case is present that you find to stack up against the aggravating circumstance, namely the nature and circumstances <em>of this particular crime, the robbery, </em>* * * <em>aggravated robbery specification.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) We have held that prosecutors cannot argue that the nature and circumstances of an <em>offense </em>are aggravating circumstances. <em>State v. Wogenstahl </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 344, 662 N.E.2d 311, paragraph two of the syllabus. On the other hand, the jury is required to consider the nature and circumstances of the <em>aggravating circumstances. </em>See, e.g., <em>State v. Stojetz </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 452, 464, 705 N.E.2d 329; R.C. 2929.03(D)(1). The comments here are ambiguous and may have been improper under <em>Wogenstahl. </em>However, any such error was, in our view, isolated, harmless, and not outcome-determinative. <em>Long, </em>53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">{\u00b6 148} Other comments cited by Myers as arguing nonstatutory aggravating factors do not appear improper: \u201c[Y]ou can\u2019t tolerate crimes of this nature * * * when the facts show the reckless indifference for human life the Defendant has shown\u201d and his actions \u201creflected his utter disregard for her life.\u201d The comments that \u201cyou must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt, as you understand that phrase to be defined, that the aggravating circumstance, the robbery, the nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>of what went into the robbery, is more important than the mitigating factors\u201d and \u201c[n]o mitigating evidence presented can possibly overcome the brutality of [Myers\u2019s] actions\u201d were not improper. Prosecutors can urge the merits of their cause and legitimately argue that defense mitigation is worthy of little or no weight. <em>State v. Wilson </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 381, 399, 659 N.E.2d 292. Nor did the prosecutor improperly argue that Myers\u2019s prior sexual battery of Reagin was an aggravating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">{\u00b6 149} Myers next asserts that the prosecutor stated his personal opinions during closing argument: \u201c[Myers\u2019s testimony] doesn\u2019t add up. * * * It\u2019s not credible. He is dishonest, manipulative, controlling\u201d; \u201cany punk with a weapon * * * can take a person\u2019s life like that.\u201d The expression of personal beliefs by a prosecutor is improper. <em>State v. Lott </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 166, 555 N.E.2d 293. Yet, it is difficult for prosecutors to argue vigorously for the death penalty without making what might arguably be statements of personal opinion. This court may excuse what can be characterized as opinions of the prosecutor if the opinions are based on the evidence. See, e.g., <em>State v. Durr </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 86, 96, 568 N.E.2d 674. We believe that none of the cited comments here constitutes plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">{\u00b6 150} Nor did the prosecutor improperly argue to the jury concerning victim impact. Even if statements that \u201cit was frightful for [Maher] in her last moments\u201d were improper, our independent review will cure the effect of such errors. <em>Landrum, </em>53 Ohio St.3d at 124, 559 N.E.2d 710. We reject Proposition of Law 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-8\">\n<em>Effective Assistance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">{\u00b6 151} In Proposition of Law 22, Myers argues that both trial counsel and appellate counsel rendered ineffective assistance. Reversal of a conviction for ineffective assistance of counsel requires that the defendant show, first, that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and, second, that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense so as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial. <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Accord <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph two of the syllabus. The same standard is used to determine whether appellate counsel performed ineffectively. <em>Watson, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 16, 572 N.E.2d 97. However, Myers does not demonstrate prejudice, i.e., \u201ca reasonable probability that, were it not for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the trial would have been different.\u201d <em>Bradley, </em>supra, at paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">{\u00b6 152} Myers first claims ineffective assistance in counsel\u2019s failure to cross-examine Debbie Reagin, who accused Myers of raping her in 1986. However, counsel\u2019s decision not to cross-examine may well have been part of their trial strategy. Counsel likely determined that cross-examining Reagin would risk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>bolstering or emphasizing her testimony rather than impeaching it. We will ordinarily refrain from second-guessing strategic decisions counsel make at trial, even where counsel\u2019s trial strategy was questionable. <em>State v. Clayton </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 45, 49, 16 O.O.3d 35, 402 N.E.2d 1189.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">{\u00b6 153} Myers next claims that counsel were ineffective in stipulating to the admission of his civil deposition. Yet, this also appears to be a matter of trial strategy. By admitting the deposition, the defense underscored its position that Myers was not the killer and that Myers sought to redress the accusation of guilt through a civil action. As we noted under Proposition of Law 28, the fact that Myers had nightmares after the murder could be attributed to the defense position that Myers was unjustly indicted for a murder he did not commit. Moreover, defense counsel was able to get the court to redact portions of the deposition concerning Myers\u2019s drug use. While counsel should have objected to the portions of the deposition concerning Myers\u2019s teenage paternity and psychiatric condition, that failure to object did not unfairly prejudice Myers.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">{\u00b6 154} Myers also complains of counsel\u2019s failure to object to improper remarks during closing arguments at both phases of trial. However, a reasonable attorney may decide not to interrupt his opponent\u2019s closing argument. <em>State v. Keene </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 646, 668, 693 N.E.2d 246. Objections can \u201c \u2018disrupt the flow of a trial\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018are considered technical and bothersome by the fact-finder.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Campbell </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 38, 53, 630 N.E.2d 339, quoting Jacobs, Ohio Evidence (1989) iii-iv. A decision not to interrupt during closing arguments reflects an \u201cobjective standard of reasonable representation.\u201d <em>Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">{\u00b6 155} Myers complains that counsel\u2019s guilt-phase closing argument overemphasized the issue of capital punishment. This emphasis, however, does not constitute deficient performance. A review of the instances cited by Myers reveals that counsel apparently tried to persuade the jurors of the gravity of their task and the consequences of a guilty verdict for his client. In our view, this was in the nature of trial strategy, not an undermining of Myers\u2019s right to a presumption of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">{\u00b6 156} Myers also asserts that counsel failed to fully cross-examine Dr. Krause as to when he formed his opinion that fingernail impressions on Maher\u2019s neck were consistent with the assailant\u2019s having an injury to his ring finger and that, as a result, the jurors were left ignorant on this point, which affected their ability to assess Krause\u2019s conclusion. However, the jury was aware that Krause\u2019s opinion in this vein was formed after the coroner\u2019s verdict since defense counsel elicited this information from Krause during recross. No deficient performance is demonstrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>{\u00b6 157} Myers next claims that counsel were deficient in failing to object to a biased grand jury. Yet, as discussed under Proposition of Law 20, Myers fails to adequately demonstrate bias or fear on the part of the one grand juror or that the grand juror had influenced the rest of the panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">{\u00b6 158} Contrary to Myers\u2019s next assertion, counsel\u2019s failure to \u201clife qualify\u201d the jury during voir dire does not constitute deficient performance. As discussed under Proposition of Law 29, examination of the voir dire transcript reveals that no \u201cautomatic\u201d death-penalty juror was seated on the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">{\u00b6 159} Myers was not prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to object to gruesome photographs. As we noted under Proposition of Law 25, all of the photographs admitted illustrated the coroner\u2019s testimony and helped prove intent and a lack of accident or mistake. Although some photographs were repetitive, their admission and counsel\u2019s failure to object to them did not affect the outcome of Myers\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">{\u00b6 160} Counsel\u2019s failure to object to the victim-impact statement at sentencing did not prejudice Myers. The trial judge declared that the statement \u201chas not provided any information that would in any way affect the Court\u2019s decision in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">{\u00b6 161} Myers next contends that counsel were deficient in withdrawing their objection to photographs depicting Myers wearing the shirt with the inscription \u201cLover Boy.\u201d However, the photographs were admissible because they portrayed Myers exactly as he appeared to witnesses in the hours leading up to the murder. Similarly, Myers also failed to raise before the court of appeals counsel\u2019s failure to (1) challenge the probation detainer, (2) offer the testimony of Kim Grimes, or (3) retain Robert Young as a blood-spatter expert. Even if these issues had been raised in the court of appeals, we find that Myers has not demonstrated prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">{\u00b6 162} As we intimated under Proposition of Law 24, counsel\u2019s failure to secure Myers\u2019s right of allocution was harmless error, since he had already testified at length during the mitigation phase. See <em>Campbell, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 325, 738 N.E.2d 1178.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">{\u00b6 163} Likewise, counsel\u2019s failure to object to the reasonable doubt instruction made no difference, since we have repeatedly upheld similar instructions in capital cases. (See discussion under Proposition of Law 27.) Myers was not prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to object to the readmission of trial exhibits during the mitigation phase. (See discussion under Proposition of Law 32.)</p>\n<p id=\"b571-12\">{\u00b6 164} Myers\u2019s assertion of ineffective assistance based on defense counsel\u2019s failure to appeal the state\u2019s entry of the nolle prosequi is patently absurd. The <em>nolle prosequi </em>dismissed the murder charges against Myers and reopened the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>investigation of the Maher murder. Counsel should not be second-guessed for failing to foresee a future indictment of Myers and the speedy-trial implications of the failure to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">{\u00b6 165} Finally, Myers has not demonstrated prejudice in appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise assignments of error that (1) the trial court erred in not accepting the <em>nolle prosequi </em>in \u201copen court,\u201d (2) the trial court abused Myers\u2019s right of confrontation in refusing to order the state to provide proper addresses of witnesses, and (3) the trial court\u2019s failure to inform the jury that a solitary juror could prevent imposition of a death sentence. Given the record of this case, none of these allegations would have compelled a reversal of Myers\u2019s convictions or death sentence by the court of appeals. Thus, we also reject Myers\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">{\u00b6 166} Based on all the foregoing, we overrule Proposition of Law 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">\n<em>Constitutionality</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">{\u00b6 167} In Propositions of Law 26, 27, 28, 30, and 31, Myers challenges Ohio\u2019s death penalty statutes on numerous constitutional grounds. We summarily reject these challenges. See, e.g., <em>Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264; <em>State v. McNeill </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 438, 453, 700 N.E.2d 596; <em>Maurer, </em>15 Ohio St.3d 239, 15 OBR 379, 473 N.E.2d 768; <em>State v. Gumm </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 413, 653 N.E.2d 253; <em>State v. Poindexter </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 520 N.E.2d 568, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">INDEPENDENT REVIEW AND PROPORTIONALITY</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">{\u00b6 168} At the mitigation hearing, Myers testified at length and subjected himself to cross-examination. He maintained his innocence in the murder of Amanda Maher and asserted that those witnesses who had testified against him had been lying. However, Myers did declare that he has \u201cgrown a great deal in the Lord since the summer of \u201988,\u201d and considered himself \u201cvery immature\u201d in the past by indulging in alcohol and drugs. He claimed that he had stopped using cocaine on July 18, 1988, and tried to get into a rehabilitation program because a close friend had overdosed and nearly died a few days earlier. Myers stated that he was not a good husband but considers himself to be a good ex-husband. He also claimed innocence in the sexual battery of Reagin and asserted that she was drunk and coming on to him. He further claimed that the prosecutor was out to get him. On cross-examination, Myers stated that before July 1988, he had a $500-a-day cocaine habit that was financed largely by transporting the drug for dealers.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">{\u00b6 169} Also testifying on Myers\u2019s behalf were several relatives, including his mother, Ruth Myers. Mrs. Myers recounted that Myers is one of five children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>and that her husband, a welder, died in 1989. Although Myers repeated eighth grade, he graduated from high school. Myers\u2019s first marriage produced two daughters, but ended in divorce in 1988. However, his ex-wife brings the children to visit Myers and the family, and keeps in contact with them. Ruth Myers also noted that Myers fathered a child as a teenager, and paid child support for the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">{\u00b6 170} Myers\u2019s current spouse, Sandra Myers, also testified. She has known Myers since grammar school, but moved to South Carolina with her family when she was 12 years old. She moved back to Ohio in 1993 to be with Myers, and then married Myers \u201c[bjecause I love him.\u201d They regularly attended church together when they could.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">{\u00b6 171} Myers\u2019s sister, Freda Chambliss, offered brief testimony, but only to attempt to establish that an investigator\u2019s description of the suspect\u2019s car did not fit her brother\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">{\u00b6 172} The co-pastor of Myers\u2019s church, Cheryl Gilliland, testified that Myers and his wife Sandy had faithfully attended her church, the Faith Christian Fellowship. She visited Myers several times after his arrest in 1988, and performed the wedding ceremony for Myers and Sandy. Gilliland stated that Myers helped clean the church when it moved to Beavercreek, and was a greeter every fourth Sunday. She noted that Myers contributed a tithe to the church. She also testified that she trusted her children with Myers and considers him a friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">{\u00b6 173} Myers\u2019s ex-wife, Angela Thompson, testified that Myers always sent her money for child support when he was working. Myers loves his daughters and has an excellent relationship with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">{\u00b6 174} The defense presentation during mitigation was essentially a plea to the jury that it had made a mistake when it found that Myers murdered Amanda Maher.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">{\u00b6 175} After independent assessment, we conclude that the evidence proves beyond a reasonable doubt the aggravating circumstance in this case: that Myers murdered Maher during an aggravated robbery (R.C. 2929,04[A][7]).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-12\">{\u00b6 176} The nature and circumstances of the offense offer nothing in mitigation. Myers assured Glenn Smith and Xenia police officers that he would make sure Maher got home after Smith was arrested outside the Round Table bar. A few hours later, police found Maher next to the railroad tracks, naked and barely clinging to life. A railroad spike had been driven into Maher\u2019s right temple and three stones had been shoved into her vagina. Based on the evidence, it appears that Myers robbed and murdered Maher after she resisted his sexual advances.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"a1z-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>William F. Schenck, Greene County Prosecuting Attorney, and Robert K. Hendrix, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b574-11\">Dennis J. Adkins and Suzanne M. Lough Wynn, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b574-3\">{\u00b6 177} Myers\u2019s history, character, and background provide modest features in mitigation. Myers has fathered three children and has an excellent relationship with his two daughters. He paid child support whenever he was working. Myers claims to have overcome his substance abuse problem and to have sought out rehabilitation towards that end. He also became involved with his church in various activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">{\u00b6 178} With regard to the mitigating factors of R.C. 2929.04(B), only the (B)(7) catchall factor is relevant in this case. The love, support, and devotion Myers shares with his family deserve some weight in mitigation. See <em>State v. Eley </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 174, 189, 672 N.E.2d 640. Perhaps some mitigating weight should be accorded to Myers\u2019s recognition of his problems as a husband and as a substance abuser.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">{\u00b6 179} Upon independent weighing, we find that the aggravating circumstance outweighs the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. Myers led Maher to believe that he would help her get home after her boyfriend was arrested, but, instead, he took her to a secluded area, strangled her to unconsciousness, put three stones in her vagina, and drove a railroad spike into her head. He then absconded with Maher\u2019s and Smith\u2019s wallets. Myers\u2019s actions merit the capital penalty to which he was sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">{\u00b6 180} The death penalty in this case is both appropriate and proportionate when compared with capital cases combining murder with aggravated robbery. See, e.g., <em>State v. Green </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 141, 609 N.E.2d 1253; and <em>State v. Palmer </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 543, 687 N.E.2d 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">{\u00b6 181} For these reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b574-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
