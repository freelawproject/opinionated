Kimbro requested the writs to compel appellee, Lorain County Common Pleas Court Judge Kosma J. Glavas, to issue findings of fact and conclusions of law on the denial of his motion to vacate his judgment of conviction. He attached an affidavit in which he stated, \u201cIn the last five (5) years, plaintiff has filed one civil petition in this Honorable Court under Kimbro v. Medders, Case No. 01CV128533, however, said action was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>dismissed for failure to prosecute an appeal.\u201d The court of appeals dismissed the complaint because Kimbro failed to comply with R.C. 2969.25(A).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ajo\">Nathaniel Kimbro, pro se.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">{\u00b6 2} In his appeal as of right, Kimbro claims that the court of appeals erred because his complaint complied with R.C. 2969.25(A). But a review of his complaint establishes that Kimbro did not attach the affidavit required by R.C. 2969.25(A)(1), which specifies that the affidavit contain a \u201cbrief description of the nature of the civil action or appeal.\u201d Kimbro\u2019s notation of one case failed to contain a sufficient description of the \u201cnature of the civil action or appeal.\u201d Kimbro specifies only that it was an appeal of a \u201ccivil petition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">{\u00b6 3} And Kimbro fails to assert that he has not filed any civil actions in the previous five years or that R.C. 2969.25(A) is otherwise inapplicable. Therefore, the court of appeals properly dismissed his complaint. See <em>State ex rel. Akbar-El v. Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 210, 761 N.E.2d 624; <em>State ex rel. White v. Mack </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 572, 573, 757 N.E.2d 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">{\u00b6 4} Moreover, contrary to Kimbro\u2019s contentions on appeal, sua sponte dismissal of his complaint without notice, while not generally permissible, was appropriate here because his complaint was obviously devoid of merit. <em>State ex rel. Peeples v. Anderson </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 559, 560, 653 N.E.2d 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">{\u00b6 5} Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b406-10\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
