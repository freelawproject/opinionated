XVIII, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Western Division, has certified to this court the following question of state law:</p>\n<p id=\"b681-13\">{\u00b6 2} \u201cCan an oral contract constitute a \u2018security\u2019 as that term is defined in Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 1707.01(B)?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-14\">{\u00b6 3} This court answers \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b681-16\">{\u00b6 4} In its certification order, the district court set forth the following description of the federal action:</p>\n<p id=\"b681-17\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cThe plaintiffs [respondents here] allege that the defendants [petitioners here] induced them to invest funds in a series of business opportunities, in which the defendants would advance the plaintiffs\u2019 funds to a certain third party who would use the funds to purchase goods at a discount and then resell the goods at a profit. This profit would be used to pay back to the plaintiffs their principal plus profit. The plaintiffs allege that, contrary to the defendants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>representations to them, there were no such business opportunities, the defendants had not performed adequate due diligence on any such opportunities, the defendants did not monitor the investment transactions, and the third party was not conducting a prospering and expanding business. The plaintiffs allege that they suffered significant financial losses as a result of the defendants\u2019 conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe plaintiffs filed the instant proceeding in the certifying Court on January 31, 2001. They seek to recover compensatory and punitive damages for the allegedly unlawful conduct of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cCounts Five, Six, and Seven of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint allege that the defendants\u2019 conduct violated Ohio securities law. The defendants have moved to dismiss those counts, arguing that they never sold any written certificates or instruments to the plaintiffs and therefore did not sell \u2018securities\u2019 within the meaning of Ohio\u2019s securities laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cThe certified question appears to be one for which there is no controlling precedent in the decisions of the Ohio Supreme Court. It is a question of determinative importance in this litigation. It is not fact-specific.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">{\u00b6 11} We look to the text of R.C. 1707.01(B) that defines \u201csecurity\u201d to decide whether an oral agreement can qualify as one. The petitioners point us to the clause \u201c \u2018[s]ecurity\u2019 means any certificate or instrument\u201d in the first sentence of the text as excluding oral contracts. The respondents counter that because the General Assembly listed \u201cany investment contract\u201d among examples of securities in the second sentence of the text, oral contracts qualify as securities.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-12\">{\u00b6 12} The entire subsection reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b682-13\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c <em>\u2018Security\u2019 means any certificate or instrument </em>that represents title to or interest in, or is secured by any lien or charge upon, the capital, assets, profits, property, or credit of any person or of any public or governmental body, subdivision, or agency. <em>It includes </em>shares of stock, certificates for shares of stock, membership interests in limited liability companies, voting-trust certificates, warrants and options to purchase securities, subscription rights, interim receipts, interim certificates, promissory notes, all forms of commercial paper, evidences of indebtedness, bonds, debentures, land trust certificates, fee certificates, leasehold certificates, syndicate certificates, endowment certificates, certificates or written instruments in or under profit-sharing or participation agreements or in or under oil, gas, or mining leases, or certificates or written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>instruments of any interest in or under the same, receipts evidencing preorgani-zation or reorganization subscriptions, preorganization certificates, reorganization certificates, certificates evidencing an interest in any trust or pretended trust, <em>any investment contract, </em>any life settlement interest, any instrument evidencing a promise or an agreement to pay money, warehouse receipts for intoxicating liquor, and the currency of any government other than those of the United States and Canada, but sections 1707.01 to 1707.45 of the Revised Code do not apply to the sale of real estate.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">{\u00b6 14} In past decisions we have explained that when addressing issues of statutory meaning, \u201c[[legislative intent is the preeminent consideration in construing a statute. To determine the legislative intent, we first review the statutory language. In reviewing the statutory language, we accord the words used their usual, normal, or customary meaning.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State ex rel. Wolfe v. Delaware Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 182, 184, 724 N.E.2d 771. See, also, <em>State ex rel. Purdy v. Clermont Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 338, 340, 673 N.E.2d 1351; <em>State ex rel. Hawkins v. Pickaway Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 275, 277, 662 N.E.2d 17; R.C. 1.42. Both \u201ccertificate\u201d and \u201cinstrument\u201d usually and customarily mean some form of writing. A \u201ccertificate\u201d is \u201c[a] <em>document </em>in which a fact is formally attested\u201d or \u201c[a] <em>document </em>certifying the bearer\u2019s status or authorization to act in a specified way.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed.1999) 218. An \u201cinstrument\u201d is \u201c[a] <em>written legal document </em>that defines rights, duties, entitlements, or liabilities.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at 801. And a \u201cdocument\u201d is \u201c[something <em>tangible </em>on which words, symbols, or marks are recorded.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">{\u00b6 15} The respondents argue, however, that because the General Assembly employed examples in the second sentence to <em>elaborate </em>on the definition in the first sentence, the \u201ccertificate or instrument\u201d requirement does not constrain the broad range of securities embraced by the phrase \u201cany investment contract.\u201d But the structure and wording of the statute belie this argument. We adopt instead the rationale of the petitioners that the first clause of the first sentence establishes the core definition of \u201csecurity\u201d and that the succeeding list of examples cannot be read to expand that core definition. See, e.g., <em>Emery v. So-Soft of Ohio, Inc. </em>(1964), 94 Ohio Law Abs. 357, 366, 199 N.E.2d 120, 124-125 (\u201cIn determining whether a certificate or instrument comprises one or more of the various classifications of securities set out in the latter provisions of Section 1707.01(B), Revised Code, that portion must be interpreted with an eye to the first sentence\u201d). We interpret the list of examples in the second sentence as providing specific examples of what <em>forms </em>such securities, as defined by the first sentence, may take. Accordingly, the inclusion of the example \u201cany investment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>contract\u201d merely confirms that the definition includes \u201cany certificate or instrument that represents\u201d \u201cany investment contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">{\u00b6 16} The respondents also argue that petitioners\u2019 view fails to account for the repeated use of \u201cwritten,\u201d \u201ccertificate,\u201d and \u201cinstruments\u201d in the list of examples. If the drafters intended the first sentence to overlay the examples, the respondents argue, it is redundant to include those words again in the list of examples itself. We reject this position because it reads the list of examples as taking no meaning from the first sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">{\u00b6 17} Further, the respondents\u2019 reading of R.C. 1707.01(B) gains no additional traction with their argument that because federal law does not limit securities to written certificates and instruments, Ohio\u2019s \u201cbroader\u201d securities law follows suit. The statutes upon which the respondents rely for the federal definitions of \u201csecurity\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> do not include Ohio\u2019s core definition. And that core definition is what decides this issue. Compare R.C. 1707.01(B) with Sections 77b(a)(l) and 78c(a)(10), Title 15, U.S.Code. Although federal securities law can inform Ohio securities law, see <em>In re Columbus Skyline Securities, Inc. </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 495, 498, 660 N.E.2d 427, we do not consult federal law in the absence of ambiguity and analogous statutes or statutory reference to federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>{\u00b6 18} Likewise, we discount the respondents\u2019 third argument, which urges the court to weigh the public policy in favor of treating oral contracts as securities. Given that we view the statutory language and the structure of R.C. 1707.01(B) as dictating our decision, the statute is not ambiguous and we have no cause to consider the consequences of a particular construction. See R.C. 1.49.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">{\u00b6 19} For the foregoing reasons, we advise the federal district court that an oral contract cannot constitute a \u201csecurity\u201d as the General Assembly has defined that term in R.C. 1707.01(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">Decision accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b685-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b685-10\">Lundberg Stratton, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b684-7\">. {\u00b6 a} Both federal statutes contain a broader definition of a security that, unlike Ohio\u2019s statute, does not confine a security to a written document. Section 77b(a)(l), Title 15, U.S.Code provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">{Kb} \u201cThe term \u2018security\u2019 means any note, stock, treasury stock, security future, bond, debenture, evidence of indebtedness, certificate of interest or participation in any profit-sharing agreement, collateral-trust certificate, preorganization certificate or subscription, transferable share, investment contract, voting-trust certificate, certificate of deposit for a security, fractional undivided interest in oil, gas, or other mineral rights, any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege on any security, certificate of deposit, or group or index of securities (including any interest therein or based on the value thereof), or any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege entered into on a national securities exchange relating to foreign currency, or, in general, any interest or instrument commonly known as a \u2018security\u201d, or any certificate of interest or participation in, temporary or interim certificate for, receipt for, guarantee of, or warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">{\u00b6 c} Section 78c(a)(10), Title 15, U.S.Code provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">{\u00b6 d} \u201cThe term \u2018security\u201d means any note, stock, treasury stock, security future, bond, debenture, certificate of interest or participation in any profit-sharing agreement or in any oil, gas, or other mineral royalty or lease, any collateral-trust certificate, preorganization certificate or subscription, transferable share, investment contract, voting-trust certificate, certificate of deposit for a security, any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege on any security, certificate of deposit, or group or index of securities (including any interest therein or based on the value thereof), or any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege entered into on a national securities exchange relating to foreign currency, or in general, any instrument commonly known as a \u2018security\u2019; or any certificate of interest or participation in, temporary or interim certificate for, receipt for, or warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing; but shall not include currency or any note, draft, bill of exchange, or banker\u2019s acceptance which has a maturity at the time of issuance of not exceeding nine months, exclusive of days of grace, or any renewal thereof the maturity of which is likewise . limited.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b685-11\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AAH\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-12\">{\u00b6 20} I believe that an oral investment contract is a security as that term is defined in R.C. 1707.01(B). Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-13\">{\u00b6 21} The majority holds that the first sentence of R.C. 1707.01(B) \u2014 \u201c \u2018Security\u2019 means any <em>certificate </em>or <em>instrument </em>that represents title to or interest in, or is secured by any lien or charge upon, the capital, assets, profits, property, or credit of any person or of any public or governmental body, subdivision, or agency\u201d \u2014 indicates that all securities listed in R.C. 1707.01(B) must be in writing. (Emphasis added.) The language of R.C. 1707.01(B) belies that conclusion. For example, the list includes \u201cshares of stock\u201d and <em>\u201ccertificates </em>for shares of stock,\u201d \u201csubscription rights\u201d and <em>\u201creceipts </em>evidencing * * * subscriptions,\u201d and \u201cmembership in limited liability companies\u201d and <em>\u201ccertificates </em>or <em>written instruments </em>in or under profit-sharing or participation agreements.\u201d The General Assembly\u2019s use of the words \u201cwritten,\u201d \u201ccertificates,\u201d and \u201cinstruments\u201d to describe certain securities while not using them to describe others indicates its deliberate inclusion of some securities that are required to be in writing and some that are not. If the opening definition required all items to be in writing, there would be no need to modify certain examples as needing to be written. Specifically, there is no indication that \u201cinvestment contracts\u201d must be in writing. On the contrary, R.C. 1707.01(B) includes <em>\u201cany </em>investment contract.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b685-14\">{\u00b622} The majority\u2019s interpretation of R.C. 1707.01(B) ignores the word \u201cany\u201d as it is used to describe the term \u201cinvestment contract\u201d therein. In matters of construction \u201cit is the duty of this court to give effect to the words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>used [in a statute], not to delete words used or to insert words not used.\u201d <em>Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co. v. Cleveland </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 50, 524 N.E.2d 441, paragraph three of the syllabus. The word \u201cany\u201d is defined as \u201cone indifferently out of more than two.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third International Dictionary (1986) 97; see, also, <em>Motor Cargo, Inc. v. Richfield Twp. Bd. of Trustees </em>(1953), 52 O.O. 257, 259, 117 N.E.2d 224 (the word \u201cany\u201d means \u201cevery\u201d or \u201call\u201d). Thus, I believe that the General Assembly\u2019s use of the word \u201cany\u201d to modify the term \u201cinvestment contract\u201d indicates that the term \u201cinvestment contract\u201d is not limited to written contracts only, but includes oral contracts as well.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aq7\">Squire, Sanders &amp; Dempsey, L.L.P., Mark J. Ruehlmann, Gregory A. Ruehl-mann and Pierre H. Bergeron, for respondents.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b686-8\">Yorys, Sater, Seymour &amp; Pease, L.L.P., Glenn V. Whitaker and Phillip J. Smith; and Coolidge, Wall, Womsley &amp; Lombard and Roger J. Makley, for petitioners.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"b686-9\">Betty D. Montgomery, Attorney General, David M. Gormley, State Solicitor, Michael R. Gladman and Robert L. Strayer, Assistant Solicitors, as amicus curiae in favor of respondents.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">{\u00b6 23} Finally, I believe that the purpose of the General Assembly also indicates that it intended the term \u201cany investment contract\u201d to include oral investment contracts. The purpose of the Ohio Securities Act is to protect the public from fraudulent investments. <em>In re Columbus Skyline Securities, Inc. </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 495, 498, 660 N.E.2d 427. To hold that an oral investment transaction is not a security and thus not covered by the Securities Act merely because of its form defeats the purpose of protecting the public. I do not believe that the General Assembly meant to permit scam artists to circumvent the securities law by keeping their offer in oral form only.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">{\u00b6 24} Accordingly, I believe that an oral investment contract is a security within the definition of R.C. 1707.01(B). Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
