Moulton buys propane on the wholesale market and has it delivered to its retail and satellite facilities by independent tanker truck. The retail and satellite facilities are equipped with one or more above-ground cylindrical bulk tanks mounted on concrete piers. The bulk tanks range in size from 18,000 to 40,000 gallons. Moulton attempts to balance its daily deliveries from suppliers with its daily deliveries to customers so that only a small amount of propane is actually stored in the bulk tanks for more than a day.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-14\">{\u00b6 2} Moulton pumps the liquid propane from its bulk tanks to tanks mounted on its delivery trucks through a specialized arrangement of pipes, pumps, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>valves. Moulton\u2019s delivery trucks, referred to as \u201cbobtail trucks,\u201d are straight bed trucks which have been specially outfitted with tanks (\u201cbobtail tanks\u201d) that range in size from 3,000 to 3,500 gallons, along with the pumping and handling equipment necessary to transfer the liquid propane from the tank on the bobtail truck to the customer\u2019s tank.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">{\u00b6 3} Appellant and cross-appellee, Tax Commissioner, issued and affirmed a use tax assessment against Moulton for the audit period July 1, 1993, through June 30, 1996. Moulton appealed the assessment to the Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d), where it contested the assessment of use tax against its purchases of the bulk tanks, the bobtail tanks, equipment used to pump the liquid propane to and from the bobtail tanks, and installation and repair charges related to the bobtail tanks and the bulk tanks. Purchases of the truck chassis on which the bobtail tanks are mounted are not in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">{\u00b6 4} The BTA exempted the bobtail tanks as packages. However, the BTA denied exemption to the bulk tanks as packages or as equipment used in packaging. In addition, the BTA denied Moulton\u2019s claim of exemption for equipment used to pump the liquid propane to and from the bobtail tanks and for labor, parts, and equipment used in connection with the installation and repair of both the bulk tanks and bobtail tanks.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">{\u00b6 5} This cause is now before the court upon an appeal and cross-appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">{\u00b6 6} In his appeal, the Tax Commissioner contests the BTA\u2019s exemption of the bobtail tanks. Moulton cross-appealed, contesting the BTA\u2019s denial of exemption for equipment, installation, and repair charges relating to the bobtail tanks. In addition, Moulton contests the BTA\u2019s denial of exemption for the bulk tanks and for the labor charges and parts used in the installation and repair of the bulk tanks.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">{\u00b6 7} The question presented by the Tax Commissioner\u2019s appeal is whether the storage, use, or consumption in Ohio of the bobtail tanks is exempt under the packaging exemption set forth in R.C. 5739.02(B)(15), as made applicable to the use tax by R.C. 5741.02(C)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">{\u00b6 8} R.C. 5739.02 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c(B) The tax does not apply to the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">{\u00b610} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b257-13\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c(15) Sales * * * to persons engaged in making retail sales * * * of packages, including material, labels, and parts for packages, and of machinery, equipment, and material for use primarily in packaging tangible personal property produced for sale * * * by or on the order of the person doing the packaging, or sold at retad. \u2018Packages\u2019 includes bags, baskets, cartons, crates, boxes, cans, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>bottles, bindings, wrappings, and other similar devices and containers, and \u2018packaging\u2019 means placing therein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">{\u00b6 12} We begin our analysis of this exception by recognizing that there is a presumption that every sale or use of tangible personal property in this state is taxable. In addition, statutes relating to exemption or exception from taxation are to be strictly construed, and one claiming such exemption or exception must affirmatively establish his or her right thereto. <em>Natl. Tube Co. v. Glander </em>(1952), 157 Ohio St. 407, 47 O.O. 313, 105 N.E.2d 648, paragraphs one and two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">{\u00b6 13} In <em>Custom Beverage Packers, Inc. v. Kosydar </em>(1973), 33 Ohio St.2d 68, 73, 62 O.O.2d 417, 294 N.E.2d 672, we stated that the examples of packages set forth in R.C. 5739.02(B)(15) \u201ccircumscribe and contain whatever is packaged. These items may not necessarily fully enclose, but they do restrain movement of the packaged object in more than one plane of direction.\u201d However, in <em>Cole Natl. Corp. v. Collins </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St.2d 336, 338, 75 O.O.2d 396, 348 N.E.2d 708, we limited the preceding statement from <em>Custom Beverage Packers, </em>stating that although <em>Custom Beverage Packers </em>\u201csets forth an essential characteristic of a package, it does not provide the sole criterion for making such a determination. Not all items that restrict movement in more than one direction are packages.\u201d Thus, while the bobtail tanks restrict the propane\u2019s movement in more than one plane of direction, that is not the sole criterion for determining whether they are packages within the meaning of R.C. 5739.02(B)(15). To be considered a package within the meaning of R.C 5739.02(B)(15), an item must either be included in the specific listing set forth for the term \u201cpackages\u201d in R.C. 5739.02(B)(15) or be includable as \u201cother similar devices and containers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">{\u00b6 14} When there is a listing of specific terms followed by a catchall word or phrase which is linked to the specific terms by the word \u201cother,\u201d and the statute is to be strictly construed, we apply the doctrine of ejusdem generis. In <em>State v. Aspell </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 1, 39 O.O.2d 1, 225 N.E.2d 226, paragraph two of the syllabus we held: \u201cUnder the rule of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>where in a statute terms are first used which are confined to a particular class of objects having well-known and definite features and characteristics, and then afterwards a term having perhaps a broader signification is conjoined, such latter term is, as indicative of legislative intent, to be considered as embracing only things of a similar character as those comprehended by the preceding limited and confined terms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">{\u00b6 15} We have previously considered facts similar to those presented by this case in <em>Southwestern Portland Cement Co. v. Lindley </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 417, 21 O.O.3d 261, 424 N.E.2d 304, where the taxpayer sought exemption for equipment used to convey wet cement from storage cars to trucks and railroad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>cars. The taxpayer contended that the trucks and railroad cars were packages for the wet cement. We rejected the taxpayer\u2019s contention, stating, \u201cA truck or railroad car is not at all similar to the devices listed in R.C. 5739.02(B)(15)\u201d and \u201cthat trucks and railroad cars cannot be termed \u2018packages.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 424, 21 O.O.3d 261, 424 N.E.2d 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">{\u00b6 16} When we consider the items listed in R.C. 5739.02(B)(15) and apply the principle of ejusdem generis, and our holding in <em>Southwestern Portland Cement Co., </em>we find that the bobtail tanks are not similar to the items listed in R.C. 5739.02(B)(15) and, therefore, cannot be considered \u201cpackages\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 5739.02(B)(15).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">{\u00b6 17} In its cross-appeal Moulton contends that its bulk tanks are used to facilitate the shipping and handling of propane and are therefore exempt as packaging equipment under R.C. 5739.02(B)(15). Because we found that the bobtail tanks are not packages within the meaning of R.C. 5739.02(B)(15), the bulk tanks cannot be considered packaging equipment for the bobtail tanks. Therefore, we find that the bulk tanks are not exempt under R.C 5739.02(B)(15) as machinery or equipment used primarily in packaging tangible personal property sold at retail.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">{\u00b6 18} Likewise, because the bobtail tanks and bulk tanks are not packages or packaging equipment, we find Moulton\u2019s remaining contentions regarding the labor charges for installing and repairing the tanks and the equipment used to transfer the propane to and from the tanks to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">{\u00b6 19} Accordingly, we hold that the BTA\u2019s decision exempting the bobtail tanks is unreasonable and unlawful, and we reverse it. We further hold that the BTA\u2019s decision not to exempt the bulk tanks, labor charges for installing and repairing the tanks, and equipment used to transfer propane to and from the tanks is reasonable and lawful, and we affirm it.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">Decision affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b259-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney and Cook, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b259-10\">Pfeifer and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur in part and dissent in part.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b259-11\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AZE\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-12\">{\u00b6 20} I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to reverse the BTA\u2019s ruling that allowed exemption of the bobtail tanks. Moulton distributes liquid propane gas to residential and commercial customers. Moulton pumps the product from bulk tanks into what are called \u201cbobtail tanks,\u201d i.e., tanks affixed to vehicle chassis that are used to deliver the product to customers. The truck <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>chassis are separate components that are not at issue. I agree with the BTA\u2019s conclusion that the bobtail tanks are \u201cpackages\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 5739.02(B)(15). Therefore, I would affirm the BTA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">{\u00b6 21} In order for these tanks to be exempt, they must meet the definition of \u201cpackages\u201d in R.C. 5739.02(B)(15). <em>Custom Beverage Packers, Inc. v. Kosydar </em>(1973), 33 Ohio St.2d 68, 73, 62 O.O.2d 417, 294 N.E.2d 672. The statute lists obvious examples such as bags, baskets, cartons, boxes, cans and wrappings, in addition to the catchall of \u201cother similar devices and containers.\u201d This court has described packages as \u201citems which circumscribe and contain whatever is packaged\u201d and that \u201crestrain movement of the packaged object in more than one plane of direction.\u201d Id. The \u201cfunction of a package is to contain a product for shipping or handling.\u201d <em>Newfield Publications, Inc. v. Tracy </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 150, 153, 718 N.E.2d 420. The bobtail tanks at issue certainly fit within these descriptions; they circumscribe the propane, restrain its movement in more than one plane of direction, and contain it for shipping.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">{\u00b6 22} I liken this case to <em>AGA Gas, Inc. v. Limbach </em>(Aug. 21, 1987), BTA No. 85-E-117, a case upon which the BTA relied. AGA manufactured and sold various gases, including some in liquid form. Depending upon the needs of the customer, AGA put the gas into containers known as cylinders, banks, tubes, or pipelines for transporting it to the customer. The BTA concluded that these specialized containers were packages within the meaning of R.C. 5739.02(B)(15) and should be exempt from taxation. I agree with the board\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">{\u00b6 23} In <em>LAI Properties, Inc. v. Tracy </em>(Feb. 9, 1996), BTA No. 94-M-293, the BTA compared cylinders attached to trailers that LAI used to transport gases to its customers to the tax-exempt containers used by AGA. In <em>LAI, </em>the BTA distinguished <em>Southwestern Portland Cement Co. v. Lindley </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 417, 21 O.O.3d 261, 424 N.E.2d 304, in which this court refused to exempt equipment used to convey wet cement from trucks to railroad cars. The court rejected the taxpayer\u2019s argument that trucks and railroad cars were packages.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">{\u00b6 24} Here, the BTA compared this case to the facts in <em>AGA </em>and <em>LAI </em>and distinguished this case from <em>Southwestern Portland Cement. </em>Nevertheless, the majority ignores the BTA\u2019s analysis and compares Moulton\u2019s bobtail tanks used to contain liquid gas to trucks or railroad ears. I do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">{\u00b6 25} I would find that the bobtail tanks are packages within the meaning of R.C. 5739.02(B)(15) because they are used to contain Moulton\u2019s liquid propane gas for shipment. The bobtail tanks restrain the movement of the gas in more than one plane of direction. They are similar in nature to the containers used by AGA and LAI to hold gases for shipment, and they are unlike the trucks and railroad cars in <em>Southwestern Portland Cement </em>that this court deemed merely conveyance items that are not exempt.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Abb\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Rob C.
