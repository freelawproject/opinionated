Schlosser crushed his left fingertips in a machine at work. In the autumn of 1997, claimant began to see a psychologist, Dr. William P. McFarren. Dr. McFarren\u2019s primary diagnosis was that of major depression related to claimant\u2019s industrial injury and the narcotic medications prescribed as a result. Dr. McFarren repeated that diagnosis eight months later. He also commented that \u201cconsidering the seriousness of his depression and suicidal ideations, I feel that a psychiatric consultation is critical to the successful treatment of Mr. Schlosser.\u201d He also stated that short-term intervention was unlikely to succeed.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">{\u00b6 2} Dr. McFarren continued to urge authorization for a psychiatric consultation in a September 23, 1999 letter. Suicidal ideas and depressive symptoma-tology still predominated in his discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">{\u00b6 3} On October 26, 1999, the claim was finally allowed for \u201cmajor depression.\u201d Two C84 reports from McFarren followed, which requested temporary total disability compensation. Identical in content, they repeated claimant\u2019s prior symptoms and stated that \u201cimprovement can be expected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-12\">{\u00b6 4} On March 1, 2000, claimant was finally seen by a psychiatrist, Dr. Linda Cole. The next day, claimant was examined by another psychologist, Dr. James P. Reardon. Dr. Reardon issued an extensive report. Several points were significant:</p>\n<p id=\"b290-13\">{\u00b6 5} (1) Claimant\u2019s report of symptoms (flashbacks and nightmares) that had not been related to Dr. McFarren at any prior time;</p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>{\u00b6 6} (2) Claimant\u2019s negative response to the question whether he believed Dr. McFarren\u2019s visits were helpful;</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">{\u00b6 7} (3) Elevated test scores on three profiles that suggested that claimant was \u201cvery likely\u201d malingering and that claimant had a \u201csignificant tendency to exaggerate his psychological symptoms and distresses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">{\u00b6 8} In response to the question whether claimant continued to have major depression, Dr. Reardon wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cBased on the results of my examination I am unable to confirm that the patient presently suffers from Major Depression or infact [sic] that he has ever suffered from Major Depression either related to the industrial injury or separate and apart from it. Because of the invalidity of the psychological testing and therefore by extrapolation a questionable report of symptoms provided by Mr. Schlosser during the course of the evaluation it is not possible to render an opinion regarding a possible Major Depression.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">{\u00b610} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cI have not diagnosed Mr. Schlosser with a psychological condition or a Major Depression. Therefore I can not offer an opinion with regard to whether it is work prohibitive. What I can say is that based on my observations the only condition that may in all likelihood be diagnosed would be a Personality Disorder NOS [not otherwise specified] that in all likelihood would have pre-dated the accident of the 2-8-96.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">{\u00b6 12} In responding to the question whether the allowed condition was permanent, Dr. Reardon stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cI believe that it is likely that Mr. Schlosser\u2019s present condition is permanent. I am referring primarily to the Axis II disorder of R/O Personality Disorder NOS. I have not made the diagnosis of Major Depression or any other Axis I diagnosis. The Personality Disorder NOS, should one exist, definitely would have pre-dated the accident of 2-8-96. However, having said that, it does appear that Mr. Schlosser\u2019s condition has been stable for over four years now, and I believe that it is reasonable to conclude that it \u2018will continue for an indefinite period of time without any present indication of recovery therefrom.\u2019 In that respect I believe that it is likely that he <em>has </em>reached maximum medical improvement with regard to his current psychological state. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b291-12\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cAgain, I can not offer any opinions with regard to any recommended course of treatment in the future because I have not been able to identify to reasonable psychological certainty the presence of a diagnosable psychological condition. A primary reason is the reliability of Mr. Schlosser\u2019s report of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>symptoms, and the strong likelihood of significant exaggeration of whatever symptoms or psychological distress he <em>may </em>actually experience.\u201d (Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">{\u00b6 16} On March 29, 2000, a district hearing officer for appellee Industrial Commission of Ohio granted TTC as of January 20, 1998, based on Dr. McFar-ren\u2019s March 27, 2000 C84. Dr. Reardon\u2019s report \u201cwas not found persuasive as the District Hearing Officer found that it was not clear from the report that Dr. Reardon accepted the allowed condition of \u2018Major Depression.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">{\u00b6 17} On April 10, 2000, Dr. Reardon responded to a request for clarification by appellee-employer Famous Enterprises, Inc. He stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">{\u00b6 18} <em>\u201c1.1 do acknowledge that the above captioned claim for Mr. Schlosser, Claim No. 96-S^lS8k has been allowed for the psychological condition of Major Depression. </em>I fully understand and accept that the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation has allowed Mr. Schlosser\u2019s claim for the condition of a Major Depression. In arriving at the opinions offered in the previous report <em>I did not </em>reject the psychological allowance that had been previously recognized. I hope that this statement will clarify that I do infact [sic] acknowledge and understand that his claim has been allowed for the condition of Major Depression.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c2. Having acknowledged that the Bureau has allowed the claim for the condition of Major Depression, I nevertheless have to arrive at conclusions about Mr. Schlosser\u2019s current condition based on my own independent examination of him. These conclusions are based on his psychological state at the present time, as well as taking into account the various records from prior treatment and assessments that have been examined in this case. The fact that I am acknowledging an understanding of Mr. Schlosser\u2019s case having been allowed for the condition of Major Depression does not in any way change the opinions which I offered in my previous report.\u201d (Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">{\u00b6 20} He again discussed at length claimant\u2019s elevated test scores and, turning to permanency, offered:</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cAcknowledging that Mr. Schlosser\u2019s case has been allowed for the condition of Major Depression, it is almost certain that his condition would not remain unchanged either in terms of its intensity or frequency of symptoms over a four year period whether he were treated or not. It is likely that because of circumstances and other contributing factors his situation would change be it for better or worse. In my opinion, based on my examination of Mr. Schlosser, I believe that the provisional diagnosis of Rule Out Personality Disorder NOS is the more likely contributing factor to the current psychological difficulties that Mr. Schlosser is experiencing. I believe that that condition which has been stable throughout the duration of his \u2018disability\u2019 will continue for an indefinite period of time without any present indication of recovery therefrom. I believe in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>that respect Mr. Schlosser <em>has </em>reached maximum medical improvement.\u201d (Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">{\u00b6 22} Dr. Reardon\u2019s two reports prompted a response from Dr. McFarren:</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cDr. Reardon has not had the opportunity to observe Mr. Schlosser over an extended period of time, so it is understandable that he would have difficulty addressing issues such as his depressive disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cAt this time, I do not feel he has reached maximum medical improvement. It has taken an extended period of time to even obtain Mr. Schlosser a psychiatric consultation which has just recently been initiated, since his psychological condition has been recently recognized. I do not feel it is appropriate to say he has reached maximum medical improvement when he has not even had this important treatment modality available to him until just recently. Dr. Cole is continuing to see Terry and at the last appointment had made significant changes in his pharmacological regime.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cIn Dr. Reardon\u2019s report he felt that Terry was malingering. Once again I have had an opportunity to observe Terry over an extended period of time. Having done this for over 20 years, it is generally fairly easy to spot a malingerer over a period of four years. Rarely, would someone who is malingering follow through with care consistently, driving extended distances to appointments. When Terry presented, no psychological condition had been recognized, and there was no guarantee it ever would. Mr. Schlosser has faithfully attended all appointments. In summary, malingerers generally do not follow through with care over extended periods of time, driving great distances (over 100 miles round trip) to each appointment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">{\u00b6 26} On May 2, 2000, a staff hearing officer reversed the district hearing officer, writing:</p>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">{\u00b6 27} \u201c[TJemporary total compensation is denied for the requested period 07/04/97 to 05/02/00 date of this hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cThe reports of Dr. McFarren are not persuasive to establish that the allowed psychological condition has rendered the claimant temporary totally disabled for a three year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cAll of Dr. McFarren\u2019s reports indicate that the claimant\u2019s symptoms, treatment, and complaints have remained the same for the entire requested period.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-13\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cThis finding is supported by the 04/10/00 report; and the testimony at today\u2019s hearing; of Dr. Reardon. Dr. Reardon testified at length as to his conclusion that the claimant\u2019s complaints and treatment results have been at maximum medical improvement since the claimant started with Dr. McFarren.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>{\u00b6 31} \u201cThe claimant reported to Dr. Reardon that Dr. McFarren\u2019s treatments had not helped.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cFinally, the claimant did not appear at hearing to dispute Dr. Reardon\u2019s opinions and testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cAll evidence was considered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">{\u00b6 34} Further consideration was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">{\u00b6 35} Claimant turned to the Court of Appeals for Franklin County. Affirming the staff hearing officer\u2019s reasoning, the appeals court denied the writ. This cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">{\u00b6 36} Claimant\u2019s alleged inability to return to the former position of employment is not in dispute. At issue is the permanency of the psychiatric condition underlying it, and the presence of some evidence supporting the commission\u2019s determination of MMI. For the reasons to follow, we find that the commission abused its discretion in relying on Dr. Reardon.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">{\u00b6 37} In the evidence before us, an immediately disquieting component is one of timing. MMI was declared just two months and a day after claimant\u2019s first visit to a psychiatrist \u2014 a referral Dr. McFarren had been seeking from the commission for two years as critical to claimant\u2019s chances for improvement. The proximity of the hearing to the initiation of psychiatric treatment foreclosed any input from Dr. Cole. We know only \u2014 through McFarren and Reardon\u2019s final reports \u2014 that Dr. Cole immediately and radically changed claimant\u2019s medications. Since no one had the benefit of Cole\u2019s potentially determinative prognosis, we question whether the MMI assessment was premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">{\u00b6 38} As to the evidence itself, we are faced with vigorously conflicting doctors\u2019 opinions, as McFarren and Reardon alternately accuse each other and defend their reports from the other\u2019s most recent missive. McFarren prepared six relevant documents. Three specifically denied MMI \u2014 the reading claimant urges as controlling. Dr. Reardon, on the other hand, expressly determined MMI. The flaw is that the condition he labeled as MMI was a personality disorder that is not an allowed part of the claim. Reardon made no durational assessment for major depression \u2014 the allowed condition \u2014 because he did not believe it existed. His reports, consequently, cannot be some evidence of MMI of claimant\u2019s depression.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">{\u00b6 39} Accordingly, we find that the commission abused its discretion in (1) relying on Dr. Reardon\u2019s reports as some evidence of MMI of claimant\u2019s major depression and (2) discounting Dr. McFarren\u2019s reports as evidence that claimant\u2019s condition was subject to improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-13\">{\u00b6 40} The judgment of the court of appeals is reversed and a writ of mandamus is granted that orders temporary total disability compensation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>commence as of January 20, 1998 \u2014 two years prior to claimant\u2019s motion for renewed compensation.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AqC\">Butkovich, Schimpf, Schimpf &amp; Ginocchio Co., L.P.A., and Lisa M.
