Thomas, raises fifteen propositions of law. Finding none meritorious, we affirm his convictions. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>have independently weighed the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors and compared his sentence with those imposed in similar cases, as R.C. 2929.05(A) requires. As a result, we affirm defendant\u2019s convictions and sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">{\u00b6 2} Defendant broke into Florence \u201cMolly\u201d Newbirt\u2019s home in Toledo, Ohio, during the early morning of November 23, 1994. The defendant robbed and murdered 87-year-old Newbirt by repeatedly striking her with a hammer on the head. Defendant stole a television set from Newbirt\u2019s bedroom, fled, and attempted to sell the television to an acquaintance later that morning. The defendant was convicted of aggravated murder, aggravated burglary, and aggravated robbery, and sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">{\u00b6 3} To establish defendant\u2019s guilt, the state introduced defendant\u2019s hat, found at the crime scene; defendant\u2019s shoe, containing a shard of glass from Newbirt\u2019s basement window; forensic testimony that a bloody shoeprint on Newbirt\u2019s bedroom pillowcase was of defendant\u2019s shoe; testimony that the murder weapon (i.e., the hammer) came from defendant\u2019s home; and testimony that defendant attempted to sell Newbirt\u2019s television to James Lightner on the morning of November 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">State\u2019s Case</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">{\u00b6 4} On the evening of November 22, 1994, defendant attended a birthday party for his niece at his home at 239 Hanover Street in Toledo. Defendant lived at this address with his sister and Wesley Thomas, his nephew.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">{\u00b6 5} During the party, defendant asked four or five people for money, but no one loaned him any. Defendant owed Wesley $10 and told Wesley he could not pay him. They argued but then resumed drinking. Defendant had a black baseball cap, which portrayed an Uzi machine gun and a number 187 logo, in his hand at the party. Wesley had previously owned the hat, and the defendant sometimes wore it. The number 187 represented the California Penal Code number for homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">{\u00b6 6} As the evening progressed, defendant was in a \u201cpretty bad mood,\u201d \u201cmad\u201d and \u201cdrunk,\u201d according to Wesley. Defendant left the party around midnight and did not return.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">{\u00b6 7} Newbirt lived a few houses away at 223 Hanover Street. Sandra Connolly lived behind Newbirt\u2019s residence. Between 3:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. on November 23, Connolly and her daughter, Deborah Connolly, were leaving for work when they noticed that Newbirt\u2019s back door was open and her back door lights were not on. They suspected that something was wrong, and after arriving at work, Deborah notified the police by calling 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>{\u00b6 8} Toledo police officers responding to the 911 call entered Newbirt\u2019s home and found her battered body lying under a mattress in the bedroom. Newbirt was still alive and was rushed to the hospital. Police secured the crime scene and began collecting evidence from Newbirt\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">{\u00b6 9} The police found a smashed basement window and glass on the basement floor, indicating that the culprit had entered Newbirt\u2019s home through the basement. Defendant\u2019s ball cap (with the Uzi machine gun and the number 187 logo) was found on the steps by the broken window. Footprints on the lower portion of the basement door and a broken doorjamb suggested that the assailant had entered the main part of the house through the forced basement door.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">{\u00b6 10} Police found a clump of the victim\u2019s white hair lying near a phone receiver that had been ripped from the wall, which indicated a struggle in the kitchen and dining-room area. However, blood spatters on the bedroom walls and closet doors suggested that Newbirt was murdered in her bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">{\u00b6 11} The murder weapon was a claw hammer found on the bedroom floor near the victim\u2019s body. The police also collected a pillowcase from under the bedroom desk that appeared to have a partial footprint on it. An expert concluded that defendant\u2019s Nike tennis shoe made the bloody footprint on Newbirt\u2019s pillowcase. Experts also established that DNA from blood on the hammer matched DNA from blood removed from the pillowcase.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">{\u00b6 12} The police concluded that Newbirt had been robbed, since the contents of her purse had been dumped. Police also determined that a television set had been stolen from her bedroom on the basis of an empty table top where dust silhouetted a clean rectangular shape, a nearby A/B switch and a TV cable, and a TV owner\u2019s manual in the bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">{\u00b6 13} The assailant appeared to have fled from Newbirt\u2019s residence through the back door. The back door was open, and police collected a women\u2019s purple coat lying on the ground between the rear door and the back fence.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">{\u00b6 14} At approximately 2:30 a.m. that night, before the crime was discovered, defendant went to Lightner\u2019s residence and knocked loudly on his door. Lightner lived at 1654 Campbell Street, which was several blocks from the victim\u2019s residence. After Lightner let the defendant in, Lightner noticed that the lower parts of defendant\u2019s pants were covered with blood. Defendant said \u201che had gotten into a fight with a guy.\u201d However, Lightner did not notice any marks on defendant\u2019s hands or face indicating that he had actually been in a fight. Defendant then offered to sell Lightner a television set. Defendant said that \u201chim and some guy stole it and they got to fighting over it.\u201d Lightner refused to buy the television, and the defendant left. Shortly thereafter, defendant returned to Lightner\u2019s home, asked for a ride to another location, and Lightner agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>{\u00b6 15} Defendant took the television set with him in Lightner\u2019s car. Upon arriving at Junction and Buckingham, defendant and an unidentified man took the television set out of Lightner\u2019s car, put it into the trunk of another car, and drove off. At trial, Lightner agreed that that television looked like the one pictured on the owner\u2019s manual found in Newbirt\u2019s bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">{\u00b6 16} At the hospital, Newbirt\u2019s family told police about \u00e1 neighborhood man who performed odd jobs for the victim and attempted to borrow money from her. Further investigation led police to defendant\u2019s home, where they talked to Wesley. He told police that defendant had attended a party there the night before and had left the house around midnight. Wesley identified distinctive markings on the hammer, noting that it came from a drawer in their house. Wesley described the clothes defendant had been wearing, including the baseball cap with the Uzi machine gun and the number 187 logo. He also identified the hat when police showed it to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">{\u00b6 17} Officer Thomas Ross interviewed defendant following his arrest two days later on November 25, 1994. According to the defendant, he stayed at the Cherry Street Mission, a local homeless shelter, the day of the crime. Defendant told police that he had turned in his \u201cold and soiled\u201d clothes, and \u201cthe people at the mission gave him new clothes.\u201d Ross seized defendant\u2019s Nike tennis shoes after noticing blood on one of them. A piece of glass was also found embedded inside the shoe. At trial, an expert concluded that there was a \u201cvery strong probability\u201d that the glass fragment came from Newbirt\u2019s basement window based on its refractive index.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">{\u00b6 18} When asked how blood got on his shoes, defendant said, \u201c[M]y mind went blank, I don\u2019t remember.\u201d Defendant told Ross that he knew the victim because \u201cshe lived a few doors down from him, and that he on occasion had raked some leaves for her.\u201d When asked if he broke into her home and attacked her, defendant said, \u201c[I]f I did something like that, I don\u2019t remember. I\u2019m just sick from some bad drugs I got that night.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">{\u00b6 19} Defendant remembered drinking beer at the party on November 22, but \u201ceverything went blank after that.\u201d Defendant next remembered \u201cwaking up in a vacant house near Junction and Nebraska and walking down to the Cherry Street Mission and being admitted there.\u201d Defendant said that he did not recall carrying a television set that night or trying to sell a television set to Lightner. When asked again about attacking Newbirt, defendant said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t me William. Doesn\u2019t seem I\u2019d do anything like that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">{\u00b6 20} Newbirt remained hospitalized from the attack for a month, until she died on December 23, 1994. Newbirt had suffered approximately 15 to 20 injuries to her head and face. Several circular depressed skull fractures showed that a hammer or a similar object caused Newbirt\u2019s injuries. The deputy coroner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>concluded that Newbirt died as a \u201cresult of respiratory complications * * * due to craniocerebral injuries that she sustained in a beating.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">{\u00b6 21} At trial, the defense elected not to present any evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Trial Result</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">{\u00b6 22} The three-judge panel convicted defendant as charged. Count I, charging defendant with aggravated murder, included a capital specification for murder during an aggravated burglary and a second capital specification for murder during an aggravated robbery. Counts II and III separately charged defendant with aggravated burglary and aggravated robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">{\u00b6 23} The three-judge panel sentenced defendant to death on Count I. Defendant was also sentenced to 10 to 25 years in prison on Count II and 10 to 25 years in prison on Count III.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">{\u00b6 24} The court of appeals affirmed the convictions and death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">Pretrial Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">{\u00b6 25} <em>Jury waiver. </em>In proposition of law III, defendant claims that his waiver of a jury trial was insufficient because the record does not affirmatively establish that he was fully aware of all the effects of his waiver. Defendant cites <em>State v. Post </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 380, 384, 513 N.E.2d 754, which reaffirmed \u201c \u2018the usual presumption that in a bench trial in a criminal case the court considered only the relevant, material, and competent evidence in arriving at its judgment unless it affirmatively appears to the contrary.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>State v. White </em>(1968), 15 Ohio St.2d 146, 151, 44 O.O.2d 132, 239 N.E.2d 65. Defendant argues that the trial court was required by the Constitution to ensure that he understood that this presumption would be applied on appellate review if he waived a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-11\">{\u00b6 26} In <em>State v. Jells </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 22, 559 N.E.2d 464, paragraph one of the syllabus, we held, \u201cThere is no requirement for a trial court to interrogate a defendant in order to determine whether he or she is fully apprised of the right to a jury trial.\u201d \u201cThe Criminal Rules and the Revised Code are satisfied by a written waiver, signed by the defendant, filed with the court, and made in open court, after arraignment and opportunity to consult with counsel. While it may be better practice for the trial judge to enumerate all the possible implications of a waiver of a jury, there is no error in failing to do so.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id. at 26, 559 N.E.2d 464; see, also, <em>State v. Filiaggi </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 230, 238, 714 N.E.2d 867; <em>State v. Baston </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 418, 421, 709 N.E.2d 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-12\">{\u00b6 27} Defendant signed two jury waivers in open court, and both waivers conformed to the dictates of R.C. 2945.05. <em>Jells </em>holds that the statute and rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>require no inquiry, and we now hold that nor does the Constitution. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s failure to advise defendant about the legal consequences of his jury waiver was not error. Thus, we reject proposition III.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">{\u00b6 28} <em>Validity of the jury waiver. </em>In proposition of law IV, defendant argues that the three-judge panel lacked jurisdiction to try his case. First, defendant contends that the panel lacked jurisdiction because one of the jury waivers was not journalized.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">{\u00b6 29} R.C. 2945.05 requires that a waiver of a jury trial must be written, signed by the defendant, and filed and made a part of the record. In the absence of strict compliance with R.C. 2945.05, a trial court lacks jurisdiction to try the defendant without a jury. <em>State v. Pless </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 333, 658 N.E.2d 766, paragraph one of the syllabus. The requirement that a jury waiver form be \u201c \u2018filed in said cause and made a part of the record thereof means that the form must be time-stamped and included in the record.\u201d <em>State v. Gipson </em>(1998), 80 Ohio St.3d 626, 632, 687 N.E.2d 750; but, see, <em>State v. Otte </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 167, 169, 761 N.E.2d 34 (jurisdiction to hold a bench trial where jury waiver was physically located in the case file but had not been file-stamped).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">{\u00b6 30} The jury waivers contained identical language. The waiver dated October 12, 1995, was date-stamped and properly journalized. Defendant\u2019s second jury waiver, dated October 30, 1995, was date-stamped but not journal-ized. The October 12 jury waiver met the strict statutory requirements of R.C. 2945.05. Thus, the second jury waiver was superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">{\u00b6 31} In his second contention, defendant argues that the order establishing the three-judge panel was not properly executed. Defendant claims that the order was invalid because the signing judge was not a general division judge of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">{\u00b6 32} R.C. 2945.06 provides, \u201cIf the accused is charged with an offense punishable with death, he shall be tried by a court to be composed of three judges, consisting of the judge presiding at the time in the trial of criminal cases and two other judges to be designated by the presiding judge or chief justice of that court, and in case there is neither a presiding judge nor a chief justice, by the chief justice of the supreme court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">{\u00b6 33} Here, the judgment entry establishing the three-judge panel was signed by a judge on the domestic relations bench of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas. However, there is no authority in R.C. 2945.06 or elsewhere to support defendant\u2019s contention that the order designating a three-judge panel must be signed by a general division common pleas judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">{\u00b6 34} Moreover, defendant did not object at trial to the presiding judge\u2019s authority. Thus, this issue was waived and there was no plain error. Cf. <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number><em>Bays </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 15, 26, 716 N.E.2d 1126 (waiver by failing to object at trial to probate judge\u2019s assignment to the three-judge panel). Accordingly, we reject proposition IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Trial Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">{\u00b6 35} <em>Competency. </em>In proposition of law I, defendant argues that the trial court erred by failing to <em>sua sponte </em>find that he was incompetent to stand trial. According to the defendant, the \u201crecord reveals * * * upon the representations to the court by his attorneys\u201d that he was unable to assist them in his own defense. Defendant claims that the record is replete with instances where he was acting against his own interests. Moreover, defendant argues that his behavior raised substantial questions about his ability to understand the consequences of his trial or assist in his own defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cIt has long been recognized that \u2018a person [who] lacks the capacity to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him, to consult with counsel, and to assist in preparing his defense may not be subjected to a trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Smith </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 323, 329, 731 N.E.2d 645, quoting <em>Drope v. Missouri </em>(1975), 420 U.S. 162, 171, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103. Fundamental principles of due process require that a criminal defendant who is legally incompetent may not be tried. <em>State v. Berry </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 354, 359, 650 N.E.2d 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">{\u00b6 37} R.C. 2945.37(B) requires a competency hearing if a request is made before trial. <em>State v. Were </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 173, 761 N.E.2d 591, paragraph one of the syllabus. But R.C. 2945.37(B) provides that \u201c[i]f the issue is raised after the trial has commenced, the court shall hold a hearing on the issue only for good cause shown or on the court\u2019s own motion.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, the decision whether to hold a competency hearing once trial has begun is in the court\u2019s discretion. <em>State v. Rahman </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 146, 156, 23 OBR 315, 492 N.E.2d 401. The right to a hearing rises to the level of a constitutional guarantee when the record contains sufficient \u201cindicia of incompetency\u201d to necessitate inquiry to ensure the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. <em>State v. Were, </em>94 Ohio St.3d 173, 761 N.E.2d 591, paragraph two of the syllabus; <em>State v. Berry, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 359, 650 N.E.2d 433. Objective indications such as medical reports, specific references by defense counsel to irrational behavior, or the defendant\u2019s demeanor during trial are all relevant in determining whether good cause was shown after the trial had begun. <em>State v. Chapin </em>(1981), 67 Ohio St.2d 437, 21 O.O.3d 273, 424 N.E.2d 317, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>{\u00b6 38} Here, the record fails to indicate that defendant had difficulty understanding the proceedings or that he was incapable of assisting his counsel in his defense. During the trial, the trial court questioned defendant about appointment of a lawyer, jury waiver, counsel\u2019s temporary absence from the courtroom, counsel\u2019s possible conflict of interest, and defendant\u2019s right to make a sworn or unsworn statement during mitigation. Defendant showed that he understood the proceedings by meaningfully responding to each of the trial court\u2019s questions. Moreover, the defense counsel affirmatively indicated throughout the trial that defendant understood the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">{\u00b6 39} In addition, the defense counsel never suggested that defendant was incompetent. Counsel had ample time to become familiar with defendant\u2019s competency, since they represented him from their appointments in December 1994 or January 1995 through completion of the December 1995 sentencing proceedings. If counsel had some reason to question defendant\u2019s competency, they surely would have done so. Cf. <em>State v. Hessler </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 108, 125, 734 N.E.2d 1237. Finally, no expert or lay opinion indicated that defendant was actually incompetent. During the mitigation hearing, Dr. Jeffrey Smalldon and Dr. Janice Ort, clinical psychologists, testified that defendant\u2019s significant intellectual deficiencies placed him in the low borderline range of mental functioning. However, neither witness expressed any reservations about defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial. The trial court did not err by failing to find <em>sua sponte </em>that defendant was incompetent to stand trial, and we find that proposition I lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">{\u00b6 40} In proposition of law II, defendant argues that his counsel were ineffective by failing to ask the trial court to hold a hearing or order a psychiatric examination to determine his competency to stand trial. Reversal of convictions on ineffective assistance of counsel requires that the defendant show, first, that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and, second, that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense so as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial. <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674; accord <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">{\u00b6 41} Here, defendant did not display sufficient indicia of incompetency to warrant a competency hearing. See <em>State v. Smith, </em>89 Ohio St.3d at 334, 731 N.E.2d 645. Thus, his counsel\u2019s failure to request the trial court to order a competency hearing did not constitute deficient performance, and we reject proposition II.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">{\u00b6 42} <em>Advice on testifying. </em>In proposition of law V, defendant argues that the trial court violated his constitutional rights by failing to inquire <em>sua sponte </em>whether defendant knew he had an \u201cabsolute right to testify in his own behalf,\u201d and whether defendant \u201cknowingly, intelligently, and personally waives that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>right.\u201d However, \u201c \u2018a trial court is not <em>required </em>to conduct an inquiry with the defendant concerning the decision whether to testify in his defense.\u2019 (Emphasis sic.)\u201d <em>State v. Green </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 352, 375, 738 N.E.2d 1208, quoting <em>State v. Bey </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 487, 499, 709 N.E.2d 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">{\u00b6 43} Nothing in the record suggests that defendant wanted to testify and was denied the opportunity to do so. Nothing suggests that defendant was unaware of his right to testify or that defendant\u2019s counsel failed to advise him of his right. Indeed, his counsel informed the trial court that \u201c[a]fter having discussed with Mr. Thomas his right to testify in this matter, the fact that he would be subjected to cross examination, the fact that if he declines to testify that the Court will draw no inference from that failure to testify and the fact the prosecution will not comment upon it in their closing argument, it would be the defendant\u2019s desire at this time to not testify * * Thus, we find that proposition V lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">{\u00b6 44} <em>Expert qualifications. </em>In proposition of law VI, defendant argues that the trial court erred by allowing Detective Chad Culpert to testify about blood-spatter evidence without determining that he was qualified to testify as an expert. Defendant claims that Culpert\u2019s testimony provided \u201cphysical and scientific support\u201d to Wesley Thomas\u2019s testimony (i.e., that the hammer found in the victim\u2019s bedroom came from defendant\u2019s home) and led to findings that the hammer was the murder weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">{\u00b6 45} However, defendant never objected to Culpert\u2019s opinions or challenged his qualifications to testify. Thus, defendant waived all but plain error. Crim.R. 52(B); <em>State v. Hartman </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 274, 285-286, 754 N.E.2d 1150.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">{\u00b6 46} Evid.R. 702(B) provides that a witness may qualify as an expert by reason of his or her \u201cspecialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education regarding the subject matter of the testimony.\u201d Neither special education nor certification is necessary to confer expert status upon a witness. \u201cThe individual offered as an expert need not have complete knowledge of the field in question, as long as the knowledge he or she possesses will aid the trier of fact in performing its fact-finding function.\u201d <em>State v. Hartman, </em>93 Ohio St.3d at 285, 754 N.E.2d 1150; <em>State v. Baston, </em>85 Ohio St.3d 418, 423, 709 N.E.2d 128. Pursuant to Evid.R. 104(A), the trial court determines whether a witness qualifies as an expert, and that determination will be overturned only for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Hartman, </em>93 Ohio St.3d at 285, 754 N.E.2d 1150; <em>State v. Williams </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 53, 58, 4 OBR 144, 446 N.E.2d 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">{\u00b6 47} Culpert testified about blood spatters found on the walls and closet door of the victim\u2019s bedroom. He stated that the concentration of blood spatters indicated that two blows were delivered at or near the bedroom wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>{\u00b6 48} Culpert, a Toledo police detective assigned to the scientific investigation unit, was never questioned during direct examination about his professional qualifications and experience. However, Culpert\u2019s responsibilities were to \u201chandle, collect, and process the [crime] scene for any physical evidence * * * that may be pertinent to the investigation.\u201d Thus, we find no plain error and reject proposition VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">{\u00b6 49} In proposition of law VII, defendant argues his counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness by failing to object to Culpert\u2019s blood-spatter testimony because he was not qualified as an expert witness. As previously discussed, reversal of a conviction for ineffective assistance of counsel requires that defendant show, first, that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and, second, that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense so as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">{\u00b6 50} Defendant does not directly attack Culpert\u2019s qualifications to present expert testimony on blood-spatter evidence. In any event, Culpert\u2019s expert qualifications cannot be evaluated since his professional background and qualifications were not presented or questioned at trial. Moreover, defendant cannot add to the record, since \u201c[a] reviewing court cannot add matter to the record before it * * * and then decide the appeal on the basis of the new matter.\u201d <em>State v. Ishmail </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 402, 8 O.O.3d 405, 377 N.E.2d 500, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">{\u00b6 51} By not challenging Culpert\u2019s qualifications, defense counsel avoided inviting the prosecutor to ask questions that might bolster Culpert\u2019s qualifications in the eyes of the court. Given the strong presumption that counsel\u2019s performance constituted reasonable assistance, we find that counsel\u2019s failure to object may have been a tactical decision and reject this claim of ineffectiveness. See <em>State v. Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d at 144, 538 N.E.2d 373; cf. <em>State v. Hartman, </em>93 Ohio St.3d 274, 297, 754 N.E.2d 1150. Therefore, we find that proposition VII lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">{\u00b6 52} <em>Reasonable doubt. </em>In proposition of law XII, defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s use of the definition of \u201creasonable doubt\u201d in R.C. 2901.05(D) during both phases of the trial. However, we have repeatedly affirmed the constitutionality of R.C. 2901.05. E.g., <em>State v. Jones </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 335, 347, 744 N.E.2d 1163; <em>State v. Hessler, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 127, 734 N.E.2d 1237. Thus, we reject proposition XII.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">Visiting Judge\u2019s Ruling</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">{\u00b6 53} During the penalty phase, defendant\u2019s counsel objected that the two victim-impact statements \u201cgo well beyond what [R.C.] 2930.14 has provided for in terms of an [sic] victim impact statement.\u201d The three-judge panel requested a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>visiting judge, not assigned to the case, to rule on the admissibility of the victim-impact statements \u201cbecause obviously it would taint any members of the Panel or the entire Panel if we heard the statements and then made a ruling on what we can\u2019t hear.\u201d In this regard, the panel stated that \u201cafter discussions with the Panel by all of counsel, it has been agreed upon that the statements may be read as redacted by the Honorable Sumner Walters, a visiting judge, and his rulings will be made as regards the redacted statements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">{\u00b6 54} Judge Walters considered defense objections to the content of the victim-impact statements outside the presence of the three-judge panel. Judge Walters ruled that the two particular statements should be eliminated from the victim-impact statements. He admitted the remainder of the statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">{\u00b6 55} The defense renewed objections to the redacted statements before the three-judge panel, and those objections were overruled. Thereafter, the two statements were presented for the panel\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">{\u00b6 56} The three-judge panel was designated in accordance with the requirements of R.C. 2945.06. R.C. 2945.06 sets forth no procedures authorizing the panel to request a visiting judge to rule on the admissibility of victim-impact evidence. <em>Berger v. Berger </em>(1981), 3 Ohio App.3d 125, 128-129, 3 OBR 141, 443 N.E.2d 1375; <em>Rosenberg v. Gattarello </em>(1976), 49 Ohio App.2d 87, 93-94, 3 O.O.3d 151, 359 N.E.2d 467; see, also, <em>State ex rel. Chavis v. Griffin </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 50, 51, 741 N.E.2d 130. The Ohio Rules of Superintendence provide that the judge assigned to a case under the individual assignment system \u201cbecomes primarily responsible for the determination of every issue and proceeding in the case until its termination.\u201d Sup.R. 36(B)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">{\u00b6 57} Here, the three-judge panel did not need to shield itself from improper consideration of victim-impact testimony. R.C. 2945.06 provides that the judges or a majority of them on a three-judge panel \u201cmay decide all questions of fact and law arising upon the trial.\u201d In contrast to juries, judges are presumed to know the law and expected to consider only relevant, material, and competent evidence during their deliberations. See <em>State v. Post, </em>32 Ohio St.3d 380, 384, 513 N.E.2d 754; cf. <em>State v. Gillard </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 226, 229, 533 N.E.2d 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">{\u00b6 58} However, the improper referral of an evidentiary matter to another judge did not go to the jurisdiction of the court or render the judgment void. See <em>Berger v. Berger, </em>3 Ohio App.3d 125, 130-131, 3 OBR 141, 443 N.E.2d 1375; cf. <em>State v. Filiaggi, </em>86 Ohio St.3d 230, 240, 714 N.E.2d 867. The decision to employ a different judge to rule on a victim-impact statement was a cautious decision to avoid any possible taint. Moreover, the defense agreed to Judge Walter\u2019s appointment to rule on the content of the victim-impact statements. Thus, this issue was waived, and we find no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">{\u00b6 59} In proposition of law VIII, defendant argues that the prosecutor committed three acts of misconduct during closing arguments in the penalty phase. The test for prejudice in closing arguments is \u201c \u2018whether the remarks were improper and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected substantial rights of the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Hessler, </em>90 Ohio St.3d 108, 125, 734 N.E.2d 1237, quoting <em>State v. Smith </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14, 14 OBR 317, 470 N.E.2d 883.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">{\u00b6 60} First, defendant argues that the prosecutor treated the nature and circumstances of the offense as an aggravating circumstance. Defendant points to the following segment of the prosecutor\u2019s argument: \u201cAs a part of the nature and circumstances of this horrendous crime, I\u2019m not going to reiterate the details, the medical evidence that you have before you, the photographic evidence, the physical evidence that you heard from Dr. Barnett, but this murder, Your Honors, this murder is the essence of depraved and evil behavior, and that\u2019s what makes the death penalty necessary.\u201d However, the defense failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s argument, and waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Wade </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 182, 7 O.O.3d 362, 373 N.E.2d 1244, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">{\u00b6 61} The state may \u201cpresent arguments concerning the nature and circumstances of the offense.\u201d <em>State v. Wogenstahl </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 344, 355, 662 N.E.2d 311. However, \u201c[i]t is improper for prosecutors in the penalty phase of a capital trial to make any comment * * * that the nature and circumstances of the offense are \u2018aggravating circumstances.\u2019 \u201d Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">{\u00b6 62} The prosecutor correctly identified the two statutory aggravating circumstances the court could properly consider (i.e., aggravated burglary and aggravated robbery under R.C. 2929.04[A][7]) at the beginning of her argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">{\u00b6 63} Perusal of the panel\u2019s opinion demonstrates that the trial court correctly identified the aggravating circumstances as aggravated murder that occurred during an aggravated burglary and an aggravated murder that occurred during an aggravated robbery. When a trial court correctly identifies the statutory aggravating circumstances, it will be inferred that the trial court \u201c \u2018understood the difference between statutory aggravating circumstances and facts describing the nature and circumstances of the offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Green </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 141, 149, 609 N.E.2d 1253, quoting <em>State v. Sowell </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 322, 328, 530 N.E.2d 1294. Therefore, we find no plain error resulting from the prosecutor\u2019s comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">{\u00b6 64} Second, defendant argues that the prosecutor\u2019s final argument impugned the defense counsel\u2019s integrity. Here, defendant points to the following segment of the prosecutor\u2019s argument: \u201cNone of us envy your jobs, or a jury in a situation like this, but you have that job, as all of us here in this system of justice; Mr. Sniderman and I to prosecute honestly, ethically and to the best of our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>abilities with the evidence we have through the investigators; Mr. Cimerman and Mr. Helmick to zealously advocate and defend their client; and the three of you to be objective, to use the evidence before you, and combine it with your unique understanding of the law. And we know that you will do that.\u201d However, the defense failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s argument and waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Wade, </em>53 Ohio St.2d 182, 7 O.O.3d 362, 373 N.E.2d 1244, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">{\u00b6 65} The test for prejudice regarding prosecutorial misconduct in closing arguments is \u201c \u2018whether the remarks were improper and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected the substantial rights of the defendants.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Kessler, </em>90 Ohio St.3d 108, 125, 734 N.E.2d 1237, quoting <em>State v. Smith, </em>14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14, 14 OBR 317, 470 N.E.2d 883. Here, the prosecutor\u2019s argument summed up the professional responsibilities of the defense, prosecution, and the three-judge panel. The prosecutor did not say anything negative about defense counsel or otherwise impugn defense counsel\u2019s integrity. Moreover, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks did not improperly contrast defense counsel\u2019s zeal with the state\u2019s honest and ethical conduct of the case. Therefore, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were proper. We find no plain or other error, and reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">{\u00b6 66} Finally, defendant claims that the prosecutor improperly argued that the three-judge panel should defer to decisions of this court when weighing mitigating factors against the aggravating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">{\u00b6 67} The prosecutor argued that the panel should consider the weight given to mitigating evidence in several capital decisions of the Supreme Court of Ohio when weighing mitigation in defendant\u2019s case. However, the defense never objected to that argument and waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Wade, </em>53 Ohio St.2d 182, 7 O.O.3d 362, 373 N.E.2d 1244, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">{\u00b6 68} R.C. 2929.03(D)(1) neither requires nor forbids the court to consider evidence determined to be mitigating in similar cases. However, the sentencing procedures in R.C. 2929.03(D)(1) were designed to promote the objective consideration of the circumstances of the individual offense and individual offender. Asking the three-judge panel to make comparisons with other cases did not constitute prejudicial error, since it is presumed that the panel \u201cconsidered only the relevant, material, and competent evidence in arriving at its judgment.\u201d <em>State v. White </em>(1968), 15 Ohio St.2d 146, 151, 44 O.O.2d 132, 239 N.E.2d 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">{\u00b6 69} Moreover, the sentencing opinion shows that the trial court properly assessed defendant\u2019s mitigating factors in accordance with R.C. 2929.04(B). Thus, we find no plain error, and this argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">{\u00b6 70} In summary, we find no prosecutorial misconduct justifying reversal, and we reject proposition VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">{\u00b6 71} In proposition of law X, defendant claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when his trial counsel failed to preserve error by making timely objections. However, defendant fails to mention any specific example of counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">{\u00b6 72} Earlier in our discussion, we found the specific allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel in propositions II and VII to have no merit. Moreover, our review of the remaining portions of the record discloses no evidence of ineffective assistance of counsel affecting the ultimate outcome of the trial. Therefore, we reject proposition X.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Sentencing Opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">{\u00b6 73} In proposition of law IX, defendant contends that the trial court improperly weighed the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">{\u00b6 74} First, defendant claims that the panel erred by weighing the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors individually rather than collectively. Since the panel found only one mitigating factor, defendant\u2019s limited intellect, to weigh against the aggravating circumstances, there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">{\u00b6 75} Second, defendant argues that the panel treated the nature and circumstances of the offense as an aggravating circumstance. However, the panel\u2019s sentencing opinion showed that it understood the difference between the statutory aggravating circumstances and facts describing the nature and circumstances of the offense. See, also, <em>State v. Clemons </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 438, 447, 696 N.E.2d 1009. Thus, we find that this argument is also without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">{\u00b6 76} Defendant also argues that the trial court improperly weighed defendant\u2019s \u201chistory, character, and background\u201d against \u201cthe invalid aggravating circumstance of the nature and circumstances of the offense.\u201d Here, defendant points to the following segment of the sentencing opinion:</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">{\u00b6 77} \u201cWhile Mr. Thomas\u2019 life and his experiences have been unlucky, wretched, unfortunate, unhappy, counteractive and, perhaps, even disastrous, they are not unusual, exceptional, rare or even uncommon. Many other persons who have endured similar experiences in their lives have not resorted to such violent and savage behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-12\">{\u00b6 78} \u201cThe panel, therefore, finds nothing in the defendant\u2019s character, background, and history to mitigate the barbarous, inhumane and pitiless massacre of this unfortunate, hapless eighty-seven year old lady.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-13\">{\u00b6 79} R.C. 2929.04(B) required the three-judge panel to weigh the aggravating circumstances against the \u201cnature and circumstances of the offense, the history, character, and background of the offender,\u201d and other mitigating factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>set forth in R.C. 2929.04(B)(1) through (7). A careful reading of the panel\u2019s opinion demonstrates that it found that defendant\u2019s history, character, and background were entitled to no weight in mitigation. This was a proper conclusion. See <em>State v. Stumpf </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 95, 101, 512 N.E.2d 598; <em>State v. Steffen </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 111, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">{\u00b6 80} The panel\u2019s remark that it found \u201cnothing in the defendant\u2019s character, background, and history to mitigate the barbarous, inhuman and pitiless massacre\u201d was an unnecessary reference to the nature of the offense. However, this reference and other misstatements in the sentencing opinion are harmless error. The panel properly weighed the aggravating circumstances against the only mitigating factor that it found, defendant\u2019s limited intellectual abilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">{\u00b6 81} Finally, defendant claims that the panel improperly discounted mitigating evidence of his \u201cdisastrous\u201d life and experiences, and ignored the mitigating fact that giving defendant \u201cthe maximum consecutive sentences would have rendered him first <em>eligible </em>for parole at age 82.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) There is \u201cng requirement\u201d that the trial court explain \u201chow it decides how much weight to give to any one factor.\u201d Moreover, \u201c[t]he weight, if any, given to a mitigating factor is a matter for the discretion of the individual decisionmaker.\u201d <em>State v. Filiaggi, </em>86 Ohio St.3d 230, 245, 714 N.E.2d 867. Thus, the panel could reasonably assign whatever weight, if any, thought to be appropriate for that mitigating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">{\u00b6 82} Furthermore, our independent reassessment of the sentence will eliminate the effect of any deficiencies found in a trial court\u2019s sentencing decision. <em>State v. Fox </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 183, 191-192, 631 N.E.2d 124. For these reasons, we reject proposition IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">Weighing of Aggravating Circumstances and Mitigating Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">{\u00b6 83} In proposition of law XIV, defendant argues that his death penalty must be vacated because the aggravating circumstances do not outweigh the mitigating factors. We will address defendant\u2019s argument when we independently review defendant\u2019s death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">Proportionality</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">{\u00b6 84} In proposition of law XIII, defendant argues that the proportionality review of his sentence should not be limited to those cases where the death sentence has actually been imposed. We summarily reject this claim. See <em>State v. Steffen, </em>31 Ohio St.3d 111, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>{\u00b6 85} In proposition of law XV, defendant argues that his death sentence is disproportionate to death sentences in other cases. We will address the proportionality of defendant\u2019s death sentence during our sentence evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Constitutional Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">{\u00b6 86} In proposition of law XI, defendant disputes the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s death-penalty statutes. We reject these claims. See <em>State v. Carter </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 593, 607, 734 N.E.2d 345; <em>State v. Clemons, </em>82 Ohio St.3d at 454, 696 N.E.2d 1009; <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 179, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Independent Sentence Evaluation</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">{\u00b6 87} <em>Aggravating circumstances. </em>The evidence established that defendant was properly convicted of two death-penalty specifications under R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), namely committing murder during an aggravated burglary, and committing murder during an aggravated robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">{\u00b6 88} <em>Mitigation evidence. </em>Defendant called two mitigation witnesses, provided his own unsworn statement, and introduced documentary evidence. His counsel also argued mitigating factors for the panel\u2019s consideration during final argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">{\u00b6 89} Dr. Jeffrey Smalldon, a clinical psychologist, stated that defendant had a long history of learning problems, an extensive history of alcohol and drug abuse, and a history of family alcoholism.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-11\">{\u00b6 90} Defendant attended school in rural Tennessee when the schools were first being integrated. Defendant repeated the first, second, and seventh grades and then dropped out of school. According to Smalldon, defendant\u2019s educational testing results at the ages of 10 and 12 suggested an \u201coverall intellectual functioning somewhere in either the mildly retarded or what\u2019s called the borderline range of intellectual * * * functioning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-12\">{\u00b6 91} Defendant was hit in the head with a baseball bat in 1981. Medical records from the injury showed that defendant suffered \u201canterograde amnesia,\u201d and a variety of symptoms associated with postconcussion syndrome. Defendant did not suffer a skull fracture, although he remained hospitalized for three or four days.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-13\">{\u00b6 92} Testing in 1982 showed that defendant had an IQ of 72. The psychologist administering the IQ test strongly suspected that defendant suffered some degree of \u201corganic or structural brain impairment.\u201d However, defendant never received followup neurological testing to complete the diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-14\">{\u00b6 93} Testing conducted when defendant applied for Social Security disability benefits in 1993 showed that defendant had an IQ of 52. However, Smalldon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>questioned the validity of these test results, since defendant may have been motivated to perform poorly on the test to qualify for disability benefits. Smalldon\u2019s \u201cbest estimate of his IQ, if he was doing his best,\u201d was \u201cprobably at the low end of the borderline range,\u201d in the low 70s.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">{\u00b6 94} Tests administered by Smalldon before trial showed that defendant\u2019s word recognition and spelling were at the first-grade level, and his arithmetic skills were at the third-grade level. According to Smalldon, \u201cthere\u2019s no question * * * [that] Mr. Thomas has very significant intellectual deficits, deficits that place him in the cusp of the mildly retarded and low borderly [borderline] ranges of intellectual functioning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">{\u00b6 95} Other testing showed defendant\u2019s tendency toward very concrete and overly simplistic thinking and \u201cvery poor logical and sequential reasoning abilities.\u201d Further testing showed that defendant suffered from a \u201cdeficit, the sort that\u2019s most frequently associated with the right cerebral hemisphere and * * * spatial orientation,\u201d which Smalldon implied could be related to the injury from the baseball bat in 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">{\u00b6 96} Smalldon stated that defendant was \u201ccapable of planning [the crime] on some level.\u201d However, \u201c[i]f it was * * * an attempt to undertake complex planning it would be without a full appreciation for the long term implications of what he is doing. It would be a here and now kind of focus. So he would be able to plan, but in a very limited way in my opinion.\u201d Smalldon also stated, \u201cI have no reason to believe * * * that Mr. Thomas was unable to distinguish between right from wrong at the time this offense occurred.\u201d Moreover, defendant\u2019s intoxication at the time of the offense would have had the effect of further eroding his behavioral controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">{\u00b6 97} During cross-examination, Smalldon confirmed that he had information on defendant\u2019s criminal record that predated the 1981 baseball bat injury. These offenses included receiving stolen property in 1978, criminal trespass in March 1980, breaking and entering in April 1980, disorderly conduct in June 1980, criminal damaging in August 1980, menacing in March 1981, breaking and entering in April 1981, shoplifting in May 1981, and disorderly conduct in June 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-11\">{\u00b6 98} Dr. Janice Ort, a clinical psychologist, conducted psychological testing on defendant. Defendant \u201cscored in the mentally retarded range of intellectual functioning\u201d on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale \u2014 Revised (\u201cWAIS-R\u201d) test. Defendant\u2019s score fell \u201csomewhere within about the range of 65 to 69.\u201d However, Ort felt that after \u201cobserving his behavior and his level of engagement in this test, it was very likely that that was somewhat of an underestimation of his actual level of intellectual functioning.\u201d Ort stated that defendant \u201cwould feign sleeping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>during some of the administrations and had to be aroused to participate and to answer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">{\u00b6 99} Defendant scored even lower on the Stanford-Binet test, with a composite score of 58. Defendant\u2019s scores showed that his \u201cvocabulary was at the age equivalent of 7 years old, while his comprehension abilities were at an age equivalent level of an 8 year old.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">{\u00b6 100} According to Ort, defendant reported auditory hallucinations and \u201coften heard the devil speaking to him.\u201d Defendant described the devil as \u201ca brother of his who had been killed by his father.\u201d In response to a number of questions, defendant stated that it was \u201chis brother who seemed to be the voice of the devil, who seemed to be responsible for the troubles in his life.\u201d Defendant also described memory losses that were related to substance abuse, a relatively high number of somatic complaints, bizarre sensory experiences, strong feelings of persecution, and strong feelings of alienation.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">{\u00b6 101} Defendant\u2019s responses to the Rorschach inkblot test indicated that \u201chis thinking is seriously disturbed, that it\u2019s characterized by very flawed judgment, flawed conceptualizations and often includes disorganized and inconsistent decision making patterns.\u201d Testing indicated that defendant is \u201cnot bothered by a lot of the internal states and feelings that tend to motivate most people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">{\u00b6 102} Defendant attended segregated schools in Tennessee until the fourth grade. Defendant did not receive any kind of special education for his learning disabilities because such programs were not available when he was in school. Defendant\u2019s school record shows that he received mostly C\u2019s and F\u2019s until he dropped out of school the year after his second year in the seventh grade. After reviewing all of his previous IQ test scores, Ort stated that \u201cit\u2019s likely * * \u2022 * that his full scale IQ falls somewhere within the high 60\u2019s to very low 70\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">{\u00b6 103} Defendant was one of nine children. Defendant\u2019s father was an alcoholic, and the family was impoverished. Everyone in the family would often cut cotton to help supplement the family\u2019s income. One of defendant\u2019s brothers threatened other family members throughout their lives. He eventually threatened their father, who killed him in self-defense. Another brother was reported to have been institutionalized in Chicago. Defendant\u2019s mother was a very religious woman, and he described her as \u201csanctified.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">{\u00b6 104} Defendant described his substance abuse as primarily alcohol, although in his thirties he used marijuana and crack. In Ort\u2019s opinion, defendant ' \u201chas an alcohol dependence problem, a cannabis problem, cocaine dependence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">{\u00b6 105} Ort also found that defendant has \u201ca personality disorder\u201d that does not meet any of the \u201cspecific diagnostic criteria, so he\u2019s diagnosed with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>personality disorder not otherwise specified.\u201d Ort stated that defendant\u2019s \u201cfunctioning falls probably more in the borderline range of functioning towards the lower end.\u201d Moreover, Ort thought it was \u201clikely that his verbally based skills, * * * in terms of comprehension, social judgments, * * * tip more into the range of mental retardation.\u201d However, Ort also stated, \u201cI think he\u2019s capable of knowing right from wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">{\u00b6 106} During cross-examination, Ort agreed that defendant\u2019s criminal record included disorderly conduct, resisting or interfering with arrest, unauthorized use of property, a drug paraphernalia charge in September 1989, attempted breaking and entering in December 1989, and gross sexual imposition in February 1990. Defendant also committed various behavioral infractions (i.e., not completing work assignments and possession of contraband) while imprisoned at the Mansfield and Lebanon Correctional Facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">{\u00b6 107} Defendant was placed into the Volunteers of America halfway house program after being released from prison. Reports indicated that he abstained from alcohol, completed job training, and committed no violations. However, defendant had difficulty maintaining sobriety and staying employed after leaving that structured environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">{\u00b6 108} In his unsworn statement, defendant said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I have hurt anyone, hurt that lady, their peoples. But like I said before, I don\u2019t remember none of this, and that\u2019s the only thing I can say. I\u2019m sorry for what I did. I don\u2019t remember none of this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">{\u00b6 109} During the final argument in the penalty phase, defendant\u2019s counsel argued that if defendant were given a life sentence, his first hope of parole eligibility would occur when he was 82 years old. Counsel also pointed out that six states absolutely prohibit the execution of the mentally retarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">{\u00b6 110} <em>Victim-impact evidence. </em>Following defense mitigation, Rosalyn Na-gel and Carolyn Cook, the victim\u2019s daughters, presented a joint statement. They described their mother as a \u201ckind and gentle lady who treated everyone she met with compassion and understanding.\u201d Newbirt treated defendant with kindness by giving him \u201ca few dollars to perform small jobs in her yard, that she really did not require.\u201d Nagel stated that Newbirt \u201csuffered each of those 30 days in the hospital. And her family, children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren watched her dying and suffered with her each day.\u201d In a separate statement, Cook repeated many of the same sentiments about her mother. She stated that Newbirt was a \u201cdear sweet lady who was where she wanted to be, where she should have been, loving her life and loving her family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">{\u00b6 111} Both statements expressed the daughters\u2019 feelings about the nature of the crime, and defendant\u2019s character. Nagel described the offense as a \u201cdespicable violent crime that was an ultimate act of a bully.\u201d She stated, \u201cEach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>member of our family hopes that he will suffer the same terror as our mother suffered when he entered her bedroom and struck her again and again as she begged for her life.\u201d Cook stated that defendant committed an \u201cunthinkable, unspeakable crime.\u201d About the defendant, she said, \u201cIf given the same set of circumstances, he will commit another unthinkable, unspeakable crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Sentence Evaluation</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">{\u00b6 112} We find nothing in the nature and circumstances of this offense to be mitigating. Defendant broke into Newbirt\u2019s home in the middle of the night, entered her bedroom, brutally attacked Newbirt by hitting her in the head with a hammer, and stole her television. After fleeing, defendant attempted to sell the television. Thus, the facts establish a senseless murder that lacks any mitigating features.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">{\u00b6 113} Defendant\u2019s history and background provide modest mitigating features. Defendant grew up as one of nine children born to a rural, impoverished family in Tennessee. Defendant did poorly in school and dropped out of school completely after the seventh grade. His father was reportedly an alcoholic. One of defendant\u2019s brothers was killed by his father in self-defense. Defendant has a long history of drug and alcohol abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">{\u00b6 114} The statutory mitigating factors are generally inapplicable, including R.C. 2929.04(B)(1) (inducement by the victim); (B)(2) (duress, coercion, or strong provocation), (B)(4) (youth of the offender) \u2014 defendant was 38 at the time of the offense, (B)(5) (lack of a criminal record) \u2014 defendant had a lengthy criminal record including breaking and entering, receiving stolen property and gross sexual imposition, and (B)(6) (accomplice only).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">{\u00b6 115} Defendant\u2019s intellectual deficiencies and possible brain dysfunction do not qualify as a mental disease or defect under R.C. 2929.04(B)(3). See <em>State v. Gumm </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 413, 432, 653 N.E.2d 253. However, defendant\u2019s limited intellect is entitled to significant weight in mitigation under R.C. 2929.04(B)(7). Here, we wish to emphasize that the consideration of a defendant\u2019s intellectual deficiencies under the (B)(7) (catchall) rather than (B)(3) (mental disease) does not lessen the importance attributed to the evidence during the weighing process. <em>State v. Otte </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 555, 567, 660 N.E.2d 711 (in weighing the mitigation potential of addiction under [B][7], it did \u201cnot matter under which statutory category it was considered\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">{\u00b6 116} On June 20, 2002, the United States Supreme Court ruled that execution of mentally retarded persons convicted of capital crimes is unconstitutional. <em>Atkins v. Virginia </em>(2002), 536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335. Of the states that currently prohibit execution of the mentally retarded, the majority define \u201cmental retardation\u201d in terms of an IQ of 70 or below. See, e.g., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>Neb.Rev.Stat. 28-105.01(2), N.M. Stat. 31-20A-2.1, N.C.Stat. 15A-2005, S.D. Codified Laws 23A-27A-26.1, Tenn.Code 39-13-203(b), Wash.Rey.Code 10.95.030(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">{\u00b6 117} Clinical definitions of mental retardation require subaverage intellectual functioning, and significant limitations in adaptive skills such as communication, self-care, and self-direction that become manifest before age eighteen. We note that there was little evidence in the record regarding defendant\u2019s adaptive skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">{\u00b6 118} \u201cMild mental retardation\u201d is typically used to describe people with an IQ level of 50 or 55 to approximately 70.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> According to Dr. Smalldon, defendant\u2019s IQ was in the very low 70s, placing him on the cusp of the mildly retarded and low borderline ranges of intellectual functioning. Dr. Ort provided similar testimony and estimated that his IQ was in the \u201chigh 60\u2019s to very low 70\u2019s.\u201d However, evidence of defendant\u2019s mental deficiencies might be traced to his 1981 injury, when Thomas was in his mid-20s, and would therefore not meet the definition of \u201cmental retardation\u201d of most states that prohibit execution of the mentally retarded. Although the trial court found that defendant\u2019s 1981 baseball bat injury had no lasting effect, the trial court found that defendant is not retarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">{\u00b6 119} We also note that experts administering other tests believed at times that defendant was feigning mental retardation. For example, testing conducted when defendant applied for Social Security disability benefits in 1993 showed that defendant had an IQ of 52, but Smalldon questioned the validity of these tests since defendant may have been motivated to perform poorly on the test to qualify for disability benefits. On the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised test, Ort testified that defendant\u2019s score fell \u201csomewhere within about the range of 65 to 69.\u201d However, Ort believed that after \u201cobserving his behavior and his level of engagement in this test, that that was somewhat of an underestimation of his actual level of intellectual functioning,\u201d since defendant \u201cwould feign sleeping during some of the administrations and had to be aroused to participate and answer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">{\u00b6 120} Accordingly, we conclude that the expert testimony did not establish that defendant was mentally retarded. However, if defendant has additional information to present under the new test set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Atkins v. Virginia, </em>he is free to file for post-conviction relief under the standards set forth by this court in <em>State v. Lott, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 303, 2002-Ohio-6625, 779 N.E.2d 1011, decided today.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>{\u00b6 121} Further, despite his low IQ and head injuries, defendant was able to distinguish right from wrong as noted by Smalldon and Ort, who examined him. Cf. <em>State v. Gumm, </em>73 Ohio St.3d at 432-433, 653 N.E.2d 253; <em>State v. Hill </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 313, 335, 595 N.E.2d 884. Ort agreed that despite his mental deficiencies, defendant was capable of functioning in the community. Evidence also indicates that defendant was intoxicated or on drugs when he murdered Newbirt, and thus his drug and alcohol abuse significantly contributed to his behavior on the night of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">{\u00b6 122} Defendant\u2019s unsworn statement provides only slight mitigation. In his unsworn statement, defendant stated that he did not remember what he did on the night of the crime, so he expressed sorrow \u201cif I have hurt anyone.\u201d The evidence does not suggest any other mitigating factors under R.C. 2929.04(B)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">{\u00b6 123} In summary, we find that the aggravating circumstances, i.e., the murder was committed during a burglary and a robbery, outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. Undoubtedly, defendant\u2019s intellectual deficiencies and difficult childhood are entitled to significant weight in mitigation. Moreover, defendant\u2019s alcohol and substance abuse affected his judgment and played a role in the murder. However, the facts surrounding the aggravating circumstances show a brazen, callous robbery and burglary committed in connection with the brutal murder of a helpless, 87-year-old lady. Therefore, we find that the death sentence in this case is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">{\u00b6 124} Finally, we find that the death penalty imposed for the aggravated murder of Newbirt is appropriate when compared with other burglary-murder and robbery-murder cases. See <em>State v. Jones </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 403, 739 N.E.2d 300; <em>State v. Stallings </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 280, 731 N.E.2d 159; <em>State v. Spivey </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 405, 692 N.E.2d 151; <em>State v. Murphy </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 554, 605 N.E.2d 884; <em>State v. Slagle </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 597, 605 N.E.2d 916; <em>State v. Lott, </em>51 Ohio St.3d 160, 555 N.E.2d 293; and <em>State v. Barnes </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 203, 25 OBR 266, 495 N.E.2d 922.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">{\u00b6 125} Accordingly, we affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions and sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b538-10\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, J.J.
