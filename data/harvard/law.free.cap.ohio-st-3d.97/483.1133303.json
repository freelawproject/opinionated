V(4)(G) (failing to cooperate in the disciplinary process). The board recommended that respondent be suspended indefinitely from the practice of law in Ohio. We agree that respondent committed this misconduct and, since we have insufficient evidence of any mitigating medical condition from which respondent may suffer, we find that an indefinite suspension is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">{\u00b6 3} In June 1999, respondent agreed to represent an incarcerated client in his attempt to obtain early release from prison. By June 2000, the client had paid respondent a total of $825, and despite the client\u2019s repeated efforts to contact respondent about her progress, she had still filed nothing in his case. The client complained to relator, Disciplinary Counsel, on June 18, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">{\u00b6 4} The next day, respondent wrote to her client and offered to file a motion to reduce his sentence. Her letter indicated that she had spoken to the common pleas judge and that he stated that he had already denied three motions for the client\u2019s shock probation or early release. The letter also reported that the judge had indicated his willingness to entertain respondent\u2019s motion to reduce her client\u2019s sentence. The judge to whom respondent claimed to have spoken later denied the motion on the ground that he lacked jurisdiction to reduce a criminal sentence. Respondent never returned any of the fees the client paid to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">{\u00b6 5} Another client paid respondent $250 in November 2000 to obtain a dissolution of the client\u2019s marriage. Respondent never filed anything in her client\u2019s case, and her client was repeatedly unable to reach her. The client ultimately had to retain other counsel, and respondent never repaid the client\u2019s money.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">{\u00b6 6} Relator filed a complaint on June 11, 2001, charging respondent with having violated the Code of Professional Responsibility. Respondent answered this complaint pro se by admitting some allegations and adding some new information; however, her responses mostly repeated the statement \u201cI am not fully apprised of the situation.\u201d Relator later amended the complaint to allege <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>that respondent had violated Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G) by not cooperating in relator\u2019s investigation. Respondent was served the amended complaint but did not amend her answer.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ABQ\">Jonathan E. Coughlan, Disciplinary Counsel, and Claudia Herrington, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">{\u00b6 7} The board scheduled a panel hearing in the matter for May 24, 2002, and sent notice to the parties, but respondent did not appear. Upon review of the testimony and exhibits, the panel found the facts as described, and concluded that respondent had violated the cited Disciplinary Rules. The panel also denied relator\u2019s motion for a psychiatric examination pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(7)(C) because no medical evidence supported the motion and respondent had opposed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">{\u00b6 8} In addition, the panel found that respondent had not cooperated in the disciplinary process. She failed to respond to several requests for information during relator\u2019s investigation. She also failed to appear in response to relator\u2019s subpoena for her deposition. And despite the panel chair\u2019s determined efforts, she participated in only one of seven prehearing conferences conducted in preparation for the panel hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">{\u00b6 9} In recommending a sanction, the panel considered respondent\u2019s failure to make restitution to her clients and pattern of neglect as aggravating factors and her lack of a prior disciplinary record as a mitigating factor. The panel recommended that respondent receive an indefinite suspension. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings of misconduct and its recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">{\u00b6 10} We agree that respondent violated DR 1-102(A)(4), (5), and (6); 6-101(A)(3); and 7-101(A)(l), (2), and (3); and Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G) and that her license should be indefinitely suspended. Neglect of legal matters and the failure to cooperate in an ensuing disciplinary process generally warrant an indefinite suspension from the practice of law unless mitigating circumstances warrant a lesser sanction. <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Kieft </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 429, 763 N.E.2d 1167, and <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Judge </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 331, 763 N.E.2d 114. No extenuating circumstances have been sufficiently shown in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">{\u00b6 11} Accordingly, respondent is hereby indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in Ohio. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b693-11\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
