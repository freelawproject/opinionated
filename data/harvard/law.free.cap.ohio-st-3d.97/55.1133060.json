The Court of Appeals for Franklin County affirmed his conviction and sentence. <em>State v. Burke </em>(Dec. 28, 1993), Franklin App. No. 90AP-1344, 1993 WL 541653. We affirmed the court of appeals\u2019 judgment. <em>State v. Burke </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 399, 653 N.E.2d 242. The Supreme Court of the United States denied certiorari. <em>Burke v. Ohio </em>(1996), 517 U.S. 1112, 116 S.Ct. 1336, 134 L.Ed.2d 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">{\u00b6 3} On May 22, 2001, Burke\u2019s counsel filed an App.R. 26(B) application in the court of appeals. App.R. 26(B)(5) requires that the applicant show \u201ca genuine issue as to whether the applicant was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel on appeal.\u201d Burke claimed that he had been denied effective assistance by reason of his appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise 20 issues on direct appeal. The court of appeals examined each of Burke\u2019s contentions and found that they failed to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue as to appellate counsel\u2019s effectiveness. The court therefore denied Burke\u2019s application. <em>State v. Burke </em>(Nov. 15, 2001), Franklin App. No. 90AP-1344, 2001 WL 1426433.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">{\u00b6 4} In his first proposition of law, Burke contends that he did raise a genuine issue and that his application should therefore have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">{\u00b6 5} <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, establishes the standard for judging ineffective-assistance claims. The two-part <em>Strickland </em>test, we have held, \u201cis the appropriate standard to assess a defense request for reopening under App.R. 26(B)(5).\u201d <em>State v. Spivey </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 24, 25, 701 N.E.2d 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">{\u00b6 6} Under <em>Strickland, </em>a defendant claiming ineffective assistance of counsel \u201cmust show that counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d Id. at 687-688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. He must also show that the ineffective representation prejudiced his case: \u201cThe defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d Id. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. See, also, <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraphs two and three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">{\u00b6 7} Under <em>Strickland, </em>a court must apply \u201ca heavy measure of deference to counsel\u2019s judgments,\u201d 466 U.S. at 691, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, and \u201cindulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d Id. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Moreover, since the basis of Burke\u2019s claim is counsel\u2019s failure to raise certain issues on appeal, we note that appellate counsel need not raise every possible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>issue in order to render constitutionally effective assistance. See <em>Jones v. Barnes </em>(1983), 463 U.S. 745, 103 S.Ct. 3308, 77 L.Ed.2d 987.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">{\u00b6 8} The court of appeals, applying <em>Strickland, </em>concluded that Burke\u2019s application failed to raise any genuine issue of ineffective assistance of counsel. We agree. We therefore overrule Burke\u2019s first proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">{\u00b6 9} In his second proposition of law, Burke contends that the court of appeals erroneously denied his request for an evidentiary hearing on the application, see App.R. 26(B)(8), and his related requests for discovery, funds to retain an expert witness regarding ineffective assistance of counsel, and appointment of counsel. He contends that the court should have held a hearing to determine whether, under all the circumstances, appellate counsel\u2019s conduct was sound strategy or deficient performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">{\u00b6 10} This proposition lacks merit. The court of appeals carefully reviewed each of the 20 issues Burke wishes to raise on a reopened appeal. Four of them simply lacked support in the trial record. Clearly, declining to raise claims without record support cannot constitute ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. See <em>State v. Hill </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 571, 573, 740 N.E.2d 282. Hence, there was no need to inquire into the circumstances surrounding counsel\u2019s failure to raise these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">{\u00b6 11} Nor was Burke entitled to a hearing to determine the facts underlying the claims themselves, for \u201cthe effectiveness of appellate counsel [cannot] be judged by adding new matter to the record and then arguing that counsel should have raised these new issues revealed by this newly added material.\u201d <em>State v. Moore </em>(2001), <em>93 </em>Ohio St.3d 649, 650, 758 N.E.2d 1130.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">{\u00b6 12} The court of appeals determined that appellate counsel\u2019s failure to raise ten other claims was not deficient performance because four were barred by res judicata, while six were not supported by existing law. Finally, the court determined that counsel\u2019s failure to raise six other claims was not prejudicial under <em>Strickland. </em>Again, there was no need to inquire into the circumstances surrounding appellate counsel\u2019s decision not to raise these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">{\u00b6 13} Finally, as to the appointment of counsel, Burke was, in fact, represented by counsel on his App.R. 26(B) application. See <em>Moore, </em>93 Ohio St.3d at 650, 758 N.E.2d 1130.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">{\u00b6 14} The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b265-13\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
