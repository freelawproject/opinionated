Williams claimed that the officers violated his Fourth Amendment rights by using deadly force while arresting him. The officers moved for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity. The district court denied their motions, and the officers now appeal. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 29, 2012, Williams drove from Georgia to South Carolina to visit a relative. His six-year-old son was with him. When Williams and his son arrived in South Carolina, they stopped at a gas station. There, Williams ran into an acquaintance, Anthony Ancrum, who needed a ride to his apartment. Ancrum's apartment complex was nearby, and Williams offered to drive him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On the way to the apartment complex, Williams crossed paths with Officer Heroux, who was on duty in a patrol car. Heroux ran Williams's license plate through dispatch and learned that the plate had been stolen. He followed Williams into the parking lot of the apartment complex, where he turned on his blue lights. In response, Williams pulled into a parking space. Heroux got out to approach him. Two other officers, Kyle Strickland and Walter Criddle, arrived on the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   What happened over the next several seconds forms the heart of this appeal. When Heroux was about ten feet from Williams's car, Williams shifted the car into reverse and cut the wheel, causing the front end of the car to swivel in Heroux's direction. Heroux, believing himself to be in danger, stepped back and drew his gun. At the same time, Strickland started walking toward Williams's car. Williams then put the car in drive, straightened out, and drove toward Strickland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Heroux and Strickland opened fire on the car. Crucially, it is not clear-at this stage-how far Williams got before Heroux and Strickland started shooting. He may have been headed toward Strickland. He may have been passing by Strickland, such that Strickland was alongside the car and out of the car's trajectory. Or he may have already driven past Strickland, such that Strickland, like Heroux, was behind the car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   One of Heroux's shots hit Williams in the back.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Williams lost control of the car and crashed into a tree. He was airlifted to the hospital for emergency surgery, after which he was placed in a medically induced coma. Despite several subsequent surgeries,\n   Williams has, among other things, \"lost the full and proper function of his bowels, lungs, and other bodily systems.\" J.A. 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Years later, Williams was charged with three counts of assault and battery related to the incident. He pleaded guilty. As part of his plea deal, he admitted that he had deliberately rotated the car in Heroux's direction and that he had driven towards Strickland. Notably, Williams also agreed as part of his plea deal that the officers had started shooting only after his car had driven past them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2015, Williams filed a \u00a7 1983 suit against Strickland, Heroux, and other defendants who are no longer parties to the action. He alleged that by firing on him during the course of his arrest, the officers had subjected him to excessive force, violating his rights under the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After discovery, Strickland and Heroux each moved for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity. In relevant part, the officers argued that they were entitled to summary judgment because the undisputed facts showed that they had not violated Williams's clearly established rights. More specifically, they argued that when they opened fire on Williams, they believed that Williams was about to hit Strickland with his car; under those circumstances-according to the officers-Williams had no clearly established right to be free from the use of deadly force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The district court denied the officers' motion. The court determined that a reasonable jury, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Williams, could conclude that when the officers discharged their weapons, Williams's car was either (a) in the process of passing Strickland or (b) already past Strickland. According to the district court, if either (a) or (b) were true, then the officers' use of deadly force would have violated rights that we clearly established in\n   <em>\n    Waterman v. Batton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9170951\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/393/471/\">\n    393 F.3d 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 2005). Since a reasonable jury could conclude that the officers had acted in a way that violated Williams's clearly established rights, the district court held that the officers were not entitled to summary judgment. The officers now appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Our first task here is to determine whether, and to what extent, we may subject the district court's order to appellate review. Generally, our jurisdiction is limited to final decisions of the district court.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Martin v.

This means that we cannot normally review a district court's order denying summary judgment, since orders denying summary judgment are interlocutory, not final.\n   <em>\n    Hensley v.

There are, however, exceptions. One exception is the \"collateral order doctrine,\" which \"permits appellate review of a small class of orders that are conclusive, that resolve important questions separate from the merits, and that are effectively\n   unreviewable on appeal from the final judgment in the underlying action.\"\n   <em>\n    Adams v.

Our review of such orders is limited to a narrow legal question: if we take the facts as the district court gives them to us,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and we view those facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, is the defendant still entitled to qualified immunity?\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

But our review may reach only one question: would the officers be entitled to qualified immunity if a jury concluded that they had fired on Williams when they were no longer in the trajectory of Williams's car? We turn to that question now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Qualified immunity \"protects government officials from liability for violations of constitutional rights that were not clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Iko\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5896808\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/535/225/#p234\">\n    535 F.3d at 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Given this standard, we must determine two things. First, if Strickland and Heroux fired on Williams after they were no longer in the path of Williams's car, did they violate Williams's Fourth Amendment right to freedom from excessive force? Second, as of June 29, 2012, was it clearly established that using deadly force against Williams after the officers were no longer in the car's trajectory would violate Williams's right to freedom from excessive force?\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The answer to both questions is yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Fourth Amendment prohibits law enforcement officers from using excessive force to make a seizure.\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

Batton\n   </em>\n   , a case that bears striking similarities to the one at hand. There, we held that officers who used deadly force against the driver of a car had not violated the Fourth Amendment when, in the aftermath of a high-speed chase (during which the driver had reportedly tried to run an officer off the road), the officers were standing in or immediately adjacent to the car's forward trajectory, and the car \"lurched forward\" and \"began to accelerate,\" such that the officers reasonably believed that the car was going to run them over \"in approximately one second.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9170951\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/393/471/\">\n    393 F.3d at 474-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 475 n.6. We also held that the same officers\n   <em>\n    had\n   </em>\n   violated the Fourth Amendment to the extent that they started to use deadly force, or continued to use deadly force, once the car had driven by them-i.e., once it was no longer reasonable for them to believe that the car was about to run them (or their fellow officers) over.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9170951\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/393/471/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9170951\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/393/471/\">\n    at 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Therefore, the officers are not entitled to summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity, and the district court correctly denied their motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Ancrum, too, was injured, but he is not party to this action.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    We note that Heroux brings an additional appeal, separate from Strickland. Below, Heroux moved for summary judgment on the ground that Williams's claim against him was untimely. The district court denied his motion. He asks us to reverse. But a denial of summary judgment on statute-of-limitations grounds is an interlocutory order, and in general, such orders are not immediately appealable.\n    <em>\n     Cf.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Martin Marietta Corp. v. Gould, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11929170\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/70/768/#p769\">\n     70 F.3d 768\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 769-70 (4th Cir. 1995) (reviewing order denying summary judgment on statute-of-limitations grounds because the district court had certified its order for appeal). Heroux fails to advance any argument as to why we should-or may-exercise appellate jurisdiction over the district court's rejection of his statute-of-limitations defense in this case. Accordingly, we leave that portion of the district court's order undisturbed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    This is not to say that we are strictly confined to the four corners of the district court's order: we may assume some facts when the district court does not explicitly state them, provided that we draw all inferences in the plaintiff's favor.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Smith v.
