Thuraissigiam fled his home country in June 2016 and made his way to Mexico. On February 17, 2017, Thuraissigiam crossed the border into the United States. Late that night, he was arrested by a CBP officer four miles west of the San Ysidro, California, port of entry, 25 yards north of the border.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   DHS placed Thuraissigiam in expedited removal proceedings. Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201225\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A)(ii), CBP referred Thuraissigiam for an interview with an asylum officer after he indicated a fear of persecution in Sri Lanka. On March 9, an asylum officer from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\") interviewed Thuraissigiam and determined that he had not established a credible fear of persecution. A supervisor approved the decision. Thuraissigiam then requested review by an IJ, who affirmed the negative credible fear finding in a check-box decision and returned the case to DHS for Thuraissigiam's removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III. District Court Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In January 2018, Thuraissigiam filed a habeas petition in federal district court, naming as respondents DHS, several of its constituent agencies, and individual agency officials. Thuraissigiam argued that his \"expedited removal order violated his statutory, regulatory, and constitutional rights,\" sought to vacate the order, and requested relief in the form of a \"new,\n   meaningful opportunity to apply for asylum and other relief from removal.\" Thuraissigiam alleged that in Sri Lanka he had been harassed for supporting a Tamil political candidate. In 2007, he was \"detained and beaten\" by Sri Lankan army officers, and told not to support the candidate. In 2014, after Thuraissigiam continued to support the candidate, government intelligence officers kidnapped, bound, and beat him during an interrogation about his political activities. Thuraissigiam alleged that he \"was lowered into a well, simulating drowning, threatened with death, and then suffocated, causing him to lose consciousness.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Thuraissigiam also made various factual allegations about the expedited removal procedures to which he was subject after being apprehended. For one, he alleged that the asylum officer failed to \"elicit all relevant and useful information bearing on whether the applicant has a credible fear of persecution or torture\" in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20208.30\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) and \"failed to consider relevant country conditions evidence\" in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201225\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B)(v) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20208.30\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2). Thuraissigiam also alleged that there were \"communication problems\" between the asylum officer, Thuraissigiam, and the translator, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20208.30\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)-(2). Thuraissigiam alleged that the IJ hearing included the same procedural and substantive flaws, and that at both hearings, he was unaware whether \"information he offered would be shared with the Sri Lankan government.\" Thuraissigiam's petition asserted two causes of action:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   First, DHS' credible fear screening deprived Thuraissigiam \"of a meaningful right to apply for asylum\" and other forms of relief, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201225\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1), its implementing regulations, and the United States Convention Against Torture, implemented in the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (\"FARRA\"), Pub.

The asylum officer and IJ also violated those statutes \"by applying an incorrect legal standard\" to Thuraissigiam's credible fear application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Second, the asylum officer and IJ violated Thuraissigiam's rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment by \"not providing him with a meaningful opportunity to establish his claims, failing to comply with the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, and in not providing him with a reasoned explanation for their decisions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The district court dismissed the habeas petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Thuraissigiam v.

Next, the court rejected Thuraissigiam's Suspension Clause arguments. Although the court concluded that Thuraissigiam could invoke the Suspension Clause, it held that the statute's \"strict restraints\" on habeas review of expedited removal orders did not effectively suspend the writ of habeas corpus and were therefore constitutionally sound.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    at 1082-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Thuraissigiam timely appealed the district court's dismissal and moved for a stay of removal pending appeal.
