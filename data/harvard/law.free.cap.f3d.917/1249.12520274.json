Plaintiff-Appellant automobile repair shops (the \"Body Shops\") claim that the Defendant-Appellee Insurance Companies colluded to lower repair prices by improperly pressuring the shops to lower prices and by threatening to boycott those who do not comply. The Body Shops claim a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   price-fixing conspiracy and a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   conspiracy to boycott. They also bring several state law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The cost of repairing a damaged vehicle is primarily based on labor and material costs. Repair shops can consult estimating guides to assist in calculating their labor rates but there is no standard way of determining a shop's labor rate. Within the category of labor costs, variables such as overhead, shop size and capacity, repair volume, and expertise affect each shop's rate. Market considerations, such as the prevailing labor rates within the geographic area of the shop, can dominate that cost. Material costs are driven by the cost of repairing or replacing damaged parts. Parts can be sourced from the original manufacturer, an aftermarket company, a salvage yard, or a parts refurbisher. Alfred M. Thomas &amp; Michael Jund,\n   <em>\n    Collision Repair and Refinishing: A Foundation Course for Technicians\n   </em>\n   7 (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Body Shops are a group of professional automobile repair companies that provide collision repair services to individuals insured by the Insurance Companies. Accepting the factual allegations in the complaint\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff-as required by the Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) posture of this case-the Body Shops derive seventy to ninety-five percent of their revenue from customers who pay via insurance and the Insurance Companies account for sixty-five to eighty-five percent of the insurance market in each of the relevant states. The Body Shops broadly allege that the Insurance Companies-with Defendant-Appellee State Farm as their leader-have combined or conspired to depress the amounts they pay for auto repairs performed on behalf of their insureds. According to the Body Shops, the Insurance Companies accomplish this in a number of ways.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   First, the Body Shops allege that each of the Insurance Companies use a formal agreement system called \"direct repair programs\" or \"DRPs.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In exchange for entering into a DRP, the several Insurance Companies each agrees to list a shop as a \"preferred provider\" for its insureds which, at least in theory, generates increased business for the shop. In return, the shop agrees to certain concessions regarding, among other things, the \"market rate\" at which they are entitled to be reimbursed for labor costs. State Farm sets its market rate using an electronic survey of the shops in a particular geographic area and advises the Body Shops that they will pay no more than the market rate. In addition, the other Insurance Companies advise the Body Shops that\n   they will pay no more than State Farm. The Body Shops allege, primarily, that the survey is methodologically unsound,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   that State Farm manipulates the survey to achieve an artificial rate, that State Farm will contact a shop and demand that they lower their rates, that State Farm will threaten-and effectuate-removal from the \"preferred providers\" list if a shop attempts to raise its rate, and that State Farm attempts to prohibit discussions among repair shops about their rates on the theory that such discussions constitute illegal price-fixing. The Body Shops allege that the market rate is enforced even against those shops which are not signatories to a DRP.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Additionally, the Body Shops allege that the Insurance Companies have combined or conspired to depress the amounts they pay for replacement parts on damaged vehicles. According to the Body Shops, the Insurance Companies refuse to pay for \"original equipment manufacturer\" parts, which-because they are designed by the car manufacturer to fit the precise make and model of the damaged car-are more expensive. Rather, the Body Shops are required to use either \"aftermarket\" parts designed by third-parties or \"salvaged\" parts from other wrecked vehicles. These parts require extra time to install-which the Insurance Companies do not pay for-and cannot be guaranteed as safe by the Body Shops. The Insurance Companies also allegedly: utilize industry-standard databases\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   -which identify \"target\" costs for certain repairs-only when financially advantageous to them; often refuse to pay for necessary repairs; routinely refuse to reimburse the cost of certain materials; mandate participation in their parts procurement process; and force discount programs on the Body Shops. The Body Shops argue that these actions constitute a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   price-fixing violation of the Sherman Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Lastly, the Body Shops allege that the Insurance Companies engage in a practice known as \"steering,\" in which they discourage their insureds from patronizing a noncompliant repair shop through \"misrepresentation, insinuation, and casting aspersions.\" These practices allegedly include telling insureds that a particular repair shop: is not on the preferred provider list; has had quality control issues; charges more than other shops in the area (and that they will not pay the excess amount); takes longer than other shops (and that they will not pay for additional car rental days); and does not perform work that can be guaranteed by the Insurance Companies, even though the Insurance Companies never guarantee any repair work. The Body Shops argue that the Insurance Companies conspire with respect to such steering, constituting a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   group boycott.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Body Shops filed approximately twenty-two similar lawsuits in federal district courts throughout the country.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred all of the actions to the Middle District of Florida (Judge Presnell) where the \"lead case,\"\n   <em>\n    A&amp;E Auto Body, Inc. v. 21st Century Centennial Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 6:14-cv-310, was already pending. Of the twenty-two actions: two-the lead case and one other-were dismissed with prejudice\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and not appealed; four were dismissed and are currently on appeal; and two were dismissed by the district court and then also had their appeals dismissed for lack of prosecution. Of the remaining fourteen, five are the subject of this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As relevant to this appeal, the Body Shops alleged two violations of federal law under the Sherman Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , for price-fixing and group boycotting. They also alleged three causes of action under the laws of the state in which the suits were filed for unjust enrichment, quantum meruit, and tortious interference\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (collectively, the \"State Law Claims\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Insurance Companies moved to dismiss all fourteen cases, the Body Shops filed a consolidated response to which the Insurance Companies replied, and the district court referred the matter to a magistrate judge for a report and recommendation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Pursuant to that referral, the magistrate judge entered a fifty-nine page Report and Recommendation (the \"R&amp;R\"), which concluded that the relevant claims should be dismissed without prejudice. The Body Shops then filed an Omnibus Objection to the R&amp;R (the \"Objection\"), wherein they challenged the magistrate judge's conclusions with respect to some of their claims. The district court overruled the Body Shops' objections to the R&amp;R, adopted the\n   R&amp;R, and dismissed all of the relevant claims without prejudice (the \"Dismissal Order\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather than file amended complaints, the Body Shops appealed the district court's decision with respect to five of the initial actions-two that were filed in New Jersey and one each from Kentucky, Missouri, and Virginia. Those five actions were consolidated on appeal. A divided panel of this Court reversed the district court's decision, holding that the Body Shops had alleged sufficient allegations to survive a motion to dismiss on all of the claims. That decision was vacated when this Court voted to hear the case en banc.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   II. ISSUES ON APPEAL\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The parties were instructed to brief the en banc court on the following issues:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   1) Can a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   illegal price-fixing agreement or conspiracy between and among the several defendant-Insurance Companies plausibly be inferred from the allegations of the complaints in the several cases before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   2) Can a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   illegal agreement or conspiracy between and among the several defendant-Insurance Companies to boycott the plaintiffs' Body Shops plausibly be inferred from the allegations of the complaints in the several cases before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The parties also briefed the state law issues involving the three state law claims-unjust enrichment, quantum meruit, and tortious interference. We address first the federal antitrust claims, including the alleged price-fixing conspiracy and the alleged group boycott, and then the state law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   III. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We review a district court's dismissal of a complaint with prejudice for failure to state a claim\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Am. Dental Ass'n v. Cigna Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4230462\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/605/1283/#p1288\">\n    605 F.3d 1283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1288 (11th Cir. 2010). While we accept the factual allegations in the complaint as true, construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the allegations must state a claim for relief that is plausible, not merely possible.\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    550 U.S. at 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    127 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1974 ;\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

FEDERAL ANTITRUST CLAIMS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    A. The Legal Landscape\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Section One of the Sherman Act, under which both the price-fixing and boycotting claims are brought, provides that \"[e]very contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In addition to that bare bones recital of prohibited behavior, the Supreme Court has long concluded that Congress intended only to prohibit \"unreasonable\" restraints on trade.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Arizona v. Maricopa Cty. Med. Soc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188843\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/332/#p343\">\n    457 U.S. 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 343,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188843\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/332/#p343\">\n    102 S.Ct. 2466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2472-73,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6188843\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/332/#p343\">\n    73 L.Ed.2d 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982). Thus, \u00a7 1 prohibits (1) conspiracies that (2) unreasonably (3) restrain interstate or foreign trade.\n   <em>\n    Spanish Broad. Sys. of Fla., Inc. v. Clear Channel Commc'ns, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9377392\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/376/1065/#p1071\">\n    376 F.3d 1065\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1071 (11th Cir. 2004). Only the first element is at issue on this appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Therefore, because the Body Shops are required to allege facts plausibly suggesting a conspiracy, \"the crucial question is whether the challenged anticompetitive conduct stems from independent decision or from an agreement, tacit or express.\"\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    550 U.S. at 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    127 S.Ct. at 1964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As in this case, the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   was confronted with \"the antecedent question of what a plaintiff must plead in order to state a claim under \u00a7 1 of the Sherman Act.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    at 555-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    127 S.Ct. at 1964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Horizontal Price-Fixing Conspiracy\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   At the outset, we address an issue regarding the complaints. The first is merely an observation of the time-worn principle that it is only the factual allegations contained therein which we must accept as true. The Body Shops' appellate briefing takes undue liberties in construing the inferences that can be fairly read from their pleadings. The district court dismissed these claims without prejudice and, therefore, the Body Shops had an opportunity to amend their complaints to include any additional allegations that may have been omitted from their initial pleadings. Having chosen not to do so, they are not permitted to simply \"insert\" new allegations through their appellate briefing. These gaps-between the allegations of the complaints and the allegations of the appellate briefing-are discussed, where relevant, below.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Body Shops identify several purported plus factors that they contend-in conjunction with their allegations of parallel\n   conduct-warrant an inference of a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   horizontal price-fixing conspiracy. We discuss each\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   of their purported plus factors in turn.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    1. Uniformity of Price\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Body Shops argue in their brief that the Insurance Companies' conduct does \"not result from chance, coincidence, independent responses to common stimuli, or mere interdependence unaided by an advance understanding among the parties\" because they have \"adopt[ed] a uniform price despite variables that would ordinarily result in divergent prices.\" This asserted plus factor consists of two components. First, the defendants must have adopted a uniform price. This component, however, is suggestive only of parallel conduct and, without more, will not justify invoking the plus factor. Accordingly, the uniform price must exist \"despite variables that would ordinarily result in divergent pricing.\" The second component is an indicator of the agreement that makes collusion more plausible than conscious parallelism, thus moving the needle off of equipoise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The sources on which the Body Shops rely make clear the necessity of both components. In\n   <em>\n    Federal Trade Commission v. Cement Institute\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6158992\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/333/683/#p713\">\n    333 U.S. 683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 713,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6158992\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/333/683/#p713\">\n    68 S.Ct. 793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 809,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=92%20L.%20Ed.%201010\">\n    92 L.Ed. 1010\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1948), the Supreme Court inferred an agreement where \"for many years, with rare exceptions, cement has been offered for sale in every given locality at identical prices and terms by all producers.\" But the record evidence in that case established that \"[t]housands of secret sealed bids ha[d] been received by public agencies which corresponded in prices of cement down to a fractional part of a penny.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6158992\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/333/683/#p713\">\n    333 U.S. at 713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6158992\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/333/683/#p713\">\n    68 S.Ct. at 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Likewise, the Body Shops quote a leading antitrust treatise for the idea that an agreement may be present if rivals establish identical prices, but they fail to grapple with the caveat\n   that this is only true where there are \"simultaneous identical bids on a made-to-order product not readily assembled from standard and conventionally priced items.\" Phillip E. Areeda &amp; Herbert Hovenkamp,\n   <em>\n    Antitrust Law\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1434b (3d ed. 2012).\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, while this so-called convergent pricing certainly is-or at least could be-a plus factor, it should only be invoked where we should otherwise expect divergent pricing. Considered in the appropriate light, the differences between the instant case and the case on which the Body Shops rely are substantial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   First, the focus in\n   <em>\n    Cement Institute\n   </em>\n   on \"secret,\" \"sealed,\" and \"simultaneous\" bids is crucial precisely because that is what takes the situation beyond that of mere conscious parallelism: competitors cannot consciously parallel one another if they only learn of the other's price after they have established their own. Perhaps sensing this, the Body Shops' brief argues that all of the Insurance Companies employ the same, identical \"market rate\" which State Farm does not make public. As an initial matter, alleging that State Farm does not publicly disclose the market rate and arguing that it is a secret are two very different things. The fact that State Farm does not issue a press release with the market rate does not foreclose the possibility that it is publicly known. This is a crucial distinction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   There are no factual allegations that the market rate is a secret. Indeed, nowhere in the complaints do the Body Shops suggest that the labor rate is a secret. Quite the opposite, the complaints reveal that State Farm must necessarily tell the rate to every repair shop in a given geographic area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Even if it were possible to share the market rate with the Body Shops while, at the same time, keeping it a secret from the other Insurance Companies, there are no allegations at all that the other Insurance Companies knew what it was in advance. Indeed, rather than allege that all of the Insurance Companies simultaneously approached the Body Shops with an identical market rate (which might possibly indicate that they had communicated in advance), the complaints allege that the other Insurance Companies simply conform to State Farm's rate-whatever that may be. Compl. \u00b6 62 (\"Defendants ... specifically advised the Plaintiff they will pay no more than State Farm pays for labor.\"); Compl. \u00b6 115 (\"[D]efendants [state] that they will conform to State Farm's payment structure.\"). Following the example set by a competitor, without agreeing to do so in advance, is textbook \"price leadership\"-a practice we have repeatedly stated is insufficient to establish the existence of an agreement.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Williamson Oil\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9096102\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/346/1287/#p1301\">\n    346 F.3d at 1301-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"It is well settled in this circuit that evidence of conscious parallelism alone does not permit an inference of conspiracy unless the plaintiff either establishes that ... each defendant engaging in the parallel action acted contrary to its economic self-interest, or offers other 'plus factors' tending to establish that the defendants were not engaging merely in oligopolistic price maintenance or price leadership but rather in a collusive agreement to fix prices\") (internal punctuation and citations omitted);\n   <em>\n    City of Tuscaloosa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11670161\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/158/548/#p571\">\n    158 F.3d at 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[C]onsciously parallel behavior by oligopolists does not in itself support an inference of agreement, of 'a meeting of the minds,' any more strongly than it supports an inference of legal price maintenance or leadership.\"). Price leadership is comprehensively described in the leading antitrust treatise:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   The first firm in a five-firm oligopoly, Alpha, may be eager to lower its price somewhat in order to expand its sales. However, it knows that the other four firms would probably respond to a price cut by reducing their prices to maintain their previous market shares. Unless Alpha believes that it can conceal its price reduction for a time or otherwise gain a substantial advantage from being the first to move, the price reduction would merely reduce Alpha's profits and the profits of the other firms as well.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Such \"oligopolistic rationality\" cannot only forestall rivalrous price reductions, it can also provide for price increases through, for example, price leadership. If the price had for some reason been less than X [the price a monopolist would charge to maximize profits], firm Beta might announce its decision to raise its price to X effective immediately, or in several days, or next season. The other four firms may each choose to follow Beta's lead; if they do not increase their prices to Beta's level, Beta may be forced to reduce its price to their level. Because each of the other firms knows this, each will consider whether it is better off when all are charging the old price or price X. They will obviously choose X when they believe that it will maximize industry profits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Phillip E. Areeda &amp; Herbert Hovenkamp,\n   <em>\n    Antitrust Law\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1429b (4th ed. 2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   With respect to interdependent parallelism like price leadership, the treatise notes: \"The courts are nearly unanimous in saying that mere interdependent parallelism does not establish contract, combination, or conspiracy required by Sherman Act \u00a7 1.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11670161\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/158/548/#p571\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1433a. This follows from the Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   : \"Even 'conscious parallelism,' a common reaction of firms in a concentrated market that recognize their shared economic interests and their interdependence with respect to price and output decisions is not in itself unlawful.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    550 U.S. at 553-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    127 S.Ct. at 1964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotations and punctuation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Further distinguishing our case is the fact that auto body repairs are not the type of \"made-to-order product not readily assembled from standard and conventionally priced items\" where we expect to see divergent pricing. On the contrary, the \"products\" here-cars-are so readily assembled from standard parts that their assembly-line manufacturing set the standard for other industries. That the Body Shops are repairing those cars, rather than assembling them for the first time, does not make the parts used to do so any less standard. And they are so conventionally priced that, as discussed below, the Body Shops believe that the Insurance Companies should not be allowed to deviate from third-party databases that set standardized prices. Indeed, these industry databases not only indicate standardized pricing for parts, but they also estimate repair time (labor) for particular types of repairs which are ordinary and customary repairs. Thus, while convergent pricing where it should otherwise not be expected can undoubtedly serve as a plus factor, none of the indicators to which courts and commentators have traditionally looked to support such a factor-or at least none to which the Body Shops have pointed and none that we can perceive-are present here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Body Shops have not pointed to any plausible reason that one should expect that prices in this market-involving standardized automobile parts and repairs-would be divergent. Quite the contrary, the Body Shops argue that the Insurance Companies should comply with several databases\n   that exist for the sole purpose of establishing standardized pricing. That is, the fact that the Body Shops insist that the Insurance Companies should comply with the prices published in these three separate databases demonstrates that such prices are standardized, and that one should expect convergent prices-not divergent prices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In short, the instant case bears none of the traditional hallmarks of a situation in which uniform pricing is present in an industry where we would otherwise not expect it. Nor are any of the other reasons offered by the Body Shops suggestive of an environment in which we would expect to see divergent pricing. And without an expectation of divergent pricing, all that remains is an allegation of uniform pricing, which is indicative only of parallel conduct. Although the complaints repeatedly allege that the insurance companies have agreed and conspired with respect to price, these allegations have no basis in the facts actually alleged. They are merely conclusions and therefore are an insufficient basis on which to infer a prior agreement.\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    550 U.S. at 557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    127 S.Ct. at 1966\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A] conclusory allegation of agreement at some unidentified point does not supply the facts adequate to show illegality.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In this case, the Body Shops' own allegations put a nail in their coffin. Their own allegations explain why there is uniformity in price-the other Insurance Companies simply tell body shops that they will pay no more than State Farm. This is a rational and legitimate business strategy and one which involves clearly legal price leadership. Accordingly, we reject this plus factor as an indicator of the necessary agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    2. Uniformity of Tactics\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   As its second plus factor, the Body Shops argue that the Insurance Companies have engaged in uniform practices suggestive of an agreement. Several courts have found a plus factor where there is a similarity of language, terms, or conditions used by the alleged co-conspirators that would be improbable absent collusion.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    De Jong Packing Co. v.

Although the Body Shops' briefing describes the Insurance Companies' tactics as \"the same,\" \"identical,\" and part of a \"script[ ],\" the Body Shops' briefing is betrayed by their complaints, which introduce the relevant tactics as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   Through various methods, the [Insurance Companies] have, independently and in concert, instituted numerous methods of coercing the [Body Shops] into accepting less than actual and/or market costs for materials and supplies expended in completing repairs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Compl. \u00b6 63. There is nothing in those allegations to suggest that the Insurance Companies' tactics are uniform or that they use a script.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   None of the actual allegations of the complaints suggest that language used by the several Insurance Companies was the \"same\" or \"identical\" or like a \"script.\" Indeed in none of the five complaints do the words \"same,\" \"identical\" or \"script\" appear in reference to the tactics used. Nor is there any other actual allegation that suggests some uniform practice that is somehow idiosyncratic and not to be expected as within the \"wide swath of rational and competitive business strategy unilaterally prompted by common perceptions of the market.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    550 U.S. at 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    127 S.Ct. at 1964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Not only is there no allegation of identical or similar language, the language actually used in the complaints suggests just the opposite. As noted, \u00b6 63 alleges \"[t]hrough various means\" and \u00b6 64 alleges \"[s]ome of these methods\"-i.e., phrases that do not suggest that all or a substantial group of the Insurance Companies engage in all or most of the methods in strikingly similar ways.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Body Shops argue that the Insurance Companies have engaged in uniform tactics in that they require the Body Shops: to repair faulty parts rather than install replacement parts; to install used or recycled parts; and to offer discounts and concessions. Even if there were considerable uniformity with respect to the Insurance Companies' use of such methods, that would be suggestive of an agreement only if such usage would not plausibly arise from \"independent responses to common stimuli.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    550 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   556 n.4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    127 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1965 n.4 (quoting Areeda and Hovenkamp \u00b6 1425). All of these purported \"highly uniform\" tactics are easily explained by the most common of corporate stimuli: a desire to increase profits. And while some methods of increasing profits could be so idiosyncratic as to be unlikely to arise in the absence of an agreement, this is plainly not the case here. None of these tactics could even be fairly described as novel, let alone idiosyncratic, so as to support an inference of an agreement.

The Body Shops rely upon several alleged tactics which are clearly common, obvious, and mainstream. An inference of prior agreement does not arise from the mere fact that several Insurance Companies adopt policies favoring use of cheaper parts and offering discounts to Insurance Companies.

The D.C. Circuit held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   There is some evidence of parallel behavior by appellees. Construing this evidence in the light most favorable to appellants, it suggests that upon occasion certain appellees used the same labor rate in writing estimates, that they had similar arrangements with repair shops that agreed to do volume work at the low rates used in their estimates, that they conducted surveys of repair shops to determine the average rate charged by shops in particular areas, and that they tended to resist price increases by repair shops. However, these alleged parallel practices, without more, cannot create an inference or a conspiracy among appellees where, as here, the practices are in the economic self-interest of each of the individual appellees. The practices are as consistent with independent as with concerted actions. Unless an insurance company is willing to pay whatever price is charged at any given repair shop, it stands to reason that it would conduct surveys to determine the rates charged by repair shops. It is equally understandable that a company would, in an effort to control costs, resist price increases and write estimates using the lowest rates acceptable to a sufficient number of quality garages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   It also makes economic sense for an insurance company to make arrangements with certain repair shops that agree to do work at the rates used by the company in writing estimates in exchange for volume referrals by the company.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1175587,3628221\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/675/308/\">\n    675 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   334 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Workman v.

All three of these cases so held on the basis of such parallel conduct alone, without the additional nail-in-the-coffin of our plaintiffs' case-i.e., the follow-the-leader practices in our case which conclusively explain why the Insurance Companies here engage in such parallel conduct. As discussed above, it is clearly established that such follow-the-leader practices are legal and do not, by themselves, give rise to an inference of prior agreement. In other words, our case is not only controlled by\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   but our case is\n   <em>\n    a fortiori\n   </em>\n   from the three cited cases in this same context of an insurance company's dealings with automobile repair shops.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, both of the Body Shops' first two purported plus factors-identity of price and identity of tactics-are mere parallel conduct and do not support their attempt to allege the necessary agreement or conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <em>\n    3. Contrary to Economic Interest\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The Body Shops' brief suggests that the Insurance Companies' adherence to State Farm's artificial \"market rate\" and other payment structures is in contradiction to the industry databases, and by implication is against their economic self-interest. Courts have recognized a company's actions that were against its self-interest can constitute a plus factor.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Flat Glass Antitrust Litigation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1319477\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/385/350/#p360\">\n    385 F.3d 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 360 (3d. Cir. 2004). Courts and commentators have further observed that this plus factor often restates interdependence in the context of alleged price-fixing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1319477\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/385/350/#p360\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 361 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1434c1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   This argument exists only by implication because the Body Shops merely entitle the section of their brief \"contrary to [ ]economic self-interest.\" However, they do not explain how the fact that the other Insurance Companies follow the lead of State Farm rather than adhering to the industry databases is against their own self-interest. Nothing in the complaints indicates to us that the actions of the Insurance Companies are against their economic interests. The pages in the complaint cited in the brief do not illuminate the argument either. Moreover, it is hard to imagine how choosing the least costly method of repair, thereby reducing the reimbursement, is contrary to an insurance company's economic self-interest. Thus, we reject this suggested plus factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <em>\n    4. Opportunity to Exchange Information\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Body Shops also assert in their brief that they alleged that the Insurance Companies \"have exchanged or have had the opportunity to exchange information relative to the conspiracy.\" Appellants' En Banc Br. at 27.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the argument they make in their brief to support their assertion is: \"identical labor rates,\n   identical refusal to compensate for the same processes and procedures, identical false excuses for such refusal, uniform adherence to the refusal to alter labor rates until State Farm does is indicative of shared information and agreement overall and agreement on the language to be used in refusing payment for repair services (a 'script').\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In other words, they argue that because the Insurance Companies acted in identical ways, they must have been meeting and exchanging information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   There are two problems with this argument. First, the complaints make no factual allegations that the Insurance Companies either exchanged information, employed identical tactics, followed a script, or declined to pay for the same repairs. Second, even if the actual allegations did indicate considerable uniformity of price and uniformity of tactics, there would be no inference that this was the result of exchange of information for the same reasons discussed above. That is, even if there were considerable uniformity in requiring, for example, repair of parts (not replacement), use of recycled parts (not new), and requiring discounts, such actions just as plausibly result from independent resort to common and rational business practices as from exchange of information. And, as noted above, this is especially true in light of repeated allegations in the complaints that the several Insurance Companies say they will \"conform to State Farm's payment structure.\" Compl. \u00b6 115.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <em>\n    5. Conclusion with respect to Horizontal Price-Fixing Conspiracy\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In sum, the Body Shops have alleged only parallel conduct, and have not alleged\n   any facts supporting plus factors that would tip the scale from equipoise towards conspiracy sufficiently to prevent dismissal of this count.

In other words, as with the price-fixing claim of the Body Shops, their conspiracy to boycott claim requires as a prerequisite sufficient allegations of an agreement or conspiracy. Again the crucial, antecedent question is whether the alleged actions of the Insurance Companies stem from independent actions or from prior agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The boycott allegations in this case are even weaker than the allegations of price-fixing. Neither the \"steering\" allegations nor the \"boycott\" section of the complaint allege even in conclusory fashion that there was an agreement to do so. And even if we incorporate the conclusory allegations of an agreement from the price-fixing sections of the complaint, the instant complaint would still fall short of even the \"few stray statements [that] speak directly of agreement\" which the Supreme Court has held are insufficient.\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    550 U.S. at 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    127 S.Ct. at 1970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The Body Shops have asserted in their appellate briefing facts that are simply unsupportable on this record. Indeed, although the Body Shops have argued on appeal that \"[a]ll of the Defendants utilize the same script containing identical false and misleading steering statements,\" both the word \"script\" and the word \"identical\" are conspicuously absent from the complaints. Quite the contrary, in the only factual allegations with regard to steering insureds away from their shops, the Body Shops allege that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   Examples of this practice include telling insureds and/or claimants that a particular chosen shop is not on the preferred provider list, that quality issues have arisen with that particular shop, that complaints have been received about that particular shop from other consumers, that the shop charges more than any other shop in the area and these additional costs will have to be paid by the consumer, that repairs at the disfavored shop will take much longer than at other, preferred shops and the consumer will be responsible for rental car fees beyond a certain date, and that the Defendant cannot guarantee the work of that shop as it can at other shops.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Compl. \u00b6 83. From this, it is argued in the Body Shops' brief that the Insurance Companies have engaged in \"identical\" tactics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   There is nothing in these allegations that would suggest action in concert or \"rule out the possibility that the defendants were acting independently.\"\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    550 U.S. at 553-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    127 S.Ct. at 1964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There is no allegation that all or most of the Insurance Companies used most or all of the foregoing excuses in urging insureds\n   against patronizing a shop. There is no allegation that the several companies used the same language. There is no allegation suggesting any other uniformity that would be unexpected or idiosyncratic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Moreover, even if there were considerable uniformity with respect to those reasons that an insured should not use a particular shop, there could hardly be reasons more expected or more commonly used than those alleged by the Body Shops. That the shop is not on the preferred provider list, that there are quality issues, that it charges more, and/or that it takes longer are reasons that any company would be expected to use in an effort to persuade an insured not to use a particular shop. The alleged boycotting methods are not so idiosyncratic that they suggest conspiracy. To the contrary, they are methods that would logically be employed by any insurer to dissuade its insureds from using a disfavored shop. In other words, even a considerable uniformity with respect to the use of these reasons would fall well within the \"wide swath of rational and competitive business strategy unilaterally prompted by common perceptions of the market.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    at 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    127 S.Ct. at 1964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   For the same reasons that it forecloses the Body Shops' price-fixing claim,\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   forecloses the Body Shops' group boycott claims; their allegations allege only parallel conduct which is insufficient to create an inference of prior agreement or conspiracy.

Unjust Enrichment Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The Plaintiffs in all four states bring claims of unjust enrichment against these Defendants. Under the laws of the four states relevant here-Kentucky, Missouri, New Jersey, and Virginia-the elements of the cause of action include: (1) the plaintiff conferred a benefit on the defendant; (2) the defendant was aware thereof; and (3) it would be unjust to permit the defendant to retain the benefit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The gist of the Plaintiffs' claims is that the several Body Shops conferred a benefit on the several Insurance Companies, the latter were aware thereof, and allowing the Defendants to retain the benefit without full payment would be unjust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Fatal to these unjust enrichment claims is the fact that each of the five complaints alleges that each Insurance Company advised the Body Shops that it would pay no more than State Farm. Because the Plaintiff in each complaint knew before it undertook the repair that each Defendant-Insurance Company would pay no more than State Farm would pay, it clearly was not unjust for the Insurance Company to pay only that amount and no more. Without satisfying the unjust element, the cause of action fails even if we assume the other elements can be satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The Body Shops' only response to this fatal flaw is that they could not turn away sixty to ninety-five percent of the available repair business,\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   and therefore their contract to accept the amount State Farm would pay was an invalid contract. However, the Body Shops cite no law-in any of the four states-to the effect that market power alone is sufficient to invalidate a contract voluntarily entered into. Our independent research has also uncovered no such case. Moreover, we have already concluded that the Body Shops have failed to allege facts warranting an inference that the Insurance Companies agreed to or engaged in a conspiracy.

To state a cause action for quantum meruit, the Body Shops were required to allege, among other elements, that the circumstances\n   <em>\n    reasonably\n   </em>\n   notified the Insurance Companies that the Body Shops expected to get paid (Virginia and Kentucky) or that they\n   <em>\n    reasonably\n   </em>\n   expected to be compensated (New Jersey).\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   They cannot do so here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   As discussed above, the Body Shops specifically alleged that each of the Insurance Companies informed them that they would pay no more than State Farm. The Body Shops then undertook the repairs. Having fully informed the Body Shops of what they were willing to pay, the circumstances could have only reasonably informed the Insurance Companies that the Body Shops expected to be paid the amount State Farm would pay. This is fatal to the Virginia and Kentucky claims. Likewise, having been fully informed that the Insurance Companies would only pay the amount State Farm would pay, the Body Shops could not have reasonably expected to receive more than that amount. This is fatal to the New Jersey claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The Body Shops have cited no authority-and our independent research has uncovered none-to support their position that they can contract to repair the car for a specified amount, do the repair, and then sue, claiming that they should be paid more. The only analogous case law our research has uncovered suggests just the opposite of the Body Shops' position: when a plaintiff has a reasonable expectation of some amount, they cannot reasonably expect to receive additional compensation and therefore cannot bring suit to recover it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   We conclude that the quantum meruit claims of the Body Shops in the four complaints are wholly without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <em>\n    C. Tortious Inference Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Although we have concluded-as did the district court-that the unjust enrichment and quantum meruit claims of the Body Shops are wholly without merit, the situation with respect to their tortious interference claims is more complicated. The district court expressly adopted and approved the magistrate judge's dismissal of the tortious interference claims as a violation of the group pleading doctrine. The district court held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   Consistent with this Court's prior orders, a general allegation that some unidentified Defendants-or all Defendants-interfered with some unidentified customers of some unnamed plaintiff does not satisfy the pleading standard of\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

Although the district court invoked\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   , we understand its ruling to be based on a very narrow group pleading rationale, rather than a standard-issue\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   -\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   determination of the plausibility of the tortious interference claims in light of the well-pleaded factual allegations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   The gist of the problem with group pleading-as the magistrate judge noted earlier on page 9 of that same June 3 report-is the failure to give fair notice to each named defendant of the claims against it. For example, a complaint may fail to provide fair notice of the claims by failing to specify which defendants interfered with which plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Weiland v. Palm Beach Cty. Sheriff's Office\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054943\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/792/1313/#p1323\">\n    792 F.3d 1313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1323 (11th Cir. 2015). Because the district court rested its dismissal of the tortious interference claims on this narrow group pleading rationale, and because we think the district court will be well situated to determine the status of these claims on\n   remand, we need not address the merits of the tortious interference claims or even the general contours of the doctrine of group pleading. We also do not address the relationship between that doctrine and the\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   -\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   plausibility pleading standard or, for that matter, whether the allegations of tortious interference meet the plausibility standard. We address only the above-quoted narrow basis on which the district court relied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   We cannot agree with the district court that the instant five complaints' failure to name a plaintiff, to identify specific defendants, or to identify specific customers in the allegations relating to tortious interference deprived the Defendants of fair notice. Contrary to the suggestion of the district court, there is no problem with respect to \"some unnamed plaintiff.\" In four of these five cases, there is only one plaintiff and thus it is absolutely clear that the person or entity interfered with is the single named plaintiff in each complaint. Although the fifth case\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   involves four named plaintiffs, they are four body shops located in close proximity to each other in Virginia Beach and Suffolk, Virginia. It is amply clear in this fifth complaint that each Defendant-Insurance Company is alleged to have tortiously interfered with\n   <em>\n    each\n   </em>\n   of these four Virginia body shops. The allegations provide fair notice that each of the Plaintiffs is claiming that each of the named Defendants is tortiously interfering in the manner alleged with the named Plaintiff in each of the four single-plaintiff complaints and with the four named Plaintiffs in the fifth case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   We are also unpersuaded by the district court's concern that the allegations in the complaints concern \"some unidentified Defendants-or all Defendants.\" The substance of the alleged tortious interference is as follows. As alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 107-08 of the representative Quality Auto complaint, each complaint alleges that the named Insurance Companies-by means of a campaign of misrepresentation of facts about poor quality, etc.-have repeatedly steered their insureds away from each named Plaintiff to punish that Plaintiff for complaints about or refusal to submit to the price ceilings and other practices imposed by the named Defendants. Although these allegations are aimed generally at \"the Defendants,\" each complaint stipulates that, \"[w]here the term 'Defendants' is used within this Complaint, 'Defendants' is intended to and does mean each and every Defendant named in the caption above.\" In other words, the named Defendants\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   in each complaint had fair notice that \"each and every\" one of them is alleged to have improperly steered its own insureds away from the named Body Shops in each complaint because that Body Shop was not compliant with that Insurance Company's preferred reimbursement rate and other cost-saving practices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Thus, of the potential deficits identified by the district court-i.e., general allegations about \"unidentified Defendants,\" \"unidentified customers,\" and \"unnamed plaintiff[s]\"-the only possible defect remaining is the failure to identify specific insureds/potential customers who were thus steered. We cannot conclude that the Body Shops' failure to identify particular potential customers who were steered away constitutes a failure to give each defendant fair notice of the claim against it. It is not\n   the potential customer who is the target of the alleged tortious interference; it is the targeted Body Shop. A potential customer may-but very well may not-tell the Body Shop that he or she was steered away. On the other hand, each Insurance Company, or its claims adjusters, will know whether the company engages in such a practice, and will know whether each named Plaintiff in the five complaints was noncompliant with that company's preferred practices and, most important, whether its insureds were steered away from that Plaintiff Body Shop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   In sum, we are not persuaded by the district court's grounds for concluding that the allegations of tortious interference in each of these five cases violated the group pleading doctrine, i.e., failed to give fair notice to each defendant of the claim being made against it. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the district court only with respect to the tortious interference claims in each of these five cases, and we remand for further proceedings. We note that in vacating the judgment of the district court with respect to the tortious interference claim, we have ruled only on the district court's stated group pleading rationale. We note also, because the federal antitrust claims have been eliminated from the case, the district court may well decide to exercise its discretion to decline to exercise pendent jurisdiction of these state law tortious interference claims, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   VI.

An oligopsony market is one in which a cartel of relatively few buyers has significant market power in the buying market. Compared to a competitive market, oligopsony generates infracompetitive\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   input prices and a smaller quantity of the input demanded.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 2002, 2011. Using body shop labor as an example, a simplified causal chain goes like this: A group of auto insurers form a cartel and collectively agree on the maximum price they will pay for body shop labor. The cartel collectively dominates the market for the\n   <em>\n    purchase\n   </em>\n   of body shop labor. The cartel also collectively dominates the market for the\n   <em>\n    sale\n   </em>\n   of auto insurance. There are no substitute \"inputs\" for auto body shop labor-the ability to sell auto insurance depends on the ability of each insurer to purchase auto body labor. The colluding insurers pay a lower price for body shop labor, which, given the simple mechanics of supply (production) and demand (price), drives down the quantity of auto body shop labor produced. In other words, in response to the artificially low market price of labor, auto body shops produce fewer units (hours) of body shop labor. The first anticompetitive effect, then, is below-market body shop labor output.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   With fewer units of body shop labor now on the market, insurers have fewer units available to purchase. Because the insurers purchase fewer units of body shop labor, they have fewer units to incorporate into their final \"product\"-auto insurance. Assuming the colluding insurers have collective market power in the selling market-the market for auto insurance-the necessary result is that insurers must either: (1) decrease the number of \"units\" of labor included in each insurance policy (say by decreasing the quality or number of repairs so that each repair requires fewer labor hours); or (2) include the same number of units of labor in insurance policies and sell fewer insurance policies, which would require a price increase. The second anticompetitive effect, then, is on\n   <em>\n    consumers of auto insurance\n   </em>\n   : lower quality auto insurance (insurance that covers lower quality or fewer repairs) and increased prices for the same quality insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The upshot is that the colluding auto insurers can increase profits by purchasing their inputs (body shop labor and repair parts) at a price below the competitive level and selling their output product (auto insurance) at a price above the competitive level.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   With this framework in mind, it is easy to see why insurers have a motive to form an agreement. Every colluding insurer is better off, at least in the short run, if they all comply with the agreement: the insurers can only continue to purchase inputs at infracompetitive levels if the other insurers do not cheat on the agreement and purchase more units, driving up the market rate. But every insurer also has an incentive to cheat. If one insurer purchases more hours of body shop labor, it can sell either higher quality insurance (insurance that covers more or higher quality repairs) or it can sell more units of insurance. \"The individual cartel member experiences the full benefit of [purchasing more inputs] but only a portion of the burden of the [increase] in the market price, which is shared by all cartel members .... [I]f everyone cheats without limit, the market moves back to the competitive price.\" Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 2002d.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   II.

But what we do know from the complaint suggests this market could be susceptible to collusion. While certainly not a plus factor on its own, the market structure facilitates the plausibility of an agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Facilitating Factor: Exchange of Price Information\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Because it allows firms to detect cheating and easily set rates, the apparent exchange of price information between the insurers also facilitates collusion and can also nudge other allegations into plausible claims of an agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 1435a. First, all the insurers charged the same \"market rate\" as State Farm. Second, only State Farm collects market information from the body shops used to determine that rate. Third, State Farm's rate is artificial, arbitrarily adjusted, and not otherwise derived from actual market information that would be available to all insurers, seemingly ruling out the possibility that each insurer is simply responding to common market stimuli to set its rate. Fourth, the other insurers do not verify the accuracy or validity of State Farm's rate with the body shops. Fifth, the body shops are prohibited from discussing their individual labor rates with each other. And finally, State Farm admitted to discussing a method for setting\n   reimbursement rates at industry meetings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   These allegations lead to two possible explanations. Either the other insurers blindly accept the\n   <em>\n    body shops' recitation\n   </em>\n   of\n   <em>\n    State Farm's rate\n   </em>\n   without confirming or otherwise discussing that rate with State Farm, or State Farm shares its rate with the other insurers. The latter is at least a reasonable inference from the allegations in the complaint. This apparent exchange and use of rate information nudges the allegations of an agreement closer to plausibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Flat Glass Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1319477\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/385/350/#p360\">\n    385 F.3d 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 369 (3d Cir. 2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Like standardization, the exchange of rate information is also a facilitating practice because it makes it easier to detect cheating. If an insurer decided to cheat on the agreement by offering a higher price to body shops and purchasing more units of body shop labor, it might drive the actual market rate above State Farm's artificial \"market rate.\" The body shops allege that State Farm collects shop-wide and market-wide rate data and speaks with body shops that report rates it unilaterally considers too high. State Farm's survey could reveal the rate increase occasioned by the cheating insurer, and its conversations with body shops could reveal the offender.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Text Messaging Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052985\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/630/622/#p628\">\n    630 F.3d 622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2010) (market structure that enables cartel members \"to be able to detect 'cheating' \" facilitates collusion). Again, the exchange of rate information alone does not constitute a plus factor, but it is a well-accepted facilitating practice that can tip other plus factors into suggesting a plausible agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   IV. Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   None of this is to suggest that any of these plus factors or facilitating factors, standing alone, would allow the plaintiff in another case to survive a motion to dismiss. The plus factor inquiry is wholistic. We cannot analyze each possible plus factor in isolation, accept or reject it, and move on to the next. Instead, we view all the possible plus factors and the allegations that support them in their proper economic context. And only then we decide, whether, viewed as a whole, there is enough to \"nudge the claim across the line from conceivable to plausible.\"\n   <em>\n    Jacobs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052598\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/626/1327/#p1332\">\n    626 F.3d at 1333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Antitrust laws are often underenforced against anticompetitive exercises of buyer market power. And yet, under the majority's interpretation of the\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   standard, never has it been harder for an antitrust plaintiff to proceed to discovery. \"The plaintiffs have conducted no discovery. Discovery may reveal the smoking gun or bring to light additional circumstantial evidence that further tilts the balance in favor of liability.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Text Messaging Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052985\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/630/622/#p628\">\n    630 F.3d 622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 629 (7th Cir. 2010). Discovery might uncover, for example, that the insurers agreed at industry meetings to use the same market rate, same reimbursement formulas, and same standards of quality. It might reveal exchanges of rate information, attempts to punish cheating insurers, or communications between insurers about successfully maintaining infracompetitive labor rates. And it might not.

In light of our disposition, we need not address Geico's argument that the\n    <em>\n     per se\n    </em>\n    analysis should not apply to the context of insurance companies reimbursing their insureds for the companies' obligation to pay a body shop for vehicle repairs.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-196\">\n    In the briefing instructions for the en banc briefs, the Body Shops were instructed to \"identify the allegations [of the complaints] from which such an agreement or conspiracy can plausibly be inferred and discuss whether any asserted inference of agreement or conspiracy is 'just as much in line with a wide swath of rational competitive business strategy prompted by common perceptions of the market ... or whether such inference is supported by allegations tending to rule out the possibility that the defendants were acting independently.' \" Reluctantly, we cannot conclude that the en banc brief of the Body Shops complied with that directive. Although their brief lists numerous statements that it asserts are \"specific allegations of conduct that probably do not result from ... independent responses to common stimuli,\" many have no tendency to suggest an advance agreement among the insurance companies, and are thus simply irrelevant. As indicated in this opinion, others reflect facts that are simply not pled in the complaints and not reasonably inferred from the actual allegations. We also discuss in this opinion those allegations with respect to actions just as much in line with a wide swath of rational competitive business strategy and thus cannot qualify as the plus factors required for a viable claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-197\">\n    Two can be rejected outright. The Body Shops argue that they asserted \"specific allegations of conduct that indicate the sort of restricted freedom of action and sense of obligation that one generally associates with agreement.\" However, despite arguing in their brief that representatives from non-State Farm Defendants have stated that they are restricted from altering the purported market rate unless authorized by State Farm, that allegation is nowhere to be found in the complaints. Quite the contrary, the only relevant specific allegation of fact is that the non-State Farm Insurance Companies advise the Plaintiffs that they will pay no more than State Farm pays-i.e., mere price leadership as discussed below.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-198\">\n    The Body Shops also argue that the conspiracy is shown by the presence of a common motive, namely desire to maximize profits. However, under this logic, most businesses with similar pricing would be deemed in cahoots with each other because that is the goal of most corporations. This plus factor is more properly invoked in contexts where the motive is unique and specific to the alleged conspirators.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Instructional Sys.

Once competitors assemble for a lawful activity, they would be presumptive conspirators ... on every parallel action subsequently occurring. Because parallel pricing is common even in competitive markets, juries would be entitled to infer that competitors had agreed on prices, and price agreements are condemned absolutely. Thus, the effect of holding opportunity sufficient would be to discourage all trade associations, industry gatherings, or joint ventures. Thereby to imperil reasonable and procompetitive collaborations would be inconsistent both with the purposes of the antitrust laws and with well-established Supreme Court permission for many kinds of collaboration among competitors.

The results of discovery-all the body shops here seek-from a pair of cases in the 1980s can hardly undercut the allegations we must accept as true at the motion to dismiss stage.

It is a reasonable inference that at least some participate in \"insurance industry meetings.\" But regardless, State Farm's admission is important because it suggests State Farm seeks approval from other insurance industry members on its rate setting mechanism.
