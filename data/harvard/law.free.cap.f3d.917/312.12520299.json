Simmons's revocation sentence was predicated on the district court's determination that AWDWOGO is a \"crime of violence\" under the 2016 Sentencing Guidelines and, thus, a Grade A supervised release violation. Because we conclude that AWDWOGO is categorically not a \"crime of violence,\" we find that the district court erred in classifying Simmons's supervised release violations as a Grade A violation. This error anchored Simmons's revocation sentence to an improperly calculated Guidelines range. Therefore, we vacate his revocation sentence and remand for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After a high-speed car chase on February 12, 2017 by North Carolina State Highway Patrol Trooper Gary Altman, during which Trooper Altman's police vehicle was sideswiped, Tomonta Simmons and another male were arrested. At the time, Simmons was on supervised release after having served a term of federal imprisonment for conspiracy to commit bank fraud. One of the conditions of his supervised release was that he \"not commit another federal, state, or local crime.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After the February 12 incident, the United States Probation Office petitioned the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina for revocation of Simmons's supervised release. According to the Probation Office, Simmons had committed various supervised release violations. The most serious violation was the crime of AWDWOGO,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2014-34.2\">\n    N.C. Gen.

The district court heard testimony from Trooper Altman and from Simmons's mother and godmother. The court determined that Simmons was in fact driving the vehicle that sideswiped Trooper Altman's vehicle and that the Government had proven each of the alleged supervised release violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Of relevance to this appeal, the district court found that Simmons had committed a Grade A supervised release violation when he committed North Carolina AWDWOGO.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.1(a) (classifying supervised release violations into Grades A, B, and C).

Accordingly, we see no reason in light of\n   <em>\n    Voisine\n   </em>\n   to alter our conclusion in this case that North Carolina AWDWOGO-a crime that can be committed with culpable negligence-is categorically disqualified as a \"crime of violence\" under the Sentencing Guidelines.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    Plain Error\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Government argues that, even if the district court erred in finding that AWDWOGO is a crime of violence for purposes of the Sentencing Guidelines, that error was not plain because the law in this area was unsettled at the time Simmons's revocation sentence was imposed. Simmons's sentence was imposed in September 2017. Yet our decision in\n   <em>\n    Vinson\n   </em>\n   -holding that the mens rea for any of the three assault formulations under North\n   Carolina law includes \"culpable negligence\" and is categorically broader than the force clause-was issued in November 2015, nearly two years prior to Simmons's sentencing.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357964\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/805/120/#p123\">\n    805 F.3d at 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To be sure, we had not yet determined that this particular assault offense is not a \"crime of violence\" under the 2016 Sentencing Guidelines. Nonetheless,\n   <em>\n    Vinson\n   </em>\n   provided a clear answer to the question that the district court faced: whether the mens rea required to commit North Carolina AWDWOGO was a categorical match to either the mens rea required by the generic offense of aggravated assault or the mens rea required under the force clause. In light of our clear holding in\n   <em>\n    Vinson\n   </em>\n   , we find that the district court plainly erred in determining that North Carolina AWDWOGO is a \"crime of violence\" for purposes of the Sentencing Guidelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The district court's error led to the improper calculation of the applicable Guidelines range. Simmons's AWDWOGO offense was the only Grade A supervised release violation found by the district court; the others were Grade B and Grade C violations. Absent the court's error, Simmons's supervised release violations together would have classified as a Grade B violation. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.1(b) (\"Where there is more than one violation of the conditions of supervision, or the violation includes conduct that constitutes more than one offense, the grade of the violation is determined by the violation having the most serious grade.\"). Therefore, the district court erred in finding Simmons committed a Grade A violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Guidelines range for a Grade B violation with Simmons's criminal history category of V is 18 to 24 months, lower than the range of 30 to 36 months to which the revocation sentence was anchored. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a). Accordingly, we vacate Simmons's revocation sentence and remand for resentencing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rosales-Mireles v.

North Carolina courts have explained that while assault requires intent as an element, such intent may be\n   <em>\n    implied\n   </em>\n   from culpable or criminal negligence.\n   <em>\n    State v. Spellman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8411467\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nc-app/167/374/\">\n    167 N.C.App. 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=605%20S.E.2d%20696\">\n    605 S.E.2d 696\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 703 (2004). Thus, so long as there is sufficient evidence to convict a defendant of acting with culpable negligence, North Carolina courts have found that this may constitute sufficient evidence of assault under this statute. By so holding, North Carolina effectively collapses culpable or criminal negligence with intent for the purposes of assault. In North Carolina, a defendant acts with culpable negligence when he evinces \"thoughtless disregard of consequences or a heedless indifference to the safety and rights of others.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The realistic probability requirement is satisfied here because North Carolina courts have held that a necessary element of AWDWOGO, assault, can be committed with a mens rea that sweeps more broadly than that required under the generic definition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

This is because common law assault and battery, which was a necessary element of Virginia ABPO, could be satisfied by the slightest touching, which is less than the level of force required under the residual clause--\"a serious potential risk of injury to another.\"\n   <em>\n    Carthorne\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4074542\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/726/503/#p509\">\n    726 F.3d at 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The principles underlying\n   <em>\n    Carthorne\n   </em>\n   apply here: even though Simmons has not pointed to a specific case in which a defendant was punished for AWDWOGO with a mens rea of culpable negligence, it suffices that we and North Carolina courts have unambiguously held that a necessary element of AWDWOGO, assault, sweeps more broadly than \u00a7 4B1.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Moreover, one can readily conceive of cases in which a defendant could be convicted of AWDWOGO where the defendant acts with a mens rea of culpable negligence.
