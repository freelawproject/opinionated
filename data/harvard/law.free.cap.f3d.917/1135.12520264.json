The estate executor and heir declared a large charitable deduction based on the value of estate property at the time of death, only to manipulate the property for personal gain, deliver assets to the charity worth substantially less than those claimed as a deduction, and receive a tax windfall in the process. The Tax Court sustained the deficiency. We affirm in light of our holding in\n   <em>\n    Ahmanson Foundation v. United States\n   </em>\n   , where we underscored \"the principle that the testator may only be allowed a deduction for estate tax purposes for what is actually received by the charity.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1150897\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/674/761/#p772\">\n    674 F.2d 761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 772 (9th Cir. 1981). We also affirm the Tax Court's ruling sustaining an accuracy-related penalty under I.R.C. \u00a7 6662.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case involves the Victoria E. Dieringer Estate (\"Estate\"). Victoria and her late husband Robert E. Dieringer (\"Robert\") had twelve children together, including Eugene Dieringer (\"Eugene\"), Patrick Dieringer (\"Patrick\"), and Timothy Dieringer (\"Timothy\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Dieringer family owns Dieringer Properties, Inc. (\"DPI\"), a closely held corporation that manages commercial and residential properties in Portland, Oregon, as well as a Wendy's restaurant in Texas. After Robert passed away and before Victoria's death, Eugene was the president of DPI, Patrick was the executive vice-president and secretary, Victoria was the vice-president, and Timothy was the office manager. DPI's Board of Directors (\"Board\") consisted of Victoria as chairperson, and Eugene, Patrick, Timothy, and Thomas Keepes (\"Keepes\"), who is unrelated to the Dieringers, as directors. None of the other nine Dieringer children were involved in DPI in any capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Before Victoria's death, the only shareholders of DPI were Victoria, Eugene, and Patrick. Victoria owned 425 out of 525 voting shares and 7,736.5 out of 9,220.5 nonvoting shares. Eugene owned the remaining 100 voting shares, and Eugene and Patrick each owned 742 nonvoting shares.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   According to Victoria's will, dated November 10, 2000, upon her death all of her Estate would pass to the Victoria Evelyn Dieringer Trust (\"Trust\"). The Trust, as amended on April 22, 2005, provided for Victoria's children to receive some personal effects, but no other proceeds from her estate. The Trust also provided for $ 600,000 in donations to various charitable organizations. Any assets remaining in the Estate would then pass to the Bob and Evelyn Dieringer Family Foundation (\"Foundation\"), an I.R.C. \u00a7 501(c)(3) organization, as a charitable contribution. Under Victoria's estate plan, Eugene was appointed as the sole trustee of both the Trust and the Foundation. Patrick and Keepes served as advisory trustees of the Foundation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Prior to Victoria's death, the DPI Board had preliminary discussions about purchasing Victoria's DPI shares as part of ongoing succession planning. A November 24, 2008 Board resolution reported that the issue had been discussed and that the Board resolved to \"periodically purchase\" Victoria's shares based on terms acceptable to all parties. Victoria was \"completely agreeable\" to such a plan. At a February 13, 2009 Board meeting, Victoria reiterated her potential interest in having DPI purchase her shares. In anticipation of entering a purchase agreement for Victoria's shares, DPI paid the Trust $ 45,000 prior to Victoria's death. When Victoria unexpectedly died on April 14, 2009, there were no specific redemption agreements in place.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When Victoria died, Eugene was appointed executor of the Estate. To determine the value of Victoria's DPI shares for Estate administration purposes, the Estate's law firm requested that Lewis Olds &amp; Associates perform an independent appraisal of the net asset value of DPI. The appraisal determined that the value of DPI as of the date of Victoria's death was $ 17,777,626 and that Victoria's shares in DPI were worth $ 14,182,471.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Effective November 20, 2009, DPI's Board converted the corporate structure from a C corporation to an S corporation on the advice of Keepes. The DPI Board made this change in corporate structure to accomplish its long-term tax planning goals and to avoid certain adverse tax consequences under I.R.C. \u00a7 1374. As a result of electing S corporation status, the DPI Board decided that it should also redeem Victoria's DPI shares that were to pass to the Foundation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Board entered into an agreement with the Trust to redeem Victoria's shares, prior to the shares \"pouring over\" into the Foundation. Initially, DPI agreed to redeem all of Victoria's shares for $ 6,071,558, effective November 30, 2009. This amount was based on a 2002 appraisal, since the date-of-death appraisal had not yet been completed. As a result, the redemption agreement provided that the stated price would be \"reconciled and adjusted retroactively\" to reflect the fair market value of the shares as of November 30, 2009. DPI executed two promissory notes payable to the Trust in exchange for the DPI shares.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Eugene, Patrick, and Timothy entered into separate subscription agreements to purchase additional DPI shares, in order to provide funding for DPI to meet the required payments on the promissory notes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the later Tax Court trial, the court found that there were appropriate business purposes for these subscription agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At the direction of DPI, Lewis Olds &amp; Associates performed another appraisal of the value of Victoria's DPI shares as of November 30, 2009, for the purpose of redemption (\"redemption appraisal\"). The redemption appraisal valued Victoria's DPI shares at $ 916 per voting share and $ 870 per nonvoting share. Lewis Olds testified, and the Tax Court found, that Eugene (through his lawyer) instructed him to value Victoria's DPI shares as if they were a minority interest in DPI for the purposes of this appraisal, and that he would not have done so without these instructions. Olds's appraisal therefore included a 15-percent discount for lack of control and a 35-percent discount for lack of marketability. As a result, Victoria's DPI shares were valued significantly less in the redemption appraisal than in the date-of-death appraisal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   DPI determined that it could not afford to redeem all of Victoria's shares at the\n   new valuation price. The redemption agreement was then amended, and consequently DPI redeemed all 425 voting shares and 5,600.5 nonvoting shares for a total purchase price of $ 5,263,462.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The balance on the long-term promissory note was amended to reflect the changes in the number and price of shares under the amended redemption agreement. After the redemption agreement was implemented, the distribution of DPI shares was as follows: (1) the Trust owned 2,136 nonvoting shares; (2) Eugene owned 200 voting shares and 2,932 nonvoting shares; (3) Patrick owned 65 voting shares and 893 nonvoting shares; and (4) Timothy owned 25 voting shares and 108 nonvoting shares.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In January 2011, the Trust distributed the promissory notes and the remaining DPI shares to the Foundation. The state probate court approved the redemption agreement and indicated that the redemption agreement and promissory notes would not be prohibited self-dealing under I.R.C. \u00a7 4941.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the 2011 tax year, the Foundation reported the following contributions on its Form 990-PF, Return of Private Foundation: (1) a noncash contribution of DPI shares with a fair market value of $ 1,858,961; (2) a long-term note receivable with a fair market value of $ 2,921,312; and (3) a short-term note receivable with a fair market value of $ 2,250,000. The Trust reported a capital loss of $ 385,934 for the sale of the 425 voting shares and $ 4,831,439 for the sale of 5,600.5 nonvoting shares for the taxable year ending in December 31, 2009, on its Form 1041 Tax Return. The Estate filed its Form 706, United States Estate (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return on July 12, 2010, reporting no estate tax liability. The Estate claimed a charitable contribution deduction of $ 18,812,181, based on the date-of-death value of Victoria's DPI shares.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In June 2013, the Commissioner issued a notice of deficiency to the Estate based on its July 2010 tax return (Form 706). The notice stated that there was a deficiency of $ 4,124,717 and imposed an accuracy-related penalty of $ 824,943 under I.R.C. \u00a7 6662 for error and negligence in using the date-of-death appraisal as the value of the charitable contribution of Victoria's DPI shares.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Upon receiving the notice of deficiency, the Estate filed a timely petition in the Tax Court challenging the Commissioner's deficiency notice and penalty assessment. The Estate argued that it correctly used the date-of-death appraisal to determine the value of Victoria's DPI shares for the purpose of the charitable contribution deduction. The Commissioner responded that post-death events should be considered in determining the value of the charitable contribution, as the actions by Eugene, Patrick, and Timothy reduced the value of Victoria's contribution to the Foundation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Following trial, the Tax Court issued a decision upholding the Commissioner's reduction\n   of the Estate's charitable deduction and the deficiency assessment. The Tax Court found that the redemption was not part of Victoria's estate plan and there were valid business reasons for many of the transactions that took place after her death. The Tax Court also concluded, however, that post-death events-primarily Eugene's decision to apply a minority interest discount to the redemption value of Victoria's DPI shares-reduced the value of the contribution to the Foundation and therefore reduced the value of the Estate's charitable deduction. But the evidence did not support the conclusion that a poor business climate caused the reported decline in share values, as the Estate argued. Further, the Tax Court affirmed the Commissioner's determination that the Estate was liable for a penalty under I.R.C. \u00a7 6662(a). After denying the Estate's motion for reconsideration, the Tax Court entered a final decision in favor of the Commissioner, which sustained an estate tax deficiency of $ 4,124,717 and an accuracy-related penalty of $ 824,943. The Estate timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We review de novo the Tax Court's legal conclusions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DJB Holding Corp. v.

First, it argues that the Tax Court erred by taking into account events that occurred after Victoria's death in determining the value of the charitable deduction. Instead, the Estate argues that the charitable deduction should have been valued as of Victoria's date of death. Second, the Estate argues that even if post-death events could be considered, the Tax Court erred by not accounting for a decline in value of Victoria's shares caused by economic forces. Third, the Estate argues that the Tax Court erred by upholding the accuracy-related penalty under I.R.C. \u00a7 6662.

Victoria structured her Estate so as not to donate her DPI shares directly to a charity, or even directly to the Foundation, but to the Trust. Victoria enabled Eugene to commit almost unchecked abuse of the Estate by setting him up to be executor of the Estate, trustee of the Trust, and trustee of the Foundation, in addition to his roles as president, director, and majority shareholder of DPI. As the Tax Court found, Eugene improperly directed Lewis Olds to determine the redemption value of the DPI shares by applying a minority interest valuation, when he knew a majority interest applied and the Estate had claimed a charitable deduction based upon a majority interest valuation. Through his actions, Eugene manipulated the charitable deduction so that the Foundation only received a fraction of the charitable deduction claimed by the Estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Estate attempts to evade\n   <em>\n    Ahmanson\n   </em>\n   by arguing that it is limited to situations where the testamentary plan diminishes the value of the charitable property.

The Tax Court, however, found that \"[t]he evidence does not support a significant decline in the economy that resulted in a large decrease in value in only seven months.\" The Tax Court acknowledged that the adjusted net asset value of the DPI stock decreased from $ 17,777,626 at the date of Victoria's death to $ 16,159,167 at the date used for the redemption appraisal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Still, the Tax Court found, \"[t]he reported decline in per share value was primarily due to the specific instruction to value decedent's majority interest as a minority interest with a 50% discount.\" We find nothing in the record-nor does the Estate point to anything in the record-that suggests the Tax Court's findings were clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Finally, the Estate challenges the accuracy-related penalty that was imposed pursuant to I.R.C. \u00a7 6662(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Section 6662(a) imposes a penalty of 20 percent of the amount of the underpayment attributable to either negligence or disregard of rules or regulations.
