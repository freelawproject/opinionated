We deny his petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mairena, a native and citizen of Nicaragua born in 1979, entered the United\n   States on a visitor visa in 1984 and attained lawful permanent resident status in 1988. Mairena's wife, two daughters, and parents reside in the United States, and he has no family left in Nicaragua.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 9, 2010, Mairena was convicted of willful infliction of corporal injury upon the mother of his child with a prior conviction, in violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 273.5(e)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   He had been previously convicted of corporal injury to a spouse in 2008. Mairena was sentenced to five years of imprisonment: four years for the offense, plus a one-year enhancement, pursuant to California Penal Code \u00a7 12022.5(b)(1),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   for using a weapon during the commission of the offense. That same day, Mairena was also convicted of dissuading a witness, in violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 136.1(c)(1), for which he was sentenced to three years of imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 10, 2013, the Department of Homeland Security served Mairena with a Notice to Appear and charged him as removable based on those two felony convictions under \u00a7 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(iii). On March 20, 2014, the IJ (Walsh,\n   <em>\n    I.J.\n   </em>\n   ) concluded that Mairena was removable as charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 15, 2014, Mariena applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT protection. In his application, Mairena alleged that he feared that the Sandinistas would kill him because his family was previously persecuted by the Sandinistas and was currently fighting with President Daniel Ortega to recover seized family property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On October 15, 2014, Mairena applied for adjustment of status and a waiver of inadmissibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On April 1, 2015, the IJ denied all relief. As relevant to this petition, the IJ concluded as follows: (1) Mairena was statutorily ineligible for withholding of removal because he was sentenced to an aggregate term of eight years of imprisonment for his two felony convictions, and therefore convicted of a per se particularly serious crime; and (2) Mariena failed to carry his burden of proving that he would more likely than not be tortured if he returned to Nicaragua, and thus CAT protection was not warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On August 27, 2015, the BIA affirmed the IJ's decision and dismissed Mairena's appeal. As relevant to this petition, the BIA concluded as follows: (1) Mariena was statutorily ineligible for withholding of removal because he was sentenced to an aggregate term of five years of imprisonment for his corporal injury conviction, factoring in the one-year enhancement; and (2) the IJ did not clearly err in determining that Mairena failed to establish that he would more likely than not be\n   tortured if he returned to Nicaragua. The BIA did not rely on Mairena's conviction for dissuading a witness, for which he was sentenced to three years of imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On September 14, 2015, Mairena timely petitioned this Court for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We lack jurisdiction to review \"any final order of removal against an alien who is removable\" because he committed an aggravated felony,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(C), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), but \"we retain jurisdiction to decide our own jurisdiction and to resolve questions of law,\"\n   <em>\n    Bolanos v.

Mairena's contention that the BIA could not consider his sentencing enhancement is foreclosed by the plain language of the statute.

First, the IJ was not required to conduct a separate credibility analysis in adjudicating Mairena's CAT claim. Contrary to Mairena's contention, the IJ was entitled to rely on the adverse credibility determination in denying CAT relief,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Singh v. Lynch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341952\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/802/972/#p977\">\n    802 F.3d 972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 977 (9th Cir. 2015), provided that the IJ considered other evidence in the record on country conditions in Nicaragua,\n   <em>\n    Kamalthas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11101890\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/251/1279/#p1282\">\n    251 F.3d at 1282-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The IJ did so in this case. Second, the record does not compel the conclusion that Mairena would more likely than not be tortured upon return to Nicaragua. Although both Mairena and his family expressed fear that he would be tortured because of his family's pro-Contra association, (1) the persecution for which his family received political asylum transpired thirty years ago, (2) Mairena himself was never tortured, and (3) there was no evidence that Mairena or anyone in his family had received threats while attempting to regain family land from the government. Mairena has not contested the accuracy of these findings on appeal; instead, he essentially seems to disagree with the agency's conclusion. But \"our task 'is to determine whether there is substantial evidence to support the BIA's finding, not to substitute an analysis of which side in the factual dispute we find more persuasive.' \"\n   <em>\n    Singh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341952\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/802/972/#p977\">\n    802 F.3d at 974-75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Molina-Morales v.

The BIA also concluded that, while the Department of State report indicates that some former Contras were likely killed by the Nicaraguan government, those individuals-unlike Mairena-were well known and involved in armed confrontations.
