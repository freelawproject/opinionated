As we described in the Judgment, the District Court's finding of no changed circumstances and its denial of the motion to dissolve the preliminary injunction was error. I write separately to\n   elaborate on why I believe that was the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   First, we must review some history and background.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At issue in this case is the regulation of military service by transgender persons. As noted in the report of the Transgender Military Service Commission chaired by former Surgeon General Jocelyn Elders, a prevalent theme in this area is that \"regulatory terminology that references transgender identity is inconsistent.\" J.A. 753. Thus, to avoid confusion, it is critically important to define terms and characterize military regulations carefully and precisely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Based on the record, transgender persons are \"individuals who identify with a gender different from the sex they were assigned at birth.\" J.A. 606;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   J.A. 263. Thus, while a transgender woman may have been assigned the male sex at birth, she nonetheless identifies with the female gender. Similarly, a transgender man was assigned the female sex at birth but identifies with the male gender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As explained by amici American Medical Association and seven other healthcare organizations, \"[e]very person has a gender identity, which cannot be altered voluntarily or necessarily ascertained immediately after birth.\" AMA Amicus Br. 6. A person \"communicates gender identity to others through behavior, clothing, hairstyles, voice, or body characteristics,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3658197\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/557/433/#p448\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , and the extent to which transgender individuals express their gender identity varies from person to person. As found by the RAND Corporation in a report for Former Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, some transgender persons express their gender identity though \"transitioning,\" which is \"the act of\n   <em>\n    living and working\n   </em>\n   as a gender different from that assigned at birth.\" J.A. 606 (emphasis added). But according to the information that we have in the record, only \"[a] subset of transgender individuals may choose to transition ...\" J.A. 606. As explained in the Transgender Military Service Commission report:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Being transgender does not mean that one has already transitioned to a different gender, or that such a transition will occur in the future. It means recognizing that the gender one has always had does not match the physical gender that was assigned at birth. The transgender community includes people who have already transitioned to the other gender, those who have not yet transitioned but who plan to do so, those who identify with the other gender but do not wish to transition, and others.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   J.A. 752.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Some, but not all, transgender persons develop gender dysphoria, which manifests as stress and anxiety caused by the incongruence between the sex assigned to the person at birth and the person's preferred gender identity. J.A. 622-23. Gender dysphoria is recognized by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), and is often treated with \"psychotherapy, hormone therapy, surgery, and changes to gender expression and role (i.e., how people present themselves to the world ...).\" J.A. 623. Thus, many transgender persons with gender dysphoria require medical treatment, including transitioning to their preferred gender; however, \"[n]ot all [transgender persons diagnosed with gender dysphoria ] will prefer or need all or any of those options.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Prior to 2015, the Department of Defense (DoD) effectively banned all transgender persons from either joining or remaining in the military. J.A. 275; J.A. 734; J.A. 784. These accession and retention restrictions were enforced through medical standards that precluded applicants from joining the military if they had \"defects of\n   the genitalia\" including but not limited to change of sex, and through mental health standards that disqualified persons with any history of certain psychosexual conditions, including \"transsexualism\" and \"transvestism.\" J.A. 754. Thus, all transgender persons were essentially banned from military service, even if they had never undergone sex-reassignment surgery, even if they did not have gender dysphoria, and even if they had not transitioned to their preferred gender and were willing to serve pursuant to the military standards applicable to the sex assigned to them at birth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Under the pre-2015 regime, the only thing that mattered to exclude a person from military service was the person's transgender status: that the person did not\n   <em>\n    identify\n   </em>\n   with the gender assigned to them at birth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Things began to change in 2015. On July 28, 2015, then-Secretary of Defense Ash Carter issued a memorandum to the secretaries of the military departments directing that \"[e]ffective as of July 13, 2015, no Service member shall be involuntarily separated or denied reenlistment or continuation of active or reserve service on the basis of their gender identity, without the personal approval of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness.\" J.A. 709. The memorandum further ordered a working group composed of senior representatives from each of the Military Departments, Joint Staff, and relevant components from the Office of the Secretary of Defense to formulate policy options for the DoD regarding the military service of transgender servicemembers. The working group commissioned the RAND Corporation's National Defense Research Institute to conduct a study on the impact of permitting transgender servicemembers to serve openly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The RAND Corporation subsequently issued the aforementioned 91-page report (\"RAND Report\") that found no evidence that allowing transgender individuals to serve would have any effect on \"unit cohesion,\" and concluded that any related costs or impacts on readiness would be \"exceedingly small,\" \"marginal,\" or \"negligible.\" J.A. 597-708. Based on all of the information it collected, the working group unanimously concluded that transgender people should be allowed to serve openly in the military. The group not only concluded that allowing transgender people to serve would not significantly affect military readiness or costs but also found that\n   <em>\n    prohibiting\n   </em>\n   transgender people from serving would undermine military effectiveness and readiness. Specifically, prohibiting transgender people from serving would exclude qualified individuals on a basis that has no relevance to one's fitness to serve and create unexpected vacancies requiring expensive and time-consuming recruitment and training of replacements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On June 30, 2016, Secretary Carter issued Directive-Type Memorandum 16-005 (\"Carter Policy\"), which announced \"that service in the United States military should be open to all who can meet the rigorous standards for military service and readiness,\" and set forth a policy permitting service by qualified transgender individuals. J.A. 586. The Carter Policy took immediate effect with respect to retention, allowing current transgender servicemembers to serve under \"the same standards\" as cisgender (non-transgender) servicemembers and prohibiting the discharge of otherwise qualified servicemembers \"solely on the basis of their gender identity.\" J.A. 588. The Carter Policy also allowed transgender servicemembers diagnosed with gender dysphoria to transition to their preferred gender if they so desired. J.A. 275. Upon joining the military, each servicemember is assigned a \"gender marker\" in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS), and the servicemember\n   must follow all sex-based military regulations pertinent to that gender marker. J.A. 1045. Thus, under the Carter Policy, transgender servicemembers with a gender dysphoria diagnosis became eligible to change their gender marker in DEERS, and with this transition, begin following the sex-based military regulations for their preferred gender rather than for their biological sex. The sex-based standards and procedures that vary by gender include (1) uniform, grooming, physical fitness, body fat, and drug testing standards; (2) requirements for separate berthing, bathroom and shower facilities; and (3) different policies regulating military training and sports, such as boxing. J.A. 296-98; J.A. 1045.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Carter Policy directed DoD to update its standards for persons entering the military (a process formally referred to as \"accession\") by July 1, 2017. Secretary of Defense James Mattis subsequently deferred the July 1, 2017 accession deadline to January 1, 2018 so that the services could review their accession plans and provide input on the impact to the readiness and lethality of the armed forces. J.A. 426.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On July 26, 2017, President Donald J. Trump issued a statement via Twitter announcing that \"the United States Government will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.\" J.A. 124. A formal Presidential Memorandum (\"2017 Presidential Memorandum\") followed on August 25, 2017. J.A. 406-07. The 2017 Presidential Memorandum reversed the Carter Policy. President Trump explained that \"[s]hortly before President Obama left office, ... his Administration dismantled the Departments' established framework by permitting transgender individuals to serve openly in the military, authorizing the use of the Departments' resources to fund sex-reassignment surgical procedures, and permitting accession of such individuals after July 1, 2017 [later extended to January 1, 2018].\" J.A. 406. President Trump further declared:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   In my judgment, the previous Administration failed to identify a sufficient basis to conclude that terminating the Departments' longstanding policy and practice would not hinder military effectiveness and lethality, disrupt unit cohesion, or tax military resources, and there remain meaningful concerns that further study is needed to ensure that continued implementation of last year's policy change would not have those negative effects.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   J.A. 406. Thus, President Trump directed Secretary Mattis \"to return to the longstanding policy and practice on military service by transgender individuals that was in place prior to June 2016 until such time as a sufficient basis exists upon which to conclude that terminating that policy and practice would not have the negative effects discussed above.\" J.A. 406. President Trump ordered Secretary Mattis to submit a plan for implementing the policy directives of the 2017 Presidential Memorandum by February 2018. J.A. 406-07.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   By ordering a return to pre-Carter policies, President Trump effectively reinstated the prior blanket ban on accession and retention in military service by all transgender persons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The President specified that the ban on transgender accession would go into effect immediately and remain in place \"until such time as the Secretary of Defense, after consulting with the Secretary of Homeland Security, provides a recommendation to the contrary that I find convincing.\" J.A. 406. The President also ordered an immediate stop to the \"use of DoD or DHS resources to fund sex-reassignment surgical procedures for military personnel, except to the extent necessary to protect the health of an individual who has already\n   begun a course of treatment to reassign his or her sex.\" J.A. 406. Other than the halt to sex-reassignment funding, the President did not make the transgender ban immediately effective with respect to retention standards, which would have led to the immediate discharge of transgender servicemembers. Instead, President Trump instructed Secretary Mattis to \"determine how to address transgender individuals currently serving in the United States military\" and ordered that \"no action may be taken against such individuals\" until that study was complete. J.A. 407.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On October 30, 2017, the District Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the implementation of the 2017 Presidential Memorandum, the effect of which was to reinstate the Carter Policy. As the District Court found, and as we agreed in denying a motion to stay the preliminary injunction, a number of factors \"strongly suggest[ed]\" that Plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their Fifth Amendment due process claim.\n   <em>\n    Doe 1 v. Trump\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206553389\">\n    2017 WL 6553389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 22, 2017). Those factors included the breadth of the exclusion (virtually a complete ban) ordered by the Memorandum, the unusual and abrupt initial announcement of the ban, the failure to provide any supporting facts for the ban, and the recent professional judgment by the military, after a thorough study, that the prior ban should be lifted.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Given that intemperate contemporaneous statements by policymakers, departures from normal procedures, and adoption of policies unsupported or contrary to data can be considered evidence that invidious discrimination was \"a motivating factor\" in the decision,\n   <em>\n    Village of Arlington Heights v.

In February 2018, as ordered by the 2017 Presidential Memorandum, Secretary Mattis presented a memorandum to the President that proposed a policy regarding transgender military service (\"the Mattis Plan\"). J.A. 263-65. The reasoning underlying the Mattis Plan is spelled out in a 44-page report prepared by a panel of senior military and civilian experts that was also submitted to the President in February 2018 (\"the Panel Report\"). J.A. 268-312. The Panel Report concludes that transgender persons with gender dysphoria or who have undergone or will require gender transition undermine the military. According to the Panel Report, these servicemembers are fundamentally incompatible with the military's mental health standards, physical health standards, and sex-based standards and are a detriment to military readiness and unit cohesion. The Panel Report likens gender dysphoria to conditions such as \"bipolar disorder, personality disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, suicidal behavior, and even body dysmorphic disorder.\" J.A. 288. It concludes that individuals with gender dysphoria are more likely to have other mental health conditions and substance abuse problems, and to commit suicide. J.A. 289. The Panel Report also states that these individuals impose \"disproportionate costs\" on the military, J.A. 309, and repeatedly cites \"uncertainty\" in the medical field about these individuals as a reason to urge that the military \"proceed with caution,\" J.A. 274.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Mattis Plan has three key planks. First \"[t]ransgender persons without a history\n   or diagnosis of gender dysphoria, who are otherwise qualified for service, may serve, like all other Service members, in their biological sex.\" J.A. 265. \"Biological sex\" is not defined, but it appears to mean that the DEERS gender marker for the servicemember is the same as the sex assigned to the person at birth based on a physical examination of the genital organs. J.A. 299. \"Serving\" in one's biological sex is also not defined, but it appears to mean that the transgender servicemember must follow all sex-based military regulations pertinent to the person's DEERS gender marker. J.A. 273-74. (These critical points should be fleshed out in further proceedings.) The Mattis Plan's panel of experts says that this particular recommendation is consistent with the Carter Policy, which also required transgender persons without gender dysphoria to serve in their biological sex, J.A. 300, and that there are transgender persons who \"have served, and are serving, with distinction under the standards for their biological sex,\" J.A. 274.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Second, transgender persons who require or have undergone gender transition are disqualified from service, so they may not join, and may not be retained in, the military. J.A. 273. (However, the Mattis Plan includes a grandfather clause, which exempts current servicemembers who were diagnosed with gender dysphoria and began their transition pursuant to the Carter Policy and prior to the effective date of the Mattis Plan. J.A. 264; J.A. 273-74; J.A. 311.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Third, transgender persons are disqualified from accession or retention in military service if they have \"a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria and require, or have already undertaken, a course of treatment to change their gender.\" J.A. 264;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   J.A. 300. (As above, the grandfather clause in the Mattis Plan exempts current servicemembers who were diagnosed with gender dysphoria and began their transition pursuant to the Carter Policy and prior to the effective date of the Mattis Plan. J.A. 264; J.A. 273-74; J.A. 311.) Thus, unless grandfathered, a transgender person with a history or current diagnosis of gender dysphoria can remain in the military only if the person is willing and able to serve in his or her biological sex. Similarly, a transgender person with a current diagnosis of gender dysphoria cannot join the military, and a transgender person with a history of gender dysphoria can join only if the person can \"demonstrate 36 consecutive months of stability (i.e. absence of gender dysphoria ),\" has not transitioned, and is willing and able to serve in his or her biological sex. J.A. 273.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On March 23, 2018, the President issued a 2018 Presidential Memorandum, which stated that he \"revoke[s]\" his 2017 Presidential Memorandum, \"and any other directive [he] may have made with respect to military service by transgender individuals.\" J.A. 261. The President ordered that \"[t]he Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Homeland Security, with respect to the U.S. Coast Guard, may exercise their authority to implement any appropriate policies concerning military service by transgender individuals.\" J.A. 261. That same day, the government moved to dissolve the October 2017 injunction so that the military could implement the Mattis Plan. On August 6, 2018, the District Court found that the Mattis Plan had not \"genuinely changed\" the circumstances in the case, J.A. 94, and thus denied the motion to dissolve its injunction, J.A. 64-98.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As stated earlier, consistency and clarity in terminology and definitions are important, and that was a key problem below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The District Court ruled that by definition, transgender persons \"do not identify\n   <em>\n    or live in accord with\n   </em>\n   their biological sex.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   J.A. 69; J.A. 91. Plaintiffs urged this definition upon the District Court, just as they urge it upon us, by arguing that all transgender persons undergo a gender transition, Appellee Br. 19. The problem is that there is no record support for this definition of the term. As noted earlier, everything in the record, from the Elders Report, the RAND Study, the Carter Policy and the Mattis Plan consistently defines a transgender person as a person who does not \"identify\" with his or her biological sex. Indeed, Plaintiffs' own expert witness, J.A. 1056, and the American Medical Association, amici in support of Plaintiffs, AMA Amicus Br. 3, define transgender in terms of identifying with, rather than identifying with\n   <em>\n    and living in accord with\n   </em>\n   , one's preferred gender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   This subtle shift in definition by Plaintiffs is significant, because it provides the lynchpin for their argument that the Mattis Plan was no different than the policy of the 2017 Presidential Memorandum. Plaintiffs, and the District Court, swept aside all distinctions in the various elements of the Mattis Plan by characterizing it as a monolith. Under this construct, the Mattis Plan is a total ban on service by transgender persons because a transgender person cannot \"liv[e] in accord with their gender identity\" while serving in the military according to their biological sex. Appellee Br. 21;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   J.A. 69; J.A. 91. In this paradigm, the Mattis Plan is a blanket transgender ban because it does not permit each and every transgender person to serve in his or her preferred gender; unless grandfathered, the Mattis Plan requires that transgender persons serve in accord with their biological sex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Plaintiffs acknowledge that the term transgender is often defined to include persons who identify with another gender but who do not wish to live or work in accordance with that preferred gender, but they blithely dismiss that definition with the argument that any \"broader meaning [of transgender] is irrelevant to this case.\" Appellee Br. 23. How so? Plaintiffs want us to ignore the fact that they did not present evidence showing that all transgender persons necessarily \"live\" or \"work\" in their preferred gender rather than their biological sex. There were no findings below describing what it means to \"serve in one's biological sex,\" let alone findings that all transgender persons either currently serving or applying to join the military must suppress who they are to \"serve in their biological sex\" and are unwilling or unable to do so. Instead, Plaintiffs want us to adopt the position that transgender persons who desire to serve in their biological sex are not really transgender, at least for the purpose of this lawsuit. But we cannot simply substitute Plaintiffs'\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   for evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In sum, the record - at least at this point - shows that the Mattis Plan does not exclude all transgender persons serving in the military (unless grandfathered), as Plaintiffs maintain and as the District Court found. Rather, the record supports the conclusion that the Mattis Plan excludes (unless grandfathered) transgender persons who desire to express their gender identity by transitioning - changing their gender marker in DEERS - and thereby serving in accordance with all of the military requirements for their preferred gender. To the extent that there are transgender servicemembers who desire to serve under the standards for their biological sex, under the Mattis Plan, they may identify as they wish with their preferred gender while complying with the service requirements applicable to the DEERS gender marker for their biological sex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   None of this is to say that the Mattis Plan is not a hardship for transgender servicemembers who wish to transition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Nor is this dispositive of whether the Mattis Plan targets\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   transgender persons or is instead facially neutral. But it does mean that the Mattis Plan does not target\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   transgender persons, at least on this record, and it was therefore error to conclude that the Mattis Plan was not a substantive change from the 2017 Presidential Memorandum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As we observed in the Judgment, the separation of powers principles upon which our Constitution is based requires that courts defer to the reasoned, professional analysis of Congress and the Executive on matters strictly within the realm of military expertise. This is so because the Constitution vests authority over the armed forces with Congress and the Executive, because military policies devised by the political branches are accountable to the electorate while those imposed by judges are not, and because, generally speaking, judges do not have competence in matters of military personnel and training.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rostker v.

Rather, our review involves the careful assessment of a number of factors, including whether the policy is facially neutral, whether it targets a suspect class, whether the class is similarly situated to others affected, whether the policy was motivated by animus, whether it infringes upon a fundamental right (and, if so, how), what military purposes are furthered by the policy, whether those purposes are legitimate, and whether Congress or the Executive used considered professional judgment and accommodated the servicemembers' rights in a reasonable and evenhanded manner, given the rights at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   At this juncture, I express no views on these various factors, including whether the Mattis Plan was a product of comparable \"considered professional judgment\" as the policy in\n   <em>\n    Goldman,\n   </em>\n   other than to concur with the Judgment that the Plan and its accompanying Panel Report constituted changed circumstances that warrant vacating the preliminary injunction and assessing the Mattis Plan anew. This is especially true since the preliminary injunction relied heavily on the curious circumstances surrounding the President's tweet and subsequent Memorandum, which reversed a policy supported by lengthy and careful study and replaced it with a policy lacking the apparent support of any contradictory study. Reassessment is also necessary to clarify whether requiring service in one's biological sex impacts all servicemembers who identify as transgender in the same manner, because that impacts whether the Mattis Plan should be construed as one monolithic policy rather than analyzed separately into its constituent elements. Once those matters are understood, the District Court can properly review the policy or policies challenged by Plaintiffs. I express no views on the merits or the outcome of that reassessment. I write only to provide some guidance to the parties and the District Court so that this matter can proceed\n   in an efficient manner.

Op. at 706-07, 715-16, 735-37 (Williams, J., concurring). For several reasons, I disagree. To begin with, having found adequate non-constitutional reasons to vacate the preliminary injunction, it is inappropriate to seek out constitutional questions to decide in order to reach the same result. The concurrence strains to find a case on point, but all are inapposite; none holds that we are required to reach the merits of the claims in order to dissolve a preliminary injunction. Further, even if we have the discretion to reach the merits, that doesn't mean we should, particularly when they are constitutional claims. \"A fundamental and longstanding principle of judicial restraint requires that courts avoid reaching constitutional questions in advance of the necessity of deciding them.\"\n   <em>\n    Lyng v.

A correct resolution at this stage is important because the decisions of the district court reflect what in my view are wholly mistaken assumptions about the nature of constitutional review of military personnel policy-at least on the facts of this case. To be specific, the court contemplates a highly intrusive examination of the mental processes of the civilian and military leadership of a coordinate branch of government. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Doe 2 v. Mattis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526474\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/322/92/#p101\">\n    322 F.Supp.3d 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 101 (D.D.C. 2018) (declaring that plaintiffs \"are entitled to complete discovery\" regarding the executive's \"alleged deliberations\");\n   <em>\n    Doe 2 v.

These interrogations are to be aimed, the district court has said, at uncovering infirmities in a policy that the secretary of defense, in his \"professional judgment,\" has determined is essential to putting our armed forces \"in the strongest position to protect the American people.\" Memorandum from Secretary Mattis to President Trump 3 (Feb. 22, 2018) (\"\n   <em>\n    Mattis Memo\n   </em>\n   \"), J.A. 265. Under prevailing constitutional doctrine, however, this case can (and should) be resolved on the existing record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   I should start by clarifying what this case is actually about. It is not about a \"transgender ban.\" See, e.g., Appellees' Br. 2. The challenged policy expressly provides that \"[t]ransgender persons ...\n   <em>\n    may serve, like all other Service members\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Mattis Memo\n   </em>\n   3, J.A. 265 (emphasis added). It is instead about whether the Constitution requires the current administration to reinstate a policy created by the previous administration allowing certain transgender individuals to serve in their preferred gender rather than their biological sex, as all service members have for decades.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . For those transgender persons for whom the value of serving otherwise than in their biological sex exceeds the value of being in the military, of course, the policy thwarts their wish to serve. The Constitution does not compel the military to yield to their preference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Once we abstract away from the politically charged subject-matter-as we must-this is a straightforward legal case. Our \"Constitution vests [t]he complex, subtle, and professional decisions as to the composition, training, equipping, and control of a military force exclusively in the legislative and executive branches.\"\n   <em>\n    Panel Judgment\n   </em>\n   *2 (alteration in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Kreis v.

So, although the policy argument in favor of accommodating plaintiffs' claimed entitlement to transition into their preferred gender may be compelling, the legal argument for requiring such accommodation is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The current administration's policy-which is far more accommodating to transgender service than that of any administration from 1789 until 2016-easily passes constitutional muster. Given their biological differences, males and females have long been assigned to separate berthing, bathroom, and shower facilities, and subject to different sets of physical fitness, body fat, uniform, and grooming standards. This is unquestionably lawful; it is required (in part) by Congress, see, e.g.,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207419\">\n    10 U.S.C. \u00a7 7419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and has been approved (repeatedly) by the Supreme Court, see, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Opp'n to Mot. to Dismiss 10 (May 11, 2018), ECF No. 130)). That is so, they say, because the Mattis policy, unlike the Carter policy, does not accommodate gender transition. Whereas the Carter policy allows individuals to undergo a gender transition (ranging, as we have seen, from purely \"social\" changes to complete transformational surgery) and to then serve in their preferred gender (rather than their biological sex),\n   <em>\n    Carter Memo\n   </em>\n   , attachment at 1-2, J.A. 588-89;\n   <em>\n    Carter Memo Implementation Handbook\n   </em>\n   43, J.A. 550, the Mattis policy sticks to longstanding military practice: \"all\" individuals must serve in their \"biological sex.\" Thus, individuals who have undergone gender transition (to live outside their biological sex) are ineligible,\n   <em>\n    Mattis Memo\n   </em>\n   2-3, J.A. 264-65 (unless they qualify for a waiver or the reliance exception).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Plaintiffs' argument that this policy difference is of constitutional magnitude is fundamentally flawed-factually and legally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   <em>\n    1.

Their counsel's first substantive words were as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-178\">\n   [The Mattis policy] bans transgender people from the military, it bans only transgender people, and all transgender people.

Tr. 19:10-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   That is wrong. By requiring most individuals to serve in their biological sex, the Mattis policy does not \"translate[ ] into a ban on transgender persons.\" Appellees' Br. 20 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Doe II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525695\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/315/474/\">\n    315 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   494 ). This is so for at least three reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   First, the factual reality: As the panel found, there is \"nothing in the record\" to support plaintiffs' assertion that the \"defining\" characteristic of being \"transgender\" is not\n   <em>\n    living\n   </em>\n   in one's biological sex.\n   <em>\n    Panel Judgment\n   </em>\n   *2. To the contrary, \"everything in the record, from the Elders Report, the RAND Study, the Carter Memo and the Mattis Memo consistently define a transgender person as a person who does not '\n   <em>\n    identify\n   </em>\n   ' with [his or her] biological sex.\"\n   <em>\n    O\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    p.\n   </em>\n   701 (Wilkins, J., concurring) (emphasis added); see, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    DoD Report\n   </em>\n   7 n.10, J.A. 275;\n   <em>\n    RAND Report\n   </em>\n   at x, J.A. 606;\n   <em>\n    Report of the Transgender Military Service Commission\n   </em>\n   5 (Mar. 2014), J.A. 752;\n   <em>\n    Carter Memo Implementation Handbook\n   </em>\n   13, J.A. 520. Even plaintiffs' own expert, along with the American Medical Association (in support of plaintiffs), define \"transgender\" in terms of how one \"\n   <em>\n    identi[fies]\n   </em>\n   ,\" not how one\n   <em>\n    lives\n   </em>\n   . See Brown 2017 Decl. \u00b6 13, J.A. 1056 (emphasis added); AMA Br. 3 (same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   There is, moreover, no doubt that many transgender individuals can, do, and wish to serve\n   <em>\n    in their biological sex\n   </em>\n   . Contrary to plaintiffs' assertion, the transgender community is not a monolith in which every person wants to take steps necessary to live in accord with his or her preferred gender (rather than his or her biological sex). Quite the opposite. The implementation handbook for the Carter policy, for example, explains that only \"some\" transgender individuals \"feel compelled\" to \"transition to the preferred gender.\"\n   <em>\n    Carter Memo Implementation Handbook\n   </em>\n   13, J.A. 52. The Elders Report adds that the \"transgender community includes people\" who do not even \"wish to transition.\"\n   <em>\n    Report of the Transgender Military Service Commission\n   </em>\n   5, J.A. 752. And the RAND Report specifies that only 55% of \"transgender individuals\" reported \"living\" in their preferred gender; of the remainder, only half-27% of the total-even \"wished to transition at some point in the future.\"\n   <em>\n    RAND Report\n   </em>\n   20 &amp; n.2, J.A. 636 &amp; n.2. This leaves but one conclusion, as the military has already found: transgender individuals can serve and are \"serving[ ] with distinction ... [in] their biological sex.\"\n   <em>\n    Panel Judgment\n   </em>\n   *2 (quoting\n   <em>\n    DoD Report\n   </em>\n   6, J.A. 274).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Second, the Mattis policy's exceptions to the requirement of service in one's biological sex: Again, as the panel found, the policy \"contains a reliance exception,\"\n   <em>\n    Panel Judgment\n   </em>\n   *2, that expressly\n   <em>\n    permits\n   </em>\n   certain transgender individuals \"to serve in their preferred gender,\" rather than their biological sex,\n   <em>\n    Mattis Memo\n   </em>\n   2, J.A. 264. This exception covers around 1000 individuals, see\n   <em>\n    DoD Report\n   </em>\n   22, J.A. 290, so that even on the false premise that transgender must be equated with transition, the policy would not be a \"ban\" on \"all transgender people.\" It was \"clear error\" for the district court to hold otherwise.\n   <em>\n    Panel Judgment\n   </em>\n   *2. Moreover, the military reserves the authority-as it does for virtually all standards,\n   <em>\n    DoD Report\n   </em>\n   10, J.A. 278-to issue waivers for persons who would otherwise be ineligible,\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 5, J.A. 273.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Third, the internal inconsistency in plaintiffs' position:\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs\n   </em>\n   demand a return\n   to the Carter policy. See Second Am. Compl. 20, J.A. 209;\n   <em>\n    Doe I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12418268\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/275/167/#p178\">\n    275 F.Supp.3d at 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But even that policy, plaintiffs admit, requires transgender persons to serve\n   <em>\n    in their biological sex\n   </em>\n   until their gender transition is \"complete.\" Appellees' Br. 45; see\n   <em>\n    Carter Memo Implementation Handbook\n   </em>\n   11, J.A. 518. So, if \"a requirement to serve in one's biological sex\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   a transgender ban,\" Appellees' Br. 15, plaintiffs' logic seems to doom the very remedy they now seek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   To put it simply: The Mattis policy-by declining to make the same accommodations for gender transition as the Carter policy-does not translate into a \"transgender ban.\" See\n   <em>\n    Panel Judgment\n   </em>\n   *2 (holding that the district court \"clear[ly] err[ed]\" in \"finding that the Mattis Plan was the equivalent of a blanket ban on transgender service\"). And no amount of discovery will change \"this fact.\" But cf.\n   <em>\n    O\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    p.\n   </em>\n   705 n.* (Wilkins, J., concurring).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   <em>\n    2.

But the handbook is not \"directive in nature\"; it provides only a \"general discussion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 48, J.A. 555. So, the commander is \"reminded\" to also \"consult with [his] Chain of Command, ... Service, and DoD guidelines before determining the best course(s) of action.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . And, as always, he should \"[c]onsult with [the] SCCC [the Service Central Coordination Cell],\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 63, J.A. 570; accord\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . 48, J.A. 555-a service-level \"cell of experts created to provide multi-disciplinary (e.g., medical, legal) advice and assistance to commanders with regard to service by transgender Service members,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 12, J.A. 519. And this is only a swim test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   A multitude of similar puzzles-e.g., issues concerning showers (\"Scenario 11\"), sleeping (\"Scenario 15\"), and social events (\"Scenario 16\")-would call on the commander to re-consult the handbook, his \"Chain of Command, SCCC, Service, and DoD guidelines before determining the best course(s) of action.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 48, J.A. 555; see\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 60-65, J.A. 567-72. If the commander found time for military issues-after, say, adjusting the \"timing\" of the shower facilities to avoid any conflicts and ensuring that each \"shower stall[ ]\" contains \"curtains\" and \"clothing hooks,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 60-61, J.A. 567-68-then matters become \"more complicated\" still,\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 69, J.A. 576. Consider deployments. Because \"[s]ome nations view transgender people as culturally unacceptable and will not recognize [an] individual's preferred gender,\" the commander must \"[c]onduct a thorough analysis of the\" destination country by reviewing \"the U.S. State Department's country specific website\" and the \"DoD Foreign Clearance Guide\"-as well as, of course, \"discuss[ing] the situation with [his] chain of command and the SCCC.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .

But (1) the Mattis policy is facially neutral, and (2) it would not trigger heightened scrutiny even if it were not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   The Mattis policy, like the Carter policy before it, turns not on transgender status, but on a medical condition called gender dysphoria. See\n   <em>\n    Mattis Memo\n   </em>\n   2-3, J.A. 264-65;\n   <em>\n    Carter Memo\n   </em>\n   , attachment at 1, J.A. 588. In fact, the Mattis policy expressly provides that \"[t]ransgender persons without a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria, who are otherwise qualified for service,\n   <em>\n    may serve, like all other Service members\n   </em>\n   , in their biological sex.\"\n   <em>\n    Mattis Memo\n   </em>\n   3, J.A. 265 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   Plaintiffs, of course, object to the requirement that all must serve in their biological sex. That is central to their claim. See Oral Arg. Tr. 19:12-16 (arguing that the Mattis policy \"requires anyone who serves to do so in their biological sex,\" but that \"not living in a person's biological sex is the defining characteristic of what it means to be transgender\"). But the requirement is nevertheless facially neutral; \"all\" means \"all.\" Transgender or non-transgender; gender dysphoria or non-gender dysphoria ; \"all\" service members must serve \"in their biological sex.\"\n   <em>\n    Mattis Memo\n   </em>\n   3, J.A. 265. This can't be facially discriminatory as to transgender persons; military officials need not know an individual's transgender status in order to enforce the policy-knowledge of physical characteristics unrelated to gender preference is both necessary and sufficient.

The argument (it seems) proceeds as follows: Whereas both transgender\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    non\n   </em>\n   -transgender people can experience gender dysphoria,\"\n   <em>\n    Report of the Transgender Military Service Commission\n   </em>\n   24 n.31, J.A. 771 (emphasis added); accord\n   <em>\n    DoD Report\n   </em>\n   20 n.57, J.A. 288, the Mattis policy presumptively disqualifies\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    [t]ransgender\n   </em>\n   persons with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria,\" Appellees' Br. 20 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Mattis Memo\n   </em>\n   2, J.A. 264).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   But in reality\n   <em>\n    non\n   </em>\n   -transgender people with gender dysphoria are no better off than their\n   <em>\n    transgender\n   </em>\n   compatriots in terms of rules for accession and retention. And this would be true even if the Mattis policy on gender dysphoria were applied only to transgender persons, as plaintiffs claim, but the record appears to bely. See\n   <em>\n    DoD Report\n   </em>\n   42, J.A. 310 (describing the Mattis policy's gender dysphoria disqualification in terms of all \"persons\"). Non-transgender individuals who develop gender dysphoria do so as a consequence of grievous injuries or diseases, see\n   <em>\n    DoD Report\n   </em>\n   20 n.57, J.A. 288 (citing\n   <em>\n    Report of the Transgender Military Service Commission\n   </em>\n   24 n.31, J.A. 771), that are themselves presumptively disqualifying. The only examples in the record involve horrific testicular wounds or mastectomies because of cancer. But, absent waiver, no individual-transgender or not-may join the military with a history of such conditions. See\n   <em>\n    DoD Instruction 6130.03: Medical Standards for Appointment, Enlistment, or Induction into the Military Services\n   </em>\n   25 (May 6, 2018), J.A. 236 (disqualifying those without testicles);\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 46, J.A. 257 (same for those with history of malignancy). And if an individual were already in the military when he or she began experiencing gender dysphoria, then-again, regardless of transgender status-that individual could \"be retained\" so long as he or she did \"not require a change of gender and remain[ed] deployable within applicable retention standards.\"\n   <em>\n    Mattis Memo\n   </em>\n   2, J.A. 26. There is thus no daylight between the opportunities available to transgender individuals with gender dysphoria and non-transgender individuals with gender dysphoria.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   And even if there were a difference-suppose there were, theoretically, a non-transgender person who suffered from gender dysphoria and who was eligible to serve without waiver-plaintiffs' attack on the Mattis policy would still be untenable. Plaintiffs cannot have their cake and eat it, too: they cannot seek to invalidate the Mattis policy on the basis that it \"subjects transgender people-and only transgender people-to a 'special\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   exclusionary rule,' \" Appellees' Br. 20, while, at the same time, seeking a remedy (a return to the Carter policy, see Second Am. Compl. 20, J.A. 209) that runs afoul of precisely the principle they invoke against the Mattis policy: it too subjects \"transgender\" people-and only \"transgender\" people-to a special additional exclusionary rule, see\n   <em>\n    Carter Memo\n   </em>\n   1, J.A. 585 (\"This DTM [Directive-type Memorandum]: Establishes policy ... for the standards for retention, accession ... for transgender personnel[.]\"). Cf.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Bethlehem Steel Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"813786\" index=\"325\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/446/652/#p661\">\n    446 F.2d 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 661 (2d Cir. 1971) (rejecting objection to one remedy where party didn't object to a different remedy that was \"logically ... subject to the same [alleged] defect\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   Further, the context refutes plaintiffs' inference of biased intent. To the extent that Secretary Mattis addressed \"transgender persons\" (as opposed to all persons), this focus seems more a sign of bureaucratic orderliness than animus. Recall that Secretary Carter\n   <em>\n    first\n   </em>\n   commissioned studies regarding service by \"transgender Service members\" and, ultimately, established a new policy for service by \"transgender personnel.\" See Memorandum from Secretary Carter to Secretaries of Military Departments (July 28, 2015), J.A. 709;\n   <em>\n    Carter Memo\n   </em>\n   , J.A. 585. It is only natural that his successor would follow suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   In addition, there appear to be genuine bureaucratic imperatives that swayed Secretary Carter as much as Secretary Mattis. For example, it seems quite rational to handle on a case-by-case basis (rather than with a formal policy) the evidently rare instances in which\n   <em>\n    non\n   </em>\n   -transgender persons develop gender dysphoria. The examples in the record seem in their nature to call for case-specific treatment-grievous battlefield injuries (i.e., \"genital wounds\") and drastic surgeries (i.e., \"mastectom[ies] because of breast cancer\").\n   <em>\n    DoD Report\n   </em>\n   20 n.57, J.A. 288. To handle these on an individualized basis seems more a matter of common sense than animus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   In any case, even if the Mattis policy\n   <em>\n    were\n   </em>\n   facially discriminatory, this fact would not compel a different result.

Ultimately, this is a matter best sorted out by the District Court in the first instance.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-271\">\n    Under the Carter policy, a service member \"must meet all military standards associated with the with member's gender marker in DEERS [the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System] and use military berthing, bathroom, and shower facilities in accordance with the DEERS gender marker.\"\n    <em>\n     Carter Memo Implementation Handbook\n    </em>\n    11, J.A. 518.
