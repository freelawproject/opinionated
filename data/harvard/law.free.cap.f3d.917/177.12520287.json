Reese was convicted in the District Court of six counts each of wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. His sentence was 70 months' imprisonment, restitution, and three years of supervised release. He appeals several issues affecting his conviction and sentencing, but we need address only one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Three weeks before the scheduled date of Reese's trial, after more than 50 days had expired on Reese's 70-day time limit under the Speedy Trial Act (for convenience, the \"Act\"), the District Court ordered a\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   continuance that postponed Reese's trial by an additional 79 days, at least 71 of which were not automatically excluded under the Act. At the time the continuance was entered, the District Court neither cited the Act, nor stated that time would be excluded, nor made findings of fact that would justify an exclusion of time under it. As a result, the 70-day time limit to bring Reese to trial expired long before his trial began.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   When Reese moved before trial to dismiss the indictment under the Act, the District Court should have granted the motion. The statutory remedy is to vacate Reese's conviction and remand for dismissal of the indictment. The Court should, based on the Act, determine in the first instance whether the dismissal is with or without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In December 2015 a federal grand jury in the Middle District of Pennsylvania returned an indictment charging defendant-appellant Kevin L. Reese with six counts of wire fraud and six counts of aggravated identity theft related to his work as an office manager at Sheehan Pipe Line and Construction Company in Dunmore, Pennsylvania. The indictment alleged that, between November 2014 and August 2015, Reese devised and implemented a scheme to defraud Sheehan by cutting false checks on Sheehan's behalf to other employees and then cashing them in their names.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Soon after he was indicted, Reese retained defense attorney Joseph D'Andrea for all proceedings in the trial court. After his arraignment on January 4, 2016, he entered a plea of not guilty as to all counts. On January 11, 2016, the District Court entered an order scheduling jury selection and the start of trial for March 7, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Between February 23 and September 1, 2016, the Court granted six motions for\n   continuance, five filed by the Government with D'Andrea's consent, and one filed by D'Andrea on Reese's behalf. For each of these orders the Court excluded time under the Speedy Trial Act on the ground that additional time would enable the Government and Reese to continue negotiating a potential plea deal. As a result of these continuances, Reese's trial was scheduled for October 24, 2016, with a pretrial conference on October 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 12, 2016, however, the District Court\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   entered an order rescheduling Reese's trial for December 5, 2016. The order did not state a reason for the continuance other than to say it was \"in accordance with the Court's calendar.\" The order also stated that the delay in Reese's trial occasioned by this order-a period of 42 days-would be excluded under the Speedy Trial Act because \"[t]his Court finds that the ends of justice served by this order outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203161\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(7)(A) and (h)(7)(B)(iv).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On November 10, 2016, the District Court held a pretrial conference, which Reese attended represented by D'Andrea. It opened with the following colloquy concerning the date of Reese's trial:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   THE COURT: So I'm setting the trial-and I apologize for this, because I can't try the case until February, February 22nd.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   MR. D'ANDREA: February 22nd will work for me. I'm just really bad in December and January myself. February opens up.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The District Judge and the attorneys then discussed other pre-trial matters and the Court's trial practices. There was no further discussion of postponing Reese's trial or the need to exclude time under the Speedy Trial Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Following the conference, the District Court entered an order rescheduling Reese's trial for February 22, 2017. It stated that Reese's trial was rescheduled \"per the final pretrial conference held November 10, 2016,\" without any further explanation for the basis of the rescheduling. It did not mention the exclusion of time under the Speedy Trial Act or use any language that would suggest a finding by the Court that an exclusion was proper. No pre-trial motions were pending or filed between November 10, 2016 and February 9, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 10, 2017, twelve days before trial, Reese filed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   a motion requesting a hearing for the purpose of dismissing his retained counsel and obtaining the appointment of substitute counsel. According to Reese, he was entitled to have new counsel appointed on the eve of trial because there was a complete breakdown in communication and an irreconcilable conflict with his retained attorney, D'Andrea. On February 15, 2017, the Court held a hearing on Reese's motion for appointment of counsel and denied the motion from the bench.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Just before trial began, Reese, through D'Andrea, filed a motion for dismissal of the charges based on a violation of the 70-day time limit under the Speedy Trial Act. The Court denied the motion from the bench, stating as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   I am going to deny the motion. The defendant sat on his rights, he didn't do anything.... And he made no indications that he disagreed with the continuances. And throughout these proceedings he had counsel. We have\n   a case defendant's consent is not required for a continuance request by his counsel for the ends of justice, and that's ... [\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As noted, the District Court entered\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   continuance orders on October 12, 2016, and November 10, 2016. Reese contends that neither excluded time under the Act. But we need not address the challenge to the October 12, 2016 order because we rule in favor of Reese under\n   the Act based on the delay caused by the second\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   continuance. That order did not validly exclude time under the Act. The contemporaneous record consists of the transcript of the pre-trial hearing on November 10 and the written continuance order itself. Neither invokes the Act nor uses any language that would suggest an exclusion of time under it, as would be required to allow exclusion under\n   <em>\n    Brooks\n   </em>\n   through a later supplementing of the record. Likewise, neither contains any factual findings that demonstrate a \"balanc[ing] [of] the interests of the public and of all the defendants,\" as would be required to exclude time under\n   <em>\n    Rivera\n   </em>\n   . Accordingly, under\n   <em>\n    Brenna\n   </em>\n   the Court failed to exclude time under the Act and the period of delay occasioned by the order-a period of at least 71 days\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   -counted under the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   There is no dispute that, when the District Court entered the November 10, 2016 order, a period of 50 days had already expired on the Speedy Trial clock. Given the additional 70-plus unexcluded days caused by the November order, the 70-day time limit to bring Reese to trial expired long before the first day of his trial. (Indeed, the unexcluded period of delay caused by the order was itself longer than what is allowed under the Act.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Government makes three principal arguments against vacating Reese's conviction under the Act, no one of which succeeds. First, it contends the continuance was entered \"in consultation with\" Reese's counsel during the November 10 pre-trial conference. We reject this attempt to rewrite the record, which makes clear that the District Court began the conference by stating: \"So I'm setting the trial-and I apologize for this, because I can't try the case until February, February 22nd.\" Although D'Andrea's statement in response to the District Court's postponement of trial suggests he may have been unavailable for trial before February (which may in turn have been a basis for the Court to exclude time under the Act), the Court made no finding that it was stopping the clock based on counsel's availability. Rather, the record shows the Court had already made the decision to postpone trial due to the Court's own schedule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Second, the Government asserts that Reese cannot now complain because he \"was present\" at the conference and \"raised no objection to the rescheduled date.\" It emphasizes that D'Andrea not only did not object to the continuance, but if anything voiced his acquiescence to it. However, this argument runs headlong into\n   <em>\n    Zedner\n   </em>\n   , in which the Supreme Court squarely rejected the prospective exclusion of time \"on the grounds of mere consent or waiver.\"\n   <em>\n    Zedner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276046\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/489/#p497\">\n    547 U.S. at 500-01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276046\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/489/#p497\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1976\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Third, the Government argues that Reese's Speedy Trial Act challenge fails because he did not establish prejudice. But those arguments, which rely on case law addressing the Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial, do not apply in the Speedy Trial Act context. As Justice Alito explained for a unanimous Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Zedner\n   </em>\n   , \"[t]he relevant provisions of the Act are unequivocal.... When a trial is not commenced within the prescribed period of time, 'the information or indictment\n   <em>\n    shall be dismissed\n   </em>\n   on motion of the defendant.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276046\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/489/#p497\">\n    547 U.S. at 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276046\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/489/#p497\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1976\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original).

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Our decisions give district courts considerable leeway in making the findings required to exclude time from the 70-day time limit under the Speedy Trial Act. But there are still limits. When a district court enters a continuance order without either stating the factual basis for excluding time under the Act or using language that invokes it (the latter of which allows a later factual explanation), the delay caused by the continuance is not excluded and the district court cannot exclude the time in hindsight. That a defendant does not object to the continuance or even expresses acquiescence to the continuance does not change this analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In this case, as a result of the District Court's November 2016\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   continuance, the 70-day clock expired long before Reese was brought to trial. When he moved to dismiss the indictment under the Act, the Court should have dismissed the indictment. The remedy for this error is to reverse the District Court's decision, vacate Reese's conviction, and remand for dismissal of the indictment. That Court needs to decide in the first instance whether the dismissal is with or without prejudice per the factors in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203162\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   AMBRO and GREENAWAY, Circuit Judges, concurring\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We write separately to address a trend among our sister Circuits that appears to be expanding the doctrine of waiver by defendants under the Speedy Trial Act. To be clear, the Government has foregone any assertion that Reese waived his Speedy Trial Act challenge in this case by not raising the issue in its appellate brief or in oral argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Seventh Circuit was the first expressly to break this ground in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

As most recently formulated by the Second Circuit, these courts have held that filing a timely motion to dismiss on Speedy Trial Act grounds is not enough if a defendant \"fail[s] to challenge a particular period of delay.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Holley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088774\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/813/117/#p121\">\n    813 F.3d 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 121 (2d Cir. 2016) (\n   <em>\n    per curiam\n   </em>\n   );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Cir. 2015) ;\n   <em>\n    United States v. Loughrin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3551897\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/1111/#p1121\">\n    710 F.3d 1111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1121 (10th Cir. 2013) ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Thus, those Circuits have held, \"[w]hen a defendant fails to specify the particular exclusions of time within his or her motion to dismiss, [he] has failed to move for dismissal on that ground\" and has waived the right to dismissal because of it.\n   <em>\n    Holley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088774\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/813/117/#p121\">\n    813 F.3d at 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   These Circuits have buttressed their holdings with several prudential considerations. First, if a defendant is not deemed to waive arguments unmade in the motion to dismiss, \"[it] would force the court on a motion to dismiss [on Speedy Trial Act grounds] to consider every conceivable basis for challenging its orders of continuance and exclusions of time, for fear that the defendant would raise new arguments on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Loughrin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3551897\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/1111/#p1121\">\n    710 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1121 ;\n   <em>\n    accord, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    O'Connor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3832026\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/656/630/#p637\">\n    656 F.3d at 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"If [the mere] filing a motion to dismiss were enough to preserve all violations of the Act-whether identified in the motion or not-then the district court or the government, rather than the defendant, would effectively bear the burden of 'spotting violations,' contrary to the Court's instruction in\n   <em>\n    Zedner\n   </em>\n   .\"). Second, forcing a defendant to identify specific periods of delay \"ensures that the district court has the opportunity to develop all arguments below and fully explain its reasoning for excluding a particular period of delay.\"\n   <em>\n    Holley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088774\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/813/117/#p121\">\n    813 F.3d at 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Third, \"requiring defendants to notify district courts of any potential exclusions of time within their motions to dismiss ... prevents undue defense gamesmanship.\"\n   <em>\n    Taplet\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6890994,6055551\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/776/875/\">\n    776 F.3d at 880\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks omitted). In the absence of this broadened waiver doctrine, the rationale goes, defendants may \"withhold meritorious non-excludable time in their motions to dismiss on the chance that, if their trials go badly,\" an appellate court's reversal under the Act will provide \"a one-time reset button\" and give them \"a second bite of the apple.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6890994,6055551\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/776/875/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6890994,6055551\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/776/875/\">\n    at 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   We observe that a different approach to construing the waiver provision in the Act is more easily reconciled with the language of the Act and the\n   <em>\n    Zedner\n   </em>\n   decision. A defendant who moves to dismiss an indictment under the Act has \"the burden of proof of supporting such motion.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203162\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). Thus, to the extent a\n   defendant's motion is premised on a challenge to the district court's exclusion of a specific period of time under the Act, he bears the burden to prove the exclusion was invalid. We thus would reach the same result as our sister Circuits in that scenario.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   But to the extent a defendant's motion is premised more generally on the clear expiration of more than 70 unexcluded days under the Act, the defendant can meet his burden of proof under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203162\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) by notifying the district court of its expiration through a basic motion to dismiss under the Act. In that latter scenario, a district court is obliged under\n   <em>\n    Zedner\n   </em>\n   at least to \"tally the unexcluded days\" and, if they exceed the 70 days allowed under the Act, dismiss the indictment per the Act.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276046\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/489/#p497\">\n    547 U.S. at 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276046\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/489/#p497\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1976\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In most cases the distinction we propose will make no difference. Generally a defendant seeking dismissal on Speedy Trial Act grounds will need to challenge a district court's exclusion of time to succeed on his motion. This means that a defendant typically must \"challenge a particular period of delay,\" as other Circuits have held.\n   <em>\n    Holley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088774\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/813/117/#p121\">\n    813 F.3d at 121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But in some cases a basic motion to dismiss will suffice to establish the point that dismissal is warranted. For example, if a defendant were indicted and arraigned but the court never set a date for trial, it would make no sense to require the defendant to challenge a specific continuance order or a specific period of delay other than to move to dismiss in a timely way. Similarly in this case (when Reese filed his motion at the end of the over 70-day unexcluded delay caused by the District Court's\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   continuance), Reese's motion was enough to demonstrate to the Court that more than 70 unexcluded days had expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In short, we believe Reese's Speedy Trial Act challenge would have survived a waiver argument had the Government made one.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Because we resolve Reese's appeal under the Speedy Trial Act, we omit the details of his pre-trial motion for the appointment of counsel. We also express no view on whether the District Court erred in denying that motion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    On appeal, Reese raises four claims of error related to his sentencing. As a structural error, he contends (i) the District Court violated his Sixth Amendment right to choose his sentencing counsel by denying his post-conviction motion for new counsel. In addition, he claims (ii) ineffective assistance of sentencing counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment, (iii) violation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(i)(1)(A), which requires the District Court to \"verify that the defendant and the defendant's attorney have read and discussed the presentence report and any addendum to the report,\" and (iv) overbreadth and vagueness of a special condition of supervised release that would prohibit him from \"obtaining any employment in which he would have control over money, finances, or engage in financial transactions.\" Each of these additional claims of error has considerable merit and could very well justify vacating Reese's sentence and remanding for resentencing. But because we resolve this appeal by vacating Reese's conviction under the Speedy Trial Act, we omit here the troubling factual grounds underlying these additional claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    In relevant part, the provision states: \"In any case in which a plea of not guilty is entered, the trial of a defendant charged in an information or indictment with the commission of an offense shall commence within seventy days from the filing date (and making public) of the information or indictment, or from the date the defendant has appeared before a judicial officer of the court in which such charge is pending, whichever date last occurs.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    The \"ends of justice\" provision examined by the\n    <em>\n     Zedner\n    </em>\n    Court has been relocated from \u00a7 3161(h)(8)(A) to the present-day codification in \u00a7 3161(h)(7)(A).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    We have also established standards for \"open-ended\" continuances in the ends of justice,\n    <em>\n     see, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     United States v.

During oral argument his counsel acknowledged that the period of delay caused by the continuance was actually 79 calendar days and suggested that his prior calculation of 71 days may have been an understatement. The Government did not dispute either of these calculations, and we need not resolve the minor inconsistency because both 71 and 79 are greater than the 70 days allotted under the Act, especially when added to the 50 days that had expired before the District Court entered its November 2016 order (a number the Government also does not contest).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    In denying Reese's motion to dismiss, the District Court cited\n    <em>\n     United States v.
