Williams argues that the District Court erred in denying his motions to dismiss the Indictment, in which he asserted that time had elapsed in excess of the seventy-day period during which the Speedy Trial Act requires the Government to commence a trial of a defendant, and Williams petitions the Court to dismiss the Indictment with prejudice. For the reasons that follow, we hold that Williams's rights under the Speedy Trial Act were violated, and we will reverse the order of the District Court denying Williams's motions to dismiss the Indictment, vacate the judgment of conviction and sentence imposed, and remand to the District Court with the direction to dismiss the Indictment with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 28, 2014, the Government charged Williams, in a five-count Information, with (a) possessing a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school zone, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (q)(2)(A) and 924(a)(4) ; (b) discharging a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school zone, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (q)(3)(A) and 924(a)(4) ; (c) discharging a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(A) ; (d) assault with a deadly weapon, in violation of V.I. Code tit. 14, \u00a7 295(2) ; and (e) possessing, transporting, and carrying a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence, in violation of V.I. Code tit. 14, \u00a7 2253(a). The charges contained in the Information arose from Williams's conduct on December 24, 2013, when the Government alleges that Williams shot a store owner on St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, during an altercation that began inside the store owner's place of business and ended outside of a nearby elementary and high school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Nearly a month after the Government's filing the Information, but before Williams had been arraigned, Williams's counsel filed a motion for a hearing to determine Williams's mental competency pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204241\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Thereafter, the District Court granted Williams's motion, ordering Williams to undergo a psychological examination. Williams refused to participate in the court-ordered psychological examination, however, and thus the District Court neither received a formal report nor held a hearing with respect to Williams's competency. As a result, the Government filed its own motion for a hearing to determine Williams's competency, which the District Court granted on June 11, 2014. The District Court ordered that Williams be transported to the Federal Medical Center in Butner, North Carolina (\"FMC Butner\"), to undergo a psychological examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following day-June 12, 2014-a grand jury returned a five-count Indictment,\n   charging Williams with (a) discharging a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school zone, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (q)(3)(A) and 924(a)(4) ; (b) possessing a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school zone, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (q)(2)(A) and 924(a)(4) ; (c) possessing, on a separate occasion, a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school zone, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (q)(2)(A) and 924(a)(4) ; (d) assault with a deadly weapon, in violation of V.I. Code tit. 14, \u00a7 297(2) ; and (e) possessing, transporting, and carrying a firearm during the commission of a crime of violence, in violation of V.I. Code tit. 14, \u00a7 2253(a). Four of the counts arose from the same conduct that was the subject of the charges contained in the Information; the second count for possessing a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school zone arose from Williams's arrest on December 29, 2013. On June 18, 2014, Williams was arraigned with respect to the charges contained in the Indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Pursuant to the District Court's order dated June 11, 2014, Williams was transported to FMC Butner to undergo a psychological examination, but Williams did not arrive at FMC Butner until July 29, 2014. Following an examination of Williams, on October 31, 2014, a forensic psychologist submitted a formal report to the District Court with respect to Williams's competency. On November 5, 2014, the District Court held a hearing, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204241\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , to determine Williams's mental competency. The District Court determined that Williams lacked the mental competency to stand trial and, on November 6, 2014, entered an order committing Williams to the custody of the United States Attorney General pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204241\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   During the period of Williams's incompetency, the Government filed a motion to involuntarily medicate Williams, in an attempt to restore his competency. On October 9, 2015, the District Court held an evidentiary hearing on the Government's motion. During a recess, a physician employed by FMC Butner-who previously recommended that Williams be involuntarily medicated-conducted an examination of Williams, after which the physician testified that Williams indeed was\n   <em>\n    competent\n   </em>\n   to stand trial. Following the testimony of the physician, the Government withdrew its motion, and the District Court indicated that it promptly would set a date for Williams's trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The District Court did not set a trial date, however, and neither the Government nor Williams filed any pleadings in the case for nearly two months following the evidentiary hearing on October 9, 2015. On December 2, 2015, the Government ended the fifty-three-day lapse in activity by filing a motion in limine (the \"Motion in Limine\") to \"exclude evidence, argument, or questioning regarding [Williams's] mental health or competency.\" App. 87.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Rather than filing a brief in opposition to the Government's Motion in Limine, on December 18, 2015, Williams filed a motion to dismiss the Indictment (the \"First Motion to Dismiss\"), asserting that his rights under the Speedy Trial Act had been violated. The Government filed a brief in opposition to Williams's First Motion to Dismiss on December 31, 2015, and the District Court held an evidentiary hearing with respect to Williams's First Motion to Dismiss on February 25, 2016. At the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing, the District Court ordered the Government and Williams to submit supplemental briefing on certain issues raised during the hearing, which the parties submitted on March 10, 2016. The District Court then ordered the Government to reply to the arguments raised by Williams in his supplemental brief. The Government, with the District\n   Court's permission, filed an out-of-time reply on March 31, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Following the Government's submission on March 31, 2016, approximately three-and-a-half months elapsed, during which neither party filed pleadings and during which the District Court took no further action with respect to Williams's First Motion to Dismiss. Then, on July 15, 2016, Williams filed a second motion to dismiss the Indictment (the \"Second Motion to Dismiss\" and, together with the First Motion to Dismiss, the \"Motions to Dismiss\"), reiterating and supplementing his arguments that his rights under the Speedy Trial Act had been violated. After nearly three months of inaction on the parts of the Government and the District Court with respect to his Second Motion to Dismiss, Williams filed a writ of mandamus in this Court to compel the District Court to rule on the still-pending Motions to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In response to Williams's filing his writ of mandamus, and prior to this Court's consideration of Williams's writ of mandamus, the District Court took a number of actions. On October 24, 2016, the District Court set a trial date for the matter and ordered Williams to submit a reply brief with respect to the Government's Motion in Limine, which had been pending since December 2, 2015. Two days later, on October 26, 2016, the District Court, in an order that did not include written reasons,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   denied Williams's Second Motion to Dismiss and denied Williams's First Motion to Dismiss as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Pursuant to a plea agreement with the Government, Williams subsequently pleaded guilty to one count of possessing a firearm within 1,000 feet of a school zone, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (q)(3)(A) and 924(a)(4), but explicitly \"reserve[d] the right to appeal [any potential] speedy trial violation.\" App. 242. The District Court sentenced Williams to a term of \"time served\" and a one-year period of supervised release. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203231\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

VI. Congress enacted the Speedy Trial Act to give effect to this constitutional guarantee \"by setting specified time limits ... within which criminal trials must be commenced.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Pursuant to the Speedy Trial Act, \"the trial of a defendant charged in an information or indictment with the commission of an offense shall commence within seventy days from the filing date (and making public) of the information or indictment, or from the date the defendant has appeared before a judicial officer of the court in which such charge is pending, whichever date last occurs.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203161\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1). Thus, under the Speedy Trial Act, a seventy-day \"clock\" begins to run upon the latest of (x) the\n   filing of an information, (y) the filing of an indictment, or (z) a defendant's appearance, and the Government must commence a trial of the defendant prior to the expiration of the seventy-day clock.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Speedy Trial Act provides that certain periods of time are \"excludable\" for purposes of calculating the time within which the Government must commence a trial of a defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203161\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3161(h). In other words, certain events or occurrences \"stop\" the seventy-day speedy trial clock.

The controversy in this appeal centers on whether, or to what extent, the time between June 11, 2014-when the District Court ordered that Williams be transported to FMC Butner to undergo a psychological examination-and July 29, 2014-when Williams arrived at FMC Butner-is excludable for purposes of the seventy-day speedy trial clock.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   This appeal requires us to address, for the first time, the interplay between\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203161\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(1)(A) -which excludes periods of delay relating to proceedings to determine a defendant's mental competency-and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203161\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(1)(F) -which excludes certain periods of delay in connection with, among other things, transportation\n   of a defendant to a psychological examination.

Put differently, this appeal requires us to determine whether section 3161(h)(1)(F) places a limitation on the amount of time that can be excluded pursuant to section 3161(h)(1)(A) for a competency determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Several of our sister circuits have considered this question. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has held that\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   period of delay relating to a proceeding to determine a defendant's mental competency is excludable pursuant to section 3161(h)(1)(A), regardless of whether the delay is unreasonable or related to the transport of the defendant to the site of a psychological examination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Thus, the Second Circuit held that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   time between the filing of a motion for a competency determination and a hearing on such motion is excludable because the text of section 3161(h)(1)(A) does not contain any language limiting the applicability of the exclusion to only reasonable periods of delay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10533724\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/918/329/#p333\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The United States Courts of Appeals for the First, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits, however, have taken a contrary position.

Put simply, both section 3161(h)(1)(A) and section 3161(h)(1)(F) specifically relate to the same \"examinations\": section 3161(h)(1)(A) excludes periods of delay with respect to examinations,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and section 3161(h)(1)(F) excludes periods of delay in transporting a defendant to the site of such examinations and explicitly places a potential limitation on the amount of time that may be excludable for such transport delays.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Psychological examinations that necessitate the transport of defendants from their places of detention typically occur in the context of the competency determinations that are the subject of section 3161(h)(1)(A) -a defendant would not be transported out of his detention facility for a psychological examination in the absence of such a court-ordered competency determination.

Therefore, we hold that the period of delay between a party's filing a motion for a competency determination and a court's disposition of that motion is excludable, except that only ten days for transport of the defendant to the site of a psychological examination are automatically excludable; any period of transport delay in excess of ten days is presumptively unreasonable and, consequently, presumptively non-excludable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We now must determine the extent to which the period of delay in transporting Williams to FMC Butner in 2014 is excludable for purposes of the seventy-day speedy trial clock. The District Court entered its order directing that Williams be transported to FMC Butner for a psychological examination on June 11, 2014. Pursuant to section 3161(h)(1)(F), the period through June 21, 2014-ten days from the District Court's order directing Williams's\n   transport-is automatically excludable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203161\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(1)(F). The thirty-seven-day period between June 21, 2014, and July 29, 2014-when Williams arrived at FMC Butner-is presumptively unreasonable and, therefore, presumptively non-excludable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203161\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Government has not overcome the presumption that such thirty-seven-day period is non-excludable. The District Court held an evidentiary hearing with respect to the reasons for the delay in transporting Williams to FMC Butner, and thus the record is well developed in this regard. At the evidentiary hearing, which was held on February 25, 2016, the District Court heard testimony from the representative of the United States Marshals Service who was responsible for making Williams's transport arrangements. The only explanation for the delay that was offered by the representative of the Marshals Service is that the Marshals Service did not receive the District Court's order directing Williams's transport until July 9, 2014. The automatic ten-day transport delay exclusion under section 3161(h)(1)(F), however, begins on \"the date of an\n   <em>\n    order\n   </em>\n   ... directing such transportation\"; the ten-day period does not begin on the date that the Marshals Service receives actual notice of such an order.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203161\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(1)(F) (emphasis added). Thus, delay-beyond ten days-in transporting a defendant that is attributable only to negligence on the part of the Government or a district court in relaying to the Marshals Service the order directing the defendant's transport is patently unreasonable and non-excludable. To hold otherwise would require us to ignore the text of section 3161(h)(1)(F) -which places the sole focus of the inquiry on the date of a court's order-and would require us to impose a notice requirement that the statute otherwise does not contain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Therefore, the thirty-seven days that elapsed between June 21, 2014, and July 29, 2014, are non-excludable because the Government has not overcome the presumption that this period of delay in transporting Williams to FMC Butner is unreasonable. Given that the Government concedes that a separate, fifty-three-day period of non-excludable delay elapsed between October 9, 2015, and December 2, 2015, a total of ninety days of non-excludable time had elapsed prior to the commencement of a trial of Williams, in violation of the seventy-day clock imposed by the Speedy Trial Act pursuant to section 3161(c)(1).

Because we hold that non-excludable time elapsed in excess of the seventy-day period within which the Government must have commenced a trial of Williams-namely, during the period between October 9, 2015, and December 2, 2015, and during all but ten days of the period between the District Court's order directing Williams to be transported to FMC Butner and his arrival there-we need not, and do not, reach the issues related to the Government's Motion in Limine, including whether the Motion in Limine is a \"pretrial motion\" that stops the seventy-day clock pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203161\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (h)(1)(D) or whether the Motion in Limine was \"under advisement\" by the District Court pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203161\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (h)(1)(H).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Although this case presents issues with respect to the determination of the date on which the seventy-day speedy trial clock began to run, it is unnecessary to address these issues because all non-excludable time in this case occurred after June 18, 2014-the date of Williams's first appearance with respect to the charges contained in the Indictment-which is the\n    <em>\n     latest\n    </em>\n    date on which the seventy-day clock could have begun to run pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203161\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c)(1).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Section 3161(h)(1)(A) excludes periods of \"delay resulting from any proceeding, including any\n    <em>\n     examinations\n    </em>\n    , to determine the mental competency ... of the defendant.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203161\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (h)(1)(A) (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Section 3161(h)(1)(F) applies to periods of \"delay resulting from transportation of any defendant ...\n    <em>\n     to and from places of examination\n    </em>\n    \" and automatically excludes a period of up to ten days for a defendant's transport to the site of a psychological examination; \"any time consumed in excess of ten days from the date an order ... directing such transportation\" to the site of a psychological examination \"and the defendant's arrival at the destination shall be presumed to be unreasonable.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%203161\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 3161(h)(1)(F) (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Our holding is limited to the impact of section 3161(h)(1)(F) on section 3161(h)(1)(A) in particular. We need not, and do not, opine on the interplay between section 3161(h)(1)(F) and other subsections of section 3161(h), including section 3161(h)(4), which excludes periods of delay resulting from the fact that the defendant is actually mentally incompetent. One of our sister circuits recently has addressed this issue, holding that any period of delay following a court's determination that a defendant is mentally incompetent is excludable under section 3161(h)(4) and that section 3161(h)(1)(F) does not limit the excludability of such period of delay whatsoever.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.

This holding of our sister circuit provides further support for the proposition that if section 3161(h)(1)(F) is to have\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    meaning, that subsection must relate to section 3161(h)(1)(A) and act as a limitation thereon.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
