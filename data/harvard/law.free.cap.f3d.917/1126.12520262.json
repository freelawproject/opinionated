Little of the tragic history involving nine different trial and appellate proceedings is relevant to this opinion, in which we determine only whether State Farm timely removed the case to federal court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Addressing an issue of first impression in this circuit, we join the Fourth Circuit in holding that receipt of an initial pleading by a statutorily designated agent does not begin the thirty-day removal clock under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1), and that it was instead actual receipt by State Farm that started the removal clock.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Elliott v. Am. States Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516073\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/883/384/#p394\">\n    883 F.3d 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 394 (4th Cir. 2018). Applying this rule, we conclude that State Farm timely removed the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Andersons sued State Farm in Washington state court. Because State Farm is an out-of-state (or \"foreign\") insurer, state law designates Washington's Insurance Commissioner as State Farm's statutory agent. RCW 48.05.200(1). To serve legal process on State Farm, the Andersons served the Commissioner, who\n   forwarded the complaint to State Farm's designated recipient. RCW 4.28.080(7)(a), 48.05.200(1) - (2). The Andersons served the Commissioner on February 9, 2015, and State Farm received the forwarded complaint four days later, on February 13. On March 16, State Farm removed the case to federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The parties agree on how to count to thirty, but they disagree over when to begin counting. According to the Andersons, removal was untimely because the thirty-day removal clock began on February 9, when the Commissioner received the complaint. State Farm contends removal was timely as calculated from February 13, when the forwarded copy of the complaint reached State Farm's designated recipient.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court agreed with State Farm and denied the Andersons' motion to remand. We have jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and review de novo the district court's ruling.\n   <em>\n    Patterson v.

A notice of removal must be filed \"within 30 days after the receipt by the defendant, through service or otherwise, of a copy of the initial pleading.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). One reading suggests removal was timely because the actual defendant-State Farm-did not receive notice until receiving the mailing from the Commissioner. That reading, however, does not account for the effect of service on a statutory agent. \"[T]he statute itself says nothing about service on a statutory agent,\"\n   <em>\n    Elliott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516073\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/883/384/#p394\">\n    883 F.3d at 392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and an agent designated by the state legislature to receive service fundamentally differs from a defendant's agent-in-fact, because the defendant has no meaningful say in or control over the former.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   14C Charles Alan Wright, et al.,\n   <em>\n    Federal Practice &amp; Procedure\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3731 (Rev. 4th ed. 2018) (\"Realistically speaking, of course, statutory agents are not true agents but merely are a medium for transmitting the relevant papers.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Washington law, however, lends some force to the position that service on a statutorily designated agent should qualify as \"receipt by the defendant\" for purposes of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). As a practical matter, a company cannot receive anything except through its agents, and Washington equates service upon the Commissioner with service upon the insurer. RCW 48.05.200(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, plaintiffs\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   serve foreign insurers via the Commissioner.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; RCW 4.28.080(7)(a).

It is a question of the construction of the federal statute on removal, and not the state statute.\"). So we decline to place much weight on Washington law and conclude that the federal removal statute is, at most, ambiguous on this point.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Elliott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516073\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/883/384/#p394\">\n    883 F.3d at 392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A] straightforward reading ... supports holding that the 30-day period ... is not triggered by service on a statutory agent ....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The legislative history, on the other hand, is unambiguous-it clearly demonstrates Congress' intent to avoid disparate application of the removal statute due to differences in state law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Murphy Bros., Inc. v.

Before Congress enacted \u00a7 1446(b), a defendant could remove at \"any time before the defendant [wa]s required by the laws of the State ... to answer or plead to the declaration or complaint.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2072\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1940). The practical effects of this regime varied widely among the states. Seeking a replacement that would \"give adequate time and operate uniformly throughout the Federal jurisdiction,\" Congress enacted \u00a7 1446(b). H.R. Rep. No. 80-308, at A135 (1947).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As initially enacted, however, \u00a7 1446(b) suffered the same infirmity: the removal deadline depended on procedural rules that varied by state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Murphy Bros.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133193\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/344/#p351\">\n    526 U.S. at 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133193\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/344/#p351\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, the removal clock began \"after commencement of the action or service of process, whichever [wa]s later.\" Act of June 25, 1948, Pub. L. No. 80-773, \u00a7 1446(b),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=62%20Stat.%20869\">\n    62 Stat. 869\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 939. In states like New York, which allowed a plaintiff to commence an action by serving the summons without the complaint, the removal deadline could expire before the defendant could access the complaint. H.R. Rep. No. 81-352, at 14 (1949);\n   <em>\n    Murphy Bros.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133193\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/344/#p351\">\n    526 U.S. at 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133193\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/344/#p351\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Recognizing this disparity, the next Congress amended the statute to provide each defendant with \"20 days after he has received (or it has been made available to him) a copy of the initial pleading.\" S. Rep. No. 81-303, at 6 (1949). In all relevant respects, the 1949 version of \u00a7 1446 mirrors today's version: \"The petition for removal of a civil action or proceeding shall be filed within twenty days after the receipt by the defendant, through service or otherwise, of a copy of the initial pleading ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Act of May 24, 1949, Pub.

In both versions of the statute, the key point was to peg the time calculation to receipt by the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Intertwining the removal statute with state-specific idiosyncrasies would thwart Congress' twin aims of adequate time to respond and uniform application of the rule.\n   <em>\n    Murphy Bros.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133193\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/344/#p351\">\n    526 U.S. at 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133193\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/344/#p351\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, if delivery to a statutorily designated agent began the removal clock, the effective time a defendant had to remove would depend not only on differences in state law, but also on the efficiency of state agencies in each instance. The interpretation the Andersons advance would compound disfavored interstate differences by adding case-by-case,\n   <em>\n    intra\n   </em>\n   state discrepancies. That arrangement cannot be reconciled with Congress' unambiguous intent to provide each defendant with a fixed and adequate amount of time, after obtaining access to the complaint, to decide whether to remove.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Elliott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516073\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/883/384/#p394\">\n    883 F.3d at 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Serving a statutory agent does not guarantee that the defendant is provided with actual notice of the complaint or adequate time to decide whether to remove a case.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As the Andersons point out, the Court held in\n   <em>\n    Murphy Brothers\n   </em>\n   that \"a named defendant's time to remove is triggered\n   by simultaneous service of the summons and complaint.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133193\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/344/#p351\">\n    526 U.S. at 347-48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133193\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/344/#p351\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But this holding addressed\n   <em>\n    what\n   </em>\n   must be received, not\n   <em>\n    who\n   </em>\n   must receive it.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133193\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/344/#p351\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court did not consider the implications of serving a statutory agent before actual receipt by the defendant. And although it addressed a different question, the Court announced a principle of fairness that is pertinent here:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   We read Congress' provisions for removal in light of a bedrock principle: An individual or entity named as a defendant is not obliged to engage in litigation unless notified of the action, and brought under a court's authority, by formal process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133193\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/344/#p351\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133193\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/344/#p351\">\n    at 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133193\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/344/#p351\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That \"bedrock principle\" regarding the importance of actual notice confirms that serving the Commissioner did not provide the necessary notice to State Farm of the suit-that occurred only when State Farm's designated recipient received the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We are also unconvinced by the Andersons' invocation of the interpretive canon counseling strict construction of removal statutes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gaus v.

The legislative history and\n   <em>\n    Murphy Brothers\n   </em>\n   provide just such a clear command.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Nor are we persuaded by the Andersons' suggestion that our ruling invites collateral litigation over \"who qualifies\" as a recipient.
