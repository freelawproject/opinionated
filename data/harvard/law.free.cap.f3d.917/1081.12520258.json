Plaintiff Vicente Palacios Crawford is the son of two such landowners. Plaintiff's ancestral land is in the Tiyan region, where many of the taken properties were subsequently transferred by the United States to the government\n   of Guam. Defendant Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport Authority, Guam (\"GIAA\") currently operates the A.B. Won Pat International Airport, which is located on ancestral lands in the Tiyan region, including Plaintiff's. In its several attempts to address this past injustice, the government of Guam established administrative entities and procedures to receive and resolve ancestral landowners' claims for the taking of their lands without adequate compensation. These efforts have a convoluted history of enactment and partial repeal, as well as a lack of funding. As a result, no claims by ancestral landowners whose land is currently being used for public purposes have been considered and resolved through compensation. Plaintiff filed this action against the GIAA Defendants-the GIAA and GIAA chairperson Ricardo C. Duenas\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   -and the Government Defendants-Governor Edward Calvo\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Guam Ancestral Lands Commission (\"GALC\") chairperson Anthony Ada\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   -and asserts that lengthy delays in the compensation process violate his constitutional rights to procedural due process and equal protection. Plaintiff appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants.

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Historical Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The United States government took control of substantial amounts of privately owned land on Guam for military purposes during and immediately after World War II. At the time, many of the landowners received little or no compensation. After World War II ended, Congress transferred land no longer necessary for American military use to the naval government of Guam. Later, the Organic Act of Guam, Pub. L. No. 630,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20Stat.%20384\">\n    64 Stat. 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1950), created the government of Guam, transferred certain land from the naval government of Guam to the new government of Guam, and placed other land under the control of the government of Guam for the benefit of the people of Guam.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In a condemnation proceeding brought by the naval government of Guam in 1950, Plaintiff's mother, Josefina Palacios Crawford (formerly Josefina Palacios Flores), received $ 8,340.00 as compensation for the taking of her property, Lot 5204 in the Tiyan region. On January 25, 1980, Josefina Crawford, individually and as Jesus C. Flores's heir, filed a complaint against the United States, seeking further compensation, pursuant to 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1424c (\"\n   <em>\n    J. Crawford v. United States\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Josefina\n   Crawford, and other similarly situated claimants, agreed to a stipulated judgment with the United States in a consolidated case in 1992. All of the consolidated claims were extinguished by agreement. Thus, in 1993, Josefina Crawford was awarded $ 71,227.22 for the taking of Lot 5204.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 1994, Congress enacted the Guam Excess Lands Act, Pub. L. No. 103-339,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20Stat.%203116\">\n    108 Stat. 3116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994), authorizing the transfer of land in Guam from the United States to the government of Guam, with the requirement that the government of Guam develop a plan to use the land for public benefit. The Guam legislature, the\n   <em>\n    I Liheslaturan Gu\u00e5han\n   </em>\n   , has repeatedly expressed its intent to restore the excess lands to the original owners or their heirs.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Guam%20Pub.%20L.%2023\">\n    Guam Pub. L. 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -141, \u00a7 3 (1997). In 1999, the Guam legislature passed the Guam Ancestral Lands Act (\"GALA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Guam%20Pub.%20L.%2025\">\n    Guam Pub. L. 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -45, \u00a7 1 (1999), which recognized that the powers granted to Guam's agencies by previous legislation had proven inadequate to implement remedies for the ancestral landowners,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Guam%20Pub.%20L.%2025\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2(a). Significantly, the GALA added Chapter 80 to Title 21 of the Guam Code Annotated (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20Guam%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2080101\">\n    21 Guam Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 80101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to 80104 ),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   which\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   affirms and formally recognizes the \"Ancestral Property Right\"; establishes an administrative process for the exercise of that right; and creates the Guam Ancestral Lands Commission [\"the Commission\" or \"GALC\"] and authorizes the Commission to administer the provisions of this Chapter in order that original landowners, their heirs and their descendants may expeditiously exercise all their fundamental civil rights in the property they own. The exercise of \"ancestral property right\" claims shall be applicable to lands already declared excess by the Federal government and shall also be applicable to all future declaration of excess lands either by the United States Government or by the government of Guam.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20Guam%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2080102\">\n    21 Guam Code Ann. \u00a7 80102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). In order to provide a remedy for ancestral landowners, the Guam legislature ordered GALC to establish a \"Land Bank Trust\" to manage and, if necessary, develop the land returned from the United States and to use any income generated by the land to compensate the ancestral landowners.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20Guam%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2080102\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 80104(e) (\"The Commission shall establish rules and regulations pursuant to the Administration Adjudication Law for the Guam-based trust. The resulting income shall be used to provide just compensation for those dispossessed ancestral landowners.\"). However, no payments have been made from the Land Bank Trust to ancestral landowners because of a bureaucratic impasse: the rules and regulations for the Land Bank Trust have not been finalized, and no claims can be paid until the rules and regulations are finalized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2000, the United States transferred to the GIAA, by quitclaim deed, the land in the Tiyan region on which the international airport now sits. This deed requires that the transferred property \"be used for public airport purposes for the use and benefit of the public on reasonable terms and without unjust discrimination.\" It also provides that the airport property cannot be sold or otherwise used without the Federal Aviation Administration's consent and that all revenues generated by the airport can be used only for the airport's capital or operating costs. If the GIAA fails to comply with these restrictions, the United States can retake possession of the transferred land. In short, the quitclaim deed prevents the return of the airport property, or the payment of compensation from\n   revenue generated by the land, to ancestral landowners, including Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Guam legislature has attempted repeatedly to create a compensation process for those ancestral landowners whose land is used for the airport.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Guam%20Pub.%20L.%2024\">\n    Guam Pub.

L. 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -100, \u00a7 4 (2002). The Task Force was charged with identifying lands \"excess to the needs of GIAA,\" as well as non-Tiyan properties that could be conveyed as compensation to ancestral landowners whose Tiyan lands could not be returned.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Guam%20Pub.%20L.%2026\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The current version of \u00a7 4 requires the Task Force to identify the ancestral landowners who had properties taken for use by the airport and to identify land owned by the government of Guam that can be used to compensate those ancestral landowners by way of a land exchange.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Guam%20Pub.%20L.%2030\">\n    Guam Pub. L. 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -6, \u00a7 1 (2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Task Force ultimately proposed a land exchange of two parcels of property in the Land Bank Trust for the release of claims by ancestral landowners whose land had been taken and used for the airport.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Guam%20Pub.%20L.%2030\">\n    Guam Pub.

A (P/L 30-6 Tiyan Task Force Report). Because the proposed land exchange excluded the ancestral landowners whose lands were not used for the airport, these excluded ancestral landowners filed a class action in the Guam Superior Court to enjoin the land exchange,\n   <em>\n    Gange, et al. v. Gov't of Guam, et al.\n   </em>\n   , Civil Case No. 1461-10. The superior court in 2013 found that the proposed land exchange would constitute a taking of property without compensation and granted a permanent injunction. In response, Governor Calvo announced in 2014 that GALC would disburse $ 3.2 million to the ancestral landowners throughout Guam. None of these funds have yet been paid to any ancestral landowners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiff's Ancestral Property Right Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Government Defendants concede that Plaintiff has rights under the GALA as an ancestral landowner because of his mother's ownership of Lot 5204, and that he is not likely to regain possession or title because his land is still being used for the airport.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On August 16, 2002, Plaintiff submitted to GALC an Ancestral Title and Compensation Application regarding Lot 5204. More than 130 ancestral landowners filed claims regarding lands being used by the GIAA for the airport (\"Airport Ancestral Lands Claims\"). GALC has not held any hearings regarding the Airport Ancestral Lands Claims, and the government of Guam has not compensated any of these ancestral landowners. Thus, Plaintiff's ancestral land claim remains unresolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    C. District Court Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff filed his Class Action Complaint on January 16, 2015. Relevant to the instant appeal, the Complaint alleged the following claims: a\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   claim against the Government Defendants and Duenas alleging a denial of procedural due process (\"Count I\"); and a \u00a7 1983 claim against the Government Defendants and Duenas alleging a denial of equal protection (\"Count II\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On September 1, 2016, Plaintiff and the GIAA Defendants filed motions for summary judgment. The Government Defendants filed a counter-motion for summary judgment. The Court denied Plaintiff's motion, granted the GIAA Defendants' motion, and granted in part the Government Defendants' motion. Judgment as a matter of law was granted to the Government Defendants and Duenas as to Count I, and summary judgment was granted to the Government Defendants as to Count II.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The district court's grant of summary of judgment may be affirmed on any ground that is supported by the record, even if the district court did not rely on that ground.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518594\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/903/829/#p845\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Whether the GIAA Defendants Are Proper Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The only claims at issue in this appeal are Counts I and II. Because the GIAA was not named in either count, it is not a proper party to this appeal and therefore must be dismissed. Additionally, Duenas is no longer named in Count II. Thus, Count I is the only claim against Duenas before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The crux of Count II is that the procedures established in \u00a7 80104 to process ancestral property right claims are inadequate and thus deprive Plaintiff of his Fourteenth Amendment right to procedural due process. The district court granted summary judgment on Count II in favor of Duenas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   At summary judgment, Plaintiff conceded that: (1) no GIAA official has ever served as a GALC commissioner; (2) neither the GIAA nor any GIAA official participates in promulgating or administrating GALC's procedures; (3) the GIAA was not served with Plaintiff's application asserting his ancestral property right claim; (4) the GIAA did not participate in GALC's review of Plaintiff's application; and (5) the GIAA did not oppose Plaintiff's application. Although Plaintiff's admissions refer only to the GIAA, no evidence in the record exists to suggest that Duenas (or his predecessor Untalan) either deprived Plaintiff of a constitutionally protected property interest or denied Plaintiff adequate procedural protections.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roybal v. ToppenishSch.

The district court's grant of summary judgment in\n   favor of Duenas is therefore affirmed, although on different grounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Glazing Health &amp; Welfare\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518594\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/903/829/#p845\">\n    903 F.3d at 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, we need only address the merits of Plaintiff's claims against the Government Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Whether Plaintiff's Ancestral Property Right is a Constitutionally Protected Property Right\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff challenges the district court's ruling that the Government Defendants were entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's procedural due process claim because Plaintiff had not established, and could not establish, a constitutionally protected property right. Due to the conditions placed on the transfer of land to the GIAA, Plaintiff's property cannot be returned. Additionally, Plaintiff's claim against the United States was settled when his mother received compensation in 1993. Therefore, the only property right at issue is Plaintiff's right to payment from Guam under Chapter 80 for his ancestral claim to Lot 5204.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Constitutionally protected property interests are not limited to tangible property.\n   <em>\n    Nozzi v.

Thus, no rules or regulations exist to implement and govern the\n   Land Bank Trust. This lack of implementing regulations supports the district court's conclusion that Plaintiff's ancestral property right is not a constitutionally protected interest for purposes of the Due Process Clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nozzi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4359150\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/806/1178/#p1191\">\n    806 F.3d at 1191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that both the statutes and their implementing regulations must be considered in determining whether the right is sufficiently defined to warrant constitutional protection).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Section 80104 and Other Chapter 80 Provisions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiff contends that, even in the absence of implementing regulations, \u00a7 80104 and the relevant Guam Public Laws contain sufficiently mandatory terms to create a reasonable expectation of entitlement to payment. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Neither the text of \u00a7 80104 nor the text of Chapter 80 in general creates an entitlement couched in mandatory terms. First, inconsistency in the provisions regarding \"just compensation\" precludes the recognition of an entitlement. The definition of \"just compensation\" in \u00a7 80104(b)(1) -which applies to all of Chapter 80-refers to, but is inconsistent with, the \u00a7 80101 definition. Under \u00a7 80104(b)(1), just compensation is \"defined as limited to the return of land or access to landlocked lots across public lands.\" By contrast, \u00a7 80101(k) defines just compensation as \"only land recovery or land exchange, and ... any other form of compensation other than a specifically described available land.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Further confusion regarding \"just compensation\" arises from \u00a7 80104(c), which sets forth the \"Four (4) Step Process for Extinguishment of Claims, Award of Just Compensation, and Recordation of Ancestral Land Title\" that GALC is required to include within its procedures, rules, and regulations. It provides: \"This Chapter sets forth two (2) forms of compensation for future title claims which shall be either the return of original ancestral land, or just compensation, as defined in \u00a7 80101 of this Act, based upon mutually satisfactory negotiations between the government and the applicant.\" \u00a7 80104(c), Step 2, Category 2. Section 80104(c) thus suggests that \"the return of original ancestral land\" is not considered \"just compensation,\" which is inconsistent with both \u00a7 80101(k) and \u00a7 80104(b)(1). Category 2 also appears to require that a just compensation award result from \"mutually satisfactory negotiations,\" a term entirely absent from both \u00a7 80101(k) and \u00a7 80104(b)(1). Simply put, Chapter 80 is internally inconsistent as to what just compensation entails; these inconsistencies weigh against a ruling that Plaintiff is entitled to the protection afforded by the Due Process Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Second, although \u00a7 80104 contains mandatory text\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   indicating the Guam legislature's intent to extinguish ancestral property right claims and provide payment of just compensation awards, there is no mandatory wording that compels GALC to pay just compensation for ancestral property right claims. At the first step of the process, GALC must accept an ancestral claim application, enter it into the Claims Registry, and \"make a determination if in fact a valid basis for an ancestral title claim exists.\" \u00a7 80104(c), Step 1. This requirement that GALC make a validity determination does not create a constitutionally protected property right, because the\n   statute does not sufficiently define what constitutes a \"valid basis.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Ching\n   </em>\n   , we held that a citizen petitioner's right to immediate relative status for his or her alien spouse is entitled to due process protections, reasoning that \"[t]he decision of whether to approve [the] petition is a nondiscretionary one because determinations that require application of law to factual determinations are nondiscretionary.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070421\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/1149/#p1155\">\n    725 F.3d at 1155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).

In fact, \u00a7 80104(c), Step 1 states that unspecified \"other details about the claim\" may exist, which GALC \"may deem appropriate\" to consider in determining whether the claim is valid. Thus, \u00a7 80104(c), Step 1-unlike\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201154\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) -fails to provide a statutory scheme identifying certain facts that would\n   <em>\n    compel\n   </em>\n   GALC to find that the ancestral claim is valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Additionally, none of the other steps in the \u00a7 80104(c) process require GALC to award just compensation if certain specified requirements are met. Section 80104(c) does not include a mandatory award of just compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Third, Plaintiff also argues that \u00a7 80104(e) creates a reasonable expectation of payment. Section 80104(e) requires the establishment of the Land Bank Trust, the establishment of rules and regulations for the trust, and the use of the trust's income \"to provide just compensation for those dispossessed ancestral landowners.\" There is mandatory text regarding the use of Land Bank Trust income, but we must consider this passage in \"its context within the surrounding statutory framework.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ward v.

In\n   <em>\n    Ward\n   </em>\n   , we noted that incarcerated inmates do not have many traditional property rights or a common law property interest in their wages. However, under Arizona state law, an inmate has a statutorily limited protected property interest in his wages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 810-11.

The Chapter 80 statutory scheme requires payment of just compensation to dispossessed ancestral landowners as provided by rules and regulations adopted according to Guam's Administrative Adjudication Law. But, as noted, none exist. Although GALC proposed such rules and attempted enactment pursuant to the Administrative Adjudication Law, the proposed rules were rejected and no Land Bank Trust rules are currently in effect. In short, Chapter 80 provides Plaintiff with the right to file a claim for compensation, but no framework exists to pay his claim and, because of the definitional inconsistencies within Chapter 80, no coherent basis exists to determine the amount of compensation, if any, that is owed to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   When read in the context of \u00a7 80104 and Chapter 80 as a whole, the provision stating that the income from the Land Bank Trust \"shall be used to provide just compensation for those dispossessed ancestral landowners\" is not sufficiently definite to provide Plaintiff with a reasonable expectation of entitlement to compensation. Nor is any other provision in \u00a7 80104 or elsewhere in Chapter 80 sufficiently definite to create such an entitlement. Although Plaintiff has a recognized ancestral property right under \u00a7 80102, neither \u00a7 80102 nor any of the other statutes in Chapter 80 supports Plaintiff's position that he has a legitimate claim of entitlement to just compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   We therefore hold that the Chapter 80 provisions, whether examined individually or read together, do not give rise to a protected property interest under the Due Process Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Public Laws\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiff argues that various statements in the Public Laws enacted by the Guam legislature in its attempt to address the rights of ancestral landowners create an entitlement to compensation for his ancestral lands. Again, we are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   First, Plaintiff relies on Public Law 22-145, which refers to the ancestral landowners as the \"rightful original landowners.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Guam%20Pub.%20L.%2022\">\n    Guam Pub. L. 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -145, \u00a7 1 (1994). This phrase is a statement of intent and purpose for the ongoing land return program; it does not grant specific rights that became enforceable when Public Law 22-145 was enacted.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Guam%20Pub.%20L.%2022\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2 (requiring the Guam Department of Land Management to identify land \"in preparation for their\n   <em>\n    eventual\n   </em>\n   return to their original landowners or the heirs, administrators, executors or other legal representatives of the landowners' original estates\" (emphasis added)),\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Guam%20Pub.%20L.%2022\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3 (\"It is the intent of this Act to insure that the lands condemned by the federal government and deemed excess to the federal government's needs, pursuant to U.S. Public Law 103-339, are rightfully returned to their original owners or their heirs.\"). While Public Law 22-145 does mandate the transfer of certain specific parcels \"to the original rightful landowners and their heirs,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Guam%20Pub.%20L.%2022\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2, no evidence in the record includes Plaintiff's ancestral land in these parcels. Thus, nothing in Public Law 22-145 supports Plaintiff's position that he has a legitimate claim or property right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Second, Plaintiff points to the statement in Public Law 23-23 that, as to \"[l]ands clearly under existing public use[,] ... the government of Guam shall make good faith efforts to derive a means of compensation for continued public use of such lands.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Guam Pub.

This is a statement of general policy and intent; it does not define specific benefits and does not support Plaintiff's position that he has a legitimate claim entitling him to compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Third, Plaintiff contends that his entitlement is conferred by the statement in the GALA that \"[s]everal local enactments provide a basis for former, 'original' landowners to assert a claim for land recovery or for compensation where land recovery is not possible.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Guam%20Pub.%20L.%2025\">\n    Guam Pub.

This is only a historical statement included in the background supporting the enactment of Chapter 80. It does not grant any specific benefits or rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Fourth, Plaintiff refers to the statement in Public Law 26-100 that the Task Force \"shall ... find alternative means of compensation for the original owners of properties strictly needed for airport-related operations, either through leases with original landowners, outright purchases, or value-for-value land exchanges.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Guam%20Pub.%20L.%2026\">\n    Guam Pub. L. 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -100, \u00a7 4 (2002). However, this version of \u00a7 4 cannot confer a legitimate claim to an entitlement because it was repealed, and the reenacted version does not contain this wording.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Guam%20Pub.%20L.%2030\">\n    Guam Pub. L. 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -06, \u00a7 1 (2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Fifth, Plaintiff contends he has a claim conferred by Public Law 30-06, which directs that the Task Force \"shall identify the original owners of properties transferred to the [GIAA] by the United States Government and shall identify property of the government of Guam to be transferred to these original landowners to compensate them on a value for value and/or size for size exchange for their property.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Guam%20Pub.%20L.%2030\">\n    Guam Pub.

As previously noted, the Task Force did propose an exchange, and Public Law 30-158 was enacted to effectuate the transfer, but the Guam Superior Court ruled that the transfer would constitute an illegal taking and enjoined it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   We therefore hold that none of the Guam Public Laws raised by Plaintiff, individually, read together, or read together with Chapter 80, give rise to a protected property interest for purposes of a due process analysis. While the Guam legislature has clearly established a process to receive, evaluate, and compensate ancestral property right claims, the legislature did not design the process to be sufficiently definite to transform Plaintiff's expectation into a property right entitled to due process protection.

However, the statutory scheme for determining compensation for the In-Use Class is more complicated than that for restoring title to the Land Return Class. Additional issues exist for the In-Use Class, including,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   : whether there is other land that may be used to compensate the claimants; whether the claimants are to receive monetary compensation and, if so, the amount of compensation; and how the funds for monetary compensation should be administered. Because of these additional issues, some components in the Chapter 80 statutory scheme do not apply to the Land Return Class (such as the provisions regarding the Land Bank Trust). The government of Guam has attempted to address these issues, albeit unsuccessfully, such as by proposing the land transfer in Public Law 30-158 and by drafting proposed rules and regulations governing the Land Bank Trust. These unsuccessful attempts to address the additional issues in compensating the In-Use Class have resulted in different treatment of the Land Return Class and of the In-Use Class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   However,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   the Equal Protection Clause is satisfied so long as there is a plausible policy reason for the classification, see\n   <em>\n    United States Railroad Retirement Bd. v.

The Guam legislature's Chapter 80 statutory scheme focuses on the additional issues presented by the claims of the In-Use Class and relates rationally to legislative facts considered at the time to be true, such as that the proposed land transfer was feasible, or that GALC would successfully promulgate rules and regulations.
