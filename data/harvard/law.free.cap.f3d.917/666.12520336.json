Dubuque was an at-will employee at The Boeing Company with Special Action Program (SAP) clearances and access for his classified work. After the Air Force's Office of Special Investigations temporarily suspended his SAP access, Boeing tried to inform Dubuque that his SAP access was terminated in a SAP facility. This process is called \"debriefing.\" Dubuque refused requests to debrief. Boeing terminated him. Dubuque sued Boeing, claiming wrongful discharge in violation of public policy. The district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   denied Boeing's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, but granted dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6).\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Dubuque v. Boeing Co.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=325%20F.R.D.%20296\">\n    325 F.R.D. 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Mo. 2018). Dubuque appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Boeing contends that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Dubuque's claim because it is a nonjusticiable political question. Courts lack jurisdiction to review the merits of an executive's decision to grant or deny a security clearance because it is a \"sensitive and inherently discretionary judgment call ... committed by law to the appropriate agency of the Executive Branch.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Dep't of Navy v.

Noting that Dubuque's claim does not challenge the merits of the security-clearance decision, the district court correctly concluded it had subject matter jurisdiction over Dubuque's wrongful termination claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    8th Cir. R. 47B\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The district court also properly dismissed Dubuque's wrongful discharge claim.
