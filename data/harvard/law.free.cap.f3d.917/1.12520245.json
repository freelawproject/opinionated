It touches upon a plethora of important issues. Some of these issues relate to the appropriateness of a police officer's use of a Taser in attempting to regain custody of a mentally ill person who, after being involuntarily committed, absconded from a hospital. Others relate to the applicability vel non of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2012131\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -65, to ad hoc police encounters. In the end, we decide the case on the narrowest available grounds and affirm the entry of summary judgment for the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This case has its genesis in an on-the-street encounter between plaintiff-appellant Judith Gray (who suffers from bipolar disorder ) and Thomas Cummings, a police officer in Athol, Massachusetts (the Town). Because the case was decided below at the summary judgment stage, we must take the facts in the light most hospitable to the non-moving party (here, Gray), consistent with record support.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Houlton Citizens' Coal.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Town of Houlton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1720035\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/175/178/#p184\">\n    175 F.3d 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 184 (1st Cir. 1999). We caution, though, that we are not obliged to credit \"conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, acrimonious invective, or rank speculation.\"\n   <em>\n    Ahern\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Shinseki\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4078339\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/49/#p54\">\n    629 F.3d 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 54 (1st Cir. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Here, the raw facts are largely undisputed. In her deposition, Gray testified that she \"really [didn't] know what happened\" during the incident because she \"was in a full-blown manic phase.\" She added that she \"wouldn't know Officer Cummings if [she] fell over him\" and that she had reviewed the police report prepared by Cummings and did not know whether or not it accurately described the events that had transpired. Nor did she present any other evidence contradicting Cummings's version of the relevant events. Although we recognize that juries have some leeway to \"reject uncontradicted, unimpeached testimony when it is improbable, inherently contradictory, riddled with\n   omissions, or delivered in a manner giving rise to doubts,\"\n   <em>\n    Quintana-Ruiz\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hyundai Motor Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11431018\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/303/62/#p76\">\n    303 F.3d 62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 76 (1st Cir. 2002), that principle has no application here. Accordingly, we elicit many of the facts from Cummings's account.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harriman\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hancock County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052094\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/627/22/#p34\">\n    627 F.3d 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 34 (1st Cir. 2010) (finding no material factual dispute when plaintiff \"had no memory of being beaten by anyone at anytime relevant to this case\");\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wertish\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Krueger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"881050\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/433/1062/#p1065\">\n    433 F.3d 1062\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1065 (8th Cir. 2006) (deeming police officer's version of events \"unrefuted\" when plaintiff testified that he had very little memory of relevant events). Even so, we draw all reasonable inferences from those facts in Gray's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On May 2, 2013, Gray - who was then fifty-seven years old - experienced a manic episode and called 911. Athol police officers arrived at Gray's home and transported her to Athol Memorial Hospital. She was admitted to the hospital at around 4:00 a.m., pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mass.%20Gen.%20Laws%20ch.%20123%2C%20%C2%A7%2012\">\n    Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123, \u00a7 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (authorizing involuntary \"[e]mergency restraint and hospitalization of persons posing risk of serious harm by reason of mental illness\"). Approximately six hours later, Gray absconded from the hospital on foot. Hospital staff called the Athol Police Department, asking that Gray - \"a section 12 patient\" - be \"picked up and brought back.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Cummings responded to the call and quickly located Gray, walking barefoot along the sidewalk less than a quarter-mile from the hospital. Cummings got out of his police cruiser. Gray swore at him, and Cummings told her that she \"ha[d] to go back to the hospital.\" Gray again used profanity, declared that she was not going back, and continued to walk away. In response, Cummings radioed for backup and followed Gray on foot. He repeatedly implored Gray to return to the hospital, but his importunings were greeted only by more profanity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Initially, Cummings followed Gray at a distance of roughly one hundred feet. Within twenty-five to thirty seconds, he closed to within five feet. At that point, Gray stopped, turned around, \"clenched her fists, clenched her teeth, flexed her body and stared at [Cummings] as if she was looking right through [him].\" She again swore at Cummings and started walking toward him. Cummings grabbed Gray's shirt but he could feel Gray moving her body forward, so he \"took her to the ground.\" It is undisputed that Cummings had a distinct height and weight advantage: he was six feet, three inches tall and weighed 215 pounds, whereas Gray was five feet, ten inches tall and weighed 140 pounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Cummings testified that once on the ground, he repeatedly instructed Gray to place her hands behind her back. She did not comply. Instead, she \"tucked her arms underneath her chest and flex[ed] tightly,\" swearing all the while. Cummings warned Gray that she was \"going to get ta[s]ed\" if she did not place her hands behind her back.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Gray did not heed this warning but, rather, swore at Cummings again and told him to \"do it.\" Cummings made \"one last final demand [for Gray] to stop resisting\" and when \"Gray refused to listen,\" he removed the cartridge from his Taser, placed\n   it in drive-stun mode,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and tased Gray's back for four to six seconds. Gray then allowed him to handcuff her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Cummings helped Gray to her feet and called an ambulance, which transported Gray to the hospital. According to Gray, she felt \"pain all over\" at the moment she was tased, but she \"must have passed out because [she] woke up in Emergency.\" Charges were subsequently filed against Gray for assault on a police officer, resisting arrest, disturbing the peace, and disorderly conduct, but were eventually dropped.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In due season, Gray sued Cummings and the Town in the federal district court. She invoked federal question jurisdiction,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and asserted causes of action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and Title II of the ADA, along with supplemental state-law claims for assault and battery, malicious prosecution, and violations of the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act (MCRA), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, \u00a7\u00a7 11H - 11I. After the completion of pretrial discovery, the defendants moved for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). The district court referred the opposed motion to a magistrate judge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B) ; Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b). Following a hearing, the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation, suggesting that the motion be granted. Specifically, the magistrate judge found no violation of the Fourth Amendment under section 1983 on the part of either Cummings or the Town and no viable state-law claims. As to Cummings, the magistrate judge added that, in any event, he was entitled to qualified immunity. The magistrate judge further concluded that there had been no abridgement of the ADA because, regardless of Gray's disability, Cummings was entitled to employ an \"appropriate level of force in response to an ongoing threat.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Gray objected to the magistrate judge's report and recommendation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(C) ; Fed.

Because the court agreed that Cummings was entitled to qualified immunity, it declined to express any opinion on the magistrate judge's determination that \"Cummings employed reasonable force under all of the circumstances.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   This timely appeal followed.

The degree of force to be used in any given situation is most often a judgment call, which sometimes must be made in a split second by a police officer confronted with rapidly evolving circumstances. Determining whether a particular use of force is reasonable requires consideration of the totality of the circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p396\">\n    490 U.S. at 396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p396\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This consideration entails the weighing of a myriad of factors such as \"the severity of the crime at issue, whether the suspect pose[d] an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, and whether [the suspect was] actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p396\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Our starting point is the question of whether a reasonable jury could find that Cummings violated Gray's Fourth Amendment rights through the use of excessive force. The magistrate judge answered this question in the negative, concluding that, as a matter of law, \"the single deployment of a taser in drive stun mode\" in these particular circumstances was reasonable. Viewing the record most hospitably to Gray and drawing all reasonable inferences to her behoof, we think that a reasonable jury could find that the force employed by Cummings violated the Fourth Amendment. We explain briefly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Town's policies describe a Taser in drive-stun mode as a \"pain compliance tool.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the question reduces to whether the circumstances surrounding the confrontation between Gray and Cummings, interpreted in the light most favorable to Gray, justified Cummings's use of such a tool.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The magistrate judge analyzed this question in accordance with the\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   factors. In his view, the first factor - \"the severity of the crime at issue,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   - favored Cummings because \"Ms. Gray assaulted [him].\" At summary judgment, though, this assessment is insupportable: it fails to view the facts in the light most favorable to Gray.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In this regard, we think it important that Cummings was not called to the scene to investigate a crime; he was there to return a person suffering from mental illness to the hospital. When the subject of a seizure has not committed any crime, the first\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   factor ordinarily cuts in the subject's favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estate of Armstrong ex rel. Armstrong\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Village of Pinehurst\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4060327\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/810/892/#p899\">\n    810 F.3d 892\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 899 (4th Cir. 2016). To be sure, Gray did not submit to Cummings's orders. Withal, this failure to obey was at most a minor crime, not one that would tip the first\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   factor in Cummings's favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4060327\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/810/892/#p899\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4060327\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/810/892/#p899\">\n    at 899-900\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Nor does the alleged assault tilt the scales. In Cummings's view, the assault occurred when, after Gray walked toward him, he grabbed her shirt and she \"continued pushing against [his] arm.\" In the circumstances of this case, we think that a reasonable jury could find that the facts did not support the characterization of Gray's actions as an \"assault.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The same kind of defect mars the magistrate judge's determination that the second\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   factor - \"whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p396\">\n    490 U.S. at 396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p396\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - favored Cummings. It is true that Gray was a section 12 patient, that is, an individual who has been involuntarily committed to a hospital pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mass.%20Gen.%20Laws%20ch.%20123%2C%20%C2%A7%2012\">\n    Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123, \u00a7 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , based on a determination by a qualified medical professional (or, in emergency situations, a police officer) that \"failure to hospitalize [her] would create a likelihood of serious harm by reason of mental illness.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mass.%20Gen.%20Laws%20ch.%20123%2C%20%C2%A7%2012\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 12(a). It is also true that Cummings knew as much. Although a jury could supportably find on these facts that Cummings reasonably believed that Gray posed a danger to him, it could supportably find instead that Gray - who was shuffling down the sidewalk barefoot and unarmed - only posed a danger to herself (especially given Cummings's distinct height and weight advantage). So, too, a jury could supportably find that, at the time of the tasing, Gray had been subdued to a point at which she no longer posed a threat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The magistrate judge concluded that the final\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   factor - whether Gray was \"actively resisting arrest,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p396\">\n    490 U.S. at 396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605535\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/386/#p396\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - favored Cummings. This conclusion seems unimpugnable given Cummings's testimony that he asked Gray several times to put her hands behind her back, but that she would not do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The short of it is that the\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   factors point in conflicting directions. Seen through the prism of the totality of the circumstances, the evidence is subject to interpretation and can support plausible though inconsistent inferences. Drawing those inferences beneficially to Gray and aware that Cummings not only had her down on the ground but also outweighed her by some seventy-five pounds, a reasonable jury could find that Gray had committed no crime and that she posed no threat to Cummings when he tased her. When all is said and done, we think that Gray has presented sufficient evidence to make out a jury question as to whether Cummings used excessive force.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Morelli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4011881\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/552/12/#p23\">\n    552 F.3d at 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding triable excessive force claim when officer slammed plaintiff, who \"at worst, was suspected of being a petty thief,\" against wall);\n   <em>\n    Alexis\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McDonald's Rests. of Mass., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414526\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/67/341/#p353\">\n    67 F.3d 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 353 (1st Cir. 1995) (concluding that jury could find excessive force when officer seized and dragged plaintiff to effectuate arrest for crime of trespassing in public restaurant);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estate of Armstrong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4060327\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/810/892/#p899\">\n    810 F.3d at 906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding excessive force when officer tased \"mentally ill man being seized for his own protection, [who] was seated on the ground, was hugging a post to ensure his immobility, ... and had failed to submit to a lawful seizure for only 30 seconds\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   This conclusion does not end our inquiry.

Cummings repeatedly told Gray that she needed to return to the hospital, and she adamantly refused to obey. What is more, he warned her that he would use his Taser if she remained intransigent,\n   yet she defied the warning. Thus - unlike the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Ciolino\n   </em>\n   - Gray was afforded an adequate opportunity to submit to Cummings's authority before she was tased.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Gray cites a number of other cases in support of her argument that her resistance was \"passive\" rather than \"active\" and, thus, did not justify the use of the Taser. This argument is deeply flawed. Labels such as \"passive\" and \"active\" are generalizations and cannot serve as substitutes for a careful analysis of the facts of a particular case. In point of fact, the Supreme Court - in an excessive force case - recently cautioned against \"defin[ing] the clearly established right at a high level of generality.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Escondido\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12623261\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/139/500/#p504\">\n    139 S.Ct. at 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In the absence of either controlling authority or a consensus of persuasive authority to the contrary, we conclude that Cummings was entitled to qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As a fallback, Gray argues that the doctrine of qualified immunity, as expounded by the Supreme Court, should be modified or overruled. Gray did not raise this argument in the district court and, thus, cannot advance it here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Teamsters Union, Local No. 59\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Superline Transp.

She alleges that her Fourth Amendment rights were violated by the Town's deficient training of its police officers (including Cummings) with\n   respect to proper protocols for interacting with persons suffering from mental illness. Gray's evidence, though, falls well short of making out a failure-to-train claim against the Town.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   We cut directly to the chase. \"Triggering municipal liability on a claim of failure to train requires a showing that municipal decisionmakers either knew or should have known that training was inadequate but nonetheless exhibited deliberate indifference to the unconstitutional effects of those inadequacies.\"\n   <em>\n    Haley\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    City of Boston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3834918\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/657/39/#p52\">\n    657 F.3d 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 52 (1st Cir. 2011).

Here, however, Gray has made no such showing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In an effort to close this gap, Gray offers expert testimony about appropriate police practices for interacting with persons with disabilities. Building on this foundation, she insists that \"coupled with the facts of the encounter,\" such evidence \"create[s] questions of material fact as to whether the Town failed to properly train Cummings.\" In our view, these assertions are insufficient to support a failure-to-train claim. It is not enough to show that the Town's training regimen was faulty; Gray must also show that the Town knew or had reason to believe that such a regimen had unconstitutional effects. Gray has tendered no evidence of past violations sufficient to put the Town on notice of such effects. Given this yawning gap in her proof, Gray has not made out a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Town was deliberately indifferent to the risk of the alleged constitutional violation.

The first such theory (which we shall call the \"effects\" theory) holds that a violation may be found when \"police wrongly arrested someone with a disability because they misperceived the effects of that disability as criminal activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Gohier\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Enright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"857688\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/186/1216/#p1220\">\n    186 F.3d 1216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1220 (10th Cir. 1999). The second such theory (which we shall call the \"accommodation\" theory) holds that a violation may be found when police officers \"properly investigated and arrested a person with a disability for a crime unrelated to that disability, [but] they failed to reasonably accommodate the person's disability in the course of investigation or arrest, causing the person to suffer greater injury or indignity in that process than other arrestees.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"857688\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/186/1216/#p1220\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"857688\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/186/1216/#p1220\">\n    at 1220-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Before us, Gray advances arguments under both theories.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   With respect to the \"effects\" theory, Gray argues that the criminal charges filed against her are an\n   indication that Cummings misperceived her failure to follow his commands as a crime rather than a symptom of her disability. With respect to the \"accommodation\" theory, Gray argues that Cummings should have accommodated her disability by \"employ[ing] ... time, patience, nonthreatening communication, monitoring from a distance, and contacting and waiting for assistance such as an ambulance or a mental health care professional.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In mounting our inquiry, we start with the uncontroversial premise that the services, programs, and activities of a municipal police department are generally subject to the provisions of Title II of the ADA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Haberle\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Troxell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516299\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/170/#p179\">\n    885 F.3d 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 179-80 (3d Cir. 2018) ;\n   <em>\n    Gorman\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bartch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11711397\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/152/907/#p912\">\n    152 F.3d 907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 912 (8th Cir. 1998).

Since a plaintiff must show \"intentional discrimination\" on the part of the public entity to be eligible for damages on a Title II claim,\n   <em>\n    Nieves-M\u00e1rquez\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Puerto Rico\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9293712\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/353/108/#p126\">\n    353 F.3d 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 126 (1st Cir. 2003), some uncertainty exists as to whether \"deliberate indifference\" is the functional equivalent of \"intentional discrimination.\" Several of our sister circuits have held that a showing of deliberate indifference may suffice to prove this element.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Haberle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516299\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/170/#p179\">\n    885 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   181 ;\n   <em>\n    Duvall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9499275\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/260/1124/#p1141\">\n    260 F.3d at 1138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the question is open in this circuit, and we have stated that, \"under Title II, non-economic damages are only available when there is evidence 'of economic harm or animus toward the disabled.' \"\n   <em>\n    Carmona-Rivera\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Puerto Rico\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3729570\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/464/14/#p17\">\n    464 F.3d 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 17 (1st Cir. 2006) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Nieves-M\u00e1rquez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9293712\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/353/108/#p126\">\n    353 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   126-27 ). This case does not require us to parse whether our use of the word \"animus\" demands more than a showing of deliberate indifference,\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    S.H. ex. rel.

For present purposes, it is sufficient for us to assume, favorably to Gray, that deliberate indifference is the appropriate standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Adjudicating Grays's ADA claim against the Town does not require us to run the gauntlet of these questions. After all, we have admonished before - and today reaffirm\n   - that \"courts should not rush to decide unsettled legal issues that can easily be avoided.\"\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3726533\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/736/40/#p40\">\n    736 F.3d 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 40 (1st Cir. 2013). Consistent with this prudential principle, we decline to answer any of the three questions identified above. No matter how the loaf is sliced, Gray was obliged at a bare minimum to make out a genuine issue of material fact as to Cummings's deliberate indifference to the risk of an ADA violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In this context, such a showing requires proof that the defendant knew that an ADA-protected right was likely to be abridged, yet neglected to take available preventative action notwithstanding such knowledge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Haberle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516299\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/170/#p179\">\n    885 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   181 ;\n   <em>\n    Duvall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9499275\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/260/1124/#p1141\">\n    260 F.3d at 1139-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, to hold the Town vicariously liable under Title II based on Cummings's deliberate indifference, Gray would have to show that Cummings knew that Gray had a disability that required him to act differently than he would otherwise have acted, yet failed to adjust his behavior accordingly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Crane\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lifemark Hosps., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517920\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/898/1130/#p1136\">\n    898 F.3d 1130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1136 (11th Cir. 2018) ;\n   <em>\n    Duvall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9499275\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/260/1124/#p1141\">\n    260 F.3d at 1140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, to prevail on her version of the \"effects\" theory, Gray would at least have to show that Cummings knew that her failure to follow his orders was a symptom of her mental illness rather than deliberate disobedience (warranting criminal charges). Similarly, to prevail on her version of the \"accommodation\" theory, Gray would at least have to show that Cummings knew that there was a reasonable accommodation, which he was required to provide. Gray has not made either such showing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   To be sure, it is undisputed that Cummings knew that Gray was a section 12 patient and, thus, had a disability (specifically, that she suffered from an unspecified mental illness).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mass.%20Gen.%20Laws%20ch.%20123%2C%20%C2%A7%2012\">\n    Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123, \u00a7 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But Gray has not shown that Cummings had any particularized knowledge about the nature or degree of Gray's disability. As we have explained,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Part II.A, the fact that Gray was a section 12 patient served only to put Cummings on notice that she had been deemed a danger to herself or to others. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that Cummings knew either that Gray suffered from bipolar disorder or that she was experiencing a manic episode. Without such particularized knowledge, Cummings had no way of gauging whether the conduct that appeared unlawful to him was likely to be a manifestation of the symptoms of Gray's mental illness. So, too, without such particularized knowledge, Cummings had no way of gauging what specific accommodation, if any, might have been reasonable under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Of course, Gray has adduced evidence that national police standards provide protocols for dealing with individuals suffering from any type of mental illness. Critically, though, Gray has not adduced any evidence showing that Cummings knew of the existence of such standards.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consequently, Cummings had no way of knowing that an ADA-protected right was likely to be jeopardized by his actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Nor were Cummings's actions so plainly antithetic to the ADA as to obviate the knowledge requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Haberle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516299\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/170/#p179\">\n    885 F.3d at 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The record makes manifest that Cummings tried to talk to Gray before physically engaging with her, telling her repeatedly that she needed to return to the hospital. He followed her from a distance and did not make physical contact with her until she reversed direction and moved toward him. And in the ensuing encounter, he warned her that she would be tased if she did not put her hands behind her back and gave her several chances to comply before using the Taser (in the least intrusive mode available).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Gray has also offered evidence that in failing to wait for backup or to call an ambulance prior to approaching her, Cummings fell short of nationally recognized police standards. But as we have said, she has not shown that Cummings knew of such standards; and in all events, \"falling below national standards does not, in and of itself, make the risk of an ADA violation\" so obvious as to eliminate the knowledge requirement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516299\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/170/#p179\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   By the same token, Gray has not offered evidence sufficient to sustain a claim of direct liability against the Town. To make out such a claim, Gray could show that the Town's \"existing policies caused a failure to 'adequately respond to a pattern of past occurrences of injuries like [hers].' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516299\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/170/#p179\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516299\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/170/#p179\">\n    at 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Beers-Capitol\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Whetzel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11085326\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/256/120/#p136\">\n    256 F.3d 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 136 (3d Cir. 2001) ).

Gray has not made either showing: she has proffered no evidence of a pattern, nor has she shown an obvious risk of harm. At most, she has put forth evidence that the Town's policies failed to comply with national standards. But such a failure - without more - does not render the risk of harm so great and obvious as to excuse a failure to satisfy the pattern requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11085326\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/256/120/#p136\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11085326\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/256/120/#p136\">\n    at 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   To this point, we have explained why Gray's claim for money damages is impuissant.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   We need go no further. We add only that this is a hard case - a case that is made all the more difficult because of two competing concerns: our concern for the rights of the disabled and our concern that the police not be unduly hampered in the performance of their important duties. In the end, though, we think that the protections provided by Title II of the ADA can be harmonized with the doctrines of excessive force and qualified immunity, as explicated by the Supreme Court, to achieve a result that gives each of these competing concerns their due. We think that our ruling today - which establishes in this circuit that a jury could supportably find the use of a Taser to quell a nonviolent, mentally ill person who is resisting arrest to be excessive force - satisfies this exacting standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Affirmed\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    Gray testified she was told that she would be tased if she stood up.
