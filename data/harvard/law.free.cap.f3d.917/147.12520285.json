(\"Shire\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   manufactured and marketed the lucrative drug Vancocin, which is indicated to treat a life-threatening gastrointestinal infection. After Shire got wind that manufacturers were considering making generic equivalents to Vancocin, it inundated the United States Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") with allegedly meritless filings to delay approval of those generics. The FDA eventually rejected Shire's filings and approved generic equivalents to Vancocin, but the filings nonetheless resulted in a high cost to consumers-Shire had delayed generic entry for years and reaped hundreds of millions of dollars in profits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Nearly five years later-and after Shire had divested itself of Vancocin-the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") filed suit against Shire in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware under Section 13(b) of the Federal Trade Commission Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2053\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). The FTC sought a permanent injunction and restitution,\n   alleging that Shire's petitioning was an unfair method of competition prohibited by the Act. Shire moved to dismiss, arguing that the FTC's allegations of long-past petitioning activity failed to satisfy Section 13(b)'s requirement that Shire \"is violating\" or \"is about to violate\" the law. The District Court agreed and dismissed the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On appeal, the FTC urges us to adopt a more expansive view of Section 13(b). According to the FTC, the phrase \"is violating, or is about to violate\" in Section 13(b) is satisfied by showing a past violation and a reasonable likelihood of recurrent future conduct. We reject the FTC's invitation to stretch Section 13(b) beyond its clear text. The FTC admits that Shire is not currently violating the law. And the complaint fails to allege that Shire is about to violate the law. We will therefore affirm the District Court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A company that wishes to manufacture and market a new drug in the United States must submit to the FDA a New Drug Application (\"NDA\") demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the product.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Usually, the NDA filer demonstrates safety and efficacy by using expensive\n   <em>\n    in vivo\n   </em>\n   clinical endpoint studies, where researchers provide sick patients with either the proposed drug or a placebo to compare the safety and efficacy of the drug with the placebo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fed.

Until Shire divested itself of the product in 2014, this included Vancocin capsules.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Vancocin capsules are an oral antibiotic used to treat\n   <em>\n    Clostridium-difficile\n   </em>\n   associated diarrhea, which is a serious, potentially life-threatening gastrointestinal infection. When Vancocin capsules were developed, the NDA did not include\n   <em>\n    in vivo\n   </em>\n   clinical endpoint studies because the capsules were an alternative delivery system to Vancocin oral solution, which the FDA already knew to be safe and effective. Instead, the NDA included\n   <em>\n    in vitro\n   </em>\n   dissolution data (which measures how quickly the capsules dissolve) and\n   <em>\n    in vivo\n   </em>\n   pharmacokinetic data (which compares the absorption of the drug in capsule form versus oral solution form).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In April 1986, the FDA approved Vancocin capsules. Shire acquired Vancocin capsules in November 2004. From then until 2011, Vancocin capsules were Shire's largest revenue-generating product. Vancocin capsules accounted for all of Shire's net revenue until 2009 and up to 53% of its net revenue in 2011. United States sales for Vancocin capsules grew from $ 40 million in 2003 to almost $ 300 million in 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Generic manufacturers, attracted by Vancocin's financial success, wanted to enter the market. Vancocin was vulnerable to generic competition because it lacked both patent protection and regulatory exclusivity. One primary barrier to generic entry remained-the FDA's recommendation that generic manufacturers seeking to demonstrate bioequivalence conduct\n   <em>\n    in vivo\n   </em>\n   clinical endpoint studies. Ironically, these tests were more expensive and onerous than the\n   <em>\n    in vitro\n   </em>\n   dissolution testing and\n   <em>\n    in vivo\n   </em>\n   pharmacokinetic studies that had been used to gain approval of Vancocin capsules in the first place. The FDA apparently realized this inconsistency; in October 2004 it convened a public meeting of the Advisory Committee for Pharmaceutical Science (the \"Advisory Committee\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   to reassess bioequivalence testing for locally-acting gastrointestinal drugs like Vancocin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Shire became increasingly concerned that the FDA might allow generic manufacturers to demonstrate bioequivalence using\n   <em>\n    in vitro\n   </em>\n   data. Shire thus hired a bioequivalence consultant to advise it on the FDA's likely course of action. In November 2005, the consultant confirmed Shire's suspicions, advising Shire that the FDA would likely allow generic manufacturers to submit\n   <em>\n    in vitro\n   </em>\n   dissolution data to establish bioequivalence to Vancocin capsules. The consultant counseled Shire to submit a citizen petition \"sooner than later\" but warned that without supporting clinical data, Shire \"could not convince the FDA of its position against use of\n   <em>\n    in vitro\n   </em>\n   dissolution testing.\" Compl. \u00b6 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Shire's fear came to pass: the FDA indeed changed its position on bioequivalence testing for Vancocin capsules. In February 2006, the FDA advised a generic manufacturer that bioequivalence for Vancocin capsules could be demonstrated by\n   <em>\n    in vitro\n   </em>\n   dissolution testing. The FDA also shared this guidance with other generic manufacturers that inquired. In March\n   2007, the first generic manufacturer submitted its ANDA for Vancocin capsules. Two other generic manufacturers followed suit later that year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Not surprisingly, Shire wanted to protect its monopoly on the Vancocin market. Among its options was a citizen petition. The First Amendment guarantees individuals the right to petition the government. U.S. Const. amend. I. Consistent with that right, the Administrative Procedure Act permits any \"interested person\" to petition a federal agency \"for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of a rule.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20553\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2010.30\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 10.30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (FDA regulation governing citizen petitions).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The filing of a citizen petition can substantially delay approval of a generic drug.

Shire's filings ranged from a citizen petition and amendments thereto to public comments on other manufacturers' ANDAs. Many of these filings were around the same time Shire suspected the FDA was nearing approval of generic equivalents to Vancocin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On April 9, 2012, the FDA rejected Shire's citizen petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The FDA concluded that Shire's scientific challenges to the bioequivalence recommendation \"lack[ed] merit\" and \"were unsupported.\" Compl. \u00b6 104 (internal quotation marks omitted); App. 77-95.

The FTC claimed that Shire's conduct-submitting serial, meritless filings-had harmed consumers and competition because it enabled Shire to maintain and extend its monopoly by delaying the FDA's approval of generic alternatives to Vancocin capsules.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2045\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The FTC alleged that, absent an injunction, \"there is a cognizable danger\" that Shire will \"engage in similar conduct causing future harm to competition and consumers.\" Compl. \u00b6 150. It based this assertion on Shire's (1) knowledge that its petitioning campaign would enrich it at the expense of consumers; (2) incentive to engage in similar conduct in the future; and (3) opportunity to engage in similar conduct in the future. As to the third point, the FTC specifically alleged that Shire \"marketed and developed drug products,\" namely Cinryze, \"for commercial sale in the United States, and it could do so in the future.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2045\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2045\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 8, 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Shire moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the FTC had failed to plead sufficient facts to invoke its authority under Section 13(b).

The Tenth Circuit did not address whether the FTC had properly filed suit under Section 13(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The FTC next protests that our interpretation of \"is about to violate\" would make it harder to get in the courthouse door than to win injunctive relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   FTC contends that the likelihood of recurrence standard-which applies when a court is considering whether to grant or deny injunctive relief-\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   be the sole standard to plead a Section 13(b) claim. But the FTC cannot overcome Congress's plain language in Section 13(b), which requires the FTC to plead, at the time it files suit, that a violation \"is\" occurring or \"is about to\" occur.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2053\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Furthermore, the FTC ignores that the \"about to violate\" and \"likelihood of recurrence\" standards coexist. The \"about to violate\" pleading requirement-which is applied right out of the gate-is not inconsistent with the likelihood of recurrence standard, which a court uses to determine the FTC's entitlement to an injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The FTC also places much weight on cases interpreting the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These Acts permit the Securities Exchange Commission to seek injunctive relief in federal court when a defendant \"is engaged\" or is \"about to engage\" in a violation of securities laws. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77t(b) and 78u(d)(1). We reject the FTC's invitation to import the interpretation of \"is\" or \"is about to\" contained in cases interpreting the securities laws. We \"look to other statutes pertaining to the same subject matter which contain similar terms\" only if \"the ordinary meaning of a statute and the statute's legislative history fail to provide sufficient guidance to a term's meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    Liberty Lincoln-Mercury, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11638801\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/171/818/#p823\">\n    171 F.3d 818\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 823 (3d Cir. 1999). Here, the plain language of Section 13(b) answers the question for us-\"is about to violate\" means something more than a past violation and a likelihood of recurrence. If we were in doubt, the structure and history of the FTC Act support our interpretation. Moreover, the statutory scheme-the addition of Section 13(b) to cure a shortcoming of Section 5(b)-is not similar to the securities laws, which have always permitted suits for injunctions.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Amicus Br. of Washington Legal Foundation 9 (\"While several other statutes include language similar to the FTC's 'about to violate' language, none of those statutes include agency-litigating authority that even remotely resembles the overall structure and history of the FTC Act.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Finally, the FTC trots out the old adage that a remedial statute like the FTC Act should be construed broadly. Because Section 13(b)'s \"is\" or \"is about to\" requirement allegedly conflicts with the remedial purpose of the FTC Act, the FTC says we should disregard the plain meaning of that language. Of course, none of the authority the FTC cites stands for the broad proposition that we can\n   <em>\n    ignore\n   </em>\n   clear statutory language if it does not promote a remedial interpretation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Touche Ross &amp; Co. v.

As soon as a potential defendant got wind that the FTC was investigating its activities, it could simply stop those activities and render itself immune from suit in federal court unless the FTC could allege and prove an imminent re-violation.\"). But there is no reason to believe that our decision today unnecessarily restricts the FTC's ability to address wrongdoing. Section 5 authorizes administrative proceedings based on past violations. And, of course, if the FTC believes that a wrongdoer is \"about to violate\" the law during the pendency of an administrative proceeding, it could then come to court and obtain an injunction under Section 13(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The FTC's understandable preference for litigating under Section 13(b), rather than in an administrative proceeding, does not justify its expansion of the statutory language. If the FTC wants to recover for a past violation-where an entity \"has been\" violating the law-it must use Section 5(b).\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2045\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

Here, the FTC wants to use the most advantageous aspects of each statutory provision-to punish Shire for a past violation using the less onerous enforcement mechanism. But the FTC's attempt to squeeze Shire's conduct into the \"about to violate\" category distorts Section 13(b) beyond its intended purpose. Section 13(b) cannot accommodate the FTC's interpretation-that \"about to violate\" means only that a violation could recur at some future point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In short, we reject the FTC's contention that Section 13(b)'s \"is violating\" or \"is about to violate\" language can be satisfied by showing a violation in the distant past and a vague and generalized likelihood of recurrent conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, \"is\" or \"is about to violate\" means what it says-the FTC must make a showing that a defendant is violating or is about to violate the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Here, the FTC never initiated Section 5 proceedings against Shire.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, the FTC waited until five years after Shire had stopped its allegedly illegal conduct before seeking an injunction under Section 13(b). Viewed under the correct standard, the FTC's complaint fails to allege that\n   Shire \"is violating\" or \"is about to violate\" the law. The FTC does not contest that Shire is not currently violating the law. Indeed, Shire divested itself of Vancocin in 2014, two years after generic competition entered the market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Instead, the FTC relies on Section 13(b)'s \"is about to violate\" language. The few factual allegations in the FTC's forty-five page complaint that suggest Shire \"is about to violate\" the law are woefully inadequate to state a claim under Section 13(b). The FTC alleges generally that Shire \"is engaged in the business of, among other things, developing, manufacturing, and marketing branded drug products, including\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , Cinryze.\" Compl. \u00b6 8. As to the likelihood that Shire will engage in illegal behavior, the FTC alleges, \"[a]bsent an injunction, there is a cognizable danger that [Shire] will engage in similar conduct causing future harm to competition and consumers. [Shire] knowingly carried out its anticompetitive and meritless petitioning campaign to preserve its monopoly profits.

Without mentioning Cinryze by name, the FTC alleges that Shire \"has the incentive and opportunity to continue to engage in similar conduct in the future.

Consequently, [Shire] has the incentive to obstruct or delay competition to these or other products.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2045\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2045\">\n    \u00b6 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The District Court concluded that these vague allegations failed to \"plausibly suggest [Shire] is 'about to violate' any law enforced by the FTC, particularly when the alleged misconduct ceased almost five years before filing of the complaint.\" Op. 158. We agree. Taking the factual allegations in the complaint as true, Shire stopped its sham petitioning campaign in 2012 when the FDA approved generic equivalents to Vancocin. The complaint contains no allegations that Shire engaged in sham petitioning in the five-year gap between the 2012 cessation in petitioning and the 2017 lawsuit. The complaint also lacks specific allegations that Shire is \"about to violate\" the law by petitioning as to Cinryze, the only other drug mentioned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   At oral argument in the District Court, the FTC provided more support for its argument that Shire \"is about to violate\" the law.

None of these facts-other than that Shire markets Cinryze-are pleaded in the complaint, which the FTC chose not to amend. Based upon the pleading before us, we conclude that the FTC has failed to plead that Shire is \"about to violate\" any law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In this case, given the paucity of allegations in the complaint, the FTC fails to state a claim under any reasonable definition of \"about to violate.\" Whatever the outer reach of \"about to violate\" may be, the facts in this case do not approach it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   We therefore leave for another day the exact confines of Section 13(b)'s \"about to violate\" language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Under Section 13(b) of the FTC Act, the FTC must plead that Shire \"is\" violating or \"is about to\" violate the law.

The FTC thus fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. We will affirm the District Court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The FTC's improper use of Section 13(b) to pursue long-past petitioning has the potential to discourage lawful petitioning activity by interested citizens-activity that is protected by the First Amendment.
