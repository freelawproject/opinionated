But the district court found that Hately failed to demonstrate the requisite statutory injury under state law, and that Hately's previously opened and delivered emails stored by a web-based email service were not in statutorily protected \"electronic storage\" under federal law. We disagree with both determinations and therefore reverse and remand this case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In August 2008, Hately enrolled at Blue Ridge Community College (\"Blue Ridge College\"), a constituent institution of the Virginia Community College System. At Blue Ridge College, Hately had a student email account that he continued to use after he graduated in 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Blue Ridge College uses a web-based email client with branding specific for Blue Ridge College. Google hosts all emails.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Account holders can access the copies stored on their web-based email page as long as the student does not delete those copies. Blue Ridge College also stores at least one additional copy of all student emails, which can be used to recover any email that is accidentally deleted. Students may access these stored copies only by requesting them from Blue Ridge College's technical support personnel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   From August 2011 to February 2015, Hately had an intimate relationship with Nicole Torrenzano (\"Nicole\"), with whom Hately has two children. During their relationship, Hately and Nicole shared login and password information for their email accounts-including Hately's Blue Ridge College email account. But when, about March 2015, Nicole informed Hately that she also was involved in an intimate relationship with Watts, who was her co-worker and married to Audrey Hallinan Watts (\"Audrey\"), Hately and Nicole separated. Pertinent to this action, Hately did not change the password that he shared with Nicole for his Blue Ridge College email account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Watts and Nicole continued their personal relationship, and during the fall of 2015, Watts and Audrey initiated divorce proceedings. In an effort to help Watts in his divorce proceedings, Nicole told Watts that Hately and Audrey were having an affair. Nicole said she knew of emails between Hately and Audrey that Watts could obtain by using the password that she had to Hately's Blue Ridge College email account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Watts stated that he used the password Nicole gave him to browse through Hately's emails but contended that he \"did not open or view any email that was unopened, marked as unread, previously deleted, or in the [student email account]'s 'trash' folder.\" J.A. 506. Watts also said that he did not \"change the status of, or modify, any email in any way.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In September 2016, Hately filed his first lawsuit against Watts and Nicole in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia (\"\n   <em>\n    Hately I\n   </em>\n   \"), alleging that they unlawfully accessed his email, in violation of: (1) the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (2) the federal Stored Communications Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202701\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; and (3) the Virginia Computer Crimes Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2018.2-152.1\">\n    Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-152.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Shortly after filing suit, Hately voluntarily dismissed his claims against Watts, without prejudice, and amended his complaint against Nicole. In his amended complaint, Hately alleged that he \"incurred actual damages by the illicit access because [he] was forced to incur damages in time invested, software purchases to track and prevent future access, and more[.]\" J.A. 39 \u00b6 93. He further alleged that he had \"incurred many hours of valuable time away from day-to-day responsibilities in attempting to determine the source of the computer breach.\" J.A. 37 \u00b6 76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In an order dated December 2, 2016, the district court in\n   <em>\n    Hately I\n   </em>\n   dismissed \"without prejudice\" Hately's Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and Virginia Computer Crimes Act claims against Nicole. The order provided no explanation as to why the court dismissed those claims. But in a subsequent opinion addressing a different issue, the court explained: \"[a]lthough [Nicole] moved to dismiss the [Virginia Computer Crimes Act] Claims on multiple grounds, the Court dismissed the [Virginia Computer Crimes Act] Claims because [Hately] failed to sufficiently allege\n   how he sustained any injury to person or property by reason of a violation of the [Virginia Computer Crimes Act].\"\n   <em>\n    Hately v. Torrenzano\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:116-CV-01143 (GBL/MSN),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202274326\">\n    2017 WL 2274326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (E.D. Va. May 23, 2017). The district court did not dismiss Hately's Stored Communications Act claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On February 13, 2017, Hately moved to amend his complaint for a second time. This time, Hately sought to rename Watts as a defendant and to reinstate his Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and Virginia Computer Crimes Act claims against Nicole. The district court denied the motion\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   on grounds that Hately's \"attempt to amend the complaint would cause undue prejudice to [Nicole].\"\n   <em>\n    Hately v. Torrenzano\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:16-CV-01143 (GBL/MSN),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201428712\">\n    2017 WL 1428712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (E.D. Va. Apr. 20, 2017). According to the court, amending the complaint \"would certainly require the Court to reopen discovery for Watts\" and would \"change the nature of this litigation\" by \"add[ing claims] to what would otherwise be a narrow case involving a single cause of action under the Stored Communications Act[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201428712\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Hately did not appeal the\n   <em>\n    Hately I\n   </em>\n   court's denial of his motion to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In April 2017, Hately refiled his action against Watts, again alleging that Watts unlawfully accessed his email, in violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the Stored Communications Act, and the Virginia Computer Crimes Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Unlike his initial action against Watts, which was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice, Hately's refiled action supported his Virginia Computer Crimes Act claims by reciting additional factual allegations bearing on damages.\n   <em>\n    Hately\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202274326\">\n    2017 WL 2274326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. For example, whereas Hately's initial complaint alleged that Hately \"incurred many hours of valuable time away from day-to-day responsibilities in attempting to determine the source of the computer breach,\" J.A. 37 \u00b6 76, Hately's complaint in the refiled action provided greater detail as to the time he lost as a result of the breach, alleging that he \"was forced to identify\" and make \"several calls to\" Blue Ridge College's technical support personnel \"in order to ascertain the individual(s) that owns the domain for his school-related email account, as well as the individual(s) that manages the exchange servers for his school-related email account.\" J.A. 165 \u00b6\u00b6 94-96. And Hately's refiled complaint alleged that he \"review[ed]\" \"hundreds or thousands of email messages\" and \"restore[d]\" \"deleted but unread email messages\" that \"were previously unknown to [Hately].\" J.A. 166 \u00b6\u00b6 97-98. Also, the refiled complaint alleged that Hately was \"forced to download and run programs that scanned his mobile telephone for viruses.\" J.A. 170 \u00b6 115.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After conducting a hearing on July 6, 2017, the district court dismissed the Virginia Computer Crimes Act claims against Watts for two independent reasons.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, the court held that the Virginia Computer Crimes Act claims were barred by collateral estoppel. The court explained in an oral ruling that \"[a]ll of the damages that [Hately] alleges in this [instant] action ... were the subject of [a prior motion to dismiss in\n   <em>\n    Hately I\n   </em>\n   ], and that issue was fully briefed and argued in open court in the prior proceedings.\" J.A. 377. Even though the\n   <em>\n    Hately I\n   </em>\n   court dismissed the Virginia Computer Crimes Act claims \"without prejudice,\" the district court concluded that the previous dismissal had \"finally\n   determined\" that Hately had not \"sustained injury to person or property\" under the Virginia Computer Crimes Act. J.A. 382. Accordingly, the district court held that Hately was \"estopped from relitigating those injury claims.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202274326\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Second, the district court concluded that, even if collateral estoppel did not apply, Hately failed to plausibly allege statutory injury, notwithstanding that Hately's new complaint included additional factual allegations bearing on injury. J.A. 383 (holding that Hately had \"not alleged facts that make plausible his claim that he has sustained injury to person or property as those terms have been construed under the [Virginia Computer Crimes Act]\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Thereafter, in January 2018, Hately and Watts filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the remaining Stored Communications Act claim. In an order entered March 14, 2018, the district court denied Hately's motion, granted Watts' motion, and dismissed the case. In an accompanying opinion, the court held that \"previously opened and delivered emails\" stored \"in a web-based email client\" were not in protected \"electronic storage\" for purposes of the Stored Communications Act.\n   <em>\n    Hately v. Watts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525108\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/309/407/#p408\">\n    309 F.Supp.3d 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 408, 410-14 (E.D. Va. 2018). According to the court, the statutory definition of \"electronic storage\" \"covers emails only up to the point where the emails have been initially transmitted to their recipient and read or initially downloaded.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525108\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/309/407/#p408\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525108\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/309/407/#p408\">\n    at 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The district court also held that Hately's emails were not protected under the statute because they were not stored by an \"electronic communication service\" and were not stored \"for purposes of backup protection.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525108\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/309/407/#p408\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525108\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/309/407/#p408\">\n    at 412-413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202510\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (17)(B) ). According to the court, Blue Ridge College was acting, for purposes of the Stored Communications Act, as a \"remote computing service\"-not as an \"electronic communication service\"-because the emails Watts accessed were \"service copies\" maintained by Blue Ridge College \"for the purposes of transmitting them to a single user's account upon that user's command.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202510\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202510\">\n    at 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, the emails were not stored for purposes of backup protection because, the court maintained, they were stored for\n   <em>\n    Hately's\n   </em>\n   backup purposes rather than\n   <em>\n    Blue Ridge College's\n   </em>\n   \"own backup or administrative purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202510\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because Hately's accessed emails were not protected \"electronic storage,\" Watts was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the Stored Communications Act claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202510\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Hately timely appealed the dismissal of his Virginia Computer Crimes Act claims and the grant of summary judgment on the Stored Communications Act claim. We address each claim in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Regarding the district court's dismissal of his Virginia Computer Crimes Act claims, Hately contends that the district court's error was twofold. First, that the court improperly applied the doctrine of collateral estoppel, also referred to as \"issue preclusion,\" to bar reconsideration of whether he adequately alleged that his \"property or person [was] injured\" within the meaning of the Virginia Computer Crimes Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2018.2-152.12\">\n    Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 18.2-152.12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (A). And second, that the court incorrectly determined that he failed to plausibly allege injury to person or property within the meaning of the Virginia Computer Crimes Act. We agree, and therefore conclude that the district court erred in dismissing Hately's Virginia Computer Crimes Act claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The district court applied the doctrine of issue preclusion to bar reconsideration of whether Hately's complaint\n   adequately alleged his \"property or person [was] injured\" within the meaning of the Virginia Computer Crimes Act.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2018.2-152.12\">\n    Va.

Neither the Supreme Court nor this Court has ever addressed what law governs the issue-preclusive effect of a federal court disposition of a state law claim rendered in a case in which the federal court exercised supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claim. However, in\n   <em>\n    Semtek International v. LockheedMartin\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that when a federal court exercises diversity jurisdiction over a state law claim, \"federal common law governs the claim-preclusive effect of a dismissal\" of the state law claim by the federal court.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505781\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/497/#p506\">\n    531 U.S. at 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505781\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/497/#p506\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Also like the system Congress described, the web-based email service then \"stores\" the message until the\n   addressee \"retrieves\" it, by routing the message through the addressee's internet provider to the browser or application on the addressee's internet-connected device in which the addressee views the message.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The copies of emails retained by a user in his web-based account also are stored by the web-based email service-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the electronic communication service-for purposes of its own and its users' \"protection.\" As set forth above, web-based email services-including Google, which hosted the copies Hately's emails accessed by Watts-retain multiple copies of the messages in a user's account for the web-based email service's\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   backup protection. Such services use \"redundant\" systems \"to decrease email downtime (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , users being unable to access their email) or loss of information due to component failure,\" CDT Br. at 22-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , to ensure the product the web-based email service markets functions as intended, expected, and demanded by users. Put simply, by storing copies of messages on multiple servers and in multiple locations, the web-based email service protects itself against the failure of one or more of its servers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Additionally, the web-based email service stores previously opened and delivered emails for the \"protection\" of their users. When the user of a web-based email service, like Hately, opens and reviews an email message and then chooses not to delete the message from his account, the user is likely retaining that message to prevent its destruction. There are numerous reasons a recipient may not want to destroy a message he already has read. For example, a user who receives an email setting up a meeting may choose not to delete the email after first reading it because the user wants to keep a copy readily available in case the user forgets the time or place of the meeting. Or, a user who reaches a business agreement over email may choose to retain in his web-based account messages concerning the agreement to document the agreement's existence and terms. Or, a user who receives a message from a friend or loved one may choose not to delete the message because it has sentimental value and the user wishes to reread the message of future. Or, a user may choose not to delete a message after reading it simply because the user does not know whether the user will need the message in the future and therefore wishes to preserve it. In each of these examples, the user chooses not to delete the message because the user does not want the message to be \"destroyed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   But importantly, the meaning of \"backup protection\" does not turn on whether a\n   <em>\n    user\n   </em>\n   subjectively chose not to delete the email after reading the message because the\n   <em>\n    user\n   </em>\n   wanted to keep the message for backup protection. That is because the purpose of the\n   <em>\n    web-based email service\n   </em>\n   in providing storage for the message-storage that is a feature of the product the web-based email service offers-is to afford the user a place to store messages the user does not want destroyed. The\n   <em>\n    web-based email service\n   </em>\n   does not need to know why the user has elected not to delete particular message. Rather, the\n   <em>\n    web-based email service\n   </em>\n   recognizes that users who choose to use a web-based email platform desire storage for read and unread messages and therefore the\n   <em>\n    web-based email\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    service\n   </em>\n   provides such storage to meet user demand. That is why providers of web-based email services like Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo! market the amount of storage their services provide.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Nicholas Behrens,\n   <em>\n    Gmail, now with 10 GB of Storage (and counting)\n   </em>\n   , Official Gmail Blog (April 24, 2012), https://gmail.googleblog.com/2012/04/gmail-now-with-10gb-of-storage-and.html (last visited Feb. 26, 2019). Put simply, the\n   <em>\n    web-based email service\n   </em>\n   is storing the message for the purpose of providing backup protection to its users because that is a feature users desire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Our conclusion that previously delivered and opened emails stored on a web-based email client are in \"electronic storage\"-and therefore actionable under Section 2701(a) -also finds support in the statute's legislative history. The House Report states that \"[a]n 'electronic mail' service, which permits a sender to transmit a digital message to the service's facility, where it is held in storage until the addressee requests it, would be subject to Section 2701.\" H.R. Rep. No. 99-647, at 63. In the case of a web-based email service, like Blue Ridge College's email service, the service holds copies of the message in \"storage\" on one or more of its servers \"until the addressee requests it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277796\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/822/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Notably, in the case of a web-based email service-like Blue Ridge College's email service-an addressee can \"request\" a message on multiple occasions-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , each time the addressee elects to open the message in his web-based email client, regardless of whether the addressee previously opened the message. Nothing in the House Report indicates that Congress intended to limit Section 2701 's protections to the period before the addressee\n   <em>\n    first\n   </em>\n   requests a message-as Watts argues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Likewise, the Senate Report notes that \"a computer mail facility authorizes a subscriber to access information in their portion of the facilit[y']s storage. Accessing the storage of other subscribers without specific authorization to do so would be a violation of [ Section 2701(a) ].\" S. Rep. No. 99-541, at 36. Here, Google, as host of Blue Ridge College's email service, allocates a \"portion\" of the space on its servers to store a user's messages. Accordingly, accessing that \"storage ... without specific authorization\"-as Watts allegedly did here-is actionable under Section 2701(a)(1). Again, the Senate Report nowhere draws a distinction between the periods before and after a user first views a message, as Watts would have us do. Rather, like the House Report, the Senate Report focuses on whether the copy of the allegedly unlawfully accessed message was held in the web-based email service's storage (and therefore is actionable under Section 2701(a)(1) ) as opposed to other entities' storage (and therefore is not actionable).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Watts nevertheless argues that previously delivered and opened emails stored by a web-based email service do not fall within the meaning of \"backup protection\" for three reasons: (1) the term encompasses only copies \"made for the service provider's own administrative purposes\"; (2) the term encompasses only copies retained \"for use in the event that the\n   <em>\n    original\n   </em>\n   is rendered unusable\"; and (3) the emails were stored for\n   <em>\n    Hately\n   </em>\n   's backup protection and not for\n   <em>\n    Blue Ridge College\n   </em>\n   's backup protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Watts' first argument-that the term \"backup protection\" encompasses only copies \"made for the service provider's own administrative purposes\"-principally rests on his contention, with which the district court agreed, that the meaning of \"backup protection\" in Subsection (B) should be construed in accordance with the meaning of \"backup copy\" in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202704\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hately\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525108\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/309/407/#p408\">\n    309 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   413 n.9 (quoting Kerr,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 1217 n.61 (\" Section 2704 makes clear that the Stored Communications Act uses the phrase 'backup copy' in a very technical way to mean a copy made by the service provider for administrative purposes.\")). Section 2704 provides that the government \"may include in its subpoena or court order [requesting communications stored by a remote computing service] a requirement that the service provider to whom the request is directed create a backup copy of the contents of the electronic communications sought in order to preserve the communications.\" Accordingly, the term \"backup copy\" in Section 2704 means a copy of an electronic communication created by a service provider pursuant to a court order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Section 2704 's use of the term \"backup copy\" does not bear the interpretive weight Watts claims. Nothing in the Stored Communications Act's definition of electronic storage, Section 2704, or the statute's legislative history provides any indication that Congress intended \"backup protection\" and \"backup copy\" to have the same meaning. On the contrary, Section 2704(a) deals with a specific type of \"backup copy\"-one created pursuant to court order-and therefore does not, and cannot, establish the general definition of \"backup.\" Notably, Watts and the district court concede as much, concluding that the definition of \"backup protection\" encompasses all \"backup\" copies created for an electronic communication service's \"administrative purposes,\" not just any backup copies created pursuant to a court order issued under Section 2704(a). Indeed, the \"backup copies\" at issue in Section 2704(a) arguably are not created for \"administrative purposes\" at all-they are created to comply with the court order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   More significantly, even assuming Watts and the district court are correct that the term \"backup protection\" encompasses only copies that are \"made for the service provider's own administrative purposes,\" Hately's emails in question would fall within the meaning of \"backup protection.\" \"Administrative\" means \"relating to the running of a business, organization, etc.\"\n   <em>\n    Administrative\n   </em>\n   , Merriam-Webster.com (last visited Feb. 26, 2019). As explained above, web-based email services-including Google, which hosted Hately's College email account-create numerous copies of emails for their own administrative purposes, such as decreasing email downtime, protecting against loss of data in the event a particular server fails, CDT Br. at 22, and for their own commercial purposes, such as to more effectively target advertisements. Accordingly, the copies of Hately's emails at issue were created for Blue Ridge College email service's \"administrative purposes\" under the common meaning of that term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   In support of his second argument-that the term \"backup protection\" encompasses only copies retained \"for use in the event that the\n   <em>\n    original\n   </em>\n   is rendered unusable\"-Watts asserts that the definition of backup presupposes the existence of an \"original.\" Appellee's Br. at 33-34;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jennings\n   </em>\n   , 736 S.E.2d at 245 (\"Congress's use of 'backup' necessarily presupposes the existence of another copy to which this e-mail would serve as a substitute or support.\"). According to Watts, the emails accessed by users of a web-based email service are \"originals,\" rather than \"copies,\" and therefore do not fall within the meaning of \"backup.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   To be sure, some definitions of \"backup\" suggest a distinction between \"backups\" and \"originals.\"\n   <em>\n    See Backup\n   </em>\n   , The American Heritage Dictionary 132 (\"A copy of a program or file that is stored separately from the original.\");\n   <em>\n    Copy\n   </em>\n   , The American Heritage Dictionary 405 (defining \"copy\" as \"[a]n imitation or reproduction of an original\"). But not all definitions of \"backup\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   draw such a distinction.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part III.B.4. And relying on definitions of \"backup\" that define the term relative to an \"original\" makes little sense in the context of messages stored by electronic communication services, and email services, in particular. That is because the \"original\" would seem to be most readily understood as the copy of a message that a\n   <em>\n    sender\n   </em>\n   types into his email client. The sender's email service then sends a copy of that original to the recipient's email service, meaning that the recipient's email service never receives, much less stores, the \"original\" message.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. No. 99-541, at 8 (stating that in the \"most common form\" of email \"messages are typed into a computer terminal, and then transmitted over telephone lines to a recipient computer operated by an electronic mail company. If the intended addressee subscribes to the service, the message is stored by the company's computer 'mail box' until the subscriber calls the company to retrieve its mail\"). Put differently, all copies of an email held by a recipient's email service, web-based or otherwise, are \"copies,\" rather than \"originals.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Additionally, even if an addressee's email service did receive an \"original,\" in the context of \"redundant\" web-based email services-like Blue Ridge College's email service hosted by Google-even the \"original\" serves as a \"backup.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CDT Br. at 22. In particular, each of the numerous copies of the messages created and stored on the service's server acts as a \"substitute\" or \"support\" for every other copy stored on the service's servers.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, even if one of those numerous copies was an \"original,\" that \"original\" would still serve as a \"backup\" for all the other copies stored by the service.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Third, Watts argues-and the district court agreed-that Hately's emails were not stored \"for purposes of backup protection\" because the court determined those emails were stored for\n   <em>\n    Hately\n   </em>\n   's backup protection and not for\n   <em>\n    Blue Ridge College email service\n   </em>\n   's backup protection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hately\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525108\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/309/407/#p408\">\n    309 F.Supp.3d at 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that Subsection (B) \"refers to a copy of a communication ... stored by the [electronic communication service] for its\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   backup or administrative purposes\" (emphasis added)). But, as explained above, messages\n   stored by a web-based email service are stored for purposes of the web-based email service's own backup protection as well as the user's backup protection. Equally important, \"nothing in the [Stored Communications Act] requires that the backup protection be for the benefit of the [electronic communication service] rather than the user.\"\n   <em>\n    Theofel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9286847\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/359/1066/#p1072\">\n    359 F.3d at 1075\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On the contrary, the statute's legislative history expressly contemplates that the requisite backup protection may be for the benefit of the user. H.R.

And because such emails amount to \"wire or electronic communications\" in \"storage\" by an \"electronic communication service,\" such emails are in \"electronic storage\" for purposes of Subsection (B).\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Parts III.B.1-3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Our conclusion that previously delivered and opened emails fall within the meaning of Subsection (B) also accords with Congress's purpose in enacting the Stored Communications Act. Congress sought to fill in a \"gap\" in then-existing law as to the \"protect[ion of] the privacy and security of communications transmitted by new non-common carrier communications services or new forms of telecommunications and computer technology,\" including email. S. Rep. No. 99-541, at 5 ; H.R. Rep.

As noted above, Congress expressed concern that the absence of such protection \"unnecessarily discourage[s] potential customers from using innovative communications systems\" and \"encourages unauthorized users to obtain access to communications to which they are not a party.\" S.

Potential users of web-based-email services-like Blue Ridge College's email service-would be deterred from using such services, knowing that unauthorized individuals and entities could access many, if not most, of the users' most sensitive emails without running afoul of federal law. Likewise, without the\n   prospect of liability under federal law, unauthorized entities will face minimal adverse consequences for accessing, and using for their own benefit, communications to which they are not a party. The legislative history establishes that Congress did not intend such a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The district court's interpretation of Subsection (B)-which would protect only\n   <em>\n    unread\n   </em>\n   emails stored in by web-based email service-also leads to an arbitrary and untenable \"gap\" in the legal protection of electronic communications. S. Rep. No. 99-541, at 5. Under the district court's reading, the Stored Communications Act renders unlawful unauthorized access of\n   <em>\n    unopened\n   </em>\n   messages stored by web-based email services, whereas unauthorized access of\n   <em>\n    opened and saved\n   </em>\n   messages stored by such services would not violate the Stored Communications Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hately\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525108\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/309/407/#p408\">\n    309 F.Supp.3d at 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the messages a user of a web-based email service chooses\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to delete-the messages the district court's construction of Subsection (B) leaves unprotected-are likely precisely the types of messages Congress sought to protect. By choosing to save such messages after reading them, the user indicates that the messages have sufficient personal, commercial, or other significance that they want to be able to access them again in the future. It defies logic that the unopened junk and spam email messages that a user leaves in his or her inbox or designated folder without opening would be entitled to\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   protection than those messages the user chooses to open\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   retain.

Kerr reasons that the electronic communication service rules and remote computing service rules are \"mutually exclusive\" because \"\u00a7 2703(a) states that a government entity needs a warrant to compel a service provider acting as an [electronic communication service] to disclose contents so long as the contents have been in storage for 180 days or less\" whereas \"\u00a7 2703(b)(1)(B)(i) states that the government entity can compel a service provider acting as [a remote computing service] to disclose contents with only prior notice.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206561156\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \"If an email message is covered by both the [electronic communication service] and [remote computing service] rules at the same time, legal process that is permitted under the [remote computing service] rules would violate the [electronic communication service] rules,\" he reasons.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206561156\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    There are several problems with this analysis. To begin, because both Section 2703(a) and Section 2703(b)(1)(B)(i) can be satisfied at the same time-by, for example, obtaining a warrant, \u00a7 2703(b)(1)(A) -they are not \"mutually exclusive\" in the logical sense.\n    <em>\n     See Mutually Exclusive,\n    </em>\n    Merriam-Webster.com (last visited Feb. 26, 2019) (defining \"mutually exclusive\" as \"being related such that each excludes or precludes the other\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    More significantly, both the House Report and Senate Report recognize that there are instances \"in which a person or entity acts both as a provider of [electronic communications] services and also offers other services to the public,\" which other services may be subject to different statutory disclosure requirements. H.R. Rep. No. 99-647, at 65; S. Rep. No. 99-541, at 37. Congress stated that in such circumstances, the provider should adhere to the more restrictive disclosure regime. H.R. Rep. No. 99-647, at 65 (\"The Committee intends that such instances be analyzed as though the communication services and the other services were provided by distinct entities. Where a combined entity in its non-provider role would not be allowed to disclose, the appropriate outcome would be non-disclosure.\"); S. Rep. No. 99-541, at 37 (same). For example, Congress stated when an entity simultaneously is subject to both the remote computing service and the Fair Credit Reporting Act disclosure restrictions, the entity should adhere to the more onerous Fair Credit Reporting Act disclosure restrictions. H.R. Rep. No. 99-647, at 65. Applying Congress's intended analytical approach, entities that simultaneously function as an electronic communication service and a remote computing service would follow the more restrictive disclosure regime set forth in Section 2703(a).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    Although no Circuit court appears to have squarely addressed the question, courts are divided as to whether delivered and previously opened emails retained on the server of the host of a web-based email service are stored for \"purposes of backup protection.\" Several courts, including the district court in this case, have concluded that such emails cannot amount to \"backup[s]\" because the term \"backup\" presupposes the existence of another copy to which this e-mail would serve as a substitute or support.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Hately\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525108\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/309/407/#p408\">\n     309 F.Supp.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    413 n.9 ;\n    <em>\n     Jennings\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3885670\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/401/1/\">\n     736 S.E.2d at 245\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (noting that \"[t]he ordinary meaning of the word 'backup' is 'one that serves as a substitute or support' \");\n    <em>\n     see also, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Cobra Pipeline Co., Ltd. v.

Additionally, that Blue Ridge College maintained \"storage copies\"-as the district court defined that term-of emails for backup protection in no way precludes a determination that \"service copies\" also are \"stored for purposes of backup protection,\" as Congress used that term. Neither the statute nor its legislative history limits the scope of messages in \"electronic storage\" under Subsection (B) to a single backup copy or type of backup copy. On the contrary, as long as Blue Ridge College's email service stored the \"service copies\" of Hately's emails \"for purposes of backup protection\" as required by Subsection (B), it is irrelevant that additional backup copies-be they characterized \"storage copies\" or otherwise-also may exist.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    Watts also asserts that language in the legislative history of two bills considered by Congress more than a decade\n    <em>\n     after\n    </em>\n    it enacted the Stored Communications Act establishes \"Congress's intent that opened and retained emails not be considered in 'electronic storage.' \" Appellee's Br. at 45.
