She began working for the Department of State in\n   1991 as a Communications Officer in Paris, France. In Paris, Linda met and married Russell, an Australian citizen who then worked for the Australian Embassy in France. Over the next decade, Linda and Russell held similar postings around the world, usually arranging their assignments so that they could pursue their careers in the same country. In 2001, Russell retired from his position with the Australian government, and he thereafter followed Linda as she continued her career with the State Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2005, the State Department assigned Linda to our Embassy in Sana'a, Yemen. Russell accompanied Linda to Sana'a and also found work at the Embassy. Among other jobs, Russell performed administrative work for the Embassy Commissary. In Sana'a, Linda and Russell lived in housing provided by the State Department, and they were protected by U.S. government security. Linda and Russell remained in Sana'a for approximately three years. Around December 2008, Linda and Russell moved to Japan, where Linda received her next State Department posting. By 2012, Linda and Russell had relocated to Melbourne, Australia, where Russell died of pancreatic cancer that September. Linda continues to reside in Melbourne.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Sarah Roe first met the Howards in September 2005, soon after their arrival in Yemen. At that time, Roe was twenty years old. Born into an impoverished family in Ethiopia, Roe had moved to Yemen to seek work, and she initially secured various housekeeping and cleaning jobs. In September 2005, Roe was employed there as a waitress at a restaurant on U.S. Embassy grounds called Uncle Sam's. It was at Uncle Sam's that the Howards first encountered Roe and sought to befriend her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As one of his odd jobs around the U.S. Embassy, Russell worked in a shop next door to Uncle Sam's. He first introduced himself to Roe, and then introduced Roe to Linda. Both Howards paid special attention to Roe: they complimented her appearance, initiated friendly conversations, and encouraged her to work for them as their live-in housekeeper. At first Roe declined the job offer, and Russell asked her to help \"find a beautiful woman like [her]self to work in [the Howards'] home.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 232. Linda would stop by Uncle Sam's three or four times a week, where she would \"greet\" and \"hug\" Roe.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 231. Linda even gave Roe her personal phone number.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 234.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Around 2006, Roe returned to Ethiopia from Yemen for several months to care for her mother. As a result, she lost her job at Uncle Sam's. When Roe returned to Sana'a, a young Ethiopian woman named Sabha was then employed as the Howards' live-in housekeeper, but Linda helped Roe obtain a data-entry job at the U.S. Embassy. Linda gave Roe an application for the data-entry position and taught her how to use a basic data-entry program on Linda's home computer. After Roe got the job, Linda continued to befriend her, meeting Roe to talk about her hair stylist and other non-work matters. Linda presented herself to Roe \"as a friend, someone very easy to talk to, someone with a very good heart.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 239. Linda also promised to help Roe find another job after the data-entry position ended. Roe believed Linda offered such help because Linda \"really liked\" her.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 241.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Some months later, in the spring of 2007, the Howards' then live-in housekeeper (another young Ethiopian woman named Brhan) left them. At the time, Roe was looking for a new job and the Howards renewed their offer to Roe to fill the housekeeping position. Roe was uncertain\n   about accepting the Howards' offer. She made more money when she had jobs that allowed her to accept tips, like waitressing. Roe also had her own apartment and did not want to move in with the Howards, which was a requirement of the position. But the Howards offered to help Roe get medical treatment for an eye ailment, renew her work visa, and aid her family in Ethiopia. Linda also \"knew that [Roe] had a desire to improve [her] language skills,\" and promised that Russell could help her with her English.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 247. As part of their discussions about the live-in position, Linda explained to Roe \"that Russell is usually at home, he needs a friend.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Linda told Roe that \"the main part of this job is to make Russell happy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 250. Roe understood this to mean that \"doing my job, cleaning, doing everything else was what was going to make him happy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Roe accepted the position and agreed to move in with the Howards. She began working for the Howards in June 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Once Roe moved into the Howards' apartment, she discovered that, although she had her own room and bathroom, the door to her room could not be locked without a key. The Howards told Roe they did not have the key. The Howards then presented Roe with a uniform consisting of a \"very short\" skirt and a blouse that \"looked like something you would wear ... when you go out.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 253. Linda had made the outfit herself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   When Roe refused to wear the uniform, Russell took Roe to the mall to go shopping. At the mall, he purchased a \"very revealing\" \"one-piece\" that \"open[ed] in the front,\" and \"underwear ... with one tiny string\" and \"many holes.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 253. Back at the apartment, Russell asked Roe to put on the new purchases \"and show him what it looks like.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 254. Roe refused again and went to the kitchen to prepare Russell's lunch. She then retired to her room. Suddenly, Russell entered the room, naked. Roe tried to escape but Russell cornered her, pinned her down on the bed, and raped her. Russell continually raped and sexually assaulted Roe for the duration of her time with the Howards. He repeatedly threatened Roe to maintain her silence: he verbally abused her, he warned Roe that he could have her thrown in jail, he threatened to tell her religiously conservative family about the assaults, and he retained possession of her passport.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As the district court succinctly put it in its post-trial opinion, \"Linda Howard was aware of these assaults.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 145-46. Linda often watched as Russell touched Roe's rear end and breasts. Roe overheard Russell talking to Linda on the phone about the assaults, including complaining that Roe \"wasn't like Brhan.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 258, 334. Roe knew it was Linda on the other end of the line based on the nature and content of those conversations. On one occasion, Russell related events to Linda over the phone as he took Roe to a hospital to have an intrauterine contraceptive device implanted. Russell also told Roe that he talked to Linda about the rapes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Eventually, Roe's continued resistance to Russell's repeated assaults and open, abject misery so enraged Russell that he fired her in December 2007. Linda then helped Roe obtain another restaurant job near the Howards' apartment and wrote a letter of recommendation for her. Even then, Russell would often stop by the restaurant to threaten Roe to maintain her silence about the rapes he had perpetrated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Congress enacted the TVPA in the year 2000 \"to combat trafficking in persons, a contemporary manifestation of slavery whose victims are predominantly women and children, to ensure just and effective\n   punishment of traffickers, and to protect their victims.\" TVPA, Pub.

The jury found Linda liable for each of the four alleged violations of the TVPA. The jury calculated Roe's compensatory damages at $1 million for each violation. The jury found, however, that those compensatory damages were duplicative, and thus awarded Roe $1 million in total compensatory damages. The jury also awarded Roe $2 million in punitive damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 115-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In September 2017, Linda filed multiple post-trial motions seeking to overturn the jury's verdict. As relevant to this appeal, Linda sought a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(a), contending that the district court had erred in admitting Doe's testimony. Linda also renewed her Rule 50 motion for judgment as a matter of law on the grounds that the TVPA did not apply to her extraterritorial conduct in 2007, and that the 2008 TVPRA amendments did not apply retroactively. In October 2017, the court denied Linda's post-trial motions. The court then entered judgment in favor of Roe in accordance with the verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In January 2018, the district court issued a post-trial opinion that addressed, inter alia, Linda's contention that the TVPA's civil remedy provision did not apply extraterritorially to reach her conduct in Yemen in 2007.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roe v.

First, Linda maintains that the court erred in concluding that the TVPA's civil remedy provision applied to her extraterritorial conduct in 2007, and thus erred in denying her motion for judgment as a matter of law. By her second contention, Linda argues that the court erred in admitting Jane Doe's trial testimony regarding her abuse by the Howards in 2008. We address each contention in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Linda seeks to vacate the judgment against her on the ground that the TVPA's civil remedy provision, codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201595\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , did not apply extraterritorially before 2008. Linda contends that this precludes any liability for her conduct toward Roe, which took place in Yemen in 2007. The district court rejected that argument when it denied Linda's post-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law. In so ruling, the court relied on the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co.\n   </em>\n   , and concluded that Linda's conduct sufficiently \"touch[ed] and concern[ed] the United States\" to displace the presumption against extraterritoriality.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 149 (citing\n   <em>\n    Kiobel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697039\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/108/\">\n    569 U.S. 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 124-25,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697039\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/108/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013) ).

We reach this conclusion, however, based on a somewhat different analysis than that employed by the district court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

To determine whether the substantive RICO provisions applied to foreign conduct, the Court examined the text and context of \u00a7 1962.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 2101-03.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Court explained that \"[t]he most obvious textual clue\" that \u00a7 1962 applied extraterritorially was that RICO defined \"racketeering activity\" to include \"a number of predicates that plainly apply to at least some foreign conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 2101. The Court reasoned that \"Congress's incorporation of [such] extraterritorial predicates into RICO gives a clear, affirmative indication that \u00a7 1962 applies to foreign racketeering activity - but only to the extent that the predicates alleged in a particular case themselves apply extraterritorially.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 2102. Thus, although Congress had not included \"an express statement of extraterritoriality\" in RICO's text, the context and structure of \u00a7 1962 - specifically, its incorporation of \"predicate statutes that\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   apply extraterritorially\" - nonetheless provided the necessary \"clear, affirmative indication\" that \u00a7 1962 applied extraterritorially.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 2101, 2102-03.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Put simply,\n   <em>\n    RJR Nabisco\n   </em>\n   teaches that, even absent an express statement of extraterritoriality, a statute may apply to foreign conduct insofar as it clearly and directly incorporates a predicate statutory provision that applies extraterritorially.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597929\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2090/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2102-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But that part of Justice Alito's opinion for the Court depended on factors that do not apply to \u00a7 1595 of the TVPA. First, RICO's civil remedy provision, codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201964\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), does not directly incorporate any extraterritorial predicates. Indeed, it makes no reference to any extraterritorial provision whatsoever. Rather, civil liability under \u00a7 1964(c) is premised on \u00a7 1962 criminal liability, but - crucially - is not coextensive with \u00a7 1962 liability. Justice Alito emphasized that the text of \u00a7 1964(c) limited its application to certain types of injuries, and thereby created a gap between the reach of \u00a7 1964(c) civil liability and \u00a7 1962 criminal liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 2106, 2108. Further, \u00a7 1964 contained no other indication that it should apply extraterritorially; that is, it lacked the kind of \"foreign-oriented language\" or reference to foreign activity that could sustain its extraterritorial application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 2108-10 &amp; n.12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   None of the foregoing considerations apply to \u00a7 1595 of the TVPA. As explained above, \u00a7 1595 expressly and directly incorporates the TVPA's criminal predicates, many of which manifestly apply to foreign conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    RJR Nabisco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597929\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2090/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that regard, \u00a7 1595 of the TVPA resembles \u00a7 1962 of RICO rather than the circumscribed text of \u00a7 1964(c).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 2109-10 (comparing and distinguishing \u00a7 1962 and \u00a7 1964 );\n   <em>\n    acc.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pfizer, Inc. v.

Moreover, the text of \u00a7 1595 shows that it applies coextensively with its predicate offenses, omitting any qualifying or modifying language, which further distinguishes it from \u00a7 1964(c). Notably, as discussed above, the TVPA is replete with the \"foreign-oriented language\" that Justice Alito found lacking in \u00a7 1964(c), including in the predicates underpinning Roe's claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    RJR Nabisco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597929\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2090/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2110 n.12. Indeed, the TVPA more clearly targets foreign conduct than any provision of RICO, as demonstrated by its international scope and Congress's repeated expansions of its extraterritorial reach.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 2005 TVPRA, 119 Stat. at 3562.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In short, \u00a7 1595 evinces the same relationship to its extraterritorial predicate offenses that RICO's substantive criminal provision does to its predicates, and is not subject to textual limitations like those found in RICO's private cause of action. Section 1595 therefore provides a civil remedy for conduct that comes within the extraterritorial predicates of the TVPA. Accordingly, we now turn to the question of whether the predicate offenses underlying Roe's civil suit applied to Linda's extraterritorial conduct in 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The jury awarded Roe damages based on their findings that Linda had violated\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201589\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1590, 1591, and 1594.

The remaining question for us today is whether those predicates applied extraterritorially and reached Linda's foreign conduct in\n   2007.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    RJR Nabisco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597929\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2090/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We will therefore assess each predicate offense, mindful that \"the inclusion of\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   extraterritorial predicates does not mean that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   [statutory] predicates extend to foreign conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Section 1591 - prohibiting sex trafficking - presents the simplest analysis.

By the TVPA's own terms, this extraterritorial application is limited in scope; that is, it applies only to persons employed abroad by the federal government. Linda, however, falls within that class of employees. Consequently, her actions in Sana'a were within the extraterritorial scope of \u00a7 1589 and \u00a7 1590 in 2007. The jury therefore properly found her liable for violating those provisions under \u00a7 1595.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   c.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Turning to \u00a7 1594, however, our analysis differs. Regardless of \u00a7 1594 's extraterritoriality, the conspiracy provision for which the jury found Linda liable had not been enacted by 2007. Rather, the conspiracy prohibitions contained in \u00a7 1594(b) and (c) were added as part of the 2008 TVPRA amendments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2008 TVPRA, \u00a7 222, 122 Stat. at 5070. That said, we need not resolve whether \u00a7 1594 applies retroactively in order to affirm the award of damages to Roe. If this Court is \"reasonably certain\" that the jury would have awarded the same amount of damages regardless of the \"issues erroneously submitted to it,\" we are entitled to affirm the award.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tire Eng'g &amp; Distribution, LLC v.

That rule holds particular force where, as here, the jury has completed a special verdict form addressing liability and damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 313-14 (collecting and comparing cases). Because the jury indicated that it calculated Roe's damages at $1 million for each of the four TVPA violations, but awarded only $1 million total because those damages were duplicative, it is beyond reasonable debate that the jury would have awarded Roe $1 million in compensatory damages for any one of Linda's violations, and for any combination thereof.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 115-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In sum, the facts established at trial show that Linda committed at least three predicate offenses that applied to her extraterritorial conduct toward Roe in 2007. Pursuant to the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    RJR Nabisco\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 1595 authorizes Linda's civil liability based on her commission of those offenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   We are entitled to affirm the jury's award of damages because they were properly awarded pursuant to \u00a7 1595, and because any error with regard to the applicability of \u00a7 1594 did not affect that result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Because step one of the\n   <em>\n    RJR Nabisco\n   </em>\n   framework demonstrates that \u00a7 1595 applied extraterritorially to Linda's conduct, we need not proceed to step two, which guides our analysis only where the pertinent statute does not apply extraterritorially.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    RJR Nabisco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597929\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2090/\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We confine our analysis today to the text and context of \u00a7 1595, and affirm the jury's award of damages to Roe on that basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Turning to Linda's second and final appellate contention, we must resolve whether the district court properly admitted Jane Doe's evidence concerning the sexual abuse she suffered while working as the Howards' housekeeper in 2008. Linda raises various objections to Doe's testimony: that it was impermissible character evidence barred by Federal Rule of Evidence 404(a) ; that it could not be admitted\n   under Rule 415, which permits testimony of \"similar acts\" in sexual assault lawsuits; that it was unfairly prejudicial and thus barred by Rule 403; and that the portion of Doe's testimony relating to Russell's statements constituted inadmissible hearsay. Each assertion is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   First, Doe's testimony was plainly admissible under Rule 404(b) 's exception to Rule 404(a) 's general prohibition of character evidence to prove an action in conformity therewith. Doe's testimony described Linda's efforts to recruit Doe to work as the Howards' housekeeper, and her knowledge and facilitation of Russell's repeated sexual assaults on Doe. Consistent with the permissible uses of character evidence under Rule 404(b), Doe's testimony constituted highly probative evidence regarding Linda's intentions in her interactions with Roe; the existence of a plan or pattern of behavior by the Howards toward their live-in housekeepers; and Linda's knowledge of Russell's abuse of their staff. Doe's testimony was therefore admissible under Rule 404(b)(2), which permits the introduction of evidence of \"a crime, wrong, or other act\" to show, inter alia, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, or absence of mistake. Indeed, the similarity between Doe and Roe's accounts of their abuse enhances the probative value and relevance of Doe's evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Queen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11889571\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/132/991/#p997\">\n    132 F.3d 991\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 997 (4th Cir. 1997).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because we are satisfied that Doe's testimony was properly admitted under Rule 404(b), we need not assess whether it was also admissible under Rule 415.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Nor was Doe's testimony barred by Rule 403. Pursuant to Rule 403, a court may exclude evidence if its \"probative value\" is \"substantially outweighed\" by, inter alia, the risk of \"unfair prejudice.\" As noted above, Doe's testimony provided highly probative evidence of a pattern of abusive behavior by Russell, knowingly facilitated by Linda. Moreover, because the assaults Roe suffered occurred in Yemen nearly a decade prior to Linda's trial, Doe's evidence was particularly important given the lack of available physical evidence to corroborate Roe's claims. Finally, the district court limited the scope of Doe's testimony to avoid revealing the upsetting details of Russell's past assaults, and thus reduced the risk of unfair prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Mark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1855981\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/943/444/#p449\">\n    943 F.2d 444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 449 (4th Cir. 1991). In these circumstances, the court did not abuse its discretion in permitting Doe to testify.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mohr\n   </em>\n   , 318 F.3d at 619-20 (emphasizing that Rule 403 only requires exclusion of evidence resulting in unfair prejudice that \"\n   <em>\n    substantially\n   </em>\n   \" outweighs its probative value);\n   <em>\n    United States v. Van Metre\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1540677\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/150/339/#p351\">\n    150 F.3d 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 351 (4th Cir. 1998) (sustaining admission of evidence of prior sexual assault in light of its \"significant probative value\" and trial court's effort to reduce its prejudicial impact).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Lastly, Doe's testimony concerning Russell's past statements was not inadmissible hearsay. Rule 804(b)(3) authorizes the admission of hearsay statements by an unavailable declarant that are manifestly against the declarant's interest. Specifically, the statement must be one that \"a reasonable person in the declarant's position would have made only if the person believed it to be true because, when made, it ... had so great a tendency ... to expose the declarant to civil or criminal liability.\" Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(3). Russell's\n   statements to Doe - admitting to his past assaults of his former employees - more than qualify as statements against interest as so defined, and his death in 2012 establishes his unavailability to testify. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by relying on that exception to admit Doe's testimony regarding Russell's incriminating statements.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Udeozor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644844\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/515/260/#p267\">\n    515 F.3d 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 267-68 (4th Cir. 2008) (evaluating flexible requirements of Rule 804(b)(3) and sustaining admission of hearsay statements that implicated declarant in multiple crimes).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In short, the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Doe's testimony, and we are satisfied to affirm the court's rulings in that regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Pursuant to the foregoing, we affirm the district court's judgment in favor of Roe and against Linda Howard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <em>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    The TVPA is generally codified at\n    <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201581\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581\n    </extracted-citation>\n    <em>\n     et seq\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    To avoid confusion, we generally refer to Linda Howard and Russell Howard by their first names, that is, simply as Linda and Russell.
