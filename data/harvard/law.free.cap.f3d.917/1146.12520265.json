At his 2017 sentencing hearing, the district court determined that Door's base offense level should be 24 pursuant to United States Sentencing Guideline (U.S.S.G.) \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) after concluding that Door's prior Washington state convictions for second-degree assault and felony harassment qualify as crimes of violence. Door contends these offenses do not constitute crimes of violence and that his offense level was thus calculated incorrectly. Consistent with\n   <em>\n    United States v. Werle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266254\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/877/879/#p884\">\n    877 F.3d 879\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 884 (9th Cir. 2017), we hold that Door's 1997 conviction for felony harassment, in violation of the Revised Code of Washington (Wash. Rev. Code) \u00a7\u00a7 9A.46.020(1)(a)(i) and (2)(b), qualifies as a crime of violence. Door's argument to the contrary disregards that the framework for the \"crime of violence\" analysis differs depending on whether the prior offense is alleged to constitute a crime of violence pursuant to the force clause, the enumerated offenses clause, or the residual clause of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). The district court did err, however, in concluding that Door's 2002 conviction for second-degree assault, in violation of Wash. Rev. Code. \u00a7 9A.36.021(1)(c), qualifies as a crime of violence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

These discoveries led to Door's indictment in 2012; he was charged with being a Felon in Possession of a Firearm, a Violent Felon in Possession of Body Armor, and a Felon in Possession of an Explosive. In 2014, a jury convicted Door of each count. Door received a 300-month sentence, but for reasons not pertinent to this appeal, we vacated Door's sentence and remanded for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On remand, the probation officer recommended a base offense level of 24 because the officer concluded that Door's prior Washington state convictions for second-degree assault and felony harassment constitute crimes of violence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) (providing that a base offense level of 24 applies \"if the defendant committed any part of the instant offense subsequent to sustaining at least two felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense\"). A total offense level of 32 and Door's criminal history category of VI yielded a guideline imprisonment range of 210 to 262 months. The probation officer recommended 276 months of imprisonment due to Door's extensive criminal history. This represented the maximum sentence for each count, served consecutively. Door argued that his prior convictions for second-degree assault and felony harassment were not \"crime[s]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   of violence\" as defined in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, and thus his base offense level should only be 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the resentencing hearing held in 2017, the district court ruled that Door's prior convictions for second-degree assault and felony harassment qualified as crimes of violence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2. The court concluded that Door had a total offense level of 32 and imposed a sentence of 276 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We have jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"We review de novo whether a state-law crime constitutes a crime of violence under the [Federal Sentencing] Guidelines.\"\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266542\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/933/#p941\">\n    869 F.3d at 936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   To determine whether a prior conviction qualifies as a crime of violence, we apply the categorical approach first outlined in\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

Because a conviction pursuant to Wash. Rev.

As Door's argument goes, because every Washington criminal statute incorporates aiding and abetting, all Washington criminal statutes are overbroad, and therefore\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   Washington state convictions fail to qualify as crimes of violence-an argument inspired by\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Valdivia-Flores's crime of conviction was overbroad because: (1) aiding and abetting is included in every Washington criminal statute; (2) Washington defines aiding and abetting more broadly than federal law because it merely requires knowledge, whereas federal law requires a mens rea of specific intent; and (3) accomplice and principal liability are indivisible under Washington law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1207-10. Concluding that Valdivia-Flores's prior offense did not qualify as an \"aggravated felony,\" we observed that it may be that \"no Washington state conviction can serve as an aggravated felony at all.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1209-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Door's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Valdivia-Flores\n   </em>\n   is misplaced. The categorical analysis in\n   <em>\n    Valdivia-Flores\n   </em>\n   involved comparing the elements of the Washington drug trafficking crime with the generic federal offense of drug trafficking because \"drug trafficking\" is listed in the INA as an \"aggravated felony.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1206-07. In other words, the categorical analysis employed in\n   <em>\n    Valdivia-Flores\n   </em>\n   mirrors the inquiry under the\n   <em>\n    enumerated offenses\n   </em>\n   clause of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2).\n   <em>\n    Werle\n   </em>\n   , on the other hand, held that a prior conviction for Washington felony harassment constitutes a crime of violence pursuant to the\n   <em>\n    force\n   </em>\n   clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1). Because a conviction for violating Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 9A.46.020(2)(b) necessarily entails the threatened use of violent physical force, it qualifies as a crime of violence pursuant to the force clause, and our inquiry ends there. We need not compare the elements of the crime of conviction with the elements of the generic federal crime when analyzing whether an offense qualifies as a crime of violence pursuant to the force clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a).\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Peterson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518396\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/902/1016/#p1021\">\n    902 F.3d at 1016, 1021-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Edling\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517574\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/895/1153/#p1155\">\n    895 F.3d at 1156-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Valdivia-Flores\n   </em>\n   is consistent with\n   <em>\n    Werle\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    C.
