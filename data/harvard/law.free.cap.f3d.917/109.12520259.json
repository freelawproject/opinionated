The main question before us is whether a landlord may be liable under the FHA for failing to take prompt action to address a racially hostile housing environment created by one tenant targeting another, where the landlord knew of the discriminatory conduct and had the power to correct it. In holding that a landlord may be liable in those limited circumstances, we adhere to the FHA's broad language and remedial scope and agree with the views of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\"), the agency tasked with administering the FHA. We therefore vacate the judgment of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Spatt,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   ) dismissing Donahue Francis's claims under the FHA and analogous New York State law, as well as his claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1982, and remand for further proceedings.

City of New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4308873\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/752/234/#p236\">\n    752 F.3d 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 236 (2d Cir. 2014), tell a story that remains too common today. \"Having lived in inner city urban communities during earlier parts of his life,\" and \"in search of a better housing situation,\" in 2010 Francis signed a rental lease agreement with defendant Kings Park Manor Inc. (\"KPM\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   He soon moved into an apartment unit of a complex owned by KPM and managed by co-defendant Corrine Downing (together with KPM, the \"KPM Defendants\"). After several uneventful months, Francis's next-door neighbor, Raymond Endres, began to subject Francis to what can only be described as a brazen and relentless campaign\n   of racial harassment, abuse, and threats.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The specific allegations are as follows.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint App'x 11-17. In February 2012 Francis heard Endres say \"Jews, fucking Jews,\" while standing in front of their apartments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Endres then called Francis, who is black, a \"fucking nigger.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On March 3, Endres approached Francis's open front door and said \"damn fucking Jews,\" then looked at Francis and said \"fucking asshole.\" On March 10, Francis overheard Endres and another tenant discussing Francis \"in derogatory terms.\" The following day, Endres approached Francis's open front door and repeatedly called him a \"nigger,\" then stated, \"fucking nigger, close your god-darn door, fucking lazy, god-damn fucking nigger.\" On March 20, Francis repeatedly called Francis a \"nigger\" in the parking lot of the apartment complex. By this point, Francis understandably \"felt afraid, anxious, and unwelcome.\" On May 14, Endres yelled \"fuck you\" in front of Francis's front door; the following day, Endres approached Francis, who was leaving his apartment, and said, \"keep your door closed you fucking nigger.\" On May 22, Endres told Francis, \"I oughta kill you, you fucking nigger.\" On August 10, Endres called Francis a \"fucking nigger\" and a \"black bastard.\" Finally, on September 2, 2012, Endres stood at Francis's open front door and photographed the interior of Francis's apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   From the start of Endres's several-month campaign of harassment, Francis, \"fear[ing] for his personal safety,\" contacted the police and the KPM Defendants to complain. His first call to the police on March 11 prompted Suffolk County Police Hate Crimes Unit officers to visit the KPM apartment complex, interview witnesses, and warn Endres to stop threatening Francis with racial epithets. That day Francis also filed a police report, and a police officer told the KPM Defendants about Endres's conduct. The KPM Defendants did nothing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In May 2012 Francis called the police again and filed another police report. This time, by letter dated May 23, 2012, Francis notified the KPM Defendants directly about Endres's racist conduct between March and May 2012. The letter \"report[ed] ... Endres for racial harassment, [and] for making racial slurs directly to [Francis].\" It also provided contact information for the Suffolk County police officers responsible for investigating Endres. Again, the KPM Defendants failed to do anything at all, even as little as respond to Francis's letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Endres's conduct persisted. His escalating racial threats to Francis finally prodded the Suffolk County Police Department to arrest Endres for aggravated harassment in violation of New York Penal Law \u00a7 240.30. On August 10, 2012, Francis sent a second letter. It informed the KPM Defendants that Endres continued to direct racial slurs at Francis and \"anti-semitic, derogatory slurs against Jewish people.\" It also disclosed that Endres had recently been arrested for harassment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Endres's attempt to photograph Francis's apartment on September 2 was apparently the last straw. Francis contacted the police and the following day sent the KPM Defendants a third and final letter complaining about Endres's continued harassment. After receiving the letter, KPM advised\n   Downing \"not to get involved,\" and the KPM Defendants declined to respond or follow up. As a result, Endres remained a tenant at the apartment complex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The complaint alleges that the KPM Defendants not only failed to investigate or attempt to resolve Francis's complaints of racial abuse but, to the contrary, allowed Endres to live at the complex through January 2013 without reprisal. That month, Endres's lease expired and he moved out of his apartment. A few months later, in April 2013, Endres pleaded guilty to harassment in violation of New York Penal Law \u00a7 240.26(1). That same month, the State court entered an order of protection prohibiting him from contacting Francis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In June 2014 Francis sued the KPM Defendants and Endres, claiming primarily that they violated \u00a7\u00a7 3604 and 3617 of the FHA,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Civil Rights Act of 1866,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1982, and that the KPM Defendants violated \u00a7 296(5) of the New York State Human Rights Law (\"NYSHRL\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Exec.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20296\">\n    N.Y. Exec. Law \u00a7 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5), which bars housing discrimination in New York. Francis also sued the KPM Defendants and Endres for negligent infliction of emotional distress and for violating NYSHRL \u00a7 296(6) by aiding and abetting a violation of NYSHRL \u00a7 296(5), the KPM Defendants for breach of contract and breach of the implied warranty of habitability under New York State law, and Endres for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The District Court entered a default judgment against Endres, who never appeared. The KPM Defendants moved under Rule 12(b)(6) to dismiss the claims against them for failure to state a claim. The District Court granted that motion except as to Francis's implied warranty of habitability claim, which Francis voluntarily withdrew and the District Court dismissed. The District Court then granted partial final judgment in favor of the KPM Defendants so that Francis could pursue this appeal, even though damages against Endres remained to be determined.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

In response, HUD, as amicus curiae, points us to its rules designed to clarify the law in this area and urges us to recognize certain limited claims against landlords arising out of tenant-on-tenant racial harassment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We focus on Francis's federal claims arising under \u00a7\u00a7 3604 and 3617 of the FHA and under the Civil Rights Act of 1866, as well as his New York claims arising under NYSHRL \u00a7 296 and for negligent infliction of emotional distress.

As a threshold matter, we consider whether \u00a7 3604 prohibits discrimination occurring after a plaintiff buys or rents housing. We hold that so-called \"post-acquisition\" claims are cognizable under \u00a7 3604.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Our view is rooted first in the language of the provision itself, which prohibits discrimination in the \"terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203604\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). As we describe somewhat more fully below, a number of our sister circuits have located in that text some degree of post-acquisition protection. We agree with the Seventh Circuit, for example, that the FHA's use of the terms \"privileges\" and \"conditions\" refers not just to the sale or rental itself, but to certain benefits or protections flowing from and following the sale or rental.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bloch v. Frischholz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5681768\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/587/771/#p779\">\n    587 F.3d 771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 779-80 (7th Cir. 2009) (en banc). And we agree with the analysis of the Ninth Circuit, for example, that \"[t]he inclusion of the word 'privileges' implicates continuing rights,\" indicating that the \"natural reading\" of the statute \"encompasses claims regarding services or facilities perceived to be wanting after the owner or tenant has acquired possession of the dwelling.\"\n   <em>\n    Comm. Concerning Cmty. Improvement v. City of Modesto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5757476\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/583/690/#p713\">\n    583 F.3d 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 713 (9th Cir. 2009). In other words, we rely not only on the Supreme Court's directive that we read the statute broadly, but also and more fundamentally on the statutory text itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In arriving at this interpretation, we note how closely \u00a7 3604(b) 's broad language tracks the language of Title VII, which, together with the FHA, forms part of the backbone of the coordinated congressional \"scheme of federal civil rights laws enacted to end discrimination.\"\n   <em>\n    Huntington Branch, N.A.A.C.P. v. Town of Huntington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10546645\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/844/926/#p935\">\n    844 F.2d 926\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 935 (2d Cir. 1988) (\"The [FHA and Title VII] are part of a coordinated scheme of federal civil rights laws enacted to end discrimination ....\"),\n   <em>\n    superseded by regulation on other grounds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20100.500\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7 100.500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). Section 3604(b) of the FHA provides that \"it shall be\n   <em>\n    unlawful\n   </em>\n   ... [t]o\n   <em>\n    discriminate against\n   </em>\n   any person in the\n   <em>\n    terms, conditions, or privileges\n   </em>\n   of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith,\n   <em>\n    because of race, color, religion, sex, familial status, or national origin\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203604\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (emphasis added). Title VII, enacted four years\n   before the FHA, similarly provides that \"[i]t shall be an\n   <em>\n    unlawful\n   </em>\n   employment practice for an employer ... to\n   <em>\n    discriminate against\n   </em>\n   any individual with respect to his compensation,\n   <em>\n    terms, conditions, or privileges\n   </em>\n   of employment,\n   <em>\n    because of\n   </em>\n   such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1) (emphasis added). Of course, the language in Title VII bans both pre- and post-hiring discrimination (including on-the-job racial harassment).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Rivera v.

Understanding that the analogy between the employer-employee relationship and the landlord-tenant relationship is imperfect and goes only so far, it nevertheless would be strange indeed if the nearly identical language of the FHA did not also impose liability for post-acquisition discrimination on landlords under certain circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Texas Dep't of Hous. &amp; Cmty.

HUD's amicus brief reinforces the interpretive nature of the Rule. For example, it asserts that the Rule merely \"formalizes HUD's longstanding view that, under the FHA, a housing provider may be held liable in certain circumstances for failing to address tenant-on-tenant harassment.\" HUD Amicus Br. 2. HUD also explains that the Rule \"does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   identify any new forms of liability under the FHA.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2063%2C054\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2063%2C054\">\n    at 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We have several problems with this argument. First, although both our dissenting colleague,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dissenting Op.,\n   <em>\n    post\n   </em>\n   , at 130-31, and the KPM Defendants contend that intentional discrimination is an element of an FHA violation, we have never gone quite that far. To the contrary, we have held that, \"[t]o establish a violation of the FHA, a plaintiff need not show discriminatory intent but need only prove that the challenged practice has a discriminatory effect.\"\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

Take, for example, the somewhat analogous context involving a hostile work environment claim under Title VII. Faced with such a claim, we have not required a showing of direct intentional discrimination by the employer before imposing liability. Instead, we have premised an employer's liability on the employer's actual or constructive knowledge of the non-supervisory employee's harassment and the employer's subsequent failure to act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Duch v. Jakubek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3495518\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/588/757/#p765\">\n    588 F.3d 757\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 765-66 (2d Cir. 2009). Insofar as the District Court required Francis to allege that the KPM Defendants' conduct was the result of direct, intentional racial discrimination, we conclude that this was error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Finally, even assuming that such a requirement exists, we think that Francis's complaint, viewed in the light most favorable to Francis, plausibly and adequately alleges that the KPM Defendants engaged in intentional racial discrimination. Specifically, it alleges that the KPM Defendants \"discriminat[ed] against [Francis] by tolerating and/or facilitating a hostile environment,\" even though the defendants had authority to \"counsel, discipline, or evict [Endres] due to his continued harassment of [Francis],\" and also had \"intervened against other tenants at Kings Park Manor regarding non-race-related violations of their leases or of the law.\" Joint App'x 19-20. In other words, Francis has alleged that the KPM Defendants had actual knowledge of Endres's criminal racial harassment of Francis but, because it involved race, intentionally allowed it to continue even though they had the power to end it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wetzel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518377\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/901/856/#p866\">\n    901 F.3d at 864\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accepting these allegations as true, the KPM Defendants \"subjected [Francis] to conduct that the FHA forbids.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518377\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/901/856/#p866\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It may turn out that the KPM Defendants tried but failed to respond. Or it may unfold that they were powerless to evict or otherwise deal with Endres-in which case not even a discriminatory effects test could save Francis's case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   But Francis is entitled to\n   discovery regarding at least the level of control the KPM Defendants actually exercised over tenants and whether they had the power to act to redress Endres's abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   For these reasons, we vacate the District Court's dismissal of Francis's FHA claims and remand for further proceedings relating to those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    The Civil Rights Act of 1866\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The District Court dismissed Francis's claims under the Civil Rights Act of 1866,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1982, because he failed to allege that the KPM Defendants acted with racial animus, rather than deliberate indifference. In an action under \u00a7\u00a7 1981 or 1982, a plaintiff must allege three elements: First, that the plaintiff is a member of a racial minority; second, that the defendant intended to discriminate based on the plaintiff's race; and third, that the discrimination concerned one of the enumerated statutory activities (here, to make and enforce contracts ( \u00a7 1981 ) and to lease property ( \u00a7 1982 )).\n   <em>\n    Mian v.

In this case, only the second factor is in dispute. The KPM Defendants maintain that Francis needed to allege that they intended to discriminate on the basis of race, while Francis claims that it is enough to allege their deliberate indifference to Endres's discriminatory conduct. We agree with Francis. A defendant's deliberate indifference to racial discrimination can violate \u00a7 1981,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   so long as the indifference \"was such that the defendant intended the discrimination to occur.\"\n   <em>\n    Gant ex rel.

But the case is not about the heinous conduct of horrible neighbors, nor whether to condone it. Instead, the question here is whether this Court properly construes Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, referred to as the Fair Housing Act (the \"FHA\"), to impose a duty on\n   <em>\n    landlords\n   </em>\n   to monitor and remediate the behavior of one's neighbors, on pain of incurring liability for damages and litigation costs, including attorney's fees.

Maj. Op. at 114. In concluding that the FHA\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   impose such liability, the majority purports to \"start with the statutory text.\" Maj. Op. at 116. But make no mistake. This is textual analysis in name only, performed en route to fashioning a new cause of action from a fundamentally flawed analogy to Title VII and from \"great,\" Maj.

In other words, \u00a7 3604(b), in the majority's articulation, provides \"a blanket 'privilege' to be free from all discrimination from any source\" when such discrimination affects residential enjoyment.\n   <em>\n    Bloch v.

Op. at 117. But unlike Title VII, which provides a cause of action against specified\n   <em>\n    employers\n   </em>\n   who discriminate, the FHA does not identify a class of potential defendants who can be charged-so that not only landlords, but also public housing authorities, cooperative boards, block associations, real estate agents, or, indeed,\n   <em>\n    anyone\n   </em>\n   , is potentially liable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   With this limitless list of potential defendants in mind, the full import of the majority's approach becomes clear. Agreeing with the Ninth Circuit, the majority construes the phrase \"privileges of sale or rental\" in \u00a7 3604(b) to encompass claims regarding\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   \" 'services or facilities perceived to be wanting after the owner or tenant has acquired possession of the dwelling' \"-regardless whether such services or facilities have any connection with the rental or sale.

In\n   <em>\n    Modesto\n   </em>\n   , on which the majority relies, this approach produced the holding that a plaintiff may pursue a \u00a7 3604(b) claim alleging discrimination by a local government in the provision of law enforcement protection to homeowners or renters, notwithstanding the lack of any connection to a residence's sale or lease.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Modesto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5757476\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/583/690/#p713\">\n    583 F.3d at 713-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   But \u00a7 3604(b) simply does not have the vague and expansive scope that the majority's (and the Ninth Circuit's) interpretation affords it.

Section 3604(b) 's prohibition on discrimination in the \"terms, conditions, or privileges of ... rental\" is thus most reasonably read to refer to discrimination in the terms, conditions, and privileges of the\n   <em>\n    rental arrangement\n   </em>\n   -a construction that has\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   post-acquisition application, but that still ties potential liability to discrimination regarding the commitments made and benefits afforded in connection with the rental itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   To be clear, \u00a7 3604(b) prohibits discrimination in the \"terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling,\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith ....\" (emphasis added). But this doesn't change the analysis. The Fifth Circuit has recognized as much, holding that the prohibition on discrimination in \"the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith\" applies specifically to \"\n   <em>\n    the sale or rental\n   </em>\n   of [the] dwelling,\" rather than to the dwelling generally.\n   <em>\n    Cox v.

But \"privileges of sale or rental,\" like \"terms and conditions,\" requires a connection with the sale or rental, so that not\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   impairments of a person's post-acquisition enjoyment of residence are sufficiently connected to the sale or rental to trigger \u00a7 3604(b).

This is not a usual \"term, condition, or privilege\" of a lease. But after today, that no longer matters. The majority joins the Ninth Circuit in eliminating any required connection between the \"terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental\" and the sale or rental itself, placing this Court on the wrong side of the significant circuit split as to \u00a7 3604 's post-acquisition reach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Nor do the majority's textual problems end with \u00a7 3604(b).

A landlord cannot temporarily evict a tenant or force all tenants to undergo harassment training and provide information about each other's behavior. And while an employer can transfer a problematic employee, a landlord cannot move tenants around different building units in similar fashion. Furthermore, even if landlords\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   develop a roster of such intermediate steps and penalties, we might question whether Congress sought to import such a system into the housing context, without a word as to the due process principles that such a system might implicate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The majority ignores these concerns by asserting that landlords control residential complexes, just as employers control workplaces,\n   because landlords retain the power to evict tenants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at 122-23. Granted, the majority pays lip service to the notion that determining whether any particular landlord has sufficient control over tenant behavior to impose liability will be a \"fact-dependent inquiry.\" Maj. Op. at 122. But it concludes by suggesting, again with reference to the HUD Rule, that \"housing providers ordinarily have a range of mechanisms at their disposal to correct discriminatory tenant-on-tenant harassment, such as 'issuing and enforcing notices to quit,\n   <em>\n    issuing threats of eviction and, if necessary enforcing evictions,\n   </em>\n   ' all of which are 'powerful tools.' \" Maj.

In other words, while the majority's liability rule may ostensibly require a \"fact-dependent inquiry,\" the landlord, by virtue of the power to evict, will \"ordinarily\" lose.

Perhaps the degree of control exercised by a landlord in cases such as\n   <em>\n    Wetzel\n   </em>\n   , where the landlord was responsible for the provision of daily meals and the maintenance of community spaces in a senior living facility, differs in kind from the typical case. Perhaps not. The allegations in the present complaint, however, at least as they relate to the landlord-tenant relationship, are typical in all respects. And as New York courts have confirmed, the power to evict is too blunt and unwieldy an instrument to support the conclusion that landlords are in a position to prevent one tenant's harassment of another, so that liability for the failure to do so may properly be imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The instant complaint provides a good example of the difficult questions that go unaddressed in the majority's rush to recognize this new cause of action. According to its allegations, the plaintiff, having already notified the police of his neighbor's outrageous conduct, did not notify the management company of the harassment until almost three months after the first incident occurred and two months after the plaintiff renewed his lease. Moreover, he did not request the company's assistance even at that time. Nor does the complaint suggest that the police investigation had been discontinued or was ineffective. So when, precisely, did the landlord stand in breach of a duty to act, even assuming such a duty existed? Notably, the management company declined to renew the harassing tenant's lease when it came up for renewal in the aftermath of his bad behavior, which by that point had resulted in his arrest. Does failure to renew a lease constitute \"prompt\" remedial action? Courts will be grappling with such questions for years to come.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The majority dismisses such concerns offhand as a \"parade of horribles.\" Maj. Op. at 121-22. Make no mistake, however: these issues will be unavoidable for those whom this decision affects. Judge Posner\n   was correct in noting that Congress did not contemplate the problem of harassment by \"neighbors\" when it enacted the FHA and that if it had addressed this problem, the most \"careful drafting\" would have been required.\n   <em>\n    Halprin,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9147770\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/388/327/#p329\">\n    388 F.3d at 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
