The district court found that it lacked jurisdiction over the claim because Congress had not waived sovereign immunity for suits under FCRA. It is settled law that a waiver of sovereign immunity must be unambiguous and unequivocal. Because the purported waiver here falls well short of that standard, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This appeal arises from Robinson's claims against the Big Three credit reporting agencies-Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion-the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency, and the U.S. Department of Education. The suit related to their treatment of an allegedly fraudulent student loan in Robinson's name. As all claims against the nonfederal defendants have now run their course, only Robinson's FCRA claims against the Department of Education remain on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Department administers the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program, through which it provides loans to students and parents for postsecondary education costs. Robinson's complaint detailed how the Department of Education \"directly or indirectly causes credit information to be furnished to ... consumer reporting agencies.\" J.A. 13, \u00b6 7 (Amended Complaint). Robinson alleged that he \"discovered that there were Direct Loan student loan accounts being reported to his Experian, Equifax, and Trans Union credit reports,\" J.A. 14, \u00b6 8, even though he did not \"authorize a student loan account to be opened in his name,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. Appellant asserted that he \"has been disputing the Direct Loan accounts,\" \"[s]ince November 2011 or earlier.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10; see also J.A. 14-15, \u00b6\u00b6 11-14. In this action, he alleged that the Department violated FCRA, specifically 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681s-2(b), \"by failing to fully and properly investigate [Appellant's] disputes,\" J.A. 17, \u00b6 27, and \"failing to review all relevant information\" related to his claim,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. The complaint brought claims under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681n and 1681o, which provide civil causes of action for willful and negligent FCRA violations, respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Department filed a motion to dismiss for want of subject matter jurisdiction based on sovereign immunity. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1). After comparing FCRA's language to several recognized waivers of sovereign immunity, the district court reasoned that FCRA's language did not unequivocally and unambiguously waive sovereign immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.

Damages suits against the United States, as with any litigant, may incentivize good behavior or appropriately compensate those who have been harmed.

Sovereign immunity, in short, can only be waived by statutory text that is unambiguous and unequivocal.

Robinson contends that his claims were wrongly dismissed because the United States has indeed waived sovereign immunity to civil actions under FCRA's general liability provisions. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681n - 1681o. The plaintiff bears the burden of showing that the government has waived sovereign immunity at the motion to dismiss stage.\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

Robinson claims the Department violated a provision that requires it, after being notified that a consumer disputes information relating to his credit, to \"conduct an investigation with respect to the disputed information.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681s-2(b)(1)(A). FCRA \u00a7 1681o provides that \"[a]ny person who is negligent in failing to comply with any requirement imposed under this subchapter with respect to any consumer is liable to that consumer\" for actual damages, costs, and attorney's fees. For its part, \u00a7 1681n applies to willful FCRA violations, and adds punitive damages to the remedies for negligent violations under \u00a7 1681o. District courts have jurisdiction over any timely action properly brought under either provision. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681p.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This case centers on the meaning of the word \"person\" in \u00a7 1681n and \u00a7 1681o, specifically whether the federal government is a \"person\" for purposes of FCRA's general civil liability provisions. We begin our inquiry, as always, with the text of the statute. See\n   <em>\n    Clark v. Absolute Collection Serv., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3898399\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/741/487/#p489\">\n    741 F.3d 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 489 (4th Cir. 2014). Robinson attempts to isolate FCRA's definitional and civil liability provisions from the rest of the statute in arguing that FCRA's text is straightforward. FCRA's causes of action for willful and negligent violations apply to any \"person.\" See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681n - 1681o. The statute itself defines \"person\" to include \"any individual, partnership, corporation, trust, estate, cooperative, association, government or governmental subdivision or agency, or other entity.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681a(b). Since the federal government is a government, any government is a person, and as any person can be liable, so his argument goes, the federal government can be liable for FCRA violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   But we do not interpret the word \"person\" on a blank slate.

This is hardly evidence of an unequivocal intent to waive federal sovereign immunity in the same way as statutes that specifically describe actions against the \"United States.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   There is, however, one explicit waiver of sovereign immunity elsewhere in FCRA that does not apply to Robinson's claims. Section 1681u empowers the Federal Bureau of Investigation to obtain information from consumer reporting agencies in connection with its counterterrorism efforts. This section includes a clear waiver: \"Any agency or department of the United States obtaining or disclosing any consumer reports, records, or information contained therein in violation of [\u00a7 1681u] is liable to\n   the consumer to whom such consumer reports, records, or information relate\" for statutory, actual, and sometimes punitive damages. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681u(j).

The stark contrasts between FCRA's civil liability provisions and recognized waivers serve as strong evidence that Congress did not waive sovereign immunity under FCRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Indeed, in the universe of possible waivers, this would be a very casual one. Yet the consequences of waiving immunity under FCRA's general liability provisions are anything but casual: the federal government is the nation's largest employer and lender. The Department represents that \"[i]n fiscal year 2017, for example, the delinquent non-tax debt owed to the federal government totaled $185 billion.\" Brief for Appellee, at 23. It notes that federal agencies sometimes are required by law to report delinquent debts to the consumer reporting agencies. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1080a. Each report, of course, would give rise to potential liability under FCRA.

Robinson points out that other courts, upon finding waiver under FCRA, have dismissed this problem because a prosecution could be brought against federal employees.

But, adopting Robinson's reading\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , the statute allows prosecution of \"any government,\" not\n   <em>\n    the employees of\n   </em>\n   any government. The pro-waiver camp cannot have it both ways-literal most often, just not when it suits to blur the lines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   FCRA also empowers several federal agencies to enforce its various provisions, including, most notably, the Federal Trade Commission and the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681s(a)(1) (FTC enforcement), \u00a7 1681s(b)(1)(H) (CFPB enforcement). If the prospect of the CFPB pursuing a civil action against the United States is any less odd than a criminal prosecution of the United States, it is not by much. To make matters worse, states also play a role in enforcing FCRA's various provisions. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681s(c). It would be anomalous for the federal government to expose its fisc to the suits of state attorneys general in such an offhanded manner. And once again, FCRA litigants under plaintiff's reading could even pursue punitive damages against the federal government, see 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681n, which would trample yet another presumption, this time \"against imposition of punitive damages on governmental entities.\"\n   <em>\n    Vt.

Robinson would therefore have us suppose that Congress, in an insurrectionary moment, set out to defy a prominent Supreme Court ruling that held Congress lacked the very authority Robinson now asserts it exercised. On a broader level, Robinson would have FCRA expose not only the United States but foreign, tribal, and state governments to punitive damages, criminal penalties, and an array of other monetary sanctions for activities \"in which governments are uniquely involved on a massive scale.\" Brief for Appellee, at 30. To read these broad and staggering implications into the statute on the slimmest of textual hints would be to abjure our duty to construe \"the statutory language with that conservatism which is appropriate in the case of a waiver of sovereign immunity.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But the substantive and enforcement provisions in FCRA are not one and the same. All of the problems discussed above relate to the statute's enforcement provisions. And Robinson's argument does not even begin to account for the untoward consequences of,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , reading the statute's enforcement provisions to set the federal government in courts of law against itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Moreover, just as the ordinary meaning of \"person\" has always applied to FCRA's enforcement provisions, the statutory definition of \"person\" has always applied to FCRA's substantive provisions. To take but one example, FCRA \u00a7 604(3)(D) specifically provided that consumer reporting agencies could give information to a \"person\" for \"a determination of the consumer's eligibility for a license or other benefit granted by a governmental instrumentality required by law to consider an applicant's financial responsibility or status.\" Fair Credit Reporting Act, Pub.

Who, other than a government, would be required by law to use credit information to determine eligibility for government benefits? Our reading of the word \"person\" thus does not create a textual anomaly, but rather reflects a holistic statutory view that undermines Robinson's attempt to transport the meaning of \"person\" from FCRA's substantive measures to its enforcement provisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Both parties also raise arguments by analogizing FCRA's statutory scheme to that of other federal statutes, drawing on its general purposes, and plucking out various tidbits from its legislative history. But we do not rest our opinion on those bases. We think that these arguments, at best, are of decidedly marginal relevance and secondary importance. FCRA's text and structure make clear that no unambiguous and unequivocal waiver of sovereign immunity has taken place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The parties debate extensively several cases from other circuits addressing this issue. The Ninth Circuit, for example, adopted a reading of the statute similar to our own.

Reading \"any government\" to allow suits against tribes, in the view of\n   <em>\n    Meyers\n   </em>\n   , would be \"shoehorning\" a tribal immunity waiver where it failed utterly to fit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355123,12173310\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/818/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355123,12173310\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/818/\">\n    at 827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"But when it comes to\n   sovereign immunity, shoehorning is precisely what we cannot do.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355123,12173310\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/818/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As the Ninth Circuit recognized in\n   <em>\n    Daniel\n   </em>\n   , the Seventh Circuit's logic regarding tribal sovereign immunity should apply equally to the United States.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12517142\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/891/762/#p772\">\n    891 F.3d at 774\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court dismissing this case for want of subject matter jurisdiction is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
