Since that time, the Supreme Court has issued a number of opinions recasting the role the Guidelines play in a district court's sentencing decision. We conclude that none of these decisions affect\n   <em>\n    Goodell\n   </em>\n   . In holding once more that the strict-liability enhancement of \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4) of the Sentencing Guidelines is constitutional, we join all ten of the other regional circuit courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   David Prien-Pinto was convicted in Montana state court in 2014 of felony assault on a peace officer and burglary and sentenced to a term in state prison. He was released on parole in March 2016. After his release, a confidential source alerted a joint task force of federal and local law enforcement officers that Prien-Pinto was selling narcotics out of his home in Missoula. In September 2016, officers raided the home and arrested Prien-Pinto on marijuana and methamphetamine charges. Shortly after, Prien-Pinto's wife reported to local police that she had hidden a Taurus Model 94 .22 caliber revolver (\"the firearm\") at Prien-Pinto's instruction. Prien-Pinto admitted to possessing the firearm and told police that a friend had given him the firearm as payment for a marijuana debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Police traced the firearm's serial number and determined that it had been stolen the previous summer from its owner in Kalispell, about 120 miles north of Missoula. The owner identified the firearm and told police it had been taken from the glove compartment of his vehicle during a break-in. The owner denied knowing Prien-Pinto.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Montana authorities held Prien-Pinto on a parole violation. He has remained in state custody since his arrest, serving a prison sentence on various state charges. In August 2017, a federal grand jury indicted Prien-Pinto on one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). He pleaded guilty, without a plea agreement, in November 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The district court sentenced Prien-Pinto to 36 months' imprisonment: 18 months to be served concurrently to his Montana state sentence, and 18 months to be served consecutively in federal custody. In calculating Prien-Pinto's Guidelines offense level, the district court applied a two-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4) because Prien-Pinto's crime involved a stolen firearm. Prien-Pinto objected to this enhancement, arguing that nothing in the record suggested he knew the firearm was stolen and that application of the enhancement without a mens rea would violate his Fifth Amendment rights, or alternatively, the federal statutes criminalizing possession of a stolen firearm. The district court noted that \"the facts are pretty compelling that Mr. Prien-Pinto did not have any knowledge that this firearm had been stolen.\" However, it held that Application Note 8(B) in the Commentary following \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4) -which provides that the enhancement applies \"regardless of whether the defendant knew or had reason to believe that the firearm was stolen\"-was \"not ambiguous.\" It thus applied the enhancement but invited us, on the record, to review the constitutionality of \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4) and the Application Note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The constitutionality of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)'s strict-liability enhancement\n   is the only issue before us on appeal. We review a claim that the Sentencing Guidelines are unconstitutional de novo.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Section 2K2.1 provides the offense levels for crimes like Prien-Pinto's, which involve unlawful receipt, possession, or transportation of firearms. Paragraph (b) provides a number of enhancements that increase the base offense level for firearm crimes, including this provision in subparagraph (4): \"If any firearm (A) was stolen, increase by 2 levels; or (B) had an altered or obliterated serial number, increase by 4 levels.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4). In the Commentary section following \u00a7 2K2.1, Application Note 8(B) provides: \"Knowledge or Reason to Believe.-Subsection (b)(4) applies regardless of whether the defendant knew or had reason to believe that the firearm was stolen or had an altered or obliterated serial number.\" U.S.S.G \u00a7 2K2.1, App. Note 8(B). In other words, this Application Note directs courts to apply \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)'s enhancements on a strict liability basis and not to read a mens rea requirement into the text of the provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Application Notes are not formally part of the Guidelines, but serve to \"interpret[ ]\" and \"explain[ ]\" the Guidelines for district courts.\n   <em>\n    Stinson v.

The Court also analogized the Sentencing Commission's use of Application Notes to an agency's interpretation of its own legislative rules, and thus directed courts to apply Application Notes with the same force as other such interpretations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11850\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/36/#p38\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11850\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/36/#p38\">\n    at 44-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11850\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/36/#p38\">\n    113 S.Ct. 1913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

He first argues that the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   overruled\n   <em>\n    Stinson\n   </em>\n   , and-apparently-all other pre-\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   decisions about the constitutionality of the Guidelines, including\n   <em>\n    Goodell\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Stinson\n   </em>\n   's holding that the Application Notes carry authority akin to an agency's interpretation of its legislative rules, he avers, is now incorrect, and courts would thus violate the Administrative Procedure Act by giving the Application Notes the force of law because they are not promulgated through notice-and-comment rulemaking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   This argument misunderstands the case law. We relied upon neither\n   <em>\n    Stinson\n   </em>\n   nor the Application Notes in deciding in\n   <em>\n    Goodell\n   </em>\n   that the stolen-firearm enhancement does not carry a mens rea; rather, we based that holding on the text of \u00a7 2K2.1(b) alone. Thus, an overruling of\n   <em>\n    Stinson\n   </em>\n   would not abrogate our holding in\n   <em>\n    Goodell\n   </em>\n   . Moreover,\n   <em>\n    Stinson\n   </em>\n   has not been overruled.

App'x 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 309 (10th Cir. 2009) (\"We like other circuits have long and unanimously held that Section 2K2.1(b)(4) lacks a scienter requirement.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We join the unanimous ranks of these ten circuits and decline to reverse our longstanding precedent. We fail to understand how the Supreme Court's Sixth Amendment jurisprudence requiring that all facts leading to a sentence enhancement beyond the statutory maximum be proven to a jury overrules the long-settled position that the Fifth Amendment permits a sentencing enhancement for possession of a stolen firearm to apply on a strict-liability basis. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    The government did not appeal\n    <em>\n     Handy\n    </em>\n    to the Second Circuit; thus, that court did not have an opportunity to directly review the decision.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
