(describing the same,) excepting thereout, a lot where the dwelling-house now stands, and a front opposite thereto in the river; also, excepting two lots, at the place called <em>Ose Kraal, </em>adjoining the said creek ; and excepting one other lot, wherever the said <em>A, Ten </em>Eyck, and <em>P. Ten Eyck </em>choose it, before it shall be disposed of, along the said street of <em>Ose Kraal; </em>all which lots so excepted, the said <em>D. M'-Carty </em>shall have nothing to do with, further than to lay them out regularly with the others,&amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b56-3\"><em>D. G. Van Antwerp, </em>a witness for the plaintiff, testified that <em>A. </em>and <em>P. Ten Eyck </em>demised the old stone-house at <em>Coeyman\u2019s </em>landing, with the premises in question, to one <em>M. B. Langdon, </em>who took possession thereof, under the demise, several years prior to the possession of the defendant. That the land along the river, including the premises in question, were laid out into five water-1,ots, of the breadth of forty feet each, by <em>McCarty, </em>after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>the power was executed to <em>him; </em>that the lots are adjoining each other, and partly in front of the house, which is fifty feet wide, &amp;c. that <em>McCarty </em>had a map made of the lands comprised in the power, on which the whole was laid out into lots and streets ; that when the power was executed, he understood that the excepted lot, in front of the house, was to be of the breadth of the house, but did not recollect any specific agreement on that subject.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-3\">The plaintiff then gave in evidence a release from <em>A, </em>and <em>P. Ten </em>Eyck, by M'-Carty, as their attorney, to <em>D. G, Van </em>Antwerp, dated the 26th of July, 1796, for the whole of the land comprised in the power, for the consideration of 1,200 pounds; and also a reconveyance of the same premises, dated the 30th of July, 1796, from <em>D. G. Van Antwerp </em>to <em>M'-Carty </em>the lessor, for the consideration of 100 pounds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-4\">On being re-examined, <em>D. G. Van Antwerp </em>testified, that the conveyance to him by M'-Carty, was without any actual consideration, paid by him, and for the purpose of transferring the title to the lessor, in consequence of his apprehending that <em>A. </em>and <em>P. Ten Eyck </em>were about to revoke their power to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-5\">On this evidence, the defendant\u2019s counsel moved for a nonsuit, which was denied by the judge,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-6\"><em>M. B, Langdon </em>testified, that while in possession of the lease of the house, &amp;c. under a lease from <em>A. </em>and <em>P. Ten </em>Eyck, he took a lease of the premises from the lessor ; and that a few days afterwards, at the request of the lessor, he gave up the lease, which was destroyed j and the reason assigned was, that if the lease was not given up, the witness might be liable to an action by <em>A* </em>and <em>P. Ten </em>Eyck, and that he remained in possession, under the lease from them, until the end of his term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b57-7\">The defendant, pursuant to a notice for that purpose, palled on the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to produce the map of the survey, apd allotment of the premises, described in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>the <em>power; </em>but it was not produced ; and under the direction of the judge, the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-7\">A motion was made to set aside the verdict, as against law and evidence, and for the misdirection of the judge.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b58-10\"><em>Van </em>Vechten, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9\">The lessor of the plaintiff must make out a good title against the tenant in possession. The conveyance to <em>Van Antwerp </em>was fraudulent and void; and a good title can never be derived from a fraudulent act. The conveyance was in direct contradiction to the power of attorney from <em>A. </em>and <em>P. Ten </em>Eyck, the object of which was to have the land laid out into lots, and the lots separately sold. The power \u2019 also contained an express right of revocation; and it appears from the testimony of <em>Van </em>Antwerp, that the conveyance of the whole to him, was made to prevent any revocation. A deed originating in fraud is void, and will not support an action of ejectment even against a stranger.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Again, as the plaintiff\u2019s title is under a power, he must show that the power has been strictly pursued, otherwise the title must fail. Strangers were bound to take notice of this power, because it was an essential ingredient in the title. The conveyance to the attorney himself, was contrary to the express object of -the power.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b58-11\">Henry, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AL4\">The objections to the plaintiff\u2019s title are made by a stranger, having no privity whatever with the persons under whom the lessor claims. If the deed to <em>Van Antrverp </em>was in pursuance of the power, it is valid. If there is a breach of <em>trust </em>in the attorney, this court cannot take cognisance of it. This court looks only to the <em>legal </em>title. The power authorised the lessor to sell by lots ; but so as the whole should bring 1,200 pounds. Now if one person was willing to purchase the-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>\u25a0whole for 1,200 pounds, a sale to him wouldbe within the power. The owners were satisfied, if they obtained that sum. No fraud can be inferred from the fact of a sale of the whole for the sum of 1,200 pounds. The circumstances of the case afford no evidence that <em>A. </em>and <em>P. Ten Eyck </em>xvere defrauded.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b58-1\"> <em>Runn. 117. 2 Term Rep. </em>749. Cowp. 129.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b59-3\">Thompson, j.</author>\n<p id=\"AsI\">delivered the opinion of the court. Whether the conveyance given by <em>MiCarty </em>to <em>Van </em>Ant<em>tverp </em>was absolutely void, appears to be the material question in this case. If it was void, the plaintiff according to his oxvn shoxving would have no title, and, of course, no right to recover, although no privity be shoxvn between the defendant and the <em>Ten Eycks. </em>I do not see hoxv this deed can be said to be void. It is not so upon the face of it; nor does it appear to be made in violation of any statutory provision, or repugnant to any common laxv principles, so as to authorise the court to pronounce it, <em>ipso </em>facto, void. Whether the lessor of the plaintiff xvas chargeable with a breach of trust, in the sale to <em>Van </em>Antwerp, is not an inquiry of xvhich the defendant can avail himself; no privity xvhatever being shown between him and the <em>Ten Eycks. </em>But it is by no means clear, that there xvas even a breach of trust. The general object of the <em>Ten Eycks </em>appears to have been to have the land laid out in _ town-lots, and sold as such. Their agent, hoxvever, was not limited in this respect. The only limitation contained in the power was not to sell any lot for a less price than a proportionate share of 1,200 pounds, for the xvhole tract. The consideration for xvhich the whole tract was sold was 1,200 pounds. And had it been sold in lots it is not pretended but that the authority would have been strictly pursued. But, admitting that the agent exceeded his authority, the principals may have been satisfied xvith the sale, and may have subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>ratified and confirmed <em>it; </em>and it would be going great lengths to permit a stranger to disaffirm it. Although it is a well settled rule in equity, that a trustee, or agent to sell, shall not become himself a purchaser; yet it is not a matter of course for the court of chancery to interfere, and set aside the purchase, as against the agent <em>himself; </em>the purchase shall stand, if the <em>cestui que trust </em>chooses to agree to the sale. (1 <em>Caines\u2019s Cases in Error, </em>19,20.) The doctrine in equity on this subject shows how improper it would be for a court of law to inter* fere, in the first instance, between the agent and a stranger, and set aside the purchase, as absolutely void.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">It was suggested, though not much pressed on the ar* gument, that the power of attorney did not extend to the premises in question ; but that they fell among the excepted lots j the evidence in the case does not appear t\u00ae me to warrant this conclusion. At all events, it was a question of location, and if relied upon, ought to have been submitted to the jury. No claim of this kind appears to have been made upon the trial. We are, accordingly, of opinion, that the motion for a new trial must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">Rule refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
