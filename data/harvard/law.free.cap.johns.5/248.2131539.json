The note was dated the ?th <em>July, </em>180?, and made by <em>Burton Hammond, </em>whereby he promised to- pay the defendant or order, 909 dollars and <em>SO </em>cents, twelve months after the date of the note, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-13\">The declaration was in the usual form, and stated the presentment of the note to the .maker, and demand and refusal of payment on the 10th <em>July, </em>1808, and added, \u201c of all which premises the said defendant, afterwards, to wit, on the same day and year last aforesaid, had notice.\u201d The defendant pleaded <em>non assumpsit.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-14\">The cause was tried at the <em>Albany </em>circuit in <em>October, </em>1809, before Mr. justice <em>Spencer.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-15\">The note was produced and proved at the trial. The attorney of the plaintiff, testified that the 10th July, 1808, being the last day of grace, was <em>Sunday, </em>and that on <em>Monday </em>the 11th <em>July, </em>between 11 and 12 o\u2019clock in the evening, payment was demanded of the maker, which was refused; and on <em>Tuesday </em>the 12th <em>July, </em>he called on the defendant and informed him of the nonpayment by the maker, and that the plaintiff looked to the defendant for payment. The defendant was told, at the same time, that the demand of the maker and notice to him as endorsor were irregular, as to time, but the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>defendant agreed to consider the demand and notice as made in due time, and himself liable as endorser. Though the defendant was not precisely informed that he was not holden, yet he was given to understand that he was not responsible as endorsor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-4\">A motion was made for a nonsuit, which was overruled, and the jury, under the direction of the judge, found a verdict for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-5\">A motion was made to set aside the verdict and for a new trial, for the misdirection of the judge; and also on the ground of newly discovered evidence.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMm\">delivered the opinion of the court. We are of opinion that the testimony of <em>Aikin, </em>as given at the trial, was sufficient to support the verdict. The rule is now settled, that if an endorsor has not had regular notice of non-payment by the drawer; yet if with knowledge of that fact, he makes a subsequent promise to pay, it is a waiver of the want of due notice, and <em>assumpsit </em>will lie. (2 <em>Term Rep. </em>713. <em>Stra. </em>1246. 6 <em>East, </em>16. <em>Hopes </em>v. <em>Alder, note. </em>7 <em>East, </em>231. 236, <em>note. Whitaker </em>v. <em>Morris, Esp.

All this was made out by the testimony of <em>Aikin, </em>and the motion for a new trial is founded on affidavits which go to impeach the credit of his testimony. But this ought not to be permitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>and the case of <em>Huish </em>v. <em>Shelden, (Sayer, 27.) </em>is strongly to the point. That was a motion for a new trial, on an affidavit impeaching the testimony of a material witness, and the court denied the motion, and said, that it would be productive of the most dangerous consequences, if a verdict should be set aside, because a witness had made a mistake in giving his evidence. The same attempt was before made in the time of Lord <em>Holt, </em>in the case of <em>Ford v. Tilly, </em>(2 <em>Salk. </em>653.) and equally failed; the court observing, that a new trial is not granted, because the defendant came not prepared. The cases in this court are to the same effect. In <em>Bunn </em>v. <em>Hoyt, </em>(3 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>256.) the court said that a verdict is never get aside to give the party an opportunity of impeaching the credit of witnesses sworn at a former trial; and the same doctrine was held in the case of <em>Shumway </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>at the last <em>August </em>term.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> There is the stronger reason for the application of the rule in this case, as it appears that the witness alluded to is since dead, and therefore the opportunity for explaining his testimony is for ever lost. The case of <em>Fabrilius </em>v. <em>Cock, </em>(3 <em>Burr. </em>1771.) was an extreme case not to be governed by ordinary rules. The demand and recovery there, was for the enormous sum of 2,400/. sterling; and the defendant, afterwards, discovered proof to detect the whole demand being founded in fiction, supported by perjury. That was a case of newly discovered testimony. Here the motion is founded wholly upon subsequent conversations with the witness, showing his testimony was not accurately given. It comes fully within the case in <em>Sayer, </em>and it does not appear to be a case justifying a departure from ordinary precedents. The motion ought to be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">Motion denied,.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AhH\"> 4 <em>Johns. Rep. 425.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
