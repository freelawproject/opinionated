Cheriot, about that time, became insolvent, and executed the assignment for the purpose of securing the creditors therein mentioned. JHe was, at the same time, indebted to <em>Van </em>Wyck, to the amount of the demand, for which the judgment was afterwards obtained. All the property specified in the assingment was stored in three stores, occupied by <em>Cheriot, </em>excepting the vessels and cargoes abroad, and excepting the sugars in question. At the time of executing the assignment, <em>Cheriot </em>delivered to the plaintiffs the <em>keys </em>of his Stores, and <em>Behring\u2019s </em>receipt for the sugars. On the 7th of <em>May, </em>1808, the plaintiffs called on <em>Behring, </em>to give him notice of the assignment, and to take a new receipt, which was given, as above mentioned. Immediately after giving this receipt, on returning to his counting-house, he found a letter from the defendant, saying he had levied on the sugar <em>; </em>and it was admitted, that such levy had been made, while <em>Sebring </em>was absent from his store, for the purpose of giving the receipt to the plaintiffs. The execution was issued on the 6th of <em>May.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-9\">On the arrival of one of the vessels from abroad, mentioned in the schedule annexed to the assignment, the manifest was dated 15th <em>July, </em>1808, and made out by the master, in the names of <em>Wilkes </em>and <em>Cheriot; </em>and on the 1st <em>o\u00ed February, </em>1808, the policy of insurance against fire was effected in the name of <em>Wilkes, Fontaine </em>and <em>Cheriot, </em>on the property assigned, and the premium was paid by <em>Cheriot.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>The jury found a verdict for the plaintiffs for 1,131 dollars and <em>17 </em>cents.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b352-10\">Hoffman, for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUF\">I can only anticipate and answer such objections as may be made on the other side.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-11\">1. That the assignment was fraudulent and void, because it assigned the whole property of the debtor to a particular creditor. If, however, the language of the assignment is duly considered, it will be found to be no more than an assignment of the goods specifically enumerated in the schedule. But admitting it to be an assignment of all the property of Cheviot, I am yet to learn that a debtor may not, <em>bona fide, </em>transfer all his property to a particular creditor, in payment of an individual debt, provided possession is also delivered. The statute of frauds, or the statute of <em>Elizabeth, </em>does not reach this case.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> It is not a case of bankruptcy, nor within the spirit of the bankrupt law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-12\">2. That there was such a resulting trust, or interest remaining in <em>Cheviot, </em>that it may be taken in execution. But I answer, that where goods are delivered to a trustee, under an assignment, they cannot be taken by execution in the hands of the trustee.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-13\">3. Then was there a delivery of the property to the plaintiffs in this case ? This is the only point in the <em>cause; </em>but the question, what is a delivery of goods, has been so often discussed in this court, that it is necessary only to refet to some of the cases decided.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-14\">When <em>Cheviot </em>parted with the receipt, he parted with his dominion over the goods, for <em>Sebving </em>would not deliver them, unless on the production of his receipt.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark> It may be said, perhaps, that the plaintiffs should have given <em>notice </em>to <em>Sebving, </em>of the assignment and delivery of the receipt to them. The want of notice might, perhaps, excuse <em>Sebving </em>for delivering the goods to a third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>person; but it is a circumstance of which the other r .. , , creditors cannot avail themselves.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b353-7\"><em>D. B. Ogden </em>and Slosson, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AuWE\">1. It is true that one creditor may be, <em>bona fide, </em>preferred to others ; but the cases of this kind were those in which specific property was assigned to the particular creditor. In the present case, there is an assignment of <em>all </em>the property of the debtor; for though a schedule is referred to, yet if he possessed any article not contained in the schedule, the words of the assignment are broad enough to comprehend it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b353-10\">It is admitted that such an assignment would be void, under the bankrupt law of <em>England.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It follows, we contend, that it must be also void, under the statute of frauds. By the statute of <em>James </em>I. c. 15. \u00a7 2. a fraudulent conveyance, made with intent to defeat or delay creditors, is declared to be an act of bankruptcy. By the act of the 13th <em>Eliz. </em>c. <em>5. \u00a7 </em>2. made perpetual by the act of the 29th <em>Eliz. </em>c. <em>5. all </em>conveyances, with intent to delay,hinder, or defraud creditors, are declared void. The bankrupt law, therefore, declared that such a conveyance as would be fraudulent, by the statute of frauds, shall amount to an act of bankruptcy. If, then, this assignment would be an act of bankruptcy in England, it follows, that it is void under the statute of frauds ; for the bankrupt law merely adds to the provisions of that statute, by declaring such fraudulent conveyances to be acts of bankruptcy, <footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> The words in the two statutes are the same. Though every transfer of property from a debtor to his creditor, is not a fraud, or an act of bankruptcy <em>\u2022, </em>yet if done by <em>deed, </em>it is void, and an act of bankruptcy.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b353-12\"><em>Cheriot </em>was insolvent, and indebted to the judgment creditor, when he made this assignment. He transferred the whole of his substance to the plaintiffs, without any value being fixed, by which it could appear, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>there was enough to pay all his creditors. Since the time of <em>Twine's </em>case,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> such a conveyance, by a debtor, in such circumstances, has been held to be fraudulent. If there is a trust reserved to the grantor in the conveyance, it is, <em>ipso facto, </em>void. A gift or <em>trust, </em>is not within the proviso of the statute. Trusts are express or implied ; and <em>Coke </em>states a <em>bona fide </em>conveyance to be, where there is no <em>trust, </em>express or implied. In the present case, there is a trust, first to pay the plaintiffs, next to pay certain creditors, and, lastly, to the grantor himself. By this mode of transferring all his property to a particular creditor, the debtor <em>delays </em>his other creditors. Though a debtor may legally prefer a particular creditor, he must take care to do it in such a manner as not to injure other creditors. That is, he may deliver to a particular creditor specific property, to a specific amount j but he cannot transfer to him all his property. Suppose <em>A. </em>beipg indebted to various persons, conveys all his estate^ gf the value of 100,000 dollars to <em>C, </em>in trust to pay <em>C. </em>10,000 dollars, owing to him, and the residue in trust for <em>A. </em>himself, would not this conveyance, if allowed to stand, hinder and delay the other creditors of <em>A. </em>in the recovering of their just debts ? That the other credit- or? m,ay be injured, is sufficient to render such a con- \u2022 veypnce fraudulent and void. It was so decided in the case of <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Warmal</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>soon after <em>Twyne\u2019s </em>case, on the principles of the common law, independent of any bankrupt law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-12\">Again, there was a trust reserved to <em>Cheriot, </em>which was fraudulent. A deed which is fraudulent in part, is void <em>in toto ; </em>fqr, as Lord <em>Coke</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> </em>observes, \u201c the .common law doth so abhor fraud and covin, that all acts, as well judicial as others, and which of themselves are just and lawful, yet being mixt with fraud and deceit, are, in \u2022 judgment of law, wrongful and \u2019 unlawfuland the same doctrine is laid down by <em>Montague, </em>Ch. J. in the case of <em>Wimbish </em>v. <em>Tailbeis,</em><footnotemark><em>\u00a7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>\u201c that covin may be where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>the title is good, and the title shall not give benefit to him that has it by reason of the covin, for the mixture of the good and evil together, makes the whole <em>bad; </em>the truth is obscured by the falsehood, and the virtue drowned in the vice.\u201d It is a principle of the civil law, as well as of the common law, that where the grantee knows of the fraud in a part of the deed, he shall not, as <em>particeps </em>criminis, derive any benefit from such a deed. If the deed is not void under the second section of the statute, it is so under the first, which is- explicit, though too often overlooked by courts-of law.- Though, at common law, a deed may be good in part, \u25a0 and void in part;- yet if part of a deed is made void by statute, the whole must be void,-<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> for a statute is strict law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b355-4\">. 2. Again, there was, in consequence of the resulting trust to Cheviot, such an interest as might be taken in execution. The case of <em>Cailland </em>v. Estzvick, <footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> which has been cited, is not in point. The debt for which the execution issued, arose in 1770, the lease was executed in 1784, and <em>Estzvick </em>had possession under the <em>lease, </em>and-received the rents and profits for five years,- and released to Lord <em>Abingdon, </em>who, over and over again, offered to pay the judgment creditors out of other property. Itwas a lease of certain real estate ; not an assignment of all a man\u2019s property. Lord <em>Kenyon </em>said, \u201c if the deed had been different from what it was, he should have been pressed by the argument, that there xvas a- tenancy in common.\u201d By considering--this as'a tenancy in common, no injury is done to the plaintiffs, or the creditors intended to-be preferred by the assignment. In the'case of joint partners in trade, xvhere judgment is entered against one of them, the share of the partner against xvhom the execution issues, may be sold.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> An equity of redemntton may- be sold m execution.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AjK\">3. But if the assignment xvas not void by the statute of frauds, xvas there a sufficient delivery of the goods, to rebut the presumption of fraud <footnotemark>\u00b6</footnotemark> symbolical de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>livery, in order to be effectual, must give the vendee a control over the property, as by the delivery of the key of the warehouse where it is deposited. The vendor must do every thing in his power to give, and the vendee to take, the possession.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> No notice was given to Sebring, until four months after the assignment. During that time, <em>Cheriot </em>might have demanded the goods, and <em>Se-bring </em>would have been''bound to deliver them to him, or to his order. So that <em>Cheriot </em>may be said to have had a perfect control of the property. Though in the sale of a ship at sea, the delivery of the grand bill of sale is sufficient, yet the moment the ship arrives in port, the vendee must take possession.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> Here was a <em>laches </em>on the ... part of the plaintiffs, in not giving notice to Sebring? of . the assignment to them.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b356-13\"><em>T. A. </em>Emmet, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACL\">1. This was not an assignment of all the property of Cheriot. It did not include his household goods. The general words in the deed, would not include property not contained in the schedule to which a reference is made. The subsequent specification must control the general words. But supposing this to be an assignment of all the property of the debtor, yet the statute of frauds expressly saves all conveyances made <em>bona </em>fide, and for a good <em>consideration; </em>though no such proviso is contained in the bankrupt law of <em>James </em>I. Though every act which is fraudulent under the statute of the 13th <em>Eliz. </em>will, when done by a trader, be an act of bankruptcy, and void by the statute of James, it does not follow, e converso, that every conveyance which is void under the bankrupt law, is also void under the statute of <em>Elizabeth.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AW9\">A debtor may assign the whole of his property to a particular creditor, if there be a delivery at the time, without its being considered-a fraud, within that statute, though his other creditors may be thereby hindered or delayed in the payment of their debts.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> The deed being <em>J J </em>T \u00b0 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>general, is not, alone, sufficient to avoid it. It is a mere circumstance to excite suspicion of fraud.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-4\">Lord Kenyon, in the case of <em>Nunn </em>v. <em>Willsmore,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>says, \u201c that putting the bankrupt law out of the case, a debtor may assign all his effects for the benefit of particular creditors.\u201d Such an assignment is not within the words \u2022of the bankrupt law ; but it has been decided to be within the <em>spirit </em>of the statute of James, because the debtor thereby destroyed his capacity to carry on his trade. The distinction between the statute of frauds, and the bankrupt law, as laid down by Lord Kenyon, was adopted by the supreme court of Pennsylvania, in the case of <em>Wilt </em>v. Franklin,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> which is a case strongly in point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-5\">Again, it is said that every deed which reserves a trust to the grantor is void, as it respects creditors ; but this cannot be law. On this doctrine how stand deeds of settlement and mortgages ? The case of <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Wor</em>mal, cited from Godbolt, is given by <em>Roberts </em>in a note.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> That case decided that where a man, having goods of the value of 20/. gave the whole to another to whom he owed 10/. with intent, that for the residue he should be favourable to him, the assignment was <em>altogether </em>void, because fraudulent in part; for the grantee, as to the 20/. was a privy to the fraud. In Styles, (128.) it is said that Rolle, Ch. J. ruled, that a deed might be fraudulent in part, and good in part.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-6\">There could be no valuation in this case. The assignment was in trust to sell the goods and pay certain debts, and account for the residue, if any. As it was impossible to know what would be the amount of the proceeds of the sale, it was requisite that the assignee should be required to account for any surplus.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b357-7\">Again, it is said there should have been an assignment of specific property, of a specific value, to the particular creditor. But no authority was cited in support of this doctrine, and the contrary is laid down by <em>Nezvland </em>before cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AzD\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>2. There was a sufficient delivery of the goods. The case of <em>Searle </em>v. Reeves<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> is precisely in point. Eyre, Ch. J. decided that a written order from the vendor, on t^ie Person who had the custody of the goods, directing him to deliver the goods to the vendee, was a sufficient delivery within the statute. If the delivery of the receipt of the storekeeper in this case was a valid delivery, at the time, no subsequent act of the grantor can avoid the transfer. In the case of a <em>symbolical </em>delivery, it is not requisite that the vendor should absolutely put it out of his power to commit a fraud <em>; </em>for in the case of a delivery of the key of a warehouse, he might have two keys, and deliver one to the vendee, and one to another person, and thereby commit a fraud.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-8\">3. How can <em>Cheriot </em>be a tenant in common with the plaintiffs ? They have the entire legal estate. <em>Cheriot </em>is a mere <em>cestuy que trust. </em>A tenant in common must have a present right of enjoyment; but <em>Cheriot </em>has no such right until all the other purposes of the assignment are fulfilled. It is a mere trust, as to <em>personal </em>property; and there is no decision, that such a trust of personal property can be taken in execution. The case of <em>Estwick </em>v. Caillaud shows, that the personal property included with the real, could not be taken in execution, unless the trust deed had been proved to be void.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b352-5\"><em> Cowper, </em>432. 5 <em>Term Rep. </em>235.1 <em>Vesey,jun. </em>280.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b352-6\"> 2 <em>Anstruther, </em>381. <em>Caillaud </em>v. <em>Estwick.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"\u2021\">\n<p id=\"b352-7\"> 2 <em>Caines, </em>44. 2 <em>Johns.

There is no colour or ground for the suggestion of fraud. <em>Cheriot </em>might lawfully prefer one set of creditors to another. The whole legal estate of the property specified (and the sugars in question were part of that property) vested in the plaintiffs. The object was lawful and just, and openly and fairly carried into effect. The goods in the storehouses were actually delivered, at the time, by the delivery of the keys of the stores ; and the sugars were delivered by the delivery of <em>Sebring\u2019s </em>receipt, which was the regular documentary evidence of title, and gave the plaintiffs the command of the sugars.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>It would be a waste of time to take notice of all the . . . \u2022 , ,-1 \u2022 cases which were cited, or which support this assignment. That of <em>Estwick </em>v. <em>Caillaud </em>(5 <em>Term Rep.- </em>420.) is very much in point, and fully establishes the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. This was not, in fact, a general assignment of <em>all Cheviot's </em>estate; for though the words, in one place, be general, yet the assignment immediately goes on to specify, by a reference to the schedules annexed, the specific articles of property assigned; and it therefore could operate only upon the articles specified ; for as the court said, in <em>Munra </em>v. Alaire, (2 Caines, 327.) if a general clause be followed by special words, which accord with the general clause, the deed shall be construed according to the special matter. <em>Cheviot </em>may have had a resulting trust, after the purposes for which the assignment was made were satisfied j but such <em>residuum </em>of interest was not the subject of sale on <em>Ji. </em>fa. <em>(Scot </em>v. Scholey, 8 <em>East, </em>467.) The case of a sale of an equity of redemption of a mortgage of lands, is not at all applicable. Such a residuary interest necessarily arises in every case where property is assigned in trust to pay debts, or to satisfy other specified <em>objects; </em>but unless the assignment be merely colourable, and made for the sake of the resulting trust, it is not void.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">The plaintiffs must have judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">Judgment for the plaintiffs -</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
