That the return of the writ was not according to the statute, (24 sess. c. 75.) which directs all process to be made returnable \u201c before our justices of our supreme court of judicature,\u201d &amp;c. and was therefore void. 2, That by the <em>ac etiam </em>clause, it appears to be an action on a statute, and the title of the statute is not indorsed on the writ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b245-12\">Boyd, contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AU0\">insisted, that the writ was not void, but voidable merely, and asked leave to amend. He said, that the action was not founded on any statute, but was a common action of <em>trespass quare clausum fregit. </em>The words in the <em>ac etiam. </em>clause, \u201c according to the statute,\u201d &amp;c. are inserted, merely to show that the plaintiff might hold the defendant to bail,</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b245-14\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AbK\">We have decided that such a writ is Voidable only. The case of <em>Drake </em>v. <em>Millar (Coleman\u2019s </em>Cases, 85.) was contrary to the existing rules on the subject, and ought not to govern, unless in a case precisely similar, in every respect. (See <em>ante, Williams </em>v. Rogers, 166.) The plaintiff may amend, on payment of costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
