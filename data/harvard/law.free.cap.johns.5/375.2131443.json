Loomis </em>when the plaintiff was not present, on being asked what he intended to do about the bills, replied, that he should take care of them, or that he should see them paid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b393-3\">The deposition of a notary in Baltimore, taken under a commission, the 31st <em>May, </em>1808, was read, which stated the presentment of the bill to <em>Bong han, </em>on the 28th March, 1804, who refused to accept the bill, for want of funds, and the same was thereupon protested by him (the notary) in due form of law ; that it was usual for him, in all cases of protest, to give notice in writing to the endorsers of protested bills, living at a distance, by putting such notice into the post-office, on the evening of the protest, directed to the party, at his place of residence, and that such notice is to the following purport; \u201c Mr. <em>A. B. </em>please to take notice, that <em>C. D.'s </em>bill of exchange, for - is protested by me, for nonpayment, (or for non-acceptance, as the case may be,) and that you, as an endorser, are held liable for the payment of the same.\u201d That in regard to the bill in question, as there was but one endorsement, it is possible that he gave the notice to the holder in <em>Baltimore, to </em>be forwarded or communicated in such way as he might think proper ; but although he had no doubt that notice was duly given, he could not, from his recollection, at that distance of time, answer more precisely; and that looking at the protest for non-payment, shown to him on his examination, he said, that the bill was presented for payment on the fst May, 1804, which was refused, for want of funds, and the same was by him protested for non-payment, on the same day.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b393-5\">The deposition of a notary of Charleston, taken under a commission, was also read in evidence, which stated the regular presentment of the bills mentioned in the third, fourth, and <em>fifth </em>counts, that the same were <em>noted </em>by him for non-acceptance, but not protested ; that the same were regularly presented for payment, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>were duly protested for non-payment ; that he did hot give notice to the endorsors of the bills of the non-acceptance and non-payment, and of the protest, because the endorsors did not reside within that state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b394-8\">The judge charged the jury, that there was only one point for their consideration; if they believed that the defendant, <em>Hadley, </em>had made the declaration as stated by the witness, <em>Foot, </em>knowing that he was legally discharged from all responsibility, they must find a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b394-9\">The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b394-10\">A motion was made to set aside the verdict, and for a new trial, and .also in arrest of judgment; both of which motions were argued at the same time, but the court being of opinion that there ought to be a new. trial, it is unnecessary to take any further notice of the motion in arrest of judgment.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b394-16\"><em>Colden, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AcsE\">The objection, as to want of a protest of non-acceptance and notice, depends on the fact, whether these are to be considered <em>&amp;s foreign </em>bills. If they are <em>foreign </em>bills, a protest is indispensable, and cannot be supplied by other evidence. It is in vain to look into the <em>English </em>books for a similar case; but we may refer to the <em>English </em>statutes and books, in order to ascertain what is an inland bill. The statute 9 and 10 <em>Wm. </em>III. c. <em>17. </em>considers bills drawn in one town or place in <em>England, Wales </em>or <em>Berwick, </em>on any person, in any other place, within the kingdom, as inland bills.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> An inland bill is defined to be where both the drawer and drawee reside in the same kingdom ;<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> and a foreign bill is where either the drawer or drawee resides abroad. According to this definition the present bills must be considered as foreign. Judgments in another state are considered as foreign; so bills drawn or payable in other stares, and without the jurisdiction of this state, are to be regarded as foreign. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>bills. Now, in the case of a <em>foreign </em>bill, a protest for non-acceptance is indispensably necessary, and cannot be supplied by witnesses in any other way.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In the case of <em>Orr </em>v. Maginnis,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> it was expressly decided by Lord Ellenborough, and the court of K. B. that a <em>protest </em>for non-acceptance was indispensable, to enable the payee to recover against the <em>drawer; </em>and that the want of it could not be supplied by proof of its having been <em>noted </em>for non-acceptance, and afterwards protested for non-payment. This is like the case before the court. There was a <em>noting </em>only for non-acceptance, but no protest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-4\">Again, whether, in general, a protest for non-acceptance is requisite or not, the plaintiff, in the present case, has rendered such proof necessary, by setting our a protest in his declaration. He has treated these as foreign bills, and he must prove the protest and notice according to his allegation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-5\">It may, perhaps, be said, that the irregularity arising from want of protest and notice in this case, has been waived by a subsequent promise to pay. But a promise to pay, made without a full knowledge of the laches, or its legal effect, does not cure the irregularity, or want of notice <footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> In <em>Lipscombe </em>v. Powell,<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark> and in <em>Piersons </em>v. <em>Hooker,</em><footnotemark><em>\u00b6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>this question was raised, but not decided by the court. In the case of <em>Fotheringham. </em>v. Price,<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> in <em>South </em>Carolina, it was decided, that a promise to pay, made by an endorser of a bill, under an ignorance of the <em>laches </em>of the holder, was not binding.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-6\">Again, the alleged promise to pay was made to a third person, <em>Loomis, </em>and not the plaintiff. It was not an absolute promise to pay.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b395-18\"><em>T. A. Emmet, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMi\">One circumstance to show that these are inland bills, is, that 20 <em>per cent, </em>damages are not recoverable, as is always the case with foreign <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>bills <em>; </em>nor is there any rate of exchange between the different states.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-3\">A bill of exchange, drawn in <em>England, </em>upon <em>Scotland, </em>is an inland bill.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> There is no exchange between places under the same government, or realm. This was the law before the union between <em>England </em>and <em>Scotland. </em>Judge <em>Tucker, </em>in his notes on Blackstone, defines an inland bill to be one drawn in Virginia, on any other of the <em>United </em>States, and <em>vice versa.</em><footnotemark><em>\u2020</em></footnotemark><em> If, </em>then, these were inland bills, no protest was necessary.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Am9\">\n<em>Colden.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXh\">But whether they are inland or foreign bills, notice of non-acceptance is equally necessary.<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ANm\">\n<em>Emmet.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2\">I admit, that notice is requisite <em>; </em>but in the case of an inland bill, it may be given in the morning, after the expiration of the three days of grace.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark> The law or usage of the place where the bill is presented *s t0 t&gt;e regarded ; and it appears that notice was given, according to the established usage in Baltimore.Again, in the case of <em>Lundie v. </em>Robertson,<footnotemark>\u00b6</footnotemark> was held, that a subsequent promise, by an endorser, to pay a bill which had been dishonoured, was <em>prima facie </em>evidence of its having been duly presented and dishonoured, and that due notice had been given to the endorser. Lord <em>Ellenborough </em>said, that where a man absolutely premised to pay a demand against him, every thing was to be presumed against him ; and that such a premise superseded the necessity of the ordinary proof. The same doctrine was recognised in <em>Piersons </em>v. <em>Hooker, </em>in this court j though the point was not expressly decided.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-6\">Whether the defendant knew of the <em>laches of </em>not, was a fact left to the jury. Indeed, after a lapse of three months, such knowledge was to be presumed. It is objected, that the promise was made to <em>Loomis, </em>a stranger, and not to the plaintiff j but <em>Loomis </em>may have beep <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>the plaintiff\u2019s agent, and such must have been the finding of the jury.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b397-6\">Golden, in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"As6\">said, that the amount of damages eould not furnish a criterion, by which to determine \" whether a bill was foreign or inland, as the damages were fluctuating, and depended on the rate of exchange between different places. The 20 <em>per cent, </em>damages allowed on foreign bills in this country, is arbitrary, and fixed for the sake of general convenience.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-8\">Judge <em>Tucker </em>gives no reason for his opinion, nor is any authority cited. It is, therefore, a mere <em>dictum.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-9\">The conversation between <em>Hackley </em>and <em>Loomis </em>cannot amount to a promise to pay <em>; </em>such a promise should be perfectly clear and explicit, so as to leave no doubt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-10\">Besides, it was not a promise to the plaintiff, and it does not appear that <em>Loomis </em>was his agent. And if there was evidence of a promise, it ivas made when the defendant was ignorant of the <em>laches </em>on the part of the plaintiff, and of his rights, in consequence of such neglect. In the case of <em>Lundie </em>v. Robertson, the bill was payable so many days after date, and so the drawer must have known when he was liable ; in the present pase, the bill was payable after sight.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b395-11\"><em> Chitty, </em>l5 80. 2 <em>Term Rep. 717 </em>6 <em>Mod </em>8. <em>1 </em>Sulk. 131. 5 <em>Term Rep. </em>239 2 <em>Bl.

By an agreement of counsel, the motion on the part of the defendant, for a new trial, and in arrest of judgment, came on together. This suit is to charge the defendant, as endorsor of a bill, drawn in New-York, on <em>Baltimore, </em>for 250 dollars, and of two bills drawn in <em>NewTork, </em>on <em>Charleston, </em>the one for 310 dollars, and the other for 315 dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">With respect to the first bill, I do not perceive any objection to the right of recovery. The bill, when presented for acceptance, was refused, and due notice, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>, given to the defendant. The evidence to this point con\u00bb \u2022 sisted of the deposition of a notary, who stated that he presented the bill for acceptance, and protested it for non-acceptance. That it was his usual practice, as notary, on the evening of the day of the protest, and in all cases of protest, to give notice, in writing, to the endorsors residing at a distance, by putting such notice in the post-office, directed to the party, at his place of residence ; and he had no doubt notice in this case was duly given, though, at that distance of time, he could not recollect positively ; and that it was possible he might have given the notice to the holder to be forwarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">This evidence was certainly sufficient, in the first instance, to support the averment of due notice, and there being nothing to affect it,, it will support the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">It was objected by the defendant, and urged as a reason, in arrest of judgment, that in the counts upon this bill, and in the proof, the demand, and protest for nonpayment, were made a day too late, by which neglect the holder made the bill his own, and discharged the endorsor. The answer to this objection is, that the endorser, being fixed by the non-acceptance and notice of it, it is perfectly immaterial whether the demand of payment was or was not a day too late ; because no demand was necessary, and so it was held in the case of <em>Welden </em>and <em>Furniss </em>v. <em>Buck. </em>(4 <em>Johns. Rep. </em>144.)</p>\n<p id=\"ApHj\">As to the <em>Charleston </em>bills, I am of opinion that the plaintiff has not shown enough to entitle him to recover. A protest for non-acceptance need not have been produced ; for I consider a bill of exchange made here, and drawn upon a person within the <em>United </em>States, though not in the same state with the drawer, as an inland bill; and, assuming it to be such, no protest was requisite ; for we have not adopted the statute of 9 and 10 <em>Wm. </em>III. requiring a protest on such bills. But the great <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>defect in the plaintiff\u2019s case is the want of notice to the defendant of the non-acceptance of the bills. None was given, or attempted to be given, and he was consequently discharged. A subsequent promise to pay, under a knowledge of the fact of want of notice, would be a waiver of notice <em>; </em>but I think there was not the requisite evidence of such promise. It ought to have been made out clearly and unequivocally. The defendant only said to a third person, when talking generally of all the bills, (that on <em>Baltimore </em>as well as those on Charleston,) that <em>he would take care of the </em>bills, <em>or see them paid. </em>Whether he used the one phrase or the other, is left in doubt; and if the first phrase was used, it was altogether uncertain whether he meant to be understood that he would resist, or would pay the bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">It would be dangerous to fix an endorsor without notice, and perhaps without knowledge of the <em>laches </em>of the holder, upon such loose conversation with a third person. No case has ever gone so far. Unless, therefore, the plaintiff will consent to reduce the verdict to the amount of damages on the <em>Baltimore </em>bill, there must be a new trial, with costs, to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">There were some other questions raised as to '\u25a0 the counts and the proof relative to the <em>Charleston </em>bills ; but the want of notice being a decisive objection to the right of recovery, I need not now take notice of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
