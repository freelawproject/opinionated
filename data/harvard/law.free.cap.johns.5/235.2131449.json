Where the attorney who signs the plea is also of the degree of counsellor, that will be sufficient; but he must sign <em>as </em>counsel, as well as attorney. If there be no addition to the name, it is enough; otherwise, if he only adds attorney to his name, it will not be considered. as signed by counsel.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
