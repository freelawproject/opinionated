Where the first affidavit of the plaintiff, is insufficient, whether a <em>supplementary </em>affidavit, in order to hold the defendant to bail, is admissible? <em>Qacere.</em></headnotes>\n<attorneys data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b376-8\">JOHNSON, for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARDR\">moved that an <em>exoneretur </em>be entered on the bail-piece, filed in this cause. The <em>capias ad resp. </em>on which the defendant was arrested, was returnable on the last day of <em>November </em>term. On the <em>27th November, </em>an order was obtained and served on the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, to show cause of action before the recorder of the city of <em>New-Tork, </em>on the first day of <em>December ; </em>and on that day, the plaintiff made affidavit, that the defendant was indebted to him in the sum of 2,100 dollars as the plaintiff verily believed, for goods sold and <em>delivered; </em>and for the further sum of 400 dollars, according to the best of the plaintiff\u2019s judgment, for a breach of a simple contract. This affidavit being objected to, as insufficient, the recorder gave the plaintiff time to produce another affidavit; and on the 4th <em>December, </em>he made a second affidavit, that the present suit was brought to recover of the defendant, 2,100 dollars, due and owing to the plaintiff, for goods sold and delivered to the defendant, and also for damages for the breach of a simple contract, amounting, according to the plaintiff\u2019s belief, to 400 dollars. This affidavit being also objected to, as insufficient, a third affidavit was made by the plaintiff, stating that the defendant was justly indebted to the plaintiff, in the sum of 2,100 dollars, for goods sold and delivered, &amp;c. on which the defendant was ordered to be held to bail, in the sum of 3,000 dollars.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b376-9\"><em>J. Radcliff, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AC-\">offered counter-affidavits, which were objected to by the defendant\u2019s counsel, but admitted by the court. The affidavits stated, that the defendant was justly indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of 2,100 dollars, for goods sold and delivered, &amp;c. and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>in the further sum of 400 dollars, for damages, by reason of the non-performance of a certain agreement, &amp;c. and that since the defendant had been held to bail, by order of the recorder of <em>New-7'ork, </em>he had offered to the plaintiff, in part payment of the balance due to him, an or- * der for 1,600 dollars, on the persons in whose hands the defendant had deposited the goods sold to him, and also offered to pay the balance that might be due to the plaintiff, and that the defendant had since absconded.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b377-6\"><em>Johnson </em>observed,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqsC\">that according to the practice of the court of <em>King\u2019s </em>Bench, an affidavit to hold to bail, after it was once made could not be amended, nor its defects cured by a supplementary affidavit; nor were counter-affidavits ever admitted to contradict it.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The first and second affidavits of the plaintiff were clearly insufficient.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> It is true, that the rule of practice is different in the court of C. P. in <em>England; </em>but even there, a supplementary affidavit is not allowed where the original affidavit is bad for uncertainty;<footnotemark>\u2021</footnotemark> but this court follows the practice of the K. B. in cases not provided for by its own rules.<footnotemark>\u00a7</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b377-7\"><em>Radcliff </em>insisted,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUim\">that as this was an original application to the court to exonerate the <em>bail; </em>counter-affidavits might be received as in any other case.<footnotemark>\u00b6</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"ASe9\"> l <em>Sellon, </em>120. <em>1 </em>Bac.
