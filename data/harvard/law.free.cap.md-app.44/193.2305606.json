S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>Abell Company, defendant below and appellee here, in a civil suit filed against it by Frank C. Hohman, plaintiff below and appellant here, for damages resulting from an allegedly libelous statement contained in an article printed in appellee\u2019s newspaper, <em>The Sun.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Prior to Frank C. Hohman\u2019s (appellant) retirement on December 1, 1975, he was a major in the Baltimore County Police Department with over 29 years of service. Appellee\u2019s morning newspaper, <em>The Sun, </em>began publishing a series of articles on August 24, 1975 dealing with towing operations in Baltimore County. The final article, published on January 22, 1976, generated the present dispute. Considering the nature of this case, we shall set forth the entire article below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-6\">\u201cBaltimore county police were lax in their regulation of towing firms, according to a 3-1/2-month internal investigation of charges of favoritism in the county\u2019s police-controlled towing business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\">The formal investigation report cites for \u2018nonfeasance\u2019 an unspecified number of unnamed high-ranking officers no longer with the department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-8\">Although the report finds no evidence of criminal misconduct by current or former policemen, it says \u2018subjective evidence would indicate that police officials had not fully exercised their administrative abilities\u2019 in overseeing those firms licensed to take police calls to tow disabled vehicles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-9\">Specifically, the report concludes that, in the past, towing license applications were approved or disapproved without written justification, official records of towing licensees were poor or non-existent and the tow truck operators were seldom if ever inspected for compliance with the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-10\">The nine-page report, dated January 7 and signed by Joseph R. Gallen, the police chief, has not yet been made public, but copies have been distributed within the department and sent to the county executive and state\u2019s attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Sandra A. O\u2019Connor, the state\u2019s attorney, will use the findings in her own probe of the department and the towing industry. She has said this investigation will be a top priority of the new grand jury sworn in last week.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\">The report is the first formal confirmation of articles in <em>The Sun </em>as early as August stating that a'politically well-connected Essex garage owner had established the largest towing business in that area, apparently because county police had limited his competition by control of the licensing procedure and had gerrymandered his authorized zone of operations to include some of the county\u2019s most heavily traveled roads.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">The garage owner, William E. Eiler, who lost his towing license in the ensuing investigation, is a friend of several once-powerful Democratic politicians and former police officers, including Ellison W. Ensor, the former chief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-8\">Mr. Ensor retired September 1 amid the investigation into corruption charges within the 1,180-member police force.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-9\">Mr. Gallen was then named acting chief by Theodore G. Venetoulis, the county executive, with orders to pursue the probe. Subsequently, Mr. Gallen received the permanent appointment as chief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-10\">Several high-ranking officers closely identified with the former chief also have subsequently retired. They include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-11\">*Col. Gordon C. Lee, the former operations officer, who had custody of the licensing files for towing operators.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-12\">*Maj. Louis G. Roemer, the former chief of detectives and also a friend of Mr. Eiler.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-13\">*Maj. Frank Hohman, former head of the Traffic Division, who kept the complaint files on towing operators.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-14\">*Capt. Charles L. Krach, former commander of the Eastern Patrol Bureau, who was responsible for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>drawing the towing zone boundaries in the Essex area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-5\">These four officers, as well as Chief Ensor, were among those charged with \u2018nonfeasance,\u2019 according to a reliable source.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-6\">Colonel Lee and Major Hohman were named in one section of the report which described the \u2018poor record-keeping system\u2019 within the department relating to towing operators.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-7\">Police investigators also faulted the county Department of Permits and Licenses for \u2018sloppy record keeping\u2019 relating to towing and suggested that \u2018effective internal management procedures be adopted.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-8\">The report also referred to one unidentified towing operator who \u2018may have committed several violations of law\u2019 other than the county towing statute and who is under investigation for possible criminal indictment by the state\u2019s attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-9\">At the conclusion of the report, Chief Gallen spelled out a new licensing procedure he has implemented, which will include at least three inspections a year of the county\u2019s approximately 31 police-licensed towing companies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">Appellant, at trial, claimed that this article falsely accused him of having been charged with a crime (nonfeasance) and that he had been damaged in his good name and reputation, particularly his reputation as a former law enforcement officer and as a former county employee of honesty and integrity.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">Appellee successfully maintained below, that the article was not defamatory and that, even if it were, there was no evidence of actual malice sufficient for the jury to consider whether appellee\u2019s constitutional privilege had been overcome.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>New York Times v. Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 84 S. Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>The trial judge, in granting appellee\u2019s motion for a directed verdict at the close of all the evidence, concluded that the article was not defamatory since, in the context of the entire article, the allegedly libelous paragraph, \u201cThese four officers (referring to appellant and three others), as well as Chief Ensor, were among those charged with \u2018nonfeasance,\u2019 according to a reliable source\u201d, did not charge appellant with a crime. The trial court arrived at this conclusion based upon two statements in the article which precede the offending paragraph. Those statements are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-5\">\u201cAlthough the report finds no evidence of criminal misconduct by current or former policemen...\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">\u201cSandra A. O\u2019Connor, the state\u2019s attorney, will use the findings in her own probe of the department and the towing industry. She has said this investigation will be a top priority of the new grand jury sworn in last week.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The threshold question of whether an article is defamatory is one of law to be determined by the court. The trial court correctly considered the article in its entirety, <em>Heath v. Hughes, </em>233 Md. 458, 464, 197 A.2d 104 (1964); <em>see Bowie v. Evening News, </em>148 Md. 569, 574, 129 A. 797 (1925); <em>Flaks v. Clark, </em>143 Md. 377, 382, 122 A. 383 (1923). The Court of Appeals in <em>Flaks v. Clark, supra, </em>stated well the rule applied by the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-8\">\u201c... [T]he libelous character of the article must be determined from the <em>whole article </em>published....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-9\">Words may have different meanings according to the connection in which they are used, and their context may confine them to but a single and innocent construction. It would be a dangerous doctrine, and tend to promote grave injustice, to permit words to be withdrawn from others with which they are connected and used by the publisher, and then impute to them a meaning not warranted by the whole publication.\u201d [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 382. The two preceding statements in the article, which relate that the investigative report found no evidence of <em>criminal </em>misconduct by former policemen and that the state\u2019s attorney \u201cwill use\u201d the findings from the report in her own probe, could be viewed as negating an inference that appellee was ascribing to appellant the commission of a crime. Nevertheless, we disagree with the trial court that, as a matter of law, the article was not defamatory although we conclude the case was properly withheld from the jury. We say this because it could be inferred that the author of the article was d\u00e9aling with two separate sources: one, Chief Gallen\u2019s report, and another being \u201ca reliable source\u201d. Thus, while the report itself may have stated there was no evidence of criminal misconduct, it could be inferred that a \u201creliable source\u201d said appellant and three others were \u201ccharged with nonfeasance\u201d, an admitted crime. In our view, keeping in mind the standard to be used by a trial judge in ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, reasonable readers of the article could have concluded appellant was said to have been charged with the commission of a crime. The trial judge, it seems to us, recognized his function when he stated in his oral opinion granting the motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-5\">\u201cIf there were legally sufficient evidence that this publication charged the plaintiff with the commission of a crime in the sense that it\u2019s argued by Major Hohman, then I\u2019d let the jury consider damages. If the statement was reasonably capable of two different meanings as Major Hohman\u2019s counsel argued, I should let the jury decide whether it\u2019s defamatory or not. If the statement is capable of two different meanings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Nevertheless, we believe the trial judge was wrong when he then concluded the statement was capable of only one meaning. Normally this conclusion on our part would require reversal, but not here because we do not believe there was evidence of actual malice, an element necessary to be shown under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>\n<em>Malice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Appellee argues that the lack of sufficient evidence of actual malice would also preclude submission of the issue of whether the newspaper\u2019s constitutional privilege had been overcome. The trial court did not base its decision to grant the motion for directed verdict specifically upon any failure on appellant\u2019s part to produce evidence of actual malice. The trial.judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-6\">\u201cI don\u2019t need to really base my ruling on that argument because I find that the evidence is legally insufficient to meet the burden of proof on the plaintiff to go to the jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Our recent decision in <em>Delia v. </em>Berkey,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 41 Md. App. 47, 395 A.2d 1189 (1978), denominates appellant a public official since the offending statement appears in a newspaper article which mentions him in his capacity as a Baltimore County police officer. <em>Id. </em>at 51. Judge Liss, writing for this Court in <em>Delia v. </em>Berkey; <em>supra, </em>engaged in a thorough examination of the standard of proof of malice required of a public official under <em>New York Times v. Sullivan, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\">\u201cAccordingly, the test applied in determining the governing legal principles in this case [involving a police officer acting within the scope of his law enforcement function] is the standard enunciated by the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>New York Times v. Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 84 S. Ct. 710 (1964), which held that public officials may sue for libel only when they can demonstrate that the alleged libel was made with \u2018actual malice,\u2019 which is defined to mean publication of false statements with actual knowledge of their falsity or with reckless disregard for their truth or falsity. In <em>Garrison v. Louisiana, </em>379 U.S. 64, 74, 85 S. Ct. 209 (1964), the Court refined its standard, stating that \u2018only those false statements made with the high degree of awareness of their probable falsity demanded by <em>New York </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number><em>Times </em>may be the subject of either civil or criminal sanctions.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-5\"><em>New York Times, supra, </em>and its progeny impose a heavy burden on the public official or public figure who seeks redress for an alleged defamation. The defamed public official or public figure must prove not only that the circulation was false but that it was knowingly so or was circulated with reckless disregard for truth or falsity. <em>See Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, </em>420 U.S. 469, 95 S. Ct. 1029 (1975). The procedural effect of New York Times was a shifting of the burden of proof in cases involving alleged defamation of public officials or public figures. We said in <em>Kapiloff v. Dunn, </em>27 Md. App. 514, 530, 343 A.2d 251 (1975):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsD\">In order to protect the interest of the First Amendment in the free dissemination of information concerning the conduct of a public official or public figure, the Supreme Court shifted that burden. It is now incumbent upon the public official or public figure plaintiff to prove that the statements concerning his conduct were false, and that they were published with actual malice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">The New York Times or the so called \u2018constitutional malice\u2019 doctrine focuses primarily on the element of scienter. Knowing falsity or reckless disregard for truth involves proof of a \u2018high degree of awareness of... probable falsity ...,\u2019 <em>Garrison v. Louisiana, supra, </em>such that the defendant \u2018entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his public action.\u2019 <em>St. Amant v. Thompson, </em>390 U.S. 727, 731, 88 S. Ct. 1323 (1968). <em>Accord, Marchesi v. Franchino, </em>283 Md. 131, 387 A.2d 1129 (1978).\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 51-53. To prove \u201creckless disregard\u201d, as required by <em>New York Times v. Sullivan, supra, </em>appellant had to adduce sufficient evidence to permit the conclusion that appellee in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>publication. <em>See St. Amant v. Thompson, </em>390 U.S. 727, 731, 88 S. Ct. 1323, 20 L.Ed.2d 262 (1968), where the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\">\u201cThese cases are clear that reckless conduct is not measured by whether a reasonably prudent man would have published, or would have investigated before publishing. <em>There must be sufficient evidence to permit the conclusion that the defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication. Publishing with such doubts shows reckless disregard for truth or falsity and demonstrates actual malice.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">There is simply no evidence that appellee published the article with \u201cknowing falsity\u201d or \u201creckless disregard of the truth\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Our review of the record persuades us that appellant failed to meet the heavy burden placed upon him by <em>New York Times v. Sullivan, supra, </em>in producing sufficient evidence of actual malice to take the matter to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">The <em>Sun </em>reporter\u2019s testimony negates any inference that he entertained any serious doubts about the truth of the matters treated in the article, particularly the allegedly defamatory statement. The reporter included the name of appellant among those to whom the nine-page report referred when it stated, \u201cThere was evidence of non-feasance by ranking police officers who are no longer with the police department\u201d, for the following reasons: the language of the report, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cranking police officers\u201d; the reference made by the report to the poor record-keeping within the police department, and the confirmation by a \u201creliable source\u201d that the names that were to appear in the article were the \u201cranking officers\u201d mentioned in the report. The investigative report itself did not give the names of the officers, so the reporter resorted to the sources noted previously to garner the information for the January 22, 1976 article. The reporter\u2019s recitation of his investigation to determine the names of those \u201cranking police officers\u201d contains no hint, nor is there any other evidence, that appellee or its reporter entertained any doubts, much less serious doubts, as to the truth of the publication. Thus we are led to the inescapable conclusion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>appellant failed to offer evidence of actual malice, and the motion for directed verdict was properly granted upon this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b218-12\">. Appellant proceeded below upon the theory that he was a \u201cpublic figure\u2019\u2019 within the meaning of New York Times v.
