J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Akf\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>The Sheriff<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of Baltimore City is of the mind that Thomas Abshire should not be allowed to continue employment as a deputy sheriff, so the Sheriff preferred charges against Abshire before the Secretary of Personnel of the State of Maryland. Specifically, Abshire was alleged by the Sheriff to have violated State Employee Personnel Rules .47 B and D. COMAR 06.01.01.47 B, D. Those two sections of the Rule provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-5\">\u201cB. That the employee has been wantonly careless or negligent in the performance of his duty or has used unwarrantable or excessive force in his treatment of public charges, fellow employees, or other persons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">D. That the employee has violated any lawful official regulation or order or failed to obey any lawful and reasonable directive given by his superior officer when such violation or failure to obey amounts to insubordination, a serious breach of discipline which may reasonably be expected to result in lower morale in the organization or to result in loss or injury to the State or public.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">A hearing was held before the Secretary\u2019s designated representative on July 10, 1978. As a result of that hearing, the Secretary determined \u201cthat the charges against Abshire have not been sustained by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d He ordered Abshire \u201creturned to duty with full back pay and benefits...</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">In so holding, the Secretary was critical of the Sheriff\u2019s suspending Abshire on May 9, 1978, and simultaneously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>ordering him to remain on duty.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A further criticism was directed at an intraoffice procedure whereby when an employee requested a day off, no response was deemed to be approval. Needless to say, if the supervisor, for whatever reason, did not receive the request, the employee would, nevertheless, believe the supervisor\u2019s silence was approval. The opportunity of the employee\u2019s thus being misled to his peril is obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">Frustrated by the Secretary\u2019s ruling, a ruling it is to be noted that was brought about by the Sheriff\u2019s filing of charges with the Secretary, the Sheriff appealed to the Baltimore City Court. Subsequently, the Sheriff\u2019s tactics were substantially altered. While the original petition, Md. Rule B 2 e, attacked the Secretary\u2019s jurisdiction under the Maryland Constitution, Article IV, Section 44<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Md. Courts and Judicial Proceedings Code Ann. \u00a7 2-309 (d)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>amended petition raised the additional ground that the Secretary lacked jurisdiction over the matter because of the Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights, (LEOBR). Md. Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 727-734 (D).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The Sheriff was again rebuffed when the Baltimore City Court (Sodaro, J.) granted Abshire\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The court held that \u201cdeputy sheriffs in Baltimore City are included in the State Merit System and that disciplinary actions are not controlled by the provisions of the Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The Sheriff continues in his unrelenting effort to fire Abshire by bringing an appeal to this Court where he challenges the Secretary\u2019s jurisdiction over deputy sheriffs in Baltimore City and the award of back pay to Abshire. Interlaced with the latter contention is the much berated but still very viable doctrine of sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">The funds to pay Abshire were available had he continued employment. Inasmuch as he was suspended, not fired, those same funds are still included within the Sheriff\u2019s budget. Consequently, unlike <em>Frosburg v. State Department of Personnel, </em>37 Md. App. 18, 375 A.2d 582 (1977), the Sheriff had the wherewithal to pay the accrued salary. The remaining contentions that the appellant raises to sustain his position that the back pay award was contrary to law were not decided by the trial judge, and we do not reach them. Md. Rule 1085.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">It is ironic that the Sheriff, who initially invoked the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Personnel now asserts that the Secretary did not possess the authority to hear the matter irrespective of Md. Ann. Code art. 64A, \u00a7 9E. That section, enacted as Laws 1971, ch. 519 declares:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-9\">\u201cNotwithstanding any provisions in \u00a7 3 of this article or elsewhere, all employees of the Sheriff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>office in Baltimore City, excepting the Sheriff, are part of the classified service. Any employee of the Sheriffs office who has been employed for at least six months on July 1,1971, shall be a member of the classified service of the State as provided in this article, without further examination or qualification.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">If section 9E is controlling, then the City court\u2019s action in affirming the decision of the Secretary is absolutely correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The obvious question then is what is the effect of the LEOBR on the instant case, and most particularly, on the Merit System Law, Md. Ann. Code art. 64A? The answer to the inquiry must be found by an analysis of the LEOBR considered in juxtaposition with the Merit System Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">When originally enacted as Laws 1974, ch. 722, the LEOBR added eight new sections to Md. Ann. Code art. 27, namely, sections 727 through 734. Section 727 (b) defined a \u201claw enforcement officer\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-8\">\u201cany person who, in his official capacity, is authorized by law to make arrests and who is a member of one of the following law enforcement agencies:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-9\">(1) The Maryland State Police; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-10\">(2) The Baltimore City police department; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-11\">(3) The police department, bureau, or force of any county; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-12\">(4) The police department, bureau, or force of any incorporated city or town; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-13\">(5) <em>The office of the Sheriff of any county; </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-14\">(6) The police department, bureau, or force of any bicounty agency or the University of Maryland.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>Significantly absent, by specific reference thereto, from the list of law enforcement agencies included within the ambit is the office of the Sheriff of Baltimore City. The Sheriff, however, argues that Md. Ann. Code art. 1, \u00a7 14, places his office under the LEOBR. Art. 1, \u00a7 14 provides: \u201cThe word county shall be construed to include the City of Baltimore, unless such construction would be unreasonable.\u201d The appellee asserts that construing the word county, as used in the LEOBR, to include Baltimore City would be unreasonable. Appellee points to the specific reference to the Baltimore City Police Department in Md. Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 727(b) (2) as a clear indication that the Legislature did not mean for the office of Sheriff of Baltimore City to be within the protection of the LEOBR. Appellee says that otherwise there was no need, rhyme or reason for the General Assembly to have made the specific reference to the Baltimore City Police inasmuch as they would have been included within section 727 (b) (3) or (4), unless the law makers intended to differentiate between Baltimore City and the counties. Thus, appellee contends, for the courts to interpret \u201ccounty\u201d to mean \u201cCity of Baltimore\u201d would, in the circumstances, be unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">To bolster his argument, appellee refers to an unpublished opinion of the Attorney General dated May 24, 1978, addressed to a member of the House of Delegates. In that opinion the Attorney General observed that \u201c[njowhere in this section [Md. Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 727] is the Office of the Sheriff of Baltimore City mentioned.\u201d The opinion goes on to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\">\u201cAt the time the Law Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights was enacted in 1974 and amended in 1975, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>the Office of Sheriff of Baltimore City had very little general law enforcement function.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-4\">The deputies were primarily process servers and, unlike any other sheriffs office in this State, were expressly included within the comprehensive State Merit System Law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The opinion notes that Md. Ann. Code art. 64A, \u00a7 9E places all Baltimore City deputy sheriffs in the \u201cclassified system.\u201d The then Attorney General changed his point of view as to whether the office of Sheriff of Baltimore City is embraced within the LEOBR.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The State here endeavors to erode the effect of the unpublished opinion by characterizing it as a \u201cone-signature opinion,\u201d \u201cdrafted when the status of deputy sheriffs in Baltimore City were in a state of extreme flux,\u201d of little influence inasmuch as it was unpublished, \u201cthe reasoning ... will not withstand scrutiny and ... it conflicts with the conclusion of an earlier published opinion. 61 <em>Opinions of the Attorney General </em>668, 670 (1976).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">We observe no conflict between 61 <em>Opinions of the Attorney General </em>668 and the unpublished opinion of 1978. The published opinion deals solely with whether the Police Training Commission was required to provide the law enforcement training mandated by Md. Ann. Code art. 41, \u00a7 70A to deputy sheriffs of Baltimore City. The answer supplied in the opinion was that it depends upon the duties assigned to the deputy. Moreover, section 70A (a) (4) and (5) remove any doubt as to its application to deputies in Baltimore City provided the duty of the deputy is to enforce \u201cthe general criminal laws of this State.\u201d Article 41, \u00a7 70A (a) (4) defines a \u201claw enforcement unit\u201d to mean \u201cany ... sheriffs department ... of the State, county or municipality----\u201d Article 41, \u00a7 70A (a) (5) declares that a \u201cMunicipality\u201d is \u201cany incorporated city of any class____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>We believe the Sheriffs reliance on 61 <em>Opinion of the Attorney </em>General668 to be misplaced. If the opinion is of any value as support for either party in the instant case, it is the appellee who benefits. A clear inference may be drawn from the manner in which subsections (4) and (5) of section 70A (a) are written that the Legislature was fully cognizant of the provision it had enacted with respect to the LEOBR, and desired to make known that with respect to \u201claw enforcement training\u201d it wanted to include the deputies of the office of the Sheriff of Baltimore City insofar as those deputies enforce \u201cthe general criminal laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The deputy sheriffs of Baltimore City are in the unique position of being the only deputies in the State who are under the State Merit System Law. Md. Ann. Code art. 64A, \u00a7 9E. When that factor is considered and weighed along with the wording of the LEOBR referring to the Baltimore City Police Department and making reference to the office of Sheriff, we are led to the conclusion that to read Md. Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 727 (b) (5) to include the Sheriff of Baltimore City would be unreasonable. Moreover, such a construction would indicate that the specific reference in section 727 (b) (2) is a redundancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">We note that during the 1976 session of the Legislature, House Bill No. 1526 was introduced \u201c[f]or the purpose of including within the definition of law-enforcement officer, certain sheriffs\u2019 offices in the Law-Enforcement Officers\u2019 Bill of Rights.\u201d The amendment would have changed section 727 (b) (5) to read: \u201cThe office of the Sheriff of BALTIMORE CITY OR any county....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">A similar bill, House Bill 738, was filed during the 1979 session. It was more specific as to its purpose and flatly said that it was to include \u201cthe sheriff\u2019s office of Baltimore City in the definition of law enforcement officer for purposes of the ... [LEOBR].\u201d That amendment sought to add the words \u201cor Baltimore City\u201d immediately after the noun \u201ccounty\u201d as it appears in section 727 (b) (5). Neither amendment was enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">We said in <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. State of Maryland Commission on Human </em>Relations, 40 Md. App. 473, 489, 392 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>A.2d 105, 115 (1978), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>285 Md. 205, 401 A.2d 661 (1979): \"Although the Court of Appeals has 'never held that the amendment-rejection theory is a completely determinative method of ascertaining legislative intent, . . . [it] has indicated that such action strengthens the conclusion that the Legislature did not intend to achieve the results the amendment would have achieved if adopted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Demory Brothers v. Board of Public Works, </em>273 Md. 320, 326, 329 A.2d 674, <em>aff'g </em>20 Md. App. 467, 473, 316 A.2d 529 (1974). See <em>also Bosley v. Dorsey, </em>191 Md. 229, 240, 60 A.2d 691, 696 (1948). We opined in <em>Demory, </em>20 Md. App. at 473, that \"[i]t has been held that a legislative body\u2019s rejection of a statutory amendment is significant because it throws light upon the legislative intent.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">One may infer from the rejection of the House Bill No. 1526 in 1976 and House Bill No. 738 in 1979 an intent on the part of the Legislature not to include the office of Sheriff of Baltimore City within the ambit of the LEOBR. When that inference is considered together with what we think to be the carefully chosen language of Laws 1974, ch. 722, Laws 1975, ch. 809, Laws 1976, ch. 482, ch. 484, ch. 504, Laws 1977, ch. 366, we are led to the conclusion that the General Assembly, having placed the deputy sheriffs of Baltimore City within the State Merit Law, Article 64A, \u00a7 9E, purposely omitted that office from the protection afforded by LEOBR.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">To hold, as the Sheriff urges us, that the office of Sheriff of Baltimore City <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is within the sphere of the LEOBR would be an unreasonable interpretation, Md. Ann. Code art. 1, \u00a7 14, and a judicial trespass upon a legislative prerogative.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Judge Sodaro, in granting the appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, properly construed the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b279-9\">. The origin of the ancient office of Sheriff seems to have been lost in antiquity, but its prototype, the <em>vice-comes </em>(Deputy of the earl), is found in Roman law. Alfred the Great (849=901) divided Britain into \u201cshires,\u201d and at the head of each he placed an earl with a deputy known as a \u201creeve,\u201d a Saxon term meaning \u201ckeeper.\u201d Not unexpectedly, the \u201cshire reeve\u201d became a \u201csheriff.\u201d Note, U. of Balto.
