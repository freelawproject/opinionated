In so ruling the trial judge was in error because a police officer\u2019s qualified immunity for torts is not available on demurrer. <em>See Carr v. Watkins, </em>227 Md. 578, 177 A.2d 841 (1962), in which the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-7\">\"The Montgomery County police officers are in a somewhat different position. Maryland has not adopted the rule laid down in the Barr[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] case but, on the contrary, this Court has shown reluctance to extend absolute privilege or immunity from liability for torts to government officers of a higher rank than these defendants. <em>Walker v. D'Alesandro, </em>212 Md. 163; <em>Maurice v. Worden, </em>54 Md. 233; see also <em>Brush-Moore Newsp. v. Pollitt, </em>220 Md. 132, 139. It has been felt that a qualified privilege is sufficient, so that immunity is conditioned upon absence of malice (unlike the situation where there is absolute privilege) and also upon action within the scope of the actor\u2019s duties and authority. <em>Walker v. D'Alesandro, supra; </em>3 <em>Davis, Administrative Law Treatise, </em>Secs. 26.01-26.05; <em>Prosser, Torts </em>(2d ed.), Sec. 109, pp. 780-4; Comment, 70 U. Chi. L. Rev. 677.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-10\">\"The matters of malice and the scope of their duties must be determined as to Watkins and Whalen from the testimony presented at the trial since a defense of qualified privilege is not available <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>on demurrer in Maryland. <em>Pollitt v. Brush-Moore Etc., Inc., </em>214 Md. 570; <em>Walker v. D\u2019Alesandro, supra.\u201d Id. </em>at 585-86 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-5\"><em>See also, DiBlasio v.
