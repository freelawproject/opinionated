J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A9M\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">The appellant, Dennis Gary Cooper, in this Court assails the judgment of the Circuit Court for Cecil County in an effort to have that judgment reversed. To accomplish that end, Cooper has raised half a dozen issues, ranging from a defective criminal information in the first instance to erroneous advisory jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">\n<em>THE FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">Cooper was tried before a jury on a four-count indictment filed March 20,1978, charging larceny of goods \u201cof the value of One Hundred Dollars and upwards.\u201d The indictment was in the normal form and as such contained the usual counts of receiving, petit larceny and receiving goods under the value of one hundred dollars. Additionally, the State\u2019s Attorney for Cecil County, lodged a Criminal Information <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against Cooper. It was filed on July 18, 1978 and contained two counts. The first charged Cooper with the common law offense of misprision of felony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The second count, which is the subject of this appeal, asserted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-11\">\u201cCOOPER ... willfully, unlawfully and knowingly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>did aid, harbor and assist Roy Dean Duncan after the commission of two felonies, (1) Grand Larceny, and (2) Receiving Stolen goods over $100.00, and did so with full knowledge of said crimes----\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The jury found verdicts of not guilty as to each count of the indictment and as to the first count of the Information. Cooper was found guilty, however, of the second count of the Information, aiding and abetting Duncan, \u201cafter the commission of two felonies.\u201d The trial judge imposed a sentence of eight years imprisonment but suspended the last year of that term and ordered that Cooper be placed on probation for a period of five years. Of course, the probationary period would not commence until the expiration of the period of incarceration.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">From the record it is apparent that Cooper pleaded guilty to the unrelated offense of forgery. That plea was entered some three months after trial in the instant case. The sentence imposed was exactly the same as that in the matter now before us and was made concurrent therewith. No appeal was entered from that sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">Even if Cooper were to win, yet he would lose, because, as applied to him, our striking down of one identical concurrent sentence would leave Cooper substantially where he is, <em>viz, </em>incarcerated for a period of eight years with the last year suspended, and Cooper\u2019s then being placed on probation for an additional five-year period.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, Cooper\u2019s \u201cvictory,\u201d if achieved, would be akin to that of Pyrrhus, King of Epirus (319-272 B.C.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and, consequently, no victory at all except possibly to allow parole to be more favorably considered. Under the circumstances, our subsequent discussion is largely academic as applied to Cooper.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>From the record it is apparent that Roy Dean Duncan stole certain personal property belonging to James R. West, from a \u201cfurniture type truck\u201d which was also owned by West. The property, described as \u201cstuff\u201d by West, consisted in part of \u201cRogers Stainless Steel Silverware [s/e], knives, forks and spoons,\u201d some \u201csets of steak knives,\u201d Corning ware, ladies\u2019 wallets, an FM-AM radio, two deep fryers, a hot plate, costume jewelry, an electric clock, lawn chairs, and a \u201chot dog cooker.\u201d West\u2019s cost of the items taken totaled $588.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Duncan pleaded guilty to the theft and was sentenced to a term of two years.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Apparently, after the burglary, Duncan went to Cooper\u2019s home, a trailer. There he talked to Cooper\u2019s wife, Wanda, and obtained Wanda\u2019s permission to stay in the trailer provided he gave \u201cher h\u00e1lf the things that... [he] got out of the truck.\u201d Duncan denied that he talked to Cooper before the crime. Duncan did not, according to his testimony, tell Wanda how he had obtained the items. He said that he went to Cooper\u2019s trailer \u201cbecause ... where I was staying the man told me I\u2019d have to move out because he was going to do something.\u201d Duncan testified that he gave some of the items to Lou Ann Bakeoven, a friend with whom he had been living. Cooper went with him when he took the items to Lou Ann\u2019s. Duncan denied that he sold any of the stolen property, but he gave \u201cit all away.\u201d Cooper was not living in the trailer according to him and Duncan, although his wife did reside there. Duncan stayed in the trailer for \u201cabout a month and a half.\u201d Cooper was in and out of the trailer as he and his wife were \u201cbreaking up or getting back together, or something.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Trooper Robert Faul of the Maryland State Police received information in July 1977 from an unidentified individual about a larceny from a liquor store. Subsequent investigation led the trooper to believe that the informant was actually speaking of the theft from West\u2019s truck. Following up on the information he had, Faul spoke to Cooper who told the trooper that he, Cooper, had seen the \u201cproperty which matched the description of the stolen property.\u201d Faul had spoken to Cooper \u201con numerous occasions\u201d between September 1977 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>and the time Cooper was arrested in January 1978. \u201cThe topic of conversation,\u201d Faul said, \u201ccould very well have been points that I was investigating. I was charged with the investigation of the crime. He [Cooper] was a suspect at that time and was not charged with it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The investigation obviously led Faul to conclude that Cooper was involved in the theft because he arrested Cooper on January 23, 1978, and charged him.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">As we have already observed, the trier of fact, the jury, apparently did not share Faul\u2019s belief as it convicted Cooper only of aiding and abetting after the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">THE CRIMINAL INFORMATION</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">Cooper asserts that although his trial counsel did not raise the specter of the second count of the Criminal Information\u2019s not charging an offense cognizable under Maryland law, nevertheless, the issue can be raised at any time. Md. Rule 736 a 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">That rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-11\">\u201ca. <em>Mandatory Motions.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-12\">A motion asserting one of the following matters shall be filed in conformity with this Rule. Any such matter not raised in accordance with this Rule is waived, unless the court, for good cause shown, orders otherwise:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-13\">2. A defect in the charging document, other than its failure to show jurisdiction in the court <em>or to charge an offense which defenses can be noticed by the court at any time. \u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-14\">As used in Rule 736 a 2, the noun \u201c \u2018Court\u2019 means the Circuit Court for any county ...,\u201d but it does not mean this Court. Md. Rule 5 i. Notwithstanding the rule, the question of jurisdiction, it has been repeatedly held, may be raised at any time. <em>Tate v. State, </em>236 Md. 312, 203 A.2d 882 (1968); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number><em>Bowen v. State, </em>206 Md. 368, 111 A.2d 844 (1955); <em>Berlinsky v. Eisenberg, </em>190 Md. 636, 59 A.2d 327 (1948); <em>Carroll v. State, </em>19 Md. App. 179, 310 A.2d 161 (1973); <em>Waldrop v. State, </em>12 Md. App. 371, 278 A.2d 619, <em>cert. denied, </em>263 Md. 722 (1971). <em>Ergo, </em>if the \u201cfailure... to charge an offense\u201d is jurisdictional, then it too may be raised at any time, including on appeal, even though it was not raised and decided in the trial court. <em>Carroll v. State, supra, </em>19 Md. App. at 181, 310 A.2d at 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">We are required to focus our attention upon the charging instrument, the Criminal Information, in order to determine whether that writing charges an offense under the law of Maryland, and if the answer to that query is in the negative, we must then address ourselves to whether the defect is jurisdictional.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">We begin our discussion by analyzing the second count of the Criminal Information, the count upon which the appellant was convicted. The essence of the offense charged in that count is that Cooper \u201cwillfully, unlawfully and knowingly did aid, harbor and assist... Duncan after the commission of two felonies, (1) Grand Larceny, and (2) Receiving Stolen Goods over $100.00, and did so with full knowledge of said crimes....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Appellant\u2019s assault on the phraseology of the charge is bimanous. On the one hand he asserts that the language of the count does not state an offense because it fails to allege the elements necessary to constitute the common law offense of accessory after the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">Sir William Blackstone, in IV <em>Commentaries of the Law of England* </em>37 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-9\">\u201cAn accessory <em>after </em>the fact may be, where a person, knowing a felony to have been committed, receives, relieves, comforts, or assists the felon. Therefore to make an accessory <em>ex post facto, </em>it is in the first place requisite that he knows of the felony committed. In the next place, he must receive, relieve, comfort, or assist him. And, generally, any assistance whatever given to a felon, to hinder his being apprehended, tried, or suffering punishment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>makes the assistor an accessory.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">The more modern writers are in agreement that there are four necessary ingredients to constitute the crime of accessory after the fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-8\">1) A completed felony must have been committed by another prior to the accessoryship;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-9\">2) The accessory must not be a principal in the commission of the felony;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-10\">3) The accessory must have knowledge of the felony; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-11\">4) The accessory must act personally to aid or assist the felon to avoid detection or apprehension for the crime or crimes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-12\">R. M. Perkins, <em>Criminal Law </em>667 (2d ed. 1969); <em>accord, </em>Clark &amp; Marshall, <em>A Treatise on the Law of Crimes </em>\u00a7 8.06 (M. F. Wingersky, 6th ed. 1958); 22 C.J.S., <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7\u00a7 95-99 (1961); H. Ginsberg <em>&amp; </em>I.

Torcia, 14th ed. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-13\">A reading of the Criminal Information will disclose that the first three elements of the crime of accessory after the fact are unmistakably present. It is the fourth ingredient that Cooper perceives as missing from the charge. The State, however, reads the count as alleging all four of the requisites. It reasons that \u201c[t]he information states in part that Appellant \u2018did aid, <em>harbor, </em>and assist ... Duncan....\u2019 The term \u2018harbor\u2019 includes the concept of acting with the intent to shield the one assisted from the law.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) The verb <em>harbor is </em>defined to mean: \u201cTo receive clandestinely and without lawful authority a person for the purpose of so concealing him that another having a right to the lawful custody of such person will be deprived of the same. <em>Jones v. Van Zandt, </em>5 How. 215, 227, 12 L.Ed. 122.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>876 (3rd ed. 1933). <em>See also Watson v. State, </em>208 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Md. 210, 218, 117 A.2d 549, 552 (1955); <em>Baumgartner v. Eigenbrot, </em>100 Md. 508, 513, 60 A. 601, 603 (1905); <em>McClain v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 106, 114-15, 268 A.2d 572, 576-77, <em>cert. denied, </em>259 Md. 733 (1970); <em>Robinson v.

Hochheimer, <em>Laws of Crimes and Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 36 (1897).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">Inasmuch as <em>harbor </em>means to receive the person with intent to conceal that person so as to avoid his arrest, the element Cooper perceives as missing from the Criminal Information is not in fact missing at all. We think the Information properly charged the offense of accessory after the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">On the other hand, Cooper avers that inasmuch as the Information asseverated that Duncan had committed \u201ctwo felonies (1) Grand Larceny <em>and </em>(2) Receiving Stolen Goods over $100.00\u201d it failed to charge an offense cognizable under the laws of this State. Appellant contends that one may not be both the thief and a receiver of the goods,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> then, \u201cit is axiomatic that there is no crime for aiding a thief-receiver.\u201d Recognizing that the issue was not raised in the trial court, and if short of being jurisdictional, is not properly before us, Md. Rule 1085; <em>Phenious v. State, </em>11 Md. App. 385, 274 A.2d 658, <em>cert. denied, </em>262 Md. 748 (1971), Cooper points to Md. Rule 736 a 2 as permitting the matter to be raised \u201cat any time,\u201d including before this Court. <em>Phenious </em>makes clear that \u201c[i]f the indictment [or information fails] to charge an offense ... there is a matter of jurisdiction and we are permitted to review the question whether or not it was tried and decided below, <em>Baker v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 148, 151, 250 A.2d 677 [(1969)].\u201d 11 Md. App. at 390-91, 274 A.2d at 661.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>We do not view the charging of two felonies in one count as jurisdictional, but rather as a question of duplicity which must be raised in the trial court. Whenever a count in an indictment or Criminal Information charges more than one criminal offense, it is duplicitous and, therefore, defective. <em>Kirsner v. State, </em>183 Md. 1, 36 A.2d 538 (1944); <em>Jackson v. State, </em>176 Md. 399, 5 A.2d 282 (1939); <em>Ayre v. State, </em>21 Md. App. 61, 318 A.2d 828 (1974); L. Hochheimer, <em>supra </em>at 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">We observed in <em>Ayre </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-6\">\u201cWhen a statute creates an offense and specifies several different acts, transactions, or means by which it may be committed, an indictment for violation thereof may properly allege the offense in one count by charging the accused in conjunctive terms with doing any or all of the acts, transactions, or means specified in the statute. This is the rule of <em>Leon v. State, </em>180 Md. 279, 286 [, 23 A.2d 706, 710 (1942)] as construed in <em>Morrissey v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 470, 475-476 [, 265 A.2d 585, 587-88 (1970)]. <em>See Bonneville v. State, </em>206 Md. 302 [, 111 A.2d 669 (1955)]; <em>Sturgill v. State, </em>191 Md. 75 [, 59 A.2d 763 (1948)]; <em>Thomas v. State, </em>173 Md. 676 [, 197 A. 296 (1938)]; <em>Reynolds v. State, </em>141 Md. 637 [, 119 A. 457 (1922)]; <em>Pritchett v. State, </em>140 Md. 310 [, 117 A. 763 (1922)]; <em>Stearns v. State, </em>81 Md. 341 [, 32 A. 282 (1895)]. See also 41 Am. Jur. 2d, <em>Indictments and Informations, </em>\u00a7 218. We said in <em>Morrissey, </em>at 476 [, 265 A.2d at 588]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-8\">While the rule is that an indictment or information should not charge the commission of two or more substantive offenses in the same count, it is not objectionable to charge in one count [in conjunctive terms] several related acts which enter into and constitute one offense, although when separately considered they may be distinct offenses. *** Thus, if the acts alleged are of the same nature and so connected that they can be construed as stages in one criminal transaction, they may be joined in one count, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>although separately considered they are separate offenses.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-5\">21 Md. App. at 65-66, 318 A.2d at 831. (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">In our view the two statutory crimes of larceny of more than $100 and receiving of stolen goods are two separate and distinct crimes and do not permit of joinder in one count. <em>Pritchett v. State, supra. </em>We agree with appellant that the second count of the information was duplicitous. Notwithstanding its duplicity, it does state an offense. In fact, it improperly states two offenses; either of them, however, are within the jurisdiction of the circuit court. We conclude that the information, while hardly a model to be emulated, does set out an offense over which the Circuit Court for Cecil County had jurisdiction. The duplicity issue, were it properly before this Court, would have merit, but it is a matter that should have been raised and decided in the trial court. It may not be raised for the first time here. Md. Rule 1085.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">\n<em>THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">The State notes, and we agree that the question of the sufficiency of the evidence is not before this Court inasmuch as the appellant made no motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of all the evidence. Md. Rule 756 a. <em>See Williams v. State, </em>19 Md. App. 204, 310 A.2d 593 (1973); <em>Martin v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 274, 269 A.2d 182 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">\n<em>THE CIRCUIT COURT ESTABLISHED AND APPLIED A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION IN FAVOR OF THE POLICE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">It is apparent that what appellant argues is that the hearing judge believed the statement of the accused was voluntary <em>vis a vis </em>involuntary as the appellant claimed. The appellant directs our attention to the remarks of the trial judge when he denied a motion to suppress the statement made to the troopers by the appellant. The judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-11\">\u201cI have to be more convinced than I am with this evidence that any such thing occurred. I just don\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>think that the Troopers, having this drilled into them day after day and knowing what happens to cases when they come to court if they don\u2019t give the Miranda Rights, I can\u2019t imagine them failing to give them. And I can\u2019t imagine them compromising themselves as they give them. In the absence of stronger evidence here, I am not going to believe it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">If that were all the judge said, the appellant might have a strong point, but that is not all that was said. Before the above-quoted words were stated, the judge opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-7\">\u201cWeighing the credibility of all witnesses in this matter, the Court is satisfied by a preponderance of the evidence that the statement, whatever it may have been, was made voluntarily, that anything that happened prior to January 23, 1978, did not fall within the Miranda Ambit Nor the traditional voluntariness ambit, because there was no \u2014 the Defendant was not in custodial care, and therefore, the rules of Miranda would not apply. Moreover, it is abundantly clear that whatever may have happened prior to January 23, 1978, that the rights were explained to him, and the Court adopts the version of the Trooper that the rights were explained to him before he signed the statement, as he indeed practically admitted. Because he said he read the preamble before he signed the statement, and also the explanation of rights were made to him before he signed the statement. I would reject the Defendant\u2019s testimony and adopt the Trooper\u2019s testimony about the question of bond and being furnished or not and things might go well, that sort of thing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">When the judge\u2019s remarks are read as a whole it is clear that he placed the burden of showing voluntariness, by a preponderance of the evidence, <em>Mulligan v. State, </em>18 Md. App. 588, 308 A.2d 418 (1973), squarely upon the State and not on the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>\n<em>THE JOINDER FOR TRIAL OF THE INDICTMENT AND THE INFORMATION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Appellant next complains that the trial judge improperly permitted the joinder of the indictment and the Criminal Information. The issue was not raised and decided in the trial court, and it is, therefore, improperly before us. Md. Rule 1085. We decline to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">\n<em>THE TRIAL JUDGE\u2019S JURY INSTRUCTIONS WERE ERRONEOUS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">Appellant next says that the trial judge improperly, instructed the jury on the law of accessory after the fact. Recognizing that no exception was taken to the judge\u2019s instructions, and that ordinarily the matter would not be preserved for appellate review, Md. Rule 757 f, h, appellant invites us to \u201ctake cognizance of and correct any plain error in the instructions material to the rights of the [appellant] even though the error was not objected to\u201d as provided in Md. Rule 757 h. <em>Brown v. State, </em>14 Md. App. 415, 422, 287 A.2d 62, 65 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the instruction left something to be desired, the appellant did not comply with Md. Rule 757 f. To hold that the issue is now properly before us, we must determine that it is plain error within the meaning of <em>Brown. </em>Md. Rule 757 h. We decline to accept appellant\u2019s invitation for the reason that we view the error as one of omission which could have been readily cured by the judge had the appellant requested a supplementary instruction. That appellant now chooses to characterize the omission as a commission in order to bring it within <em>Brown\u2019s </em>sphere is unavailing. We perceive no merit in appellant\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">One final word is in order. Appellant enumerates six reasons why he believes his trial counsel was so ineffective as to deny appellant his constitutional right to \u201cgenuine and effective representation.\u201d <em>State v. Merchant, </em>10 Md. App. 545, 550-51, 271 A.2d 752, 755-56 (1970). The issue, as with many others in this appeal, was not raised and decided in the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>court and may not be raised for the first time on appeal. Md. Rule 1085. Appellant, however, is not left without a forum to air his grievance. He has available to him the Maryland Post Conviction Act, Md. Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 645A. If and when appellant proceeds under that act, a court will then decide the matter of the effectiveness <em>vel non </em>of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b82-12\">.
