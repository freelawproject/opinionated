In Indianapolis in October 2014, Heishman was high on amphetamines and running around naked in the street. Police responded and tried to subdue him. A paramedic arrived on the scene and administered a sedative to Heishman so he could be moved to an ambulance to be taken to an arrestee holding room at a hospital. Soon, Heishman's heart and breathing stopped. Despite efforts to revive him, he died several days later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Heishman's estate sued, asserting federal Fourth Amendment claims and state-law tort claims. The district court denied qualified immunity to the paramedic on the excessive force claim. The court also allowed all but one of the state-law claims to proceed against the paramedic and the hospital without requiring the plaintiff estate to comply with the Indiana Medical Malpractice Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2034-18-1-1\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7 34-18-1-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq. The denial of qualified immunity is appealable as to legal issues, and the district court certified for interlocutory appeal under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201292\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) the state-law question whether the estate's claims are covered by the Indiana Medical Malpractice Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We reverse as to both issues. The paramedic is entitled to qualified immunity on the excessive force claim. Case law did not (and does not) clearly establish that a paramedic can violate a patient-arrestee's Fourth Amendment rights by exercising medical judgment to administer a sedative in a medical emergency. All of the state-law claims are subject to the substantive terms of Indiana's Medical Malpractice Act, including damage caps and the requirement to submit the claim to a medical review panel before suit is filed. The undisputed facts show that the paramedic was exercising medical judgment in dealing with a patient in a medical emergency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The district court stated the relevant facts in its summary judgment order.\n   <em>\n    Thompson v.

When he arrived, he learned that the bite was not from an animal but from a man, Dusty Heishman. Before Cope could treat the bite patient, an Indianapolis police officer approached Cope and said he needed him to \"take a look\" at Heishman, who \"was being combative.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Heishman was naked and lying prone in the middle of the street. His hands were cuffed behind his back and his ankles were shackled together. He had been tased by a police officer and had been punched and choked in a physical struggle with two civilians who helped the officer wrestle Heishman to the ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The police had responded to a report that Heishman was naked, belligerent, and roaming the neighborhood. The responding officer noticed that Heishman was sweating profusely and appeared to be on drugs. Heishman approached the officer's vehicle despite the officer's oral commands to calm down and sit down on the ground. The officer tased Heishman, but Heishman pulled the wires out of the taser, jumped back onto his feet, and tried to get into the officer's car. Despite oral commands to calm down or sit down, Heishman stared through the officer and repeatedly said \"they're trying to kill me, they're trying to kill me.\" After more officers arrived, they tried to put Heishman in the back of a police transport wagon. Heishman resisted and knocked the officers off balance, but the officers ultimately got Heishman back on the ground and held him there. Heishman was still struggling and fighting the officers who were holding him down. That was the scene when paramedic Cope arrived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Cope assessed Heishman. After checking Heishman's airway, breathing, and pulse, he suspected Heishman was on amphetamines. The district court relied on Cope's report (which is consistent with his deposition testimony), which said he injected Heishman with a sedative, Versed, as a \"chemical restraint for patient and crew safety.\" While the sedative took effect, Cope visually monitored Heishman by watching his breathing and watching for any struggling. Cope did not use medical equipment to monitor Heishman's vital signs. The medics and the officers picked Heishman up, laid him on his back on a cot, covered him with a blanket, and moved him toward a waiting ambulance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The darkness (it was after 8:00 p.m. on an October night) made it difficult for Cope to make an assessment. But once Heishman was in the ambulance, Cope saw that Heishman was not breathing and found he had no pulse. Seven minutes of CPR restored Heishman's heartbeat and breathing, but he remained unconscious. Heishman lost brain function and died eight days later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Heishman's estate sued Cope, the Health and Hospital Corporation of Marion County (\"the hospital\"), and other defendants in state court. The estate brought claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against Cope in his individual and official capacities for excessive force, deliberate indifference, and failure to protect/intervene. The estate also brought six state-law claims against Cope, the hospital, or both: wrongful death, damages resulting from injuries sustained before Heishman's death, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, negligence, and battery. The defendants removed the case to federal court based on federal-question jurisdiction over the constitutional claims, with supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Cope and the hospital moved to dismiss the state-law claims for what they called lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, arguing\n   that Indiana's Medical Malpractice Act required the estate to take those claims before a medical review panel before filing suit. The district court dismissed the wrongful death claim against the hospital but denied the motion with respect to the other state-law claims.\n   <em>\n    Thompson v.

In\n   <em>\n    Rivas\n   </em>\n   , the Third Circuit affirmed the denial of qualified immunity for two emergency medical technicians who responded to a patient who was having a seizure.

To treat the right as clearly established, the district court boiled away key circumstances of the situation here-especially the fact that Cope was a paramedic confronting a patient suffering from a life-threatening emergency. Those facts take this case out of the realm of clearly established Fourth Amendment law. It was not clearly established that a paramedic effects a \"seizure\" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment and subjects himself to an excessive force claim by sedating an arrestee who is suffering from a medical emergency to take the arrestee to the hospital.

Both sides had a fair opportunity to submit relevant evidence, and the legal issue can be decided based on undisputed facts.

Without saying so, the district court effectively converted the motion to reconsider the denial of the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment by considering \"matters outside the pleadings.\" Fed.

That is not what happened here. When the defendants submitted evidence to support\n   their motion to reconsider the denial of their motion to dismiss, the plaintiffs responded and submitted evidence in return. See Dkt. 61 (defendant's designations); Dkt. 68 (plaintiff's designations in response). That satisfied Rule 12(d) 's requirement that \"parties must be given a reasonable opportunity to present all the material that is pertinent to the motion.\" See also\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223258\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/600/726/#p731\">\n    600 F.3d at 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (affirming dismissal where non-moving party had fair opportunity to present evidence).

In any event, our standard of review is still\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .

The district court will need to dismiss the claims\n   <em>\n    without prejudice\n   </em>\n   so that the estate can refile the state-law claims if it clears the medical review panel process. The defendants acknowledge that a dismissal without prejudice is the proper result here. It is unusual for summary judgment to produce a dismissal without prejudice, but it is possible. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Fluker v. County of Kankakee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3898729\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/741/787/#p791\">\n    741 F.3d 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 791 (7th Cir. 2013) (summary judgment for failure to exhaust administrative remedies as required by Prison Litigation Reform Act should result in dismissal without prejudice), citing\n   <em>\n    Ford v.

On to the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Scope of the Medical Malpractice Act\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Claims for medical malpractice in Indiana are subject to a series of special requirements. One of the most important is that, subject to limited exceptions that do not apply here, claims must be presented to a medical review panel before the plaintiff may pursue a claim in court.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2034-18-8-4\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7 34-18-8-4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Medical review panels include three providers, two of whom must be from the individual defendant's profession or specialty, and a non-voting attorney, who chairs the panel. \u00a7\u00a7 34-18-10-3(a)-(b) &amp; -10-8. Each party may pick one provider panelist, and those two panelists pick the third. \u00a7 34-18-10-6. The panel has \"the sole duty\" to provide an expert opinion on whether the evidence supports the conclusion that the provider \"acted or failed to act within the appropriate standards of care.\" \u00a7 34-18-10-22. The opinion is \"admissible as evidence in any action subsequently brought by the claimant\" but \"is not conclusive.\" \u00a7 34-18-10-23. Malpractice claims are also subject to statutory caps on damages. \u00a7 34-18-14-3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The estate's claims are subject to the Medical Malpractice Act because the undisputed evidence indicates that Cope acted to promote Heishman's health and exercised his medical judgment to do so. It is undisputed that Cope assessed Heishman, thought he was in excited delirium, which can result in cardiac arrest, and gave the sedative for Heishman's and the crew's safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   These facts fit comfortably within the broad statutory definitions of the Medical Malpractice Act. Modern Indiana statutes tend to be written so that a great deal of substantive law is placed in the statutory definitions. That is true here. Heishman was a \"patient\" who received \"health care\" from a \"health care provider.\" The Act defines \"patient\" as \"an individual who\n   receives or should have received health care from a health care provider, under a contract, express or implied, and includes a person having a claim of any kind, whether derivative or otherwise, as a result of alleged malpractice on the part of a health care provider.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2034-18-2-22\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7 34-18-2-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Act defines \"health care\" as \"an act or treatment performed or furnished, or that should have been performed or furnished, by a health care provider for, to, or on behalf of a patient during the patient's medical care, treatment, or confinement.\" \u00a7 34-18-2-13. And the Act in turn defines \"health care provider\" to include a \"paramedic.\" \u00a7 34-18-2-14(1). All of the state-law claims relate to Cope's administration of the sedative. That makes them claims for \"malpractice,\" which is defined as \"a tort or breach of contract based on health care or professional services that were provided, or that should have been provided, by a health care provider, to a patient.\" \u00a7 34-18-2-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Our reasoning is consistent with Indiana courts' approach to these statutory questions. To determine whether a claim is for malpractice, Indiana courts analyze its substance, not its label. See\n   <em>\n    Robertson v.

Instead, the estate's arguments-about whether Cope gave the right dosage of the sedative or negligently failed to monitor Heishman or change his prone position-sound in malpractice.

The staff forcibly catheterized the plaintiff to obtain a urine sample. The state appellate court affirmed dismissal of the proposed malpractice complaint because the plaintiff was not a \"patient\" within the meaning of the Medical Malpractice Act. The catheterization\"was not for his own medical benefit ... but was carried out solely for law enforcement purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7201059\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/928/634/#p637\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7201059\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/928/634/#p637\">\n    at 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
