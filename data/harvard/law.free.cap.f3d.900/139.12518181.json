Interdiction is a civil order designating that a person is a \"habitual drunkard\" or has been convicted of driving while intoxicated. In this case, a group of homeless people suffering from alcoholism challenged the constitutionality of Virginia's interdiction statute under the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on criminalizing status, and the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of Due Process and Equal Protection. The district court dismissed the suit, concluding that the statutory scheme criminalizes acts rather than status, affords adequate process, and implicates no suspect class. We agree with appellants that states must tread carefully to avoid criminalizing status. But for the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Virginia regulates the consumption, purchase, manufacture, and sale of alcohol through a series of interconnecting provisions found in Title 4.1 of the Virginia Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Under \u00a7 4.1-333, a Virginia court may, \"after a hearing upon due notice,\" issue a civil interdiction order to any person who \"has been convicted of driving any automobile, truck, motorcycle, engine or train while intoxicated or has shown himself to be an habitual drunkard.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   An interdicted person is subject to several restrictions on his conduct. Section 4.1-322 makes it a Class 1 misdemeanor for an interdicted person to \"possess any alcoholic beverages\" or to \"be drunk in public\" in violation of another statutory provision. Section 4.1-305 similarly makes it a Class 1 misdemeanor for an interdicted person (or someone under 21 years of age) to \"consume, purchase or possess, or attempt to consume, purchase or possess, any alcoholic beverage,\" except in certain statutorily exempt circumstances such as the use of medicines containing alcohol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In Virginia, a Class 1 misdemeanor is punishable by \"confinement in jail for not more than twelve months and a fine of not more than $2,500, either or both.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2018.2-11\">\n    Va.

Bryan Manning was interdicted on October 5, 2010, in the Circuit Court for the City of Roanoke. Ryan Williams was interdicted on February 7, 2012, in the Circuit Court for the City of Roanoke. Richard Deckerhoff was interdicted on August 21, 2009, in the Circuit Court for the City of Petersburg. And Richard Eugene Walls was interdicted on June 12, 2012, in the Circuit Court for the City of Richmond. Each has been prosecuted at least eleven times for violating the alcohol restrictions resulting from his interdiction order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Appellants filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia. The complaint, brought on behalf of a putative class of \"all persons in Virginia who are homeless and who suffer from alcoholism,\" sought declaratory and injunctive relief against Roanoke Commonwealth's Attorney Donald Caldwell, Richmond Commonwealth's\n   Attorney Michael Herring, and \"all Virginia Commonwealth's Attorneys with the authority to enforce the Interdiction Statute against homeless individuals suffering from alcoholism.\" J.A. 28, 30. It alleged that Virginia Code \u00a7\u00a7 4.1-333, 4.1-305, and 4.1-322 imposed cruel and unusual punishment by criminalizing the status of alcohol addiction ; deprived plaintiffs of Due Process by converting the first step of a criminal proceeding into a civil proceeding; and violated Equal Protection by treating homeless alcoholics differently from non-homeless alcoholics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The district court dismissed the suit for failure to state a claim. With regard to the Eighth Amendment challenge, the court concluded that possession or consumption of alcohol \"is an act, regardless of whether that possession or consumption is in public or in the confines of [one's] own home,\" and therefore the statute's application to plaintiffs did not criminalize their status. J.A. 83. As to the Due Process claim, the court was \"not convinced that plaintiffs have pled facts demonstrating that the civil interdiction hearings deprive them of their physical liberty,\" and therefore found no constitutional defect in the process afforded by the statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2019.2-157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2019.2-157\">\n    at 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, with regard to the Equal Protection claim, the court found no discriminatory intent, no fundamental right, and no protected class to outweigh the Commonwealth's legitimate interest in discouraging alcohol abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This appeal followed.

In the absence of such a ruling and any sort of clear signal from the Supreme Court that\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   no longer remains good law, we think ourselves bound to respect that decision until some clearer and more definitive guidance emerges.

Virginia has been careful to draft a statutory\n   scheme that falls on the constitutional side of the line drawn in\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   . The interdiction provision set forth in \u00a7 4.1-333 is a civil enactment. An interdiction order is not accompanied by imprisonment or a punitive fine. The Eighth Amendment's prohibition on \"cruel and unusual punishment\" has obvious criminal purposes. A provision that puts a person on notice that\n   <em>\n    future acts\n   </em>\n   may result in criminal sanctions does not criminalize status for the simple reason that it does not criminalize anything. It is the\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   Virginia provisions, not \u00a7 4.1-333, that impose criminal sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   While criminal prohibitions do come into play in \u00a7\u00a7 4.1-322 and 4.1-305, those prohibitions apply only to affirmative acts: to \"possess any alcoholic beverages\" or to \"be drunk in public,\" and to \"consume, purchase or possess, or attempt to consume, purchase or possess, any alcoholic beverage.\" Appellants were arrested on the basis of committing these acts. That stands in stark contrast to the statute at issue in\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   , under which a defendant could be charged even if he had never \"used or possessed narcotics.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169863\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/370/660/\">\n    370 U.S. at 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169863\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/370/660/\">\n    82 S.Ct. 1417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We emphasize what we hope would be obvious: it would be unlawful for the state to simply round up \"undesirable\" persons based on their perceived status as addicts or drunkards.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11721589\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/156/\">\n    405 U.S. 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11721589\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/156/\">\n    92 S.Ct. 839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11721589\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/156/\">\n    31 L.Ed.2d 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1972). It is inimical to personal liberty to bring criminal charges on the basis of who someone is. For that reason, there must be some behavioral link set forth in the law. But Virginia has been careful to observe that line. It has prohibited individuals deemed at a higher risk of alcohol abuse from possessing or consuming alcohol. This includes not only habitual drunkards, but also people who have been convicted of drunk driving and those under twenty-one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4.1-305.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   To accept appellants' claim that there is no difference between alcohol addiction and the act of consuming alcohol would threaten to change the character of criminal law as we know it. Such a position has no plain limiting principle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We do not state this lightly. It is wise not to accept casually every \"slippery slope\" or \"open-the-floodgates\" argument that comes along. But in this case the potential breadth of the principle espoused by appellants is apparent. Every criminal act can be alleged to be the result of some compulsion. If human behavior is viewed as something over which human beings lack control, and for which they are not responsible, the implications are boundless. The examples extend beyond the discrete context of substance addiction. For instance, child molesters could challenge their convictions on the basis that their criminal acts were the product of uncontrollable pedophilic urges and therefore beyond the purview of criminal law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kansas v. Hendricks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"916116\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/346/#p362\">\n    521 U.S. 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 362,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"916116\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/346/#p362\">\n    117 S.Ct. 2072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"916116\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/346/#p362\">\n    138 L.Ed.2d 501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997) (upholding a sex offender statute where the law in question defined sex offenders as \"suffering from a 'mental abnormality' or a 'personality disorder' that prevents them from exercising adequate control over their behavior\"). The same could be said not only of sex offenders, but of stalkers, domestic abusers, and others driven by impulses they were allegedly powerless to check.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   That is not to say that the criminal justice system is or should be unaware of the mitigating character of allegedly nonvolitional conduct. The criminal justice system already has in place numerous features designed to mitigate nonvolitional\n   conduct, among them mens rea requirements (willfully, knowingly); affirmative defenses such as provocation, self-defense, and in extreme cases insanity; and of course sentencing proceedings where any nonvolitional characteristic or circumstance can be appraised by a sentencing judge. Those approaches to nonvolitional conduct often rely upon various combinations of legislative and judicial input, and they are more sensitive and balanced than the constitutional theory appellants propound in the instant case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Other features of the Virginia law likewise suffer no constitutional infirmity. Targeting alcohol abuse as Virginia has done is a prophylactic measure. It was permissible for the Commonwealth to regard the acts of purchasing or consuming alcohol as something that could lead persons with a history of heavy drinking to dangerous driving, domestic abuse, and sexual assault, among other criminal acts. The Virginia statutes affect rich and poor alike. They apply to a wide swath of society.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The use of prophylactic measures to sanction relatively minor acts in order to forestall more serious criminal misconduct is hardly uncommon. Many statutory schemes adopt a two-step approach: first, a civil or criminal determination identifies certain people more likely to commit serial or grave offenses. Second, that determination imposes criminal sanctions on what might seem to be relatively minor infractions in order to head off more harmful behavior. For example, the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) requires federal sex offenders to notify the states where they live and work of their prior conviction. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020913\">\n    34 U.S.C. \u00a7 20913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Once the prior conviction has established that a person poses a social risk, his mere failure to register can give rise to criminal liability.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020913\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In that way, SORNA uses criminal law to ensure that sexual offenders cannot fly under the radar. Similarly, federal criminal law prohibits otherwise routine firearms purchases by individuals who have been found by a court in a civil proceeding to be mentally incompetent. Such restrictions reduce the risk those people pose to themselves and to others.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(4) and 924(a)(2). By the same token, a domestic abuser who violates a civil Temporary Restraining Order can be subject to criminal contempt proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Va. Code 19.2-152.10, et seq. Once someone is found to pose a risk to his spouse or child, the simple act of coming within a certain distance of the protected persons or their home can give rise to criminal liability. Again, in this way, sanctioning a small act serves as a prophylactic measure designed to prevent the commission of a more serious crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Virginia's alcohol laws adopt precisely this approach. In fact, the very mechanism by which the state deters alcohol abuse by minors involves the criminalization of acts that are generally legal for the adult population. The same statute that prohibits interdicted people from possessing or consuming alcohol also applies to people who are under twenty-one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Va. Code \u00a7 4.1-305. All of these laws have one thing in common: they apply milder sanctions to less serious infractions such as possession or failure to register in order to reduce the risk of grave misconduct involving sexual predation, gun violence, or fatal accidents on the road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Appellants, however, criticize Virginia's approach for its alleged selectivity. They argue first that Title 4.1 singles out homeless people. While this contention sounds more in the nature of a disparate impact equal protection claim than an Eighth Amendment one, see\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   section V, it is\n   also incorrect. The statutory scheme addresses the problem of drunkenness in its totality. The criminal prohibitions against possessing, purchasing, or consuming alcohol apply both outside and inside a person's home. They apply whenever a non-homeless person leaves home to drive somewhere or attend a party or go to a sports bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Our concurring colleague takes a different position, arguing that a statute is fatally selective if it criminalizes \"otherwise legal behavior\" for a subset of the population. On this view, the legislature can only prohibit acts when the law would \"lead to criminal liability for everyone who commits them.\" Concurring Op. at 158-59. Such a limitation is both wholly lacking in authority and ignores the valid reasons\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   prohibitions apply to some population cohorts and not to others. The reason is simply this: past actions have given rise to present and future risks. To say that a state acts impermissibly on this basis would be an astonishing proposition, and prohibit legislative bodies from making the altogether practical assessment of risky behaviors that is entirely within the legislative prerogative. Such risk assessment has commonly led to limits on the uses of automobiles, firearms, alcohol and the like in order to lessen recognized social harms. The fact that these legislative judgments result in additional burdens for some groups, such as sex offenders, felons, or minors, does not change the Eighth Amendment analysis. To find otherwise would be to do with the Eighth Amendment what the Equal Protection Clause wisely does not, and that is to make suspect classes out of all groups who pose special and heightened risks to the community.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   Part V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Appellants also allege police misconduct in the execution of this particular statutory scheme. However, this challenge seems more appropriately addressed through the Fourth Amendment. If there were arrests based on undesirable status and divorced from any behavioral link, such police behavior would run afoul of that amendment. In this sense, the Fourth and Eighth Amendments occupy distinct but supplementary domains. The Fourth Amendment requires probable cause to undertake an arrest or search, which means probable cause to believe a forbidden\n   <em>\n    act\n   </em>\n   , as required by the Eighth Amendment, has been committed. The concurrence maintains that homeless alcoholics have been arrested \"simply because of their presence in a Walmart or near a discarded beer can.\" Concurring Op. at ----. If that truly is all there is, there would be no probable cause for an arrest, but appellants decline to press their case under any Fourth Amendment theory. The appropriate tonic for police overreach is exclusion of evidence or a civil suit under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and not, as appellants urge, driving a stake through an entire statutory scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   To say that Virginia's approach, as described above, is unconstitutional thus not only misreads its purpose, but also engages in policy choices reserved largely for legislatures and substantially for the states. The reason for legislative responsibility for defining substantive criminal prohibitions is fundamental; the criminal law exists to protect the safety of citizens, and ensuring the safety of the people is one of those things government exists to do. State legislatures thus have considerable latitude under their police power to address societal ills, and substantive criminal law has historically been reserved to them. What behavior to criminalize is not an exclusive state responsibility, but it is a core one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rachel E. Barkow,\n   <em>\n    Our Federal System of Sentencing\n   </em>\n   , 58 STAN. L. REV. 119, 119 (2005) (\"The federal system of the United States is based on the bedrock premise that the states bear primary responsibility for criminal justice policy.\"). States have a variety of tools with which to approach persistent social ills. The most thoughtful approaches are often the product of democratic input, expert opinion, cumulative experience, and simple trial and error. That is why the Eighth Amendment typically focuses on conditions of confinement, and inhumane forms and disproportionate lengths of punishment, rather than acting as a vehicle to reshape policy choices embedded within substantive criminal laws.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sanford H. Kadish,\n   <em>\n    Fifty Years of Criminal Law: An Opinionated Review\n   </em>\n   , 87 CAL. L. REV. 943, 964-66 (1999).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   There is, when all is said and done, a balance to be struck. States cannot ignore the line between status and acts. The criminal law and the constitutional limitations within which it operates are founded on the premise that human dignity is universal, and arrests and punishments alike are indefensible when based on who people are rather than what they do. It is a basic transgression on American liberty to brand someone a criminal and then prosecute that person without any underlying criminal conduct. And it is the practice of totalitarian regimes, not our free society, to substitute a personal characteristic for a prohibited act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   But it is also important not to hamstring a state's use of criminal prohibitions to protect its citizenry. Here, as noted, Virginia has opted to approach the problem of alcohol abuse prophylactically and prescriptively. The prophylactic prong is reflected in \u00a7 4.1-333. The interdiction order is a preventive tool. The state can use this sort of prophylactic device to identify those at the highest risk of alcohol problems and put them on notice that subsequent behavior may be subject to punishment. It is not constitutionally impermissible for the state to proceed in this manner so long as the line between status and act is scrupulously observed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   We next consider whether the interdiction provision, Virginia Code \u00a7 4.1-333, violates appellants' Fourteenth Amendment right to Due Process.

Virginia has a legitimate interest in discouraging alcohol abuse and its attendant risks to public safety and wellbeing. We pass no judgment on the general wisdom of interdiction.

In her view, the legislature's enactment of criminal sanctions is the wrong \"policy decision[ ],\" and the General Assembly would do well to consult studies \"show[ing] that methods focused on treatment, rather than deterrence, are more effective....\" Concurring Op. at 159. The concurrence goes to great lengths to inform the legislature of the \"many methods available to Virginia\" in this endeavor. It suggests that the state pursue \"civil\" statutes, \"prioritize treatment and establish a program of compulsory treatment\" for addicts, offer \"public health education,\" or simply enact \"laws to ameliorate the economic and social conditions\" surrounding alcohol abuse.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11162104\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/232/1353/#p1362\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Taken together, these suggestions do no less than tell the state how to calibrate deterrence and rehabilitation, manage budgetary resources, and structure their local economies. As such, it is appropriate that they are directed to the policymakers of the state rather than the litigants in this case. We need not dispute our colleague's ideas, nor pass on their merits. What they represent in their totality is a commandeering and assumption of the legislative role. This conclusion is justified only by the statement that addictions are illnesses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 157-58. The Commonwealth does not, however, punish the illness. It instead targets what takes place when the illness manifests itself in conduct harming or potentially harming other persons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   A parting recapitulation is in order. As the foregoing indicates, appellants' position suffers from multiple infirmities. As an initial matter, the desire to remove unspecified acts from the purview of criminal law flies in the face of the distinct and emphatic language of the\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   opinion, which indicates that individual actions, as opposed to personal status, remain fair subjects for the legislative contemplation of criminal sanctions. Not only are the words of the Supreme Court disregarded, but the settled legal landscape that for more than half a century has reinforced their relevance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   As noted, appellants' position undermines the basic premise of the criminal law that individuals may indeed bear responsibility for their own actions, even as appellants overlook the considerable measures that our justice system has taken to soften the sanctions and mitigate the hardships of allegedly nonvolitional conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Thirdly, appellants' position is a simple affront to our federal system, as it seeks to displace with a single constitutional edict the latitude that the 50 states have long been given to address persistent social ills associated with drug and alcohol abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   It is not often that a position operates to visit structural and institutional harms through the preemption of state and legislative authority, the disregard of higher precedent and the erosion of the most basic precepts of the criminal law. Any one of these flaws would be serious. Altogether,\n   they are more than severe.

Plaintiffs allege that they are homeless and suffer from an illness: alcoholism.

Rathod,\n   <em>\n    Distilling Americans: The Legacy of Prohibition on U.S. Immigration Law\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=51%20Hous.%20L.%20Rev.%20781\">\n    51 Hous.

Plaintiffs claim that, once interdicted, the Commonwealth arrested and criminally prosecuted them-not once or twice, but dozens of times-for otherwise legal behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   For example, they allege that police officers arrested Plaintiff Bryan Manning on one occasion \"for smelling like alcohol\" and on another for being \"in a Walmart store where alcohol was sold.\" They assert that officers arrested Plaintiff Ryan Williams for \"sleeping in a park bathroom\" where \"a beer can was found in the trash,\" and arrested Plaintiffs Richard Deckerhoff and Richard Eugene Walls for being \"near\" beer cans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs allege that the Commonwealth provides no clear procedure for removing the \"habitual drunkard\" label post-interdiction, such that interdicted persons are essentially branded for life. On the basis of these facts, Plaintiffs maintain that, as applied to them, Virginia's statutory scheme violates the Eighth Amendment by subjecting them to incarceration because of their status as \"homeless alcoholics.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In arguing to the contrary, the Commonwealth heavily relies on the fact that the Virginia statute operates in two steps. Va. Code \u00a7 4.1-333(A) permits a court to enter a civil interdiction order \"prohibiting the sale of alcoholic beverages ... until further ordered\" to a person who \"has shown himself to be an habitual drunkard.\" Then Va. Code \u00a7\u00a7 4.1-322 and 4.1-305 make it a Class 1 misdemeanor for an interdicted person to \"possess any alcoholic beverages\" or to \"consume, purchase or possess, or attempt to consume, purchase or possess, any alcoholic beverage.\" The punishment for this crime is \"confinement in jail for not more than twelve months and a fine of not more than $2,500, either or both.\" Va. Code \u00a7 18.2-11(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Virginia's two-pronged statutory scheme may be more indirect than the statute at issue in\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   , but it yields the same result. If the statute at issue in\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   had allowed the state to \"interdict\" prescription drug addicts and then arrest interdicted addicts for filling those prescriptions, the statute\n   <em>\n    effectively\n   </em>\n   would also have criminalized \"being addicted to narcotics\" even if it\n   <em>\n    nominally\n   </em>\n   punished only filling prescriptions. Such a statute would surely be unconstitutional as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   A statute that would be unconstitutional if accomplished in one step cannot be rendered constitutional simply by bifurcating it. Thus, although Virginia may nominally penalize \"possession\" or \"consumption,\" the Commonwealth's statutory scheme effectively targets and punishes homeless alcoholics based on their illness. That the Commonwealth brands homeless alcoholics as \"habitual drunkards\" before prosecuting them for involuntary manifestations of their illness does nothing to cure the unconstitutionality of the statutory scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Moreover, contrary to my colleagues' suggestions, adopting Plaintiffs' position would not shield individuals from prosecution for violating generally applicable laws, curtail a state's ability to impose post-conviction restrictions, or infringe on a state's ability to regulate alcohol. My colleagues warn against \"accept[ing] casually every 'slippery slope' or 'open-the-floodgates' argument that comes along.\" But in the same breath, they fall into this very trap. Plaintiffs challenge\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   the targeted criminalization of\n   <em>\n    otherwise legal\n   </em>\n   behavior\n   that is an involuntary manifestation of their illness. Plaintiffs do not assert that they are immune from prosecution for generally applicable criminal offenses. They do not question the constitutionality of restrictions imposed after a criminal conviction. And they raise no objection to the Commonwealth's general ability to regulate alcohol or other substances within its borders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The contention that Plaintiffs' position leads to holding that any \"uncontrollable\" act absolves an individual of responsibility for generally applicable crimes is clearly incorrect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   A state undoubtedly has the power to prosecute individuals-even those suffering from an illness-for breaking laws that apply to the general population. Under the Eighth Amendment, an alcoholic may not, as a result of his addiction, escape prosecution for criminal behavior that is unlawful if committed by a non-alcoholic. But Plaintiffs do not seek a special exemption from\n   <em>\n    generally applicable\n   </em>\n   criminal laws. The constitutional challenge we confront today deals only with a law that targets a group of vulnerable, sick people for special punishment based on otherwise legal behavior (drinking alcohol) that is an involuntary manifestation of their illness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Accordingly, Plaintiffs' position does not jeopardize laws generally criminalizing certain behavior. Those laws apply to all and reflect a state's legitimate concern that some actions are so dangerous or contrary to the public welfare that they should lead to criminal liability for everyone who commits them. That is not the case here. Generally, Virginians over the age of 21 can possess and consume alcohol, but if the state brands a person a \"habitual drunkard\" and interdicts him, behavior that is legal for all others over 21 becomes criminal for the interdicted person.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Benno Weisberg,\n   <em>\n    When Punishing Innocent Conduct Violates the Eighth Amendment: Applying the\n   </em>\n   Robinson\n   <em>\n    Doctrine to Homelessness and Other Contextual \"Crimes,\"\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20J.%20Crim.%20L.%20%26%20Criminology%20362\">\n    96 J.

But Plaintiffs' challenge simply does not impact enhanced punishments or post-conviction restrictions imposed because of a prior criminal conviction. Those laws do empower courts, in some instances, to impose such punishments and restrictions on those who suffer from certain illnesses, but\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   where a defendant has already been convicted of a crime-a conviction imposed subject to due process and other constitutional safeguards.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020913\">\n    34 U.S.C. \u00a7 20913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (establishing sex offender registry);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020913\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 20911(1) (defining \"sex offender\" as \"an\n   individual who was convicted of a sex offense\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Finally, holding Virginia's statutory scheme unconstitutional would not affect \"[t]he broad power of a State to regulate\" alcohol or narcotics within its borders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169863\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/370/660/\">\n    370 U.S. at 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169863\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/370/660/\">\n    82 S.Ct. 1417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It can elect to prioritize treatment and \"establish a program of compulsory treatment for those addicted to\" alcohol.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169863\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/370/660/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169863\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/370/660/\">\n    at 664-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169863\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/370/660/\">\n    82 S.Ct. 1417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And it can \"choose to attack\" the combined \"evils\" of alcoholism and homelessness \"through public health education,\" or by enacting laws designed to \"ameliorate the economic and social conditions under which those evils might be thought to flourish.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169863\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/370/660/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169863\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/370/660/\">\n    at 665\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169863\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/370/660/\">\n    82 S.Ct. 1417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Policy decisions such as these are, of course, not ours to make; they rest within the sound province of the Virginia General Assembly. I note, however, that just as society's understanding of alcoholism and addiction have evolved in the 56 years since\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   , so too have methods of targeting these problems. Indeed, studies have repeatedly-and convincingly-shown that methods focused on treatment, rather than deterrence, are more effective at targeting the combined problems of alcoholism and homelessness.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness,\n   <em>\n    Searching out Solutions: Constructive Alternatives to the Criminalization of Homelessness\n   </em>\n   (June 2012).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In response to this concurrence, my colleagues offer rhetoric and misapprehensions. I will not attempt to match the rhetoric, but must correct a few of the misapprehensions. Faithfully following Justice White's controlling opinion in\n   <em>\n    Powell\n   </em>\n   , as I would, does not \"overturn or greatly extend\" Supreme Court precedent. Rather, only this course properly follows the Court's longstanding\n   <em>\n    Marks\n   </em>\n   rule. And the accusation that I have gone \"to great lengths to inform the legislature\" that it has made \"the wrong 'policy decision[ ]' \" ignores the preceding paragraphs. In fact, I expressly recognize that policy decisions are the legislature's province-provided those decisions do not violate the Constitution. Finally, of course a state may target conduct \"harming or potentially harming other persons,\" but the statute at issue here contains no such limitations. Indeed, the complaint alleges that the Commonwealth routinely uses this statute to arrest homeless alcoholics simply because of their presence in a Walmart or near a discarded beer can. (Given these allegations, Plaintiffs may also have a claim under the Fourth Amendment, as my colleagues suggest; of course, a plaintiff need not pursue every available claim.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Thus, although my colleagues' opinion makes for dramatic reading, their analysis remains divorced from the law and the facts of this case. Plaintiffs' challenge is a narrow one that will neither hinder nor even implicate a state's ability to make\n   legislative judgments concerning the safety and welfare of its citizens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The statutory scheme challenged here criminalizes the otherwise legal behavior of individuals suffering from a serious illness. The specter of this unconstitutional law looms large over a number of the Commonwealth's most vulnerable citizens. Plaintiffs allege that from 2007 to 2015, Virginia interdicted 1,220 individuals and recorded 4,743 criminal convictions of interdicted persons for alcohol possession or consumption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Imprisonment for a short time-here, for not more than twelve months-does not, in the abstract, seem to be cruel or unusual punishment. But, as the\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   Court recognized, \"[e]ven one day in prison would be cruel and unusual punishment for the 'crime' of having a common cold.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169863\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/370/660/\">\n    370 U.S. at 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6169863\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/370/660/\">\n    82 S.Ct. 1417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The targeted criminalization of otherwise legal behavior that is an involuntary manifestation of an illness is just as clearly cruel and unusual punishment here as it was in\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Given our precedent,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   I must concur in the judgment rejecting the challenge to Virginia's statutory scheme. Because thousands of Virginians remain subject to a law that, in my view, is unconstitutional, I do so with reluctance and regret.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    My colleagues' suggestion that two other courts of appeals have joined in \"a large chorus of circuit opinions\" supporting their contrary approach rests on two short unpublished (and therefore non-precedential) opinions.
