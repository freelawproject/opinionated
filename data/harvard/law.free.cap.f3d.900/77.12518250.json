The pursuit involved the use of lethal force against Bland, who sustained severe injuries after he was shot between 16 and 18 times. The question presented is whether the District Court committed legal error when it denied the officers summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds. Because the officers' conduct was within the bounds of the Supreme Court's relevant decisions regarding the use of lethal force, we will reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A. Initial Pursuit\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the early evening of December 26, 2011, Newark Police received a report that a black Audi bearing Pennsylvania license plate number PZK821C had been carjacked at gunpoint. Approximately three hours later, New Jersey State Troopers James Thompson and Brian Murphy spotted the carjacked vehicle in Newark. Appellee Corey Bland was behind the wheel. The troopers activated their police lights, but Bland failed to stop. Instead, he accelerated and began to drive recklessly, running red lights and shutting off his headlights as he went. The troopers lost sight of the Audi, but an officer from the Summit Police Department began following it shortly thereafter. Bland nearly struck that officer's vehicle and collided with an embankment, but he continued driving. He reached speeds exceeding 100 miles per hour, weaving in and out of light traffic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   State Trooper John Oliveira joined the chase in his marked police car after receiving reports that units from the State Police and Summit Police Departments were pursuing a carjacked vehicle. State Trooper Miguel Holguin,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   driving an unmarked Chrysler 300 accompanied by State Troopers Anthony Sardanopoli and Stephen Riefler, got involved after hearing a radio broadcast by Thompson and Murphy containing details about the carjacked vehicle. Bland continued to drive recklessly, frequently changing lanes, disregarding traffic lights, turning his lights off, accelerating to more than 80 miles an hour in an area with a 25-mile-per-hour speed limit, and driving over a curb in an empty parking lot, which caused the Audi to begin to smoke. Despite all this, the Audi was not disabled, and Bland continued to evade police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B. Lincoln Park Events\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Eventually, Bland began driving the wrong way down Lincoln Park, a one-way street. While doing so, he collided both with Thompson and Murphy in their marked state police car and an occupied Newark Police vehicle. When Bland hit the\n   Newark police car, he was travelling approximately 25 to 35 miles per hour, and the impact caused the police car to strike an unoccupied parked car. As a result, the Audi, the police car, and the unoccupied car became entangled. State Trooper Thomas Espinoza, who had received a radio transmission about an ongoing pursuit involving a vehicle carjacked at gunpoint, arrived on the scene shortly after these collisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Numerous officers surrounded the Audi, including Murphy, Thompson, Oliveira, Sardanopoli, Espinoza, and State Trooper William Legg.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Many of the officers ordered Bland to surrender, and one officer attempted to break the Audi's window by striking it. During this encounter, the six state troopers fired a total of 28 shots, none of which hit Bland. Newark Police Officer Thomas Del Mauro was present at Lincoln Park, but he did not discharge his weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   There is no evidence in the record that Bland attempted to surrender at this time. Instead, he revved the Audi's engine, spun its tires, and tried to get the vehicle to accelerate. Bland ultimately freed the Audi from the Newark police car by reversing and striking the now-unoccupied state police car a second time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   He then drove over a curb and through a public park.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Upon exiting the park, Bland continued to speed through Newark with his lights off, at times on roads populated with vehicular and pedestrian traffic. Officers and state troopers continued to pursue Bland, but Thompson and Murphy were no longer involved because their vehicle was disabled when it was struck by the Audi at Lincoln Park. During this portion of the chase, a state police car struck an occupied civilian vehicle. Bland eventually drove to the intersection of 18th Avenue and Livingston Street, where the most vigorously disputed series of events took place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   C. The Terminus of the Chase\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At the intersection of 18th and Livingston, the unmarked Chrysler 300 driven by Holguin allegedly rammed the Audi, sending the Audi into scaffolding that surrounded a school. State Troopers Holguin, Sardanopoli, and Riefler exited the Chrysler 300 and moved toward the Audi, which remained entangled in the scaffolding. Holguin approached the driver's side with Riefler standing behind him, while Sardanopoli moved to the Audi's passenger side.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   All three troopers began firing their weapons at the Audi. Holguin and Riefler testified that they initially discharged their weapons because Bland refused to comply with their orders to show his hands and to stop moving and because he repeatedly threatened to kill the officers. Sardanopoli stated that he fired his weapon after he saw Holguin firing. Legg-also on the scene-asserted that he fired because he could see Bland moving around in the Audi as Holguin and Riefler discharged their weapons. Bland, for his part, denied that the troopers shouted any verbal commands or that he made evasive movements, but he conceded that nothing in the record contradicts the officers' allegations that he threatened to kill them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After the first volley of shots, Riefler approached the driver's side of the Audi, whereupon Riefler testified that Bland attempted\n   to climb through the window while again threatening to kill him. In response, Riefler fired his weapon again. Espinoza also discharged his weapon, as did Newark Officers Del Mauro, Reuben Torres, and David Martinez, who had heard about the carjacking at roll call earlier that evening. The Newark officers stated that they fired their weapons because they saw the Audi moving or heard it revving, indicating that it was still capable of flight. Bland disputed this assertion, arguing instead that the Audi became inoperable once it crashed into the scaffolding. Oliveira, though present, did not discharge his weapon at the terminus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The shooting finally ceased once Riefler observed Bland slumped over, and a Newark sergeant called for the officers to hold their fire. Bland was shot between 16 and 18 times, including in the face, chest, and abdomen. He suffered numerous injuries, including a traumatic brain injury, respiratory failure, vision loss, and multiple facial fractures. No gun was recovered from the scene, and no officer observed Bland with a weapon during the course of the pursuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Bland and his wife Virginia filed a complaint in the Superior Court of New Jersey Law Division alleging (among other things) that Defendants violated Bland's Fourth Amendment rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.J.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2010%3A6-2\">\n    N.J.

Defendants removed the case to federal court and sought summary judgment, claiming qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   After oral argument, the District Court concluded that it was \"not in a position to grant or deny qualified immunity.\" App. 78. Instead, it held that a jury must first decide two issues of material fact: (1) whether the Audi's engine was revving (and thus whether the car was capable of moving) after it crashed into the scaffolding; and (2) whether the officers could see Bland's movements inside the vehicle.

Accordingly, it denied Defendants' motion, including with respect to the three officers who were neither present nor discharged their weapons at the terminus of the chase.

Before shots were fired at Lincoln Park, Bland drove at high speeds, disregarded traffic signals, drove the wrong way down a one-way street, collided with two occupied police vehicles, and failed to comply with orders to surrender. As the gunfire erupted, he repeatedly attempted to flee from police and state troopers, including by trying to drive with officers standing in close proximity to the Audi. And he engaged in all of this behavior in a vehicle that had been reportedly taken at gunpoint a few hours earlier.

The state troopers and Officer Del Mauro-all of whom were present at Lincoln Park-continued to pursue a fugitive who once again disobeyed traffic\n   lights, drove at excessive speeds, and put pedestrians and motorists at great risk.

After the crash, Bland threatened to kill the officers, and the record provides no evidence that he attempted to surrender at any time. Though the Audi remained pinned against the scaffolding, the officers had previously seen Bland successfully free the car and continue to flee after the crash at Lincoln Park. And although the officers did not see a weapon, the police reports of an armed carjacking gave them reason to believe Bland was armed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pearson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679212\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/223/#p231\">\n    555 U.S. at 244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679212\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/223/#p231\">\n    129 S.Ct. 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that qualified immunity \"turns on the objective legal reasonableness of the action\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) ).
