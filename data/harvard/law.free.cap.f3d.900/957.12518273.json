Together with their rivals, MS-13, the Mara 18 terrorize the Salvadoran population and government. The gangs use violence to exercise an enormous degree of social control over their territories, dictating where residents can walk, whom they can talk to, what they can wear, and when they must be inside their homes. The gangs have orchestrated labor strikes, brokered a now-defunct truce with the government, and plotted to bomb government buildings. They brag about influencing elections and controlling political campaigns within their territories. They extort millions of dollars from local businesses through threats of violence, and they are largely responsible for El Salvador's homicide rate-one of the highest in the world.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Two days after the Mara 18 threatened W.G.A., he fled to the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Department of Homeland Security apprehended W.G.A. for illegally entering the United States and began removal proceedings against him. W.G.A. applied for asylum, statutory withholding of removal, and deferral of removal under Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture, arguing that the Mara 18 gang would kill him if he returned to El Salvador. The immigration judge denied his applications and ordered removal. The Board of Immigration Appeals dismissed W.G.A.'s appeal, and he petitions this court for review. We grant W.G.A.'s petition for review and remand to the Board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Factual &amp; Procedural Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   W.G.A. is a citizen of El Salvador who arrived in the United States in January 2016. The immigration judge found W.G.A. credible, and the Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed that finding. We use W.G.A.'s testimony and the immigration judge's findings to provide the factual context in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   W.G.A. grew up in a small farming community of about 170 families. In 2013, the Mara 18 gang began operating in his rural community. By 2015 there were about 20 local gang members. The gang engaged in their usual activities: extorting\n   <em>\n    la renta\n   </em>\n   , or \"rent,\" from local businesses, recruiting young men as new members, and \"disappearing\" (as a transitive verb) those who refused to join.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   One day in 2014, petitioner's younger brother S.R.P. failed to return home from\n   a trip to the store. Petitioner and his mother searched for S.R.P. When they could not find him, they guessed that the gang had forcibly recruited him. About two months later, S.R.P. called petitioner. He was crying and said that he did not know where he was and could not talk long because the gang might kill him. S.R.P. then hung up abruptly. Petitioner told his mother of the call, but neither contacted the police because they felt it would be useless. They had seen others in their community seek help from the police without success. Others had disappeared after reporting crimes to police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A few months later, the family learned that S.R.P. had been arrested. Petitioner's mother attended a court proceeding, where she saw that S.R.P. had a gang tattoo on his hand. S.R.P. remained in prison until November 2015 when, on the day of his release, he called W.G.A. to say that he did not want to be a part of the gang anymore. S.R.P. said he could not come home for fear of what the gang would do, but he did not tell W.G.A. where he was going. W.G.A. assumed that his brother headed toward Guatemala.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The next day, a man called W.G.A. from a private number. The man told W.G.A. to \"be careful\" and that \"they're looking for you,\" and hung up without identifying himself. The following day-two days after S.R.P. left prison-four tattooed gang members approached W.G.A. at his house. They asked him where his brother was. When W.G.A. responded that he did not know, one man grabbed him by the collar of his shirt, threw him to the ground, drew a gun, and put it to his head. One of the men told petitioner: \"if you don't [hand] over your brother, you're going to die here.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The men told W.G.A. that he had four days to comply or they would kill him. They also told him that they would kill him and his family if anyone spoke to the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Fearing for his life, W.G.A. fled two days later. He traveled through Guatemala and Mexico to the United States. Since W.G.A. left El Salvador, gang members have repeatedly threatened his family-over the phone and in person-to demand his and his brother's whereabouts. Petitioner's mother was so frightened by the threats that she arranged for her other teenage son, J.R.P., to go into hiding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In January 2016, W.G.A. entered the United States through Texas without valid entry documents. The Department of Homeland Security initiated removal proceedings against him. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201239.1\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1239.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . W.G.A. conceded that he was removable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(7)(A)(i)(I). He then applied for asylum under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , withholding of removal under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3), and deferral of removal under Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201208.16\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1208.16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), 1208.18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The immigration judge concluded that W.G.A. did not qualify for any of his asserted grounds of relief and ordered removal. W.G.A. appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which agreed with the immigration judge and dismissed W.G.A.'s appeal. The immigration judge's order of removal became final, see\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201241.1\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1241.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and W.G.A. petitioned for review in this court, see\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), (b)(1). While W.G.A.'s appeal was pending before the Board, DHS wrongfully removed him to El Salvador. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201003.6\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (staying execution of immigration decisions while appeal is pending). This removal did not affect the Board's or our jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Matter of Diaz-Garcia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20794\">\n    25 I. &amp; N. Dec. 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (BIA 2012) ;\n   <em>\n    Marin-Rodriguez v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701342\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/612/591/#p593\">\n    612 F.3d 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 593-94 (7th Cir.2010). We ordered briefing on whether we had the authority to order DHS to permit W.G.A. to return to the United States while his appeal was pending. Rather than litigate the issue further, the government agreed to facilitate W.G.A.'s return. The parties have successfully returned W.G.A. to the United States, where he remains detained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Scope of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   It is helpful to start by clarifying the scope of our review. The answer depends on whether the Board's order is independent of or supplemented the immigration judge's decision. See\n   <em>\n    Liu v. Ashcroft\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9210133\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/380/307/#p311\">\n    380 F.3d 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 311 (7th Cir.2004). When the Board issues an independent opinion that replaces the immigration judge's reasoning with its own, our review is limited to the Board's opinion.\n   <em>\n    Jabateh v. Lynch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176123\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/332/#p337\">\n    845 F.3d 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 337 (7th Cir.2017), citing\n   <em>\n    Sarhan v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3837888\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/658/649/#p653\">\n    658 F.3d 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 653 (7th Cir.2011). Our review is broader when the Board relies on the immigration judge's findings and supplements that opinion \"with additional observations.\"\n   <em>\n    Sarhan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3837888\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/658/649/#p653\">\n    658 F.3d at 653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In those cases, we review the immigration judge's findings as supplemented by the Board's.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3837888\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/658/649/#p653\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , citing\n   <em>\n    Mema v. Gonzales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5712695\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/474/412/#p416\">\n    474 F.3d 412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 416 (7th Cir.2007). In a footnote, W.G.A. states that our review is limited to the Board's opinion. The Attorney General argues that the Board's order was supplementary to the immigration judge's decision. We agree with the Attorney General's reading and see no reason in this case to narrow our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Asylum and Withholding of Removal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   To qualify for asylum, W.G.A. must show that he is \"unable or unwilling to return\" to El Salvador \"because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A), 1101(a)(42)(A). The persecution must be \"on account of\" one of five protected grounds: \"race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). If W.G.A. proves that he was persecuted in the past because of one or more of the protected grounds, he is presumed to have a well-founded fear of future persecution on the same grounds.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201208.13\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). The Attorney General can rebut that presumption by showing that country conditions have changed or that W.G.A. can safely relocate to another part of El Salvador. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1), (b)(1)(i). Withholding of removal is similar. The Attorney General must withhold removal of W.G.A. if his \"life or freedom would be threatened in\" El Salvador because of one of the same five protected grounds.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(A). If he shows past persecution, W.G.A. is again entitled to a rebuttable presumption that his life or freedom would be threatened.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201208.16\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   W.G.A. has shown past persecution. He testified, and the immigration judge credited his testimony, that the Mara 18 threatened his life at gunpoint. That point is not in dispute in this case. The Board found that the threat amounted to persecution. See\n   <em>\n    Nakibuka v. Gonzales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8931196\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/421/473/#p477\">\n    421 F.3d 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 477 (7th Cir.2005) (\"A death threat, especially one that is accompanied by an attacker pressing a gun to the victim's head, is a serious factor supporting a finding of persecution.\"), citing\n   <em>\n    Boykov v. INS\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"834140\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/109/413/#p416\">\n    109 F.3d 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 416 (7th Cir.1997), and\n   <em>\n    Mitev v. INS\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7416431\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/67/1325/#p1331\">\n    67 F.3d 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1331 (7th Cir.1995).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The first disputed issue is whether the persecution was motivated by a reason covered by the asylum statutes. W.G.A. contends that the gang was motivated by his membership in one of two particular social groups: (1) members of his nuclear family or (2) family members of tattooed\n   former Salvadoran gang members. The immigration judge and the Board found that this persecution was not sufficiently connected to W.G.A.'s membership in a particular social group. We decide the issue by addressing two questions: (1) whether W.G.A. has shown that he is a member of a qualifying social group; and (2) whether he has shown that the Mara 18 persecuted him on account of his membership in that group. We agree with W.G.A. that he has identified a cognizable social group and that the record compels the conclusion that the Mara 18 persecuted him on account of his membership in it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    General Remand\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We first address the Attorney General's request for a general remand. The Attorney General made no substantive arguments related to asylum or withholding of removal in this appeal. Instead, he requests that we remand to the Board for reconsideration without engaging in any review ourselves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In some past cases, we have allowed the Attorney General to seek a remand without confessing error so that the Board can reconsider asylum decisions \"in light of the emerging case law.\"\n   <em>\n    Ren v. Gonzales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"82124\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/440/446/#p448\">\n    440 F.3d 446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 448 (7th Cir.2006). In some cases where we have accommodated these requests, we have been disappointed: the Board has disregarded the Attorney General's stated reasons for remand. See, e.g.\n   <em>\n    Reyes-Mendez v. Lynch\n   </em>\n   , 629 Fed. App'x 757, 761 (7th Cir.2015) (criticizing Board for repeating \"its social-group analysis word for word\" after the Attorney General requested general remand for Board to reconsider social-group analysis); see also\n   <em>\n    Marin-Rodriguez v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701342\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/612/591/#p593\">\n    612 F.3d 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 595-96 (7th Cir.2010) (rejecting Attorney General's request for a general remand for Board to reconsider merits, when Board's position was that it did not have jurisdiction to consider merits). In light of these cases, we will grant a general remand only when there is a persuasive reason to do so, at least where, as here, the request is opposed by the petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Attorney General offers two reasons for a general remand. First, he requests that the Board have a chance to reconsider whether \"family members of tattooed former Salvadoran gang members\" is cognizable in light of circuit and Board precedents that predate this case. The Attorney General does not explain why the Board needs a second chance to apply case law that was available when it decided W.G.A.'s appeal, and we decline to remand on that basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Second, the Attorney General seeks a remand to permit the Board to consider\n   <em>\n    Matter of L-E-A-\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%2040\">\n    27 I. &amp; N. Dec. 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (BIA 2017) (requiring petitioner to demonstrate that family relationship is at least one central reason for persecution). The Board issued\n   <em>\n    L-E-A-\n   </em>\n   after it dismissed W.G.A.'s appeal, and the Attorney General argues that\n   <em>\n    L-E-A-\n   </em>\n   provides \"critical guidance\" for cases that involve \"family-based particular social groups.\" But\n   <em>\n    L-E-A-\n   </em>\n   did not establish a new rule. As the government agreed at oral argument,\n   <em>\n    L-E-A-\n   </em>\n   applied the same analysis that the Board has followed since at least 2007. See\n   <em>\n    In re J-B-N- &amp; S-M-\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20208\">\n    24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 212-16 (BIA 2007) (interpreting the \"one central reason\" requirement for asylum). In this case, the immigration judge applied the already-established rules summarized in\n   <em>\n    L-E-A-\n   </em>\n   and found that social-group membership was not a central motivation for the Mara 18. We decline to remand on this basis as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Cognizable Social Group\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The first substantive question is whether W.G.A. is a member of a particular social group within the meaning of the Immigration and Nationality Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(42)(A).

Confusingly, the Board reasoned that because \"the respondent did not establish the lower burden of proof applicable to asylum, he necessarily did not establish his eligibility for withholding of removal, which carries a higher burden of proof.\" This is not quite correct. Withholding of removal carries a higher burden on two questions: the\n   <em>\n    severity\n   </em>\n   of the harm the applicant faces (persecution versus threat to life or freedom) and the\n   <em>\n    likelihood\n   </em>\n   that the applicant will be harmed (well-founded fear versus clear probability).

The nexus requirement, however, is the same for both asylum and withholding of removal. At least, that's the position the Board has taken in other cases. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Matter of C-T-L-\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20341\">\n    25 I. &amp; N.

Testimony by W.G.A. and his family members leaves no doubt that the gang repeatedly targeted the entire family because of their relationship to S.R.P. Country reports and news articles throughout the record corroborate this testimony and demonstrate widespread recognition that the Salvadoran gangs target nuclear family units to enforce their orders and to discourage defection. In other words, substantial evidence does not support the immigration judge's finding on the lack of a nexus between the gang's persecution of W.G.A. and his membership in the family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   To start, the timing of the persecution demonstrates that W.G.A.'s family relationship with his brother caused the gang to target W.G.A. The gang members threatened W.G.A. at gunpoint just two days after S.R.P. said he was defecting. The immigration judge and Board doubted whether S.R.P. had actually defected, but that detail is unimportant. What matters is that the gang was looking for S.R.P., likely because they believed he had defected. What's more, the gang's own words reveal their motivation. When the gang held a gun to W.G.A.'s head, they demanded that W.G.A. reveal his brother's location. And when the gang warned W.G.A. not to notify the police, they threatened to kill his entire family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   W.G.A. also provided examples from his community as circumstantial evidence of the gang's motivation. See\n   <em>\n    Martinez-Buendia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6049733\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/711/#p715\">\n    616 F.3d at 715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (applicant can prove motivation by direct or circumstantial evidence), citing\n   <em>\n    INS v.

W.G.A. testified that when a young man he knew reported a robbery to the police, gang members \"disappeared\" him and his father in retaliation. W.G.A.'s mother submitted an affidavit that described a young woman in the community who refused requests to become a \"gang member's woman.\" In response, the gang disappeared her and her brother. These anecdotes are analogous to W.G.A.'s situation: S.R.P. crossed the gang, and they retaliated by targeting his nuclear family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Country reports and news articles corroborate this testimony. A report by the U.S. Department of State says that \"the families of gang members often face the same risks of being killed or disappearing as the gang members themselves.\" R. 290. The United Nations also reports that family members can \"also be a target for attacks and assassination by gangs, sometimes even after the person who was initially targeted by the gang in question has fled or has already been killed.\" R. 368. One news article describes a woman who went into hiding after the gang accused her husband of talking to police. R. 477-78. Another describes a man who rescued his daughter after gang members abducted and raped her. As retribution, the gang shot and killed the man's wife. R. 463. These reports are only a few examples. We see nothing in the record that calls into question W.G.A.'s claim that he was targeted because of his family membership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Despite the extensive record, the Board adopted the immigration judge's conclusion that W.G.A. had not shown a sufficient nexus because other family members continue to live in El Salvador unharmed. This is factually inaccurate. W.G.A., his mother, and his sister described how the gang continued to target the family. W.G.A.'s mother reported that she had received at least four threatening phone calls from \"angry,\" yelling gang members and that the calls continued until she threw her cell-phone chip away. W.G.A.'s\n   mother and sister described how masked gang members have appeared at their home at least twice, threatening them and demanding to know where S.R.P. and W.G.A. were. We cannot accept the immigration judge's conclusion that threatening phone calls and home invasion by masked gang members are not evidence that other family members have been harmed. Plus, as the government correctly acknowledged in oral argument, it was improper for the immigration judge to rely on a lack of harm to other family members, without more, to find that W.G.A. was not targeted on account of his kinship ties. See\n   <em>\n    R.R.D. v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4241017\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/746/807/#p809\">\n    746 F.3d 807\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 809 (7th Cir.2014) (reasoning that statute \"does not require that all members of\" the protected group \"suffer the same fate\"); see also\n   <em>\n    Cordova v. Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4156237\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/759/332/#p339\">\n    759 F.3d 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 339 (4th Cir.2014) (refusing to uphold Board's reasoning that petitioner could not have been targeted on account of his kinship ties because other family members were not targeted for same reason).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The immigration judge also relied on W.G.A.'s testimony that the gang has a personal vendetta against him. But that testimony does not actually support the immigration judge's finding. On cross-examination, the government's lawyer asked W.G.A. if the \"gangs just have a ... personal vendetta against you.\" W.G.A. responded affirmatively. But this question does not contradict the overwhelming record evidence that the gang targeted W.G.A. because of his familial relationship to S.R.P. The government did not ask W.G.A.\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   the gang had a personal vendetta against him, and the most plausible answer is because he is related to S.R.P. The record suggests only one other potential motive for the persecution. W.G.A. testified that, in 2014, members of the gang asked him to do favors for the gang and he refused. Even if W.G.A.'s refusal to help the gang in 2014 influenced the gang's decision to target him in 2015, that one fact does not undermine the overwhelming evidence showing that W.G.A.'s familial ties were one central reason for his persecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Finally, the immigration judge also improperly stressed that W.G.A.'s parents and seven siblings remain in El Salvador. This is true, although the family is so fearful that they sent their other teenage son, J.R.P., into hiding. This is not evidence of a safe family. Additionally, the fact that some family members have not relocated within El Salvador has little force in light of the rest of the record. Country reports describe how relocation is difficult and often dangerous: the choice is between remaining in the Mara 18's territory and risking retribution, or relocating to the rival gang's territory and being killed by them. A United Nations report estimates that 600,000 to 700,000 Salvadorans-or 10% of the population-are affiliated with the gangs and act as lookouts in the gangs' territories. R. 338. The record describes various incidents when gangs killed non-members who had crossed gang boundaries for innocent reasons like visiting a family member or walking to school. R. 338, 470, 547. And W.G.A. testified about a community member who went to work at a business in MS-13 territory and who, upon arrival, was asked to identify himself and where he came from. When he revealed that he lived in Mara 18 territory, the questioner told him he would be killed if he entered MS-13 territory again. Once again, W.G.A.'s testimony corroborates the indirect evidence in the record. It means little, therefore, that W.G.A.'s family has not sought to move elsewhere to avoid threats.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    Convention Against Torture\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As a third ground for relief, W.G.A. seeks to defer removal under Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   W.G.A. bears the burden of showing \"that it is more likely than not that he ... would be tortured if removed\" to El Salvador.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201208.16\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2).

Nor did they consider the strongest evidence of the risk of torture: that masked gang members raided the house of a close family friend at night and, when they found him there, murdered and dismembered him for disobeying their orders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Board also applied the wrong legal standard when it found that W.G.A. had not shown government acquiescence. The Board stated that W.G.A. had \"not indicated that there was any involvement of a public official\" in \"any of the threats directed\" at him. W.G.A. does not need to show that a public official was involved directly.\n   <em>\n    Sarhan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3837888\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/658/649/#p653\">\n    658 F.3d at 657-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Perhaps for this reason, the immigration judge and Board ignored key evidence on this point too. They did not address the extensive record that describes how corruption, judges' refusal to protect witness anonymity, and the police's fear of reprisal all allow gangs to act with a high degree of impunity. And when the agency found that the police arrested S.R.P. twice for gang activity-and therefore do not acquiesce to any torture-the agency failed to consider the evidence that gang members continue to operate from within prisons. For these reasons, we also remand W.G.A.'s claim for deferred removal under the Convention Against Torture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   We remand to the Board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. On remand, the Board must also consider two issues that we do not discuss. First, the Board must consider the immigration judge's finding that W.G.A. would be able to relocate within El Salvador. Because the immigration judge incorrectly found that W.G.A. had not been persecuted in the past, the judge applied the wrong burden on the question of relocation. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201208.13\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1208.13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(ii), 1208.16(b)(1)(ii) (placing\n   burden on government to rebut presumption when applicant shows past persecution). Second, the Board must review the immigration judge's findings that the Salvadoran government is not unable or unwilling to prevent the persecution. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Pramatarov v. Gonzales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5562500\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/454/764/#p766\">\n    454 F.3d 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 766 (7th Cir.2006), citing\n   <em>\n    Hor v.

He argues that social distinction and particularity create a conceptual trap that is difficult, if not impossible, to navigate. The applicant must identify a group that is broad enough that the society as a whole recognizes it, but not so broad that it fails particularity. And as we have stated, rejecting a social group because it is too broad \"would be akin to saying that the victims of widespread governmental ethnic cleansing cannot receive asylum simply because there are too many of them.\"\n    <em>\n     N.L.A.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4120319\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/744/425/#p438\">\n     744 F.3d at 438\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , citing\n    <em>\n     Cece\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715324\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/733/662/#p668\">\n     733 F.3d at 675\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
