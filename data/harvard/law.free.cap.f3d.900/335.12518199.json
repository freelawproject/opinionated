This minor infraction triggered a series of events that led to her untimely death in the early days of 2012. She wound up in the county jail, where she refused to eat and drink. The medical providers who worked at the Jail did little other than monitoring as she wasted away in her cell. By the time she was sent to the hospital, it was too late to save her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Alfredo Miranda, the administrator of Gomes's estate, brought an action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and assorted state-law theories against Lake County, the Jail officials (the \"County defendants\"), and Correct Care Solutions (CCS, the Jail's contract medical provider) and its employees (the \"medical defendants\"). The district court dismissed the County defendants at summary judgment. The medical defendants proceeded to trial, but halfway through the proceeding the court granted judgment as a matter of law under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a) for them on some claims. The Estate prevailed to a modest degree on another claim, and part of the case resulted in a mistrial. Our principal ruling in response to the Estate's appeal is that the Rule 50(a) judgment was premature, and so further proceedings are necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 12, 2011, an officer arrested Gomes, a 52-year-old Indian national, for failing to appear for jury duty. (In hindsight, this was the County's first misstep: as a non-citizen, Gomes was categorically ineligible to serve as a juror. 705 ILCS 305/2(a)(4).) Gomes pulled away from the officer as he attempted to arrest her. That action earned her a second charge of resisting arrest. The officers took Gomes to Lake County Jail, where she made statements that landed her on suicide watch the next day. But she did not stay at the Jail long. On October 14, Gomes was transferred to the custody of the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) service, which released her within a few days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Roughly two months later, on December 14, after failing to appear in court on the resisting-arrest charge, Gomes found herself back in the Lake County Jail. Though officials initially placed her in the general population, it quickly became apparent that her physical and mental health were deteriorating, and so she was moved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On December 16, CCS's Director of Mental Health, Jennifer Bibbiano (a social worker), performed a mental health evaluation on Gomes. Bibbiano documented that Gomes had ingested no food or water since arriving at the Jail two days earlier. As a result, Gomes was transferred the next day to the Jail's medical pod for closer monitoring. On December 18, staff placed Gomes on suicide watch and the hunger strike protocol. At that point, after she had gone four days without food or water, staff weighed her for the first time and recorded a weight of 146 pounds. Over the next ten days, this number plummeted; by December 28, Gomes weighed only 128 pounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During this period, social workers and physicians continued to assess Gomes daily. Defendant Dr. Rozel Elazegui, an internist,\n   saw Gomes on December 22 and 27. In several progress notes, the CCS staff reported various symptoms of dehydration, such as skin tenting. Gomes's refusal to eat or drink and her unresponsiveness often prevented the medical staff from recording her vital signs and collecting any blood or urine samples. For most of this time, Gomes lay in bed and refused to speak.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As Gomes's physical condition worsened, concerns about her mental state grew. When Gomes appeared in court on December 20, the judge ordered a mental fitness examination. On December 22, Gomes was identified as needing an urgent psychiatric visit. That prompted a visit two days later from psychiatrist Hargurmukh Singh, who first met Gomes then and diagnosed her with a \"psychotic disorder not otherwise specified.\" He prescribed no medication. After seeing Gomes again on December 27, Dr. Singh concluded that her psychosis rendered her unable to understand the risks of not eating and unable to participate in her treatment plan. But his only advice to Dr. Elazegui, who wanted to perform an involuntary blood draw for monitoring purposes, was that Elazegui could do so if push came to shove.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Around this time the officials in charge of Lake County Jail entered the picture. On December 26, Wayne Hunter, the Jail's acting chief, was first notified by email that Gomes was in the Jail and was refusing medical treatment and tests. Hunter received assurances that CCS staff were monitoring Gomes's condition and that they would provide him with any updates. Two days later, Hunter personally went down to Gomes's cell in a futile attempt to persuade her to eat. On December 27, Scott Fitch, the liaison between the correctional and medical staff, learned about Gomes. He too asked for updates. Fitch called Gomes's public defender, entreating her to visit and encourage her client to eat. Sheriff Mark Curran did not hear about Gomes until December 29, the day she left the Jail. That same day, Jail officials went to court to get Gomes formally released from custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Also on December 29, Dr. Young Kim, another CCS internist, returned to work from a vacation. Dr. Kim was surprised to learn that Gomes had remained in the Jail while continuing to refuse all food and drink. (A few stray comments in Gomes's medical records suggest that she may have rubbed water on her body and perhaps taken a few sips of water from her sink. But the record as a whole implies little to no water intake.) Dr. Kim immediately called an ambulance to take Gomes to the hospital for evaluation and treatment of her dehydration and psychosis. Unfortunately, this intervention came too late. On January 3, 2012, five days after arriving at the hospital, Gomes died. The autopsy opined that she died of \"Complications of Starvation and Dehydration.\" The manner of death was suicide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Estate filed this action against Lake County, Sheriff Curran, Hunter, Fitch, CCS, Dr. Elazegui, Dr. Singh, Bibbiano, and two more social workers, Ruth Muuru and Edith Jones. It raised due process claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , state statutory and common law tort claims, violations of international treaty obligations, and claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012101\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Only the claims against the medical defendants went to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   But the jury never had the opportunity to resolve some of those claims. At the close of the Estate's presentation of evidence, the court entered judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(a) for social workers Muuru and Jones on all claims\n   against them. The court also concluded that the Estate had failed to present enough evidence to reach the jury on the question whether the medical defendants caused Gomes's death; it therefore granted them judgment as a matter of law on that part of the case. The only question remaining for the jury was the Estate's due process claim for inadequate medical care, limited to the pain and suffering Gomes experienced while in the Jail. The jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict regarding the conduct of Dr. Elazegui and Dr. Singh but it held social worker Bibbiano liable. It awarded the Estate $119,000 in compensatory damages, which Bibbiano has paid in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Estate does not challenge the jury verdict, but it takes issue with four aspects of the proceedings below: first, the district court's dismissal of the County defendants; second, the judgment as a matter of law on causation of death; third, the court's ruling barring the Estate from pursuing one of its theories of recovery under the Due Process Clause; and fourth, the court's instruction on the applicable legal standard. While we find no merit in its first point, we conclude on the latter three that the Estate is entitled to the opportunity to try its full case against the medical defendants before a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We start with the Estate's attempt to revive some of the claims against the County defendants. It first challenges the district court's conclusion that the Jail's chief, Hunter, and liaison, Fitch, were not deliberately indifferent to Gomes's inadequate medical care in violation of her due process rights. We need not delve into the nuances of the standard for such a claim, because the Estate faces an insurmountable hurdle independent of that standard. We have long recognized the fact that correctional institutions (like most entities in a modern economy) engage in the division of labor. See\n   <em>\n    Greeno v. Daley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8970445\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/414/645/#p656\">\n    414 F.3d 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 656 (7th Cir. 2005) (citation omitted). When detainees are under the care of medical experts, non-medical jail staff may generally trust the professionals to provide appropriate medical attention.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Rice ex rel.

We will not find a jail official to have acted with deliberate indifference if she reasonably relied on the judgment of medical personnel.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Greeno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8970445\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/414/645/#p656\">\n    414 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   655-56 ;\n   <em>\n    Estate of Perry v.

On the other hand, if jail officials had reason to know that their medical staff were failing to treat or inadequately treating an inmate, liability is possible.\n   <em>\n    King v. Kramer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3882483\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/680/1013/#p1018\">\n    680 F.3d 1013\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1018 (7th Cir. 2012) ;\n   <em>\n    Rice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3751646\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/675/650/#p676\">\n    675 F.3d at 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Nothing in this record justifies a finding of personal liability against the County defendants. Hunter and Fitch received assurances that CCS staff were regularly monitoring Gomes. They requested periodic updates on her condition. The medical providers informed Hunter and Fitch that Gomes was stable and promised to send her to the hospital if necessary. Knowing that the CCS employees were on the case, Hunter and Fitch were entitled to rely on their professional judgments. See\n   <em>\n    Arnett v. Webster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3837972\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/658/742/#p756\">\n    658 F.3d 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 756 (7th Cir. 2011) (\"This is not a case where [the plaintiff] was being completely ignored by medical staff.\"). The fact that they expressed concern about Gomes's\n   condition and tried directly and indirectly to get her to eat does not make them culpable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Because we find that Fitch and Hunter's reasonable reliance on their medical providers shields them from liability under section 1983, we need not consider the County defendants' alternative arguments for dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   While the Estate has apparently abandoned its claim that Sheriff Curran is individually liable for Gomes's inadequate medical care, it is still trying to pursue an official-capacity claim about the Jail's allegedly deficient hunger-strike policy. As an Illinois sheriff, Curran has final policymaking authority over jail operations.\n   <em>\n    DeGenova v.

Ind. Dep't of Corr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277402\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/849/372/#p379\">\n    849 F.3d 372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 379 (7th Cir. 2017) (\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The focus of the Estate's\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim is Lake County Jail's hunger-strike policy. That policy required four things: (1) the immediate notification of medical staff when an inmate begins a hunger strike; (2) documentation of meal refusals and immediate notification of a command officer after an inmate's third consecutive meal refusal; (3) the command's investigation and communication with medical staff as needed; and (4) a conference including the health services administrator and the chief or deputy chief of corrections about the best course of action. The Estate finds the policy lacking in some respects, including the timing of notification and consultation, follow-up procedures if the hunger strike continues, methods to review past suicidality, and guidance on what to look for and how to document an inmate's condition on suicide watch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Estate's concerns may be valid, but it has not shown that the Sheriff was deliberately indifferent in enacting this policy. Though hunger strikes may be common in jails, as\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   suggest, Gomes went longer without food and water than anyone else in the Jail's experience. This does not give the Sheriff a free pass, since a single incident can be enough for liability where a constitutional violation was highly foreseeable.\n   <em>\n    Woodward v. Corr. Med. Serv. of Ill., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9246932\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/368/917/#p929\">\n    368 F.3d 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 929 (7th Cir. 2004) (rejecting the notion of a \" 'one free suicide' pass\"). But this is not a case in which the Jail knew that hunger strikes were a risk yet did nothing. It had a system in place, and that system included a series of reasonable measures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Estate presented no evidence that would allow a trier of fact to conclude that some feature in the Jail's policy caused Gomes's death. Once Jail staff learned about her refusal to eat or drink, they stayed in regular communication with CCS's medical personnel. See\n   <em>\n    Belbachir v. Cnty. of McHenry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4074211\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/726/975/#p983\">\n    726 F.3d 975\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 983 (7th Cir. 2013). It is unclear whether anyone connected the dots between Gomes's suicidal statements in October and her condition in December, but that is irrelevant because staff identified Gomes as actively suicidal almost from the start of her second detention. There is no reason to think that additional guidance in the hunger-strike policy would have made a difference in Gomes's deterioration. Summary judgment was appropriate on this\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We can be brief with the Estate's complaint that the County defendants failed to comply with their international treaty obligations. Article 36 of the Vienna Convention guarantees a foreign national the right to have her home country's consular office notified when she is detained. Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, art. 36, Apr. 24, 1963, 21 U.S.T. 77 ;\n   <em>\n    Sandoval v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675919\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/574/847/#p850\">\n    574 F.3d 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 850 (7th Cir. 2009). When Gomes, an Indian national, was detained in October, ICE officials informed her of her Article 36 rights. No one repeated this advice when Gomes was taken back into custody in December. Still, we think summary judgment is appropriate, though for reasons different from those mentioned by the district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The district court was concerned that the Estate failed to mention section 1983 when raising this claim, see\n   <em>\n    Jogi v. Voges\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3896559\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/480/822/#p825\">\n    480 F.3d 822\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 825 (7th Cir. 2007) (\n   <em>\n    Jogi II\n   </em>\n   ), but \"complaints need not plead legal theories,\" and so that alone does not support dismissal, see\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3896559\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/480/822/#p825\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3896559\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/480/822/#p825\">\n    at 826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Another strike against the Estate, according to the district court, was the lack of evidence connecting Gomes's death with the failure to notify. Indeed, when given the opportunity to speak with the Indian consulate in October, Gomes chose not to do so. Nonetheless, we have yet to explore the question whether a plaintiff is required to show actual harm in order to recover for an Article 36 violation, or if this is more in the nature of a failure to receive required\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We need not wrestle with that issue now, however, because our case is easily resolved on the more straightforward ground of qualified immunity. The County officials are immune from suit if it was not clearly established in 2011 that their conduct violated the Vienna Convention. See\n   <em>\n    Pearson v. Callahan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679212\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/223/#p245\">\n    555 U.S. 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 245,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679212\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/223/#p245\">\n    129 S.Ct. 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679212\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/223/#p245\">\n    172 L.Ed.2d 565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). Article 36 charges \"competent authorities\" with notifying foreign nationals. The term \"competent authorities\" includes booking officers.\n   <em>\n    Mordi v. Zeigler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266862\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/770/1161/#p1166\">\n    770 F.3d 1161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1166-1167 (7th Cir. 2014). Consistent with this precedent, the Jail's written policy places the notification obligation exclusively with booking officers. But the Estate did not sue the officer who booked Gomes. And, as we acknowledged in 2014, the boundaries of who else might qualify as a competent authority have \"yet to be fixed.\"\n   <em>\n    Mordi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266862\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/770/1161/#p1166\">\n    770 F.3d at 1167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Elazegui and Singh's inaction diminished Gomes's chances of survival. First, it shows that she died from starvation and dehydration. Under Illinois law, autopsy reports are\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   evidence of their findings and conclusions, including cause of death. 725 ILCS 5/115-5.1. The report here did not mince words about Gomes's cause of death-\"Complications of Starvation and Dehydration\"-or her manner of death-\"suicide.\" The coroner implicitly ruled out the possibility that Gomes died from any hospital-based illnesses or other causes. The report is clear: not eating or drinking caused her death. (Hospital records underscore this conclusion. On the day she arrived at the hospital, Gomes was already experiencing acute liver and renal failure. For present purposes, however, we disregard these records, because they were excluded from trial at the request of the medical defendants, and the Estate has not challenged that exclusion on appeal.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Moreover, the Estate's expert witnesses testified that the doctors' failure to transfer Gomes to the hospital sooner allowed her deterioration to reach a dangerous point. Psychiatry expert Dr. James Gilligan repeatedly testified that Dr. Singh contributed to Gomes's death by failing to initiate her transfer from the Jail to the hospital. Furthermore, Dr. Singh (a psychiatrist, recall) knew that Gomes was clinically incompetent, but he took no steps to treat her even though she was endangering her life. Dr. Gilligan concluded that Dr. Singh's \"failure to act ... contributed to [Gomes's] death.\" Internal medicine expert Dr. Jack Raba testified that Gomes's pulse on December 25 was an \"ominous sign,\" raising the possibility of cardiovascular problems, electrolyte or metabolic imbalances, or renal failure. He added that Gomes's blood pressure clearly indicated dehydration. Dr. Raba said it was \"impossible\" not to consider that Gomes was starting to show signs of organ failure. These \"absolute signs\" signaled that Gomes urgently needed to be admitted to a hospital for bloodwork and possibly forced feeding and medication. Dr. Raba concluded that Dr. Elazegui's failure to intervene \"contributed to [Gomes's] ultimate demise and death.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The prison doctors' testimony lent support to Dr. Raba's expert opinion on causation. When Dr. Elazegui spoke with Gomes\n   on December 22, he informed her that starvation risked organ failure and death. He asked to be informed when her weight loss hit 18%, since that number indicates an increased risk of organ failure. Dr. Kim's testimony was also relevant to the causation question. When he returned from vacation, he was concerned that Gomes could go into respiratory failure or cardiac arrest at any minute (and unlike the others, he promptly acted on this concern).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Taken together, this evidence was enough to support an inference on the jury's part that the delay in sending Gomes to the hospital resulted in her death, or at least lessened her chance of survival.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Our analysis applies with equal force to the Estate's state malpractice claims. See 740 ILCS 180/1. Under this theory, the Estate had to show that the physicians' negligent failure to comply with the standard of care proximately caused Gomes's injury.

See Seventh Circuit Pattern Civil Jury Instruction 7.19 (rev. 2017) (an element of a failure-to-protect-from-self-harm claim is that the defendant was aware or strongly suspected a strong likelihood of serious self-harm). The court attached particular weight to testimony from Gomes's family members and the administrator that she was a devout Catholic who had no history of mental illness and would not have committed suicide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In the past, we have taken into account jail officials' knowledge of a decedent's mental health history or warnings from family members, as that information pertains to the defendants' subjective awareness of a problem.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Payne for Hicks v.

But that is not the use to which the court put the testimony of Gomes's family. It jumped from the fact that Gomes was a Catholic to an assumption that the defendants were aware of her religious affiliation, but there is no evidence that they knew any such thing. Furthermore, mental illness and suicide regrettably afflict devout members of all religious groups. While a jury could consider testimony from Gomes's family when assessing this theory of recovery, it was not the court's role to accept the family opinion as an undisputed fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   And in any event, the trial record was filled with evidence supporting a finding that the medical defendants knew that Gomes was at great risk of death by starvation and dehydration, and that she was unable to think rationally. On December\n   27, Dr. Singh deemed her not competent and concluded that she did not understand the risks of refusing to eat. Before then, CCS staff documented Gomes's suicidal ideation and placed her on suicide watch. Dr. Elazegui had warned Gomes that if she continued to refuse nutrition, she could die. The defendants' records reveal that they were aware that Gomes was at serious risk of causing her own death. The district court abused its discretion by prohibiting the Estate from pursuing this line of argument. At the next trial, the Estate must be allowed to argue this theory of recovery to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Finally, we consider whether the district court properly instructed the jury on intent.

We begin with the fact that the Supreme Court has been signaling that courts must pay careful attention to the different status of pretrial detainees. In this respect,\n   <em>\n    Kingsley\n   </em>\n   does not stand alone. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Manuel v.

We see nothing in the logic the Supreme Court used in\n   <em>\n    Kingsley\n   </em>\n   that would support this kind of dissection of the different types of claims that arise under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. To the contrary, the Court said that \"[t]he language of the [Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments] differs, and the nature of the claims often differs.

As to the second, whether to interpret the defendant's physical acts in the world as involving force that was \"excessive,\" there is a dispute. We conclude with respect to that question that the relevant standard is objective not subjective.

As applicable here, the first of those inquiries asks whether the medical defendants acted purposefully, knowingly, or perhaps even recklessly when they considered the consequences of their handling of Gomes's case.

A properly instructed jury could find that Drs.

(The jury could also reject such a conclusion.) It would be a different matter if, for example, the medical defendants had forgotten that Gomes was in the jail, or mixed up her chart with that of another detainee, or if Dr. Elazegui forgot to take over coverage for Dr. Kim when he went on vacation. Such negligence would be insufficient to support liability under the Fourteenth Amendment, even though it might support state-law liability. Here, there is evidence that Drs. Elazegui and Singh deliberately chose a \"wait and see\" monitoring plan, knowing that Gomes was neither eating nor drinking nor competent to care for herself. See\n   <em>\n    Glisson\n   </em>\n   , 849 F.3d at 380, 382 (recognizing inaction as a choice).
