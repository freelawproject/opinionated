McCarns raises eight issues on appeal, including that the district court failed to comply with the Speedy Trial Act and that the district court erred at sentencing by increasing McCarns' offense level for being a manager or supervisor. We address these two issues in this published opinion and all other issues in an unpublished memorandum disposition filed concurrently with this opinion. We affirm McCarns' conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The scheme at the center of this case is as follows. Co-defendant Charles Head established a trio of entities-one that solicited distressed homeowners, one that recruited straw buyers, and a third that obtained mortgages from lenders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   McCarns worked with the first entity as a salesperson; his job was to convince homeowners to participate in the scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The scheme would identify distressed homeowners who had equity in their homes. Salespeople, including McCarns, would approach these homeowners with a proposal-sell your home to an \"investor\" for one year, repair your credit during that year by making monthly \"rent\" payments while staying in your home, then repurchase your home at the end of the year. The scheme was pitched as a way for distressed homeowners to stay in their homes while regaining their financial footing, but actually involved a series of fraudulent transactions and regularly resulted in the victims losing their homes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The scheme accomplished its hidden agenda by identifying \"investors\"-who were really straw buyers for the defendants-to purchase the homes. The defendants would create fraudulent loan applications for the straw buyers, allowing them to secure mortgages for up to 100% of the value of the victims' homes. When a lender issued a mortgage, the defendants would pay off the victim's original mortgage, make a small upfront payment to the victim, pay a fee to the straw buyer, and keep the remainder of the proceeds. This series of transactions allowed the defendants to extract the equity that had accumulated in the victims' homes and essentially left the victims as renters. If the victims missed \"rent\" payments, the defendants would evict them and sell the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In February 2010, the Government filed a superseding indictment charging McCarns with one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   One of McCarns' co-defendants was Charles Head, the leader of the scheme. Head was charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and mail fraud.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Prior to trial, McCarns filed a motion to dismiss the charges against him for violation of the Speedy Trial Act. The motion was denied. McCarns and Head proceeded to a jury trial and were convicted on all counts in December 2013. On September 21, 2016, McCarns was sentenced to 168 months of imprisonment, followed by 36 months of supervised release. McCarns was later ordered to pay $4.9 million in restitution, pursuant to a stipulation agreed to by McCarns and the Government. McCarns timely filed two notices of appeal, one after sentencing and the other after the order of restitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The district court had jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203231\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The district court denied McCarns' motion to dismiss, concluding that its explanations for the various trial continuances satisfied the requirement in \u00a7 3161(h)(7)(A) that the district court explain the reasons for its \"ends of justice\" findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   McCarns does not dispute that the three challenged continuances were factually supported by the complexity of the case and counsel's need for more time to adequately prepare. Instead, McCarns argues that the district court failed to make the requisite \"ends of justice\" findings on the record when it referred to local codes T2 and T4. McCarns maintains that the district court's references to the local codes in General Order 479 were only \"reasons that could support\" the \"ends of justice\" findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   McCarns' argument fails because the Speedy Trial Act only requires a district court to state \"its\n   <em>\n    reasons\n   </em>\n   for finding that the ends of justice served by granting of such continuance outweigh the best interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203161\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(7)(A) (emphasis added).

A district court's \"discussion of the statutory factors is adequate to support a continuance that serves the ends of justice\" when it is clear that the district court \"considered the factors in \u00a7 3161(h) ( [7] )(B) and determined that the continuance was merited based on\" the applicable factor or factors.\n   <em>\n    Medina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3823269\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/524/974/#p982\">\n    524 F.3d at 986\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Each of the three challenged continuances occurred at the end of a status conference during which counsel for the parties described the need to review voluminous discovery and then engage in motions practice prior to trial. During the status conferences, the court discussed the complexity of the case and the parties' need for more time for adequate preparation. At the end of each conference, the district judge continued the trial to a certain date and stated the local codes that justified each continuance. The district court's use of the local codes creates an adequate record of the reasons for its \"ends of justice\" findings because the local codes clearly identify the statutory factors that the district court considered when granting the continuances.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3823269\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/524/974/#p982\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

But when the petitioners were originally sentenced, \"the [district] court discarded the advisory ranges in favor of the mandatory minimum sentences\" because \"the top end of the Guidelines range fell below the applicable mandatory minimum sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203582\">\n    at 1787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (referring to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(b) ).

At sentencing, defense counsel argued that \"the 20 year[ ] [statutory maximum] [wa]s where the court need[ed] to start, not 360 to life.\" The district court agreed, explaining that it \"do[es]n't think about that guideline range when there is a statutory maximum.\" The district court further disclaimed that the Guidelines range \"d[id] not inform [its] thinking in any way whatsoever.\" As explained in\n   <em>\n    Koons\n   </em>\n   , McCarns' sentence was therefore based on the statutory maximum, not the calculated Guidelines range.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   138 S.Ct. at 1787-89.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    McCarns was initially indicted in March 2008.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    The Government had previously indicted Head and McCarns, along with other co-defendants, in February 2008 on separate charges of conspiracy to commit mail fraud, mail fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.
