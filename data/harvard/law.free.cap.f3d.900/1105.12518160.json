The statute is silent as to which party bears the burden of\n   introducing evidence at trial to establish the debt collector's net worth.

After Tourgeman's account allegedly became delinquent, Dell Financial Services charged off and sold the purported debt to Collins Financial Services. Paragon Way, Inc., Collins's affiliated debt-collection company, sent several letters encouraging Tourgeman to pay the alleged debt. Collins then referred Tourgeman's file to the law firm of Nelson &amp; Kennard, which sent Tourgeman another collection letter. All of these letters identified the original creditor as American Investment Bank, rather than CIT Online Bank. When Tourgeman did not respond to Nelson &amp; Kennard's letter, the law firm filed a collection complaint against Tourgeman in state court. The state court complaint, like the collection letters, misidentified Tourgeman's original creditor as American Investment Bank. Tourgeman responded to the complaint by retaining counsel. Nelson &amp; Kennard ultimately dismissed the lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Tourgeman brought suit against Nelson &amp; Kennard and other entities allegedly involved in collecting his disputed debt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   He claimed that the letters and complaint violated the FDCPA by using \"false, deceptive, or misleading representation[s] or means in connection with the collection of any debt.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e.

We disagree. In light of the statutory text and structure, we conclude that Congress intended the plaintiff to carry the burden at trial of introducing evidence of the defendant's net worth.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Section 1692k of the FDCPA imposes civil liability against \"any debt collector who fails to comply with any provision of this subchapter with respect to any person[.]\" \u00a7 1692k(a). Class members are entitled to \"additional,\" or statutory damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   \u00a7 1692k(a)(2). The statute provides a two-step determination for awarding statutory damages to class members, excluding named plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1692k(a)-(b). First, the factfinder determines the damages ceiling: a class may recover statutory damages \"not to exceed the lesser of $500,000 or 1 per centum of the net worth of the debt collector[.]\" \u00a7 1692k(a)(2)(B). Within that range, the exact amount of damages is determined based on various non-exhaustive factors, including:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   the frequency and persistence of noncompliance by the debt collector, the nature of such noncompliance, the resources of the debt collector, the number of persons adversely affected, and the extent to which the debt collector's noncompliance was intentional.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00a7 1692k(b)(2). The damages provision is silent as to which party carries the burden of producing evidence at trial of the defendant's net worth.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1692k.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The parties agree that one percent of Nelson &amp; Kennard's net worth is less than\n   $500,000. Accordingly, the limit on statutory damages available to the class must be one percent of Nelson &amp; Kennard's net worth. Tourgeman conceded below that he could not produce any competent evidence of this amount at trial.

Because evidence of net worth is crucial to establish the class's entitlement to statutory damages, the burden of production at trial is properly placed on the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The structure of \u00a7 1692k further supports our conclusion that Congress did not intend to shift the burden of production to the debt collector.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   a\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The FDCPA provides a dual-step formula for calculating class statutory damages. The factfinder first determines the defendant's maximum liability. \u00a7 1692k(a)(2)(B). It next \"determin[es] the amount of liability in any action\n   <em>\n    under subsection (a)\n   </em>\n   \" based on a non-exhaustive list of factors. \u00a7 1692k(b) (emphasis added). The factfinder thus determines the appropriate award of statutory damages within the permissible range first established under subsection (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Tourgeman urges us to adopt a different interpretation. He contends that the factfinder can simply skip the cap analysis in subsection (a) and proceed directly to the list of factors in subsection (b), on which he concedes he carries the burden of proof. Under Tourgeman's theory, the factfinder may award any amount, which the debt collector can subsequently attempt to limit based on evidence of its net worth. Beyond ignoring the plain language of \u00a7 1692k(a)(2)(B), discussed above, Tourgeman would have us simply overlook the analysis Congress enacted for calculating entitlement to damages.
