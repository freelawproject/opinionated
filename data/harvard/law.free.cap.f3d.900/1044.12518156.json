FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 1998, Ricardo Guizar-Rodriguez, a citizen of Mexico, was convicted in Nevada of battery committed with the use of a deadly weapon.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Nev.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20200.481\">\n    Nev.

The Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") determined that battery committed with the use of a deadly weapon under Nevada law was an aggravated felony and ordered Guizar-Rodriguez's removal on that basis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Guizar-Rodriguez was removed from this country.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 1999, Guizar-Rodriguez illegally reentered the United States. In 2004, Guizar-Rodriguez was again removed, this time based on his illegal reentry. After his second deportation, Guizar-Rodriguez again reentered the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 20, 2016, a Nevada grand jury indicted Guizar-Rodriguez with unlawful reentry. Guizar-Rodriguez moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that his initial deportation was unlawful, because battery committed with the use of a deadly weapon under Nevada law is not an aggravated felony. The district court rejected this argument. Consequently, Guizar-Rodriguez pleaded guilty but reserved the right to challenge the district court's ruling on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In response, the Nevada legislature had amended its burglary statute to prescribe an enhancement when the burglar \"has in his or her\n   <em>\n    possession\n   </em>\n   or gains\n   <em>\n    possession\n   </em>\n   of any firearm or deadly weapon at any time during the commission of the crime.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Nev.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20205.060\">\n    Nev.

Nothing in the text of the statute or Nevada precedent suggests such an interpretation. In\n   <em>\n    Moore v. State\n   </em>\n   , the Nevada Supreme Court interpreted the word \"uses\" with respect to a\n   section 193.165\"deadly weapon\" sentencing enhancement.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9274692\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/117/659/\">\n    117 Nev. 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9274692\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/117/659/\">\n    27 P.3d 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 449 (2001). The court invoked the rule of lenity and held that \"[t]he verb 'use' connotes 'to put into action or service' and 'to carry out a purpose or action by means of.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9274692\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/117/659/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, in order to receive the sentencing enhancement in section 193.165, a criminal must \" 'put' a deadly weapon 'into action' to commit the [underlying] crime.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9274692\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/117/659/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Section 200.481(2)(e)(1) requires that the battery be \"committed with the use of a deadly weapon.\" Guizar-Rodriguez has not shown that \"use\" would be interpreted differently in section 200.481. Furthermore, the Nevada legislature has shown that it differentiates between \"use\" and \"possession\" of a deadly weapon. As we have already discussed, the Nevada Supreme Court determined that the sentencing enhancement in section 193.165 could not apply to burglary, because the enhancement requires \"use\" of a deadly weapon.\n   <em>\n    Carr v. Sheriff, Clark Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4801823\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/95/688/\">\n    95 Nev. 688\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4801823\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/95/688/\">\n    601 P.2d 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 424 (1979). Subsequently, the Nevada legislature amended its burglary statute to prescribe an enhancement when the burglar \"has in his or her\n   <em>\n    possession\n   </em>\n   or gains\n   <em>\n    possession\n   </em>\n   of any firearm or deadly weapon at any time during the commission of the crime.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Nev.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20205.060\">\n    Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 205.060\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    Funderburk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3710004\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/125/260/\">\n    212 P.3d at 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, had the legislature meant to allow a conviction under section 200.481(2)(e)(1) when a person merely possesses a deadly weapon, it would have said so. Guizar-Rodriguez has not shown a realistic probability that mere possession of a deadly weapon would satisfy the requirements of section 200.481(2)(e)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Because a violation of section 200.481(2)(e)(1) requires committing a battery \"with the use of a deadly weapon,\" it is a categorical crime of violence. As we have previously determined, \"even the 'least touching' with a deadly weapon or instrument ... is violent in nature.\"\n   <em>\n    Grajeda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755018\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/581/1186/#p1192\">\n    581 F.3d at 1192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
