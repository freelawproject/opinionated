The district court granted summary judgment for Defendant on the grounds that Plaintiff's federal claims were barred by\n   the common law tender-back doctrine. Because we conclude that the tender-back doctrine does not apply to claims brought under Title VII and the Equal Pay Act, we\n   <strong>\n    REVERSE\n   </strong>\n   the district court's judgment and\n   <strong>\n    REMAND\n   </strong>\n   for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2008, Defendant Midwest Machining, Inc., a maker of component parts for complex tools and machines, hired Plaintiff Jena McClellan as a telemarketer and quickly promoted her to work in their \"inside sales\" department. In late August of 2015, Plaintiff announced to her employer that she was pregnant. According to Plaintiff, her supervisor made negative comments for weeks in response to the announcement, including \"commenting sardonically and jealously about her perfect life,\" (R. 1, Compl., PageID # 3), and was annoyed by Plaintiff's absences for pre-natal appointments. About three months later, Plaintiff was terminated \"[d]espite [her] many years of service for the company in its inside sales department and no record of discipline in over six years.\" (R. 33, Second S. J. Order PageID # 230.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff testified that on the day of termination, Philip Allor, Midwest's president, called her into his office. There, he presented Plaintiff with an agreement and said that she \"needed to sign then if [she] wanted any severance.\" (R. 17-3, McClellan Aff., PageID # 90.) As the district court explained, although the two reviewed the agreement together, \"Allor did not ensure McClellan's understanding as they went along at a rapid pace.\" (R. 33, Second S. J. Order, PageID # 231 (citing R. 31-4, McClellan Dep., PageID # 202).) Plaintiff testified that she felt bullied throughout the meeting, that she felt she could not ask any further questions, and that Allor's tone was \"raised\" during the entire conversation. (R. 31-4, McClellan Dep., PageID # 203-04.) \"[W]hen McClellan challenged a paragraph early on, and stated, 'I still should have had one week [of vacation] left,' Allor forcefully replied, '[you] do not,' and moved on.\" (R. 33, Second S. J. Order, PageID # 231 (citing R. 31-4, McClellan Dep., PageID # 202).) Plaintiff also testified that Allor shut the door and she did not feel free to leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"Feeling pressured,\" Plaintiff signed the agreement, without the benefit of a lawyer. (R. 17-3, McClellan Aff., PageID # 90.) The agreement provided that Plaintiff would waive \"any and all past, current and future claims\" she had against Midwest. (R. 16-1, Severance Agreement, PageID # 62.) Plaintiff would later affirm that she \"did not understand that the 'claims' referred to in ... the severance agreement meant discrimination complaints.\" (R. 17-3, McClellan Aff., PageID # 90.) Instead, she \"assumed it referred to any unpaid wages or benefits.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Under the terms of the Severance Agreement, Defendant Midwest agreed to pay Plaintiff $4,000, payable in eight weekly installments beginning November 27, 2015. Defendant made each payment and Plaintiff accepted them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which issued her a right-to-sue letter on August 11, 2016. On November 6, 2016, Plaintiff met with an attorney and explained what had transpired during her employment with Midwest. Given that any Title VII claim was about to expire, Plaintiff's attorney \"immediately drafted a lawsuit.\" (R. 17-2, Piper Aff., PageID # 83.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On November 9, 2016, Plaintiff filed a complaint, naming Midwest Machining,\n   Inc. and Self Lube, Inc. as defendants. The complaint alleges that Midwest \"terminated Ms. McClellan because of her pregnancy.\" (R. 1, Compl., PageID # 4.) It also accuses Midwest of maintaining a sex-segregated workforce insofar as \"all 20 or so people who worked in inside sales ... were women,\" and \"all three people who worked in outside sales were men.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # 2.) The complaint further avers that Midwest \"paid male outside sales persons substantially higher commissions and paid them substantially more overall than female inside sales persons, even though the positions required substantially similar duties, requirements, equal skill, effort and responsibility, under the same or similar working conditions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # 3.) The suit brought claims for \"pregnancy discrimination\" under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(k), under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981a, and under the Michigan Elliot-Larsen Civil Rights Act, MCL 37.2101\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (Count I); and for equal pay violations under the Equal Pay Act (\"EPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20206\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , under the Michigan Minimum Wage Law of 1964, MCL 408.381\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (repealed 2014), and under the Elliot-Larsen Act (Count II).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After receiving Plaintiff's complaint, Midwest's counsel informed Plaintiff's counsel of the severance agreement. On or around December 1, 2016, about three weeks after Plaintiff filed suit and before any responsive pleading was due, Plaintiff sent a letter to Midwest, at the direction of her attorney, saying that she was \"rescinding the severance agreement ... because [she] want[ed] to litigate matters relating to [her] former employment and termination.\" (R. 17-2, McClellan Letter, PageID # 85; R. 17-2, Piper Aff., PageID # 83.) Enclosed with the letter was a check for $4,000. Midwest responded by returning the check to Plaintiff a week later, asserting that \"[t]here is no legal basis for rescinding the severance agreement.\" (R. 17-2, Midwest Resp., PageID # 87.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On February 24, 2016, Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the severance agreement barred Plaintiff's claims. They further argued that Plaintiff's claims were also barred because she did not \"tender back\" the monetary consideration she received under the severance agreement before commencing her lawsuit. On April 18, 2017, the district court granted in part and denied in part Defendants' motion for summary judgment. The court dismissed Defendant Self Lube, Inc., holding that there was no such legal entity known as Self Lube, which instead is a valid assumed name for Midwest Machining, Inc. The court then denied summary judgment for Defendant Midwest without prejudice and held that \"at this stage and on this factual record, the Court cannot conclude the release was valid under federal law.\" (R. 19, First S. J. Order, PageID # 101.) The court permitted the parties to conduct discovery limited to the issue of whether Plaintiff \"knowingly and voluntarily executed the agreement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # 102-04.) The court also ordered further briefing as to whether federal law required a plaintiff to tender back any consideration received under a severance agreement before commencing suit under Title VII and the EPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On May 30, 2017, Defendant Midwest Machining, Inc. filed a renewed motion for summary judgment. And on August 3, 2017, the court granted it. The court held that genuine disputes of material fact precluded summary judgment on the issue of whether Plaintiff \"knowingly\" and \"voluntarily\" executed the severance agreement. Indeed, the court found that on the morning\n   Plaintiff signed the agreement, \"she was 'blindsided' by an unexpected meeting\" to terminate her employment; \"she felt 'bullied,' did not feel free to leave the room, and did not feel like she could ask any questions.\" (R. 33, Second S. J. Order, PageID # 232.) Further, Philip Allor had \"insisted [Plaintiff] sign the agreement and forcefully said if she wanted any money after her abrupt termination, she would need to sign the agreement; she had no time to consider whether to sign the release, and certainly no time to consult with a lawyer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The court added that Plaintiff \"received a small sum of money to extinguish any claims if she truly suffered unlawful discrimination\" and found that \"she did not understand the broad scope of the agreement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Based on these facts, the district court concluded that a jury could find that Plaintiff did not enter into the agreement knowingly and voluntarily.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Nonetheless, the district court granted summary judgment for Midwest based on \"the common-law doctrines of release and tender back.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # 229.) The court held that, even if a severance agreement is voidable on grounds of duress or involuntariness, a plaintiff will still ratify the contract unless she \"return[s] the consideration\" as a precondition to filing suit, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # 233), and Plaintiff \"did not 'tender back' [the consideration] prior to filing suit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID # 232.) The court did not mention that Plaintiff had offered to tender back the money shortly after filing suit. The court declined to exercise supplement jurisdiction over her state law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff subsequently filed a timely notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The court held that, under the tender-back doctrine, \"even if a party signs a release under duress, she must 'as a condition precedent to suit, ... return the consideration in exchange for a release.' \" (R. 33, Second S.

At the heart of this appeal is whether the tender-back doctrine applies to claims brought under Title VII and the EPA, a question of first impression in this Circuit. We now hold that a plaintiff is not required to tender back consideration received under a severance agreement before bringing claims for violations of Title VII or the EPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In a number of unpublished opinions, we have discussed the application of the tender-back doctrine to other federal statutes. For instance, in\n   <em>\n    Samms v. Quanex Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=99%20F.3d%201139\">\n    99 F.3d 1139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir.1996) (unpublished table decision), this Court endorsed the tender-back doctrine in the context of a claim brought under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\"), where the plaintiff had not tendered back money received in exchange for signing a release before filing suit. We recognized, however, that \"[t]here are times when, as a matter of public policy, courts have refused to apply the tender back doctrine.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. Then, in\n   <em>\n    Bittinger v. Tecumseh Prods.

The Court did not explicitly address the tender-back rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The only published decision from this Court identified by the parties that discusses the tender-back doctrine in the context of a release of federal claims is\n   <em>\n    Raczak v. Ameritech Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"918\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/103/1257/\">\n    103 F.3d 1257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6th Cir.1997). In\n   <em>\n    Raczak\n   </em>\n   , Judge Jones rendered the opinion of the Court on the tender-back issue, writing that he \"[did] not believe Plaintiffs are required to tender back the consideration they received as a precondition to bringing suit against\n   the Defendants under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"918\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/103/1257/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"918\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/103/1257/\">\n    at 1268-69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Judge Jones reasoned as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [T]o require Plaintiffs to tender back benefits would be inequitable. A tender-back requirement would deter meritorious ADEA filings. Potential Plaintiffs would be faced with the Hobsonian choice of releasing their claims and receiving payments immediately or filing an age discrimination claim that would likely take years to resolve. It is doubtful that few claimants would choose the latter. If Plaintiffs had already received release consideration they would have to recover any amounts spent before they could bring a claim.

Indeed, the dissent cites to numerous state commercial cases to explain how the tender-back doctrine should apply to the instant case and even admonishes the majority that \"there is no federal general common law.\" (internal quotation marks, alteration, and citation omitted). But of course, the dissent also acknowledges that \"[b]oth the Supreme Court and the Sixth Circuit have broadly stated that federal law governs the validity of an agreement to release a federal cause of action.\" Contrary to the dissent, the issues presented by this case require us to look to federal law, not to state law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    The dissent's refusal to look away from state law helps explain the confusion in its preferred approach to the tender-back doctrine. After presenting a largely superfluous history lesson on the doctrine's application in courts of law and courts of equity, the dissent suggests that \"[t]o decide which version of the rule to apply courts should consider the requested remedy.\" If the requested remedy is damages, then, the dissent argues, the rule should be strict and it should require the return of consideration before initiating suit; if, however, the remedy requested is an equitable one, then the rule should be more flexible, asking whether the plaintiff returned the consideration within a reasonable time. Thus, the dissent would remand this case to the district court to analyze the remedies Plaintiff seeks and determine which rule to apply. This approach does not make sense in the context of a claim brought under Title VII.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Remedies under Title VII are different than remedies for violations of state commercial law. As the Supreme Court has highlighted, the Congressional Record regarding Title VII makes clear that:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n    [t]he [remedy provisions of Title VII] are intended to give the courts wide discretion exercising their equitable powers to fashion\n    <em>\n     the most complete relief possible\n    </em>\n    . In dealing with the present section 706(g) the courts have stressed that the scope of relief under that section of the Act is intended to make the victims of unlawful discrimination whole, and that the attainment of this objective rests not only upon the elimination of the particular unlawful employment practice complained of, but also requires that persons aggrieved by the consequences and effects of the unlawful employment practice be, so far as possible, restored to a position where they would have been were it not for the unlawful discrimination.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    <em>\n     Albemarle Paper Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9485\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/405/#p417\">\n     422 U.S. at 421\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9485\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/405/#p417\">\n     95 S.Ct. 2362\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added) (quoting 118 Cong.

She now seeks to rescind that agreement so she can sue her employer for discrimination. In a typical case, two common law doctrines would pose an obstacle to her suit. First, she would have to prove that she did not ratify the agreement with her employer. And second, she would have to tender back (i.e., return) the money she received in exchange for signing the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The majority, however, holds that neither doctrine applies in McClellan's case because she filed suit under Title VII and the Equal Pay Act.

I respectfully disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Statutes and the common law coexist in our legal system. So when Congress sets out to regulate a particular subject, chances are that some common law rules touching on that subject already exist. Courts are then left to decide how much of the common law, if any, Congress displaces when it passes new legislation. Fortunately, an age-old presumption guides us in this inquiry: Unless Congress\n   <em>\n    clearly and explicitly\n   </em>\n   states otherwise, courts should assume that Congress expected the existing common law to apply in conjunction with the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

If a plaintiff asks for an equitable remedy, the equitable version of the rule should generally apply. And if a plaintiff asks for damages, the legal version should typically apply. In some cases, that inquiry will be easy. But the question is harder in release cases like McClellan's. When a plaintiff asks a court to rescind a release agreement so that she can sue under a federal statute, the plaintiff asks for\n   <em>\n    two\n   </em>\n   remedies: first, rescission, and second, whatever remedies she ultimately seeks under the statute. What remedy is the proper touchstone for the tender-back rule? Here, McClellan seeks equitable remedies: rescission\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   reinstatement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2 Joseph Story,\n   <em>\n    Commentaries on Equity Jurisprudence\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 688-95 (listing rescission as an equitable remedy);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fleming\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10524324\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/27/259/\">\n    27 F.3d at 261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (listing reinstatement as an equitable remedy). She also seeks damages, historically a legal remedy.\n   <em>\n    But see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chauffeurs, Local No. 391 v. Terry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5170\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/558/#p571\">\n    494 U.S. 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 571,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5170\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/558/#p571\">\n    110 S.Ct. 1339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5170\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/494/558/#p571\">\n    108 L.Ed.2d 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990) (stating a monetary award may be equitable if \"incidental to or intertwined with injunctive relief\"). On the one hand, the fact she seeks an equitable remedy-reinstatement-could be sufficient grounds to apply the equitable rule. Or it might be more appropriate to apply a remedy-by-remedy analysis, such that any legal remedies she seeks are subject to the legal version of the rule, while her equitable remedies require only reasonable timing. Or there is a third possibility. Since tender-back relates to rescission of McClellan's release itself, perhaps the equitable nature of rescission should require courts to always apply the equitable version of the rule. I would remand to the district court to analyze the remedies McClellan seeks and determine the applicable rule in the first instance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <em>\n    Timing of reasonableness.\n   </em>\n   Assuming the equitable rule applies (at least in part), the district court should consider whether the timing of McClellan's tender back was reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2 James Kent,\n   <em>\n    Commentaries on American Law\n   </em>\n   194 (\"In the case of voidable contracts [by infants], it will depend upon [the] circumstances ... whether any overt act of assent or dissent on his part be requisite to determine the fact of his future responsibility.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oubre\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11471876\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/422/#p436\">\n    522 U.S. at 440-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11471876\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/422/#p436\">\n    118 S.Ct. 838\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Thomas, J., dissenting) (stating \"immediate tender is not always required\");\n   <em>\n    Stewart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3200056\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ky/33/479/#p481\">\n    33 Ky. at 481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (requiring tender back of a horse \"in a reasonable time\");\n   <em>\n    Bieghler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=174%20N.E.%20774\">\n    174 N.E. at 776\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (suggesting that it is sufficient in \"nearly all jurisdictions\" for a party to \"sufficiently excuse himself\" of the duty to tender back).
