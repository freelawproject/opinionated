Members of the Tribe subsequently elected St. Marks Chairman of the Committee, a position he held for five months before being removed by the other members of the Committee. St. Marks alleged that the Committee took this action in retaliation for his whistleblowing. After an investigation, the Department agreed and ordered the Tribe to provide relief, including back pay, to St. Marks. The Tribe now petitions for review, raising procedural and substantive challenges to the Department's decision.

Congress passed ARRA to mitigate the impact of the 2008 recession, in part by rapidly funding a variety of state, local, and tribal projects.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pub. L.

To safeguard these funds, Congress enacted robust whistleblower protections for employees of any non-federal entity receiving funds under the Act. ARRA \u00a7 1553(a), 123 Stat. at 297-302.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As relevant here, the Act provides that an employer may not discharge an employee in retaliation for the disclosure of \"information that the employee reasonably believes is evidence of\" the \"gross mismanagement of an agency contract or grant relating to covered funds.\" \u00a7 1553(a)(1), 123 Stat. at 297.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When an employee files a whistleblower complaint, the office of the inspector general (\"IG\") for the agency awarding the funds has 180 days to investigate the complaint and submit a report of its findings \"to the person, the person's employer, [and] the head of the appropriate agency.\" \u00a7 1553(b)(1)-(2), 123 Stat. at 297-98. After the agency receives the IG's report, it must determine whether the complainant has been the victim of a reprisal prohibited by ARRA's whistleblower protections. \u00a7 1553(c)(2), 123 Stat. at 300. If the employee establishes that his or her disclosure \"was a contributing factor in the reprisal,\" \u00a7 1553(c)(1)(A)(i), 123 Stat. at 299,\n   the burden then shifts to the employer to show by \"clear and convincing evidence\" that it would have removed the employee \"in the absence of the disclosure,\" \u00a7 1553(c)(1)(B), 123 Stat. at 299. If the agency concludes that a prohibited reprisal has occurred, it may order various forms of relief, including compensatory damages and reinstatement. \u00a7 1553(c)(2), 123 Stat. at 300.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2009 and 2010, the Tribe received over $27 million in stimulus funds to complete construction of a water pipeline on its reservation. The Tribe had previously entered into funding agreements with the Department that authorized the Tribe to administer the federal funds it received in those years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205363\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 5363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As a condition of receiving the water pipeline funding, the Tribe executed two modifications to those preexisting agreements. The modified agreements required the Tribe to comply with the Act's whistleblower protections, and specifically provided that those protections would be \"enforceable pursuant to processes set up by ARRA.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ken St. Marks owns a construction company that was involved in building the pipeline paid for by the stimulus funds. In August 2012, St. Marks reported to the Department that he believed members of the Tribe, including individuals on the Tribe's governing Committee, were misusing ARRA funds. Three months later, members of the Tribe elected St. Marks to serve as Chairman of the Committee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   St. Marks contends that he informed members of the Tribe of the alleged fraud in an open letter on March 5, 2013, but the Committee disputes that the letter was ever sent. Later that same week, St. Marks filed a whistleblower complaint with the Department, alleging that he had \"been threatened and retaliated against,\" and that there was a petition circulating to remove him as Chairman. The Committee subsequently removed St. Marks from his position on March 25, 2013, for \"neglect of duty and gross misconduct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The IG began investigating St. Marks's whistleblower complaint that spring. After interviewing employees of the Tribe and other witnesses, the IG submitted its report to the Department about a year later. The report discussed the factual background of the investigation, but it offered no conclusion as to whether St. Marks was the victim of a prohibited reprisal. The IG did not provide the Tribe with a copy of its report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Department reviewed the IG's report and issued its own preliminary order, concluding that the Tribe had engaged in a prohibited reprisal when the Committee removed St. Marks from office.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   At this point, the Tribe had its first opportunity to view the IG's report, which was attached to the Department's order. The Department then gave both parties an opportunity to submit additional documentation, and specifically instructed St. Marks to detail the relief he sought under the Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In response, the Tribe filed a series of exhibits to attempt to rebut the Department's conclusion and demonstrate that the Committee had properly removed St. Marks from office for fraud and misconduct. St. Marks submitted a request for monetary relief and reinstatement with\n   supporting documentation. He also asked that various restrictions be placed on the Committee's actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After analyzing the available evidence-including the Tribe's newly submitted exhibits-the Department issued a final order confirming its earlier decision that the Tribe had engaged in a prohibited reprisal. The Department awarded St. Marks approximately $650,000, including back pay, front pay, travel costs, and legal fees, and it ordered the Tribe \"to stop any and all reprisals against St. Marks arising out of\" his whistleblower activities. St. Marks had also requested compensatory damages arising from lost business opportunities, including his inability to secure a loan to purchase a nearby hotel, but the Department concluded that those losses were speculative and not clearly connected to the reprisal. The Department further declined to award attorney's fees arising from St. Marks's other disputes with the Tribe, including two lawsuits the Tribe had filed against St. Marks in tribal court. And, recognizing that reinstating St. Marks would necessarily implicate issues of \"tribal sovereignty and self-determination,\" the Department did not require the Tribe to restore St. Marks to his position as Chairman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Tribe now petitions for review of the Department's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Tribe raises five challenges in its petition for review: (1) St. Marks is ineligible for whistleblower protection because he is not an employee of the Tribe; (2) the Department violated the Tribe's sovereignty; (3) the Department violated the Tribe's procedural due process rights; (4) the Department misconstrued the facts in concluding that a prohibited reprisal occurred; and (5) even assuming that a prohibited reprisal occurred, the Department incorrectly calculated the monetary relief due to St. Marks. We address each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We first consider the Tribe's argument that St. Marks was not an \"employee\" and thus is ineligible for whistleblower protection under the Act. To qualify as an \"employee,\" ARRA requires only that \"an individual perform[ ] services on behalf of an employer.\" \u00a7 1553(g)(3)(A), 123 Stat. at 301. As the parties do not dispute that the Tribe is an employer under the Act, the question here is whether St. Marks performed services on behalf of the Tribe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   He undoubtedly did. Among other duties, the Tribe's constitution requires the Committee to \"negotiate with the Federal, State and local governments on behalf of the tribe,\" \"manage all economic affairs and enterprises of the tribe,\" and \"approve or veto any sale, disposition, lease or encumbrance of tribal lands.\" As Chairman of the Committee, St. Marks was responsible for these tasks, as well as \"presid[ing] over all meetings of the committee,\" \"perform[ing] all duties of a Chairman,\" and \"exercis[ing] any authority delegated to him by the committee.\" He was also paid a salary by the Tribe for serving as Chairman. No more is required to hold that St. Marks was an employee within the meaning of ARRA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BedRoc Ltd., LLC v.

Were it obvious that elected officials could never qualify as employees, as the Tribe argues, then Congress would not have needed to specify in those statutes that elected officials were excluded. And the fact that Congress did not exclude elected officials from ARRA even though it did so in other statutes suggests that Congress intended to include them within ARRA's whistleblower protections.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Meghrig v.

ARRA rapidly distributed billions of dollars in stimulus funding to tribes, states, and local governments-most of which have elected officials. To safeguard those funds, Congress implemented \"a historic level of transparency, oversight and accountability,\" including protections for \"[f]ederal and state whistleblowers who report fraud and abuse.\" H.R. Rep. No. 111-4, at 2-3 (2009).

We disagree. The Act makes clear that it applies to tribes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1610(b), 123 Stat. at 304-05 (requiring that an agreement distributing stimulus funds to a tribe for a project conducted under any of several tribal statutes \"incorporate provisions to ensure that the agreement\n   conforms with the provisions of this Act regarding ... transparency, oversight, reporting, and accountability\"). And when \"Congress clearly indicates that Indian tribes are subject to a given law, no tribal sovereignty exists to bar the reach or enforcement of that law.\"\n   <em>\n    Blue Legs v.

The Act requires the IG to investigate a whistleblower complaint and then submit its report to the complainant, the employer, and the head of the appropriate agency. \u00a7 1553(b), 123 Stat. at 297-99. The Act thereby contemplates that an employer will have an opportunity to respond to the IG's report before the agency makes its determination. Here, however, the Tribe did not have access to the IG's report until the Department issued its preliminary decision. This was error; the statute plainly requires the IG to provide the employer and the agency with its report at the same time.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   But because the Department issued both preliminary and final orders, the Department was able to cure the error resulting from this violation. After reviewing the preliminary order-to which the IG's report was attached-the Tribe submitted extensive rebuttal evidence directed to the merits of the underlying determination. The Department then evaluated all of the evidence again, and, if anything, in greater detail than it had in its preliminary order.

The complainant must first offer evidence that a protected disclosure \"was a contributing factor in the reprisal.\" \u00a7 1553(c)(1)(A)(i), 123 Stat. at 299. The Act allows a complainant to do this with circumstantial evidence, including \"(I) evidence that the official undertaking the reprisal knew of the disclosure; or (II) evidence that the reprisal occurred within a period of time after the disclosure such that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the reprisal.\" \u00a7 1553(c)(1)(A)(ii), 123 Stat. at 299.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   There is no dispute that the Committee knew by September 2012 that St. Marks had informed the Department of his suspicions regarding misuse of stimulus funds.

The Tribe seems to assume that this timing immunizes it because any prohibited reprisal would have to have taken place within a few weeks of the Committee's learning of the disclosure, and St. Marks was not discharged until the end of March 2013. The Tribe's assumption is incorrect. Our caselaw does not require that an employer remove an employee within weeks of discovering a protected disclosure to support an inference that the two events are causally linked.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allen v.

The Tribe presented seven alternative justifications for its decision to remove St. Marks, including that St. Marks allegedly improperly removed a tribal judge and\n   verbally and sexually harassed tribal employees. But the Department soundly addressed these proffered justifications in its final order. In particular, the Department emphasized that the Tribe not only lacked clear and convincing evidence, but in fact lacked\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   \"contemporaneous evidence documenting discovery of the alleged unauthorized behavior\" or any \"timely, formal ... process and procedure to investigate and adjudicate any of the allegations.\" The Department reasonably concluded that a \"laundry list of unsubstantiated findings in a tribal government document [was] wholly insufficient to support the drastic and significant measure of removing an elected official.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Moreover, the Tribe does not meaningfully contest the Department's conclusion that its proffered justifications were largely pretextual. Although the Tribe's brief reiterates its seven justifications for removing St. Marks from office, the Tribe does not substantively engage with the Department's reasons in its final order for finding those justifications pretextual. Even if we exercise our discretion not to treat this as a forfeiture of any challenge to the Department's conclusion that the Tribe engaged in a prohibited reprisal, the Tribe certainly has not presented a compelling argument that the Department's decision was arbitrary or capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Finally, the Tribe contends that, even if a prohibited reprisal occurred, the agency incorrectly calculated St. Marks's monetary award. St. Marks reported to the Department that he was earning a yearly salary of $128,000-a figure that the Tribe did not challenge in its subsequent filing. But the Tribe now argues that because St. Marks had at an earlier time voluntarily requested a $50,000 decrease in his yearly salary, the Department erred by calculating his front and back pay using the initial $128,000 figure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Tribe did not make this argument to the Department, and it cannot raise it for the first time on appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barron v.

This case does not require us to consider whether it would have violated the Tribe's sovereignty if the Department had ordered the Tribe to reinstate St. Marks to the role of Chairman of the Committee, because the Department did not do so.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    We are highly skeptical that a hearing would have led to a different outcome in this case in any event.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    We recognize that our decision is in tension with\n    <em>\n     Business Communications, Inc. v.

But we disagree with the Eighth Circuit's apparent assumption that general due process principles control where a statute passed pursuant to the spending power conditions the receipt of funding on agreement to specific procedures.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    We are not persuaded by the Tribe's argument that the Department had already definitively concluded when it issued its preliminary order that a prohibited reprisal had occurred, and that the Tribe's efforts to rebut the complaint were thus entirely futile. The Department's order shows that it reviewed the evidence without affording its initial determination any presumptive weight.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Because the Tribe admits that the Committee knew of St. Marks's disclosure in the fall of 2012, it does not matter whether the Committee knew of the open letter, or indeed whether the letter existed at all. The analysis in the Department's order did not turn on the letter. Rather, the Department emphasized that the Committee was aware of St. Marks's disclosure \"months\" before he was removed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    It appears that St. Marks requested the pay cut to offset payments he had authorized to members of the Tribe who were in financial need.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    One passing reference in the IG's file to St. Marks's offer to reduce his salary-in a document submitted by St. Marks, no less-was insufficient to put the Department on notice that the Tribe believed there was a discrepancy in the Department's calculations.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
