Ch. 128, art. 2, 2013 Minn. Laws at 2173-78. Under the 2013 Act, Minnesota considers homecare providers to be public employees solely for purposes of PELRA. Minn. Stat. \u00a7 179A.54, subdiv. 2. The Act specifies, however, that no agreement reached between the State and the exclusive representative may interfere with certain rights of the Medicaid recipients-namely, \"to select, hire, direct, supervise, and terminate the employment of their individual providers; to manage an individual service budget regarding the amounts and types of authorized goods or\n   services received; or to receive direct support services from individual providers not referred to them through a state registry.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 179A.54, subdiv. 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In June 2014, SEIU Healthcare Minnesota presented the Minnesota Bureau of Mediation Services with over 9,000 signed union authorization cards from Minnesota homecare providers requesting that SEIU serve as their exclusive representative. These homecare providers then collectively submitted an official election petition. SEIU agreed that it would not seek mandatory fees from providers who did not join the union.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After receiving notice of the upcoming election, the plaintiff homecare providers sued the Governor, the Commissioner of the Bureau of Mediation Services, and the Commissioner of the Minnesota Department of Human Services, in their official capacities, and SEIU. They sought to enjoin Minnesota from conducting the election and certifying SEIU as their exclusive representative. The providers alleged that if Minnesota conducted the election and recognized SEIU as the exclusive representative, the State would violate their right not to associate under the First Amendment. The district court refused to enjoin the election, and the vote selected SEIU as the exclusive representative. The court then granted judgment on the pleadings for the defendants on the providers' First Amendment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The state defendants contend that there is no case or controversy before us, because the providers lack standing to sue. They argue that the homecare providers have not alleged a concrete injury in fact that satisfies the minimum requirements of Article III. The district court thought the State's argument impermissibly conflated standing analysis with the merits of the claim and concluded that the providers had standing. The court apparently reasoned that the fact that SEIU was certified as the exclusive representative for the homecare providers was a sufficient injury in fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Article III standing requires the homecare providers to establish that they have \"(1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Spokeo, Inc. v.

To establish injury in fact, the homecare providers must show that they have suffered a concrete and particularized injury to a cognizable interest.\n   <em>\n    Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 560, 563,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    119 L.Ed.2d 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   One injury that the providers have alleged is an impingement on the freedom of the providers not to associate with the exclusive representative. The State argues that there is no impingement, and thus no injury, so the providers lack standing. We do not think, however, that the alleged restraint on associational freedom is the only injury alleged. The complaint, fairly construed at the pleading stage, also asserts the providers are harmed by the practical effect of the State's decision to recognize an exclusive representative. As the Court recognized in\n   <em>\n    Knight\n   </em>\n   , the \"unique status\" of an exclusive representative \"amplifies its voice\" in the negotiating process.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335656\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/271/\">\n    465 U.S. at 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335656\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/271/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By definition, the voices of those who disagree with the exclusive representative are correspondingly diminished. Whether or not this effect on the voices of the homecare providers violates a constitutional right, we conclude that it is sufficient to constitute an injury in fact for purposes of Article III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On the merits, the homecare providers contend that PELRA creates a \"mandatory agency relationship\" between them and the exclusive representative that violates their right to free association under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. This argument, however, is foreclosed by\n   <em>\n    Knight\n   </em>\n   . There, community college faculty instructors objected to Minnesota's recognition of an exclusive representative for negotiations on subjects outside the scope of mandatory bargaining under a prior version of the PELRA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335656\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/271/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335656\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/271/\">\n    at 274, 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335656\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/271/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court concluded that the State \"in no way restrained\" the instructors' \"freedom to associate\n   <em>\n    or not to associate\n   </em>\n   with whom they please,\n   <em>\n    including the exclusive representative\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335656\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/271/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335656\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/271/\">\n    at 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335656\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/271/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphases added). In concluding that the instructors' associational freedom was not impaired, the Court emphasized that they were \"free to form whatever advocacy groups they like,\" and were \"not required to become members of [the union].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335656\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/271/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335656\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/271/\">\n    at 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335656\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/271/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   There is no meaningful distinction between this case and\n   <em>\n    Knight\n   </em>\n   . The current version of PELRA similarly allows the homecare providers to form their own advocacy groups independent of the exclusive representative,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Minn. Stat. \u00a7 179A.06, subdiv. 1, and it does not require any provider to join the union.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335656\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/271/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 179A.06, subdiv. 2. According to\n   <em>\n    Knight\n   </em>\n   , therefore, the State has \"in no way\" impinged on the providers' right not to associate by recognizing an exclusive negotiating representative. The homecare providers urge that\n   <em>\n    Knight\n   </em>\n   addressed only whether it was constitutional for a public employer to exclude employees from union meetings, but a fair reading of\n   <em>\n    Knight\n   </em>\n   is not so narrow. The Court summarily affirmed the constitutionality of exclusive representation for subjects of mandatory bargaining.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335656\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/271/\">\n    465 U.S. at 279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335656\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/271/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And the Court discussed more broadly the fact that the State treated the position of the exclusive representative as the official position of the faculty, even though not every instructor agreed,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335656\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/271/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335656\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/271/\">\n    at 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335656\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/271/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but nonetheless ruled that the exclusive representation did not impinge on the right of association.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335656\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/271/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335656\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/271/\">\n    at 288-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11335656\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/271/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hill v.
