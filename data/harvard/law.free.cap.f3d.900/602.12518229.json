Staff arranged for Air EVAC EMS, Inc. (Air EVAC), an air-ambulance operator, to\n   transport him by helicopter to another hospital forty-one miles away. A few months after the transport, Air EVAC sent Ferrell a bill for $30,083.26. His insurer, Arkansas Blue Cross, paid $1000.00, leaving him owing a balance of $29,083.26. Ferrell brought this putative class action against Air EVAC asserting three claims for relief under Arkansas law: (i) a declaratory judgment that any contract between Air EVAC and class members is unenforceable because it lacks an essential price term; (ii) damages under the Arkansas Deceptive Trade Practices Act for concealing or omitting disclosure of its price until it completes air-ambulance transport; and (iii) a declaratory judgment that Air EVAC may not seek restitution against class members because it lacks clean hands. Air EVAC removed the action to the Eastern District of Arkansas and moved to dismiss. The district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   dismissed all claims as preempted by the express preemption provision in the Airline Deregulation Act (ADA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2041713\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 41713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).

In explaining this exception to ADA preemption, the Court noted that Congress did not authorize DOT to establish an administrative process for adjudicating private contract disputes. \"Nor is it plausible that Congress meant to channel into federal courts the business of resolving, pursuant to judicially fashioned federal common law, the range of contract claims relating to airline rates, routes, or services.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333903\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/219/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333903\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/219/\">\n    at 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333903\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/219/\">\n    115 S.Ct. 817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Most recently, in\n   <em>\n    Ginsberg\n   </em>\n   , class action plaintiffs alleged that Northwest Airlines violated its duty of good faith and fair dealing when it revoked their membership in its frequent flyer program.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12579108,12706991\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1422/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 1426-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

However, the Court noted, plaintiffs had voluntarily dismissed a separate breach of contract claim after the district court ruled that Northwest had unfettered discretion to terminate membership in its frequent flyer program.

The Form recites that the patient acknowledges the services \"was [sic] actually received,\" authorizes the services \"as being medically necessary,\" assigns to Air EVAC any third party payments for the services, and \"agrees that the patient is financially responsible for, and obligated to pay, the amount charged by [Air EVAC] for the\n   medical services, including any amount that is not paid by any third-party payor.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Ferrell seeks a declaration that no express or implied contract came into effect because there was no mutual assent on \"the amount of the price.\" He rejects the price term set forth in the Authorization Form -- that he will pay what Air EVAC charges -- because it does not state the price or provide an objective pricing mechanism. He argues the First Cause of Action falls within the preemption exception recognized in\n   <em>\n    Wolens\n   </em>\n   because it relies on a basic principle of contract law -- there must be a meeting of the minds on all essential terms for a contract to be enforceable. Air EVAC responds that the\n   <em>\n    Wolens\n   </em>\n   exception \"saves only contract-law rules aimed at discerning and enforcing the parties' bargain.\" But Air EVAC acknowledges that \"courts have recognized that it is proper to apply ordinary principles of contract law to ascertain whether there was a binding agreement between the parties,\" citing\n   <em>\n    Lyn-Lea Travel Corp. v.

Although dressed in the language of contracts, Ferrell's First Cause of Action,\n   <em>\n    as pleaded\n   </em>\n   , asserts that, under Arkansas law, air-ambulance operators have no enforceable contract unless they disclose the actual price they will charge before transporting a patient, or the precise formula that will be used to determine that price. This is asserted on a class-wide basis, independent of the relationship between an air-ambulance operator and a particular patient. This is not a contract-based claim. Like the preempted fraud claims in the Second Cause of Action, this claim asserts a price-disclosure rule under Arkansas law that would apply uniquely and across-the-board to the providers of air-ambulance services operating as federally regulated air carriers. The rule would impose a common-law standard of conduct from which Air EVAC may not free itself. It is therefore a preempted state-imposed obligation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ginsberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12579108,12706991\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1422/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 1432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   For these reasons, we conclude that Ferrell's declaratory judgment claims, like his fraud claims, are ADA-preempted. A judgment declaring that Air EVAC has no claim for breach of contract, and no right to recover for services it actually provided under any equitable theory, because it did not disclose its pricing term before providing the services, is clearly preempted under the ADA's express preemption provision as construed in\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Wolens\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Ginsberg\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Ferrell's reply brief posits that, if his claims are held to be ADA-preempted, the price for air-ambulance services will be set unilaterally by the air-ambulance provider because the DOT does not provide patients an administrative remedy. But this assumes that, if Ferrell's across-the-board class action claims are preempted, then Air EVAC is entitled to recover, as it has argued, the price stated in its Billing Authorization Form -- \"the amount charged\" -- free of contract law defenses\n   or interference. Both Ferrell's assumption and Air EVAC's assertion are unsound. Recall that, in\n   <em>\n    Wolens\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court in explaining the contract-based exception to ADA preemption stated that the ADA did not authorize DOT to adjudicate private contract disputes, and did not \"channel into federal courts\n   <em>\n    the business of resolving\n   </em>\n   , pursuant to judicially fashioned federal common law, the range of\n   <em>\n    contract claims relating to airline rates, routes or services\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333903\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/219/\">\n    513 U.S. at 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333903\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/219/\">\n    115 S.Ct. 817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So the question becomes, in this federally deregulated market, what right does Air EVAC have to recover payment for services provided to a patient who refuses to pay?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Three circuit court opinions shed important light on this question. In\n   <em>\n    Data Manufacturing, Inc. v. United Parcel Service, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3381953\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/557/849/#p851\">\n    557 F.3d 849\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 851 (8th Cir. 2009), we applied the nearly identical preemption provision in the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act to a claim that UPS had wrongfully assessed a recurring charge on DMI's shipment invoices over an extended period. But we partially reversed the dismissal of the plaintiff's complaint as entirely preempted: \"DMI cannot argue that the fee is too unconscionably high, a penalty, or void, but it can proceed with its claim that it did not agree to the fee at all.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3381953\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/557/849/#p851\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 854 n.3. In\n   <em>\n    Lyn-Lea Travel Corp.\n   </em>\n   , after American Airlines announced a policy that significantly reduced commissions paid to travel agencies, the plaintiff travel agency refused to pay American amounts due under a computer lease agreement and sued American asserting various claims. American asserted a breach of contract counterclaim to recover the unpaid lease payments; plaintiff asserted a fraudulent-inducement defense.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9509385\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/283/282/#p289\">\n    283 F.3d at 284-285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Fifth Circuit held the defense was not ADA-preempted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   When pleaded as a defense to a contract, fraudulent inducement is related to the fundamental issue in contract actions: is there an enforceable agreement? A fraudulently induced party has not assented to an agreement because the fraudulent conduct precludes the requisite mutual assent. ... The Court reasoned in\n   <em>\n    Wolens\n   </em>\n   that because contract law is, at its \"core,\" uniform and non-diverse, there is little risk of inconsistent state adjudication of contractual obligations. Fraudulent inducement is among those core concepts as it relates to the validity of mutual assent. The defense does not reflect a state policy seeking to expand or enlarge the parties' agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9509385\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/283/282/#p289\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9509385\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/283/282/#p289\">\n    at 289-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    United Airlines, Inc. v. Mesa Airlines, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the Seventh Circuit ruled: \"public bodies must enforce rules against force and fraud.

Rocky Mountain Holdings, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516778,12516779\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/889/1259/\">\n    889 F.3d 1259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1268 (11th Cir. 2018). Ferrell can assert in defense that he did not agree to pay that amount, and no enforceable contract was breached. If that defense prevails, Air EVAC can assert an equitable claim to recover for the services it provided. If there is no contract, the common law typically provides that a provider may recover the fair value or reasonable value of the services provided. What law applies in resolving these issues? No federal or unpreempted state law authorizes an agency to determine Air EVAC's \"just and reasonable\" rates. Federal law\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   apply to the contract action,\n   but\n   <em>\n    Wolens\n   </em>\n   declared that federal common law will not decide what is a reasonable charge for air-ambulance services. Absent further federal legislation, it seems obvious that a state or federal court asked to determine these contract and restitution issues will necessarily look to governing principles of state law. This is not contrary to the marketplace principles adopted in the ADA. It is the way disputes between private contracting parties are decided in a deregulated marketplace. Thus, the determination that Ferrell's class action declaratory judgment claims are preempted\n   <em>\n    as pleaded\n   </em>\n   does not leave air-ambulance patients without potential, unpreempted judicial remedies under\n   <em>\n    Wolens\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ginsberg\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    The Honorable D.P.
