Both statutes secure the rights\n   of individuals with disabilities to independence and full inclusion in American society and, unsurprisingly, have been constant companions in our case law as it has developed to effect those rights.

The question presented by this case is one of first impression in the Courts of Appeals: whether, in the absence of a similar regulation specifically interpreting the RA, its mandate of \"reasonable accommodations,\" consistent with the mandate of \"reasonable modifications\" under the ADA, generally requires that individuals with disabilities be permitted to be accompanied by their service animals and, thus, renders such requested accommodations\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   reasonable in the ordinary course.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, we hold that it does and that the District Court's contrary jury instructions constitute reversible error. Accordingly, we will vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This case centers on an elementary school student with dyslexia and epilepsy, M.B., and her rebuffed attempts to be accompanied by her service dog to school. When M.B. was a young child, her mother had to monitor her constantly and care for her during epileptic seizures, the onset of which could be subtle or sudden. As M.B. grew older and became more independent, though, her pediatric neurologist recommended that she obtain a service dog to take over this function.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   M.B.'s mother therefore arranged to acquire a service dog, which accompanied M.B. to school during second grade and helped her cope with her epilepsy by alerting during a seizure and providing safety and comfort until the seizure had passed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In third grade, M.B. switched to the dePaul School,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   which had a specialized program for dyslexic students. Before enrolling M.B. there, M.B.'s mother met with the principal and explained that, in addition to dyslexia, M.B. also had epilepsy\n   and that the service dog, who had recently died, had accompanied M.B. to her previous school. M.B.'s mother also explained that M.B. was on the waiting list for a new service dog that likewise would need to accompany her to school. After receiving assurances from the principal that M.B. was a \"very good fit\" for the School, M.B.'s mother enrolled her that fall as a third grader. JA 501.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   That winter, M.B. came off the waiting list and was paired with a new service dog, Buddy. But when M.B.'s mother asked the principal for permission to send Buddy to school with M.B., the principal refused, asserting for the first time that Buddy would be \"too much of a distraction\" to other children. JA 673. Because Buddy was not allowed to accompany her, M.B. missed the next two weeks of school to be with Buddy 24 hours a day for an initial intensive bonding period. And after M.B. returned to school, because the principal continued to deny permission for Buddy to accompany her throughout the remainder of third grade, Buddy was not available to alert school staff during seizure activity or to support her recovery. As a result, M.B.'s mother kept M.B. home when her seizures were more severe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In an effort to avoid these interruptions to M.B.'s education, M.B.'s mother met with the principal again before fourth grade to request that Buddy be permitted to accompany M.B. in the new school year. By that time, Buddy not only could alert during M.B.'s seizures, but also could predict and alert to them minutes before they even began. But the principal still refused, once more asserting that Buddy might distract other students. Yet again, M.B. attempted to attend without Buddy, but that year she missed 65 days of school-more than one-third of the school year-with seizure activity accounting for about half of her absences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A devoted advocate, M.B.'s mother sought permission again on the eve of fifth grade for Buddy to accompany M.B. to school, pointing out that M.B.'s seizures were increasing in frequency, which exacerbated the concerns about her attending without Buddy's assistance. But again the principal refused, citing possible distraction, and so once more M.B. started the school year unaccompanied by Buddy. Without her service animal, however, M.B. became anxious and distracted at school, afraid of enduring the increased seizure activity. Her mother therefore met again with the principal to renew her request for Buddy to accompany M.B. to school and to advise the principal that M.B.'s pediatric neurologist had recommended that Buddy \"should be at school with her.\" JA 530. The principal promised to \"look into\" the request. JA 531.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Unsatisfied with that answer, M.B.'s mother simply began bringing Buddy to school with M.B. in the morning. Each day she did so, however, the principal stopped them at the entrance of the School and refused to allow Buddy to enter. The principal also offered a new explanation: Instead of pointing to the possibility of distraction, the principal said she had discovered that another student in the School was allergic to dogs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At that point, given M.B.'s growing anxiety and distraction and the medical risks associated with attending school without Buddy, M.B. stayed home from school for more than two months while her mother continued her efforts to obtain an accommodation from the School. Those efforts included leaving telephone messages, having her attorney send letters, and forwarding a note she obtained from M.B.'s pediatrician that explained that, because M.B.'s \"seizure activity has escalated and is not always obvious, it is medically necessary for 'Buddy,' [her] trained seizure dog, to\n   be with her 24 hours [a day] / 7 days a week.\" JA 1396. A teacher at the School also provided the principal with an informational article about seizure alert dogs that detailed how they are able to predict and alert to seizures and give their owners time to move to a safe place, take medication, call for help, and notify others about the impending seizure for later monitoring. And the parents of the student who was allergic to dogs, for their part, informed the principal that they had arranged for allergy treatments for their son and did not want M.B. to be excluded from the School on his behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After weeks of back-and-forth effort, the principal finally agreed that M.B. could return with Buddy, but only on the condition that Buddy at all times wear a special therapeutic shirt designed to decrease allergens. Thus, in January of fifth grade, M.B. finally returned to school, this time with Buddy. But her return was short-lived. The special hypo-allergenic shirt made Buddy overheated, causing him to pant and to fail to alert or respond when M.B. had seizures. After two weeks of these conditions, M.B.'s mother learned that M.B. had slept on the floor of the principal's office for hours after seizing without Buddy's intervention. The next day, she withdrew M.B. from the School permanently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Eventually, M.B. was enrolled in the local public school, which allowed Buddy to accompany her. By that point, however, M.B.'s testing showed that she had fallen too far behind to resume or even to repeat fifth grade. Instead, she was required to enter as a fourth grader.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   M.B.'s parents sued the School, asserting that it had failed to accommodate M.B. in violation of \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (RA), Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (PHRA).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   After discovery, the School moved for summary judgment on all claims, and the District Court granted that motion as to the ADA and PHRA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Regarding the ADA claim, the Court noted that M.B.'s parents only sought damages and explained that damages are not an available form of relief under Title III of the ADA. As for the PHRA claim, the District Court summarily stated, \"the analysis of an ADA claim applies equally to a PHRA claim,\" JA 23, and dismissed it on that basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The District Court then turned to the RA claim. Observing that the substantive standard of liability to prove discrimination under \u00a7 504 of the RA was \"materially identical\" to the standard under the ADA, JA 27 (citation omitted), the Court looked for guidance to the DOJ's regulations implementing the ADA, which require that \"reasonable modifications\" be made when necessary to avoid disability discrimination,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2035.130\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 35.130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(7)(i), 36.302(a). It identified two particular ADA regulations pertaining to service animals-one applicable to public entities,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2035.130\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 35.136, and one applicable to public accommodations,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2035.130\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 36.302.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In both, the DOJ interprets\n   \"reasonable modifications\" to mean that covered actors \"shall modify [their] policies, practices, or procedures to permit the use of a service animal by an individual with a disability.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2035.130\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 35.136(a), 36.302(c)(1). Determining that the DOJ's interpretation of the ADA was equally applicable to the RA and was therefore \"enforceable against [the School] in deciding whether it violated federal law,\" JA 29, the District Court concluded that there were genuine disputes of material fact as to whether the School failed to accommodate M.B. under the RA and denied its summary judgment motion as to that claim. The parties then proceeded to a jury trial, with the District Court continuing to indicate that the ADA service animal regulations were controlling by, for example, excluding testimony from Buddy's trainer about whether it was reasonable for Buddy to wear the hypo-allergenic shirt on the ground that \"[r]easonableness has already been determined by D.O.J. regulations.\" JA 262.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Three days later, however, the District Court sharply reversed course. First, it disallowed deposition testimony about the service animal regulations on the ground that \"the A.D.A. is not in this case.\" JA 810. And second, when it came time for jury instructions and M.B.'s counsel proposed an instruction that mirrored the regulations that the District Court had found enforceable at the summary judgment phase,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court rejected it, asserting that, at trial, \"the standard is different.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   JA 984.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Instead, the District Court instructed the jury that, to prevail on a claim for failure to accommodate, plaintiffs were required to \"prov[e] by a preponderance of the evidence that the requested accommodations\" were \"reasonable,\" and further defined that term as meaning \"necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of a disability,\" or, \"[i]n other words ... necessary to permit [M.B.] meaningful participation.\" JA 1007. Only if the plaintiffs proved the accommodations were \"necessary to avoid discrimination ... on the basis of [M.B.]'s disability,\" the Court advised, would \"the burden shift[ ] to [the School] to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the requested accommodations were unreasonable.\" JA 1008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Apparently confused as to how these instructions related to the need to accommodate service animals, the jury sent the Court a question the same day requesting \"up to date specific information re: service dogs pertaining to act #504/ADA.\" JA 1998. At that point, M.B.'s counsel again urged the Court to instruct the jury on the ADA service animal regulations, but the Court again declined, stating that it had already \"g[iven] them the law that relates to this case\" and would not \"go look for some new law to tell them about or some different law or something that's not been already submitted or given to them.\" JA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   1089. The jury then returned a verdict for the School.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   M.B.'s parents timely appealed, seeking reversal of the dismissal of their PHRA claim as well as a new trial on their RA claim on the ground that the District Court did not properly instruct the jury on the applicable law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Jurisdiction and Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1367, and we have jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Whether jury instructions state the proper legal standard is a legal question over which we exercise plenary review.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Focusing primarily on their RA claim, Appellants argue that because the substantive standards for liability under the RA and the ADA are the same, the service animal regulations interpreting \"reasonable modifications\" under the ADA apply equally to \"reasonable accommodations\" under the RA. Therefore, according to Appellants, actors covered by the RA must modify their policies to allow for the use of service animals by individuals with disabilities to the same extent as actors covered by the ADA. For the reasons we explain below, we agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   First, we explain why we conclude-based on (1) the interplay between the two statutes, (2) case law interpreting them to have identical substantive standards of liability, (3) the DOJ's interpretation of the \"reasonable modification\" requirement in the ADA service animal regulations, and (4) consonant guidance from the Department of Education (DOE) in the RA context-that the \"reasonableness\" of an accommodation or a modification under either statute must be interpreted the same way. Thus, it constitutes discrimination under the RA, to the same extent as under the ADA, to refuse to permit disabled individuals to be accompanied by service animals. Second, we address the School's arguments to the contrary. And finally, we consider the ramifications of our holding for the judgment on the RA claim and briefly explain why the dismissal of the PHRA claim must be reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Relationship Between the RA and the ADA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Statutory History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   To understand the interplay between the RA's \"reasonable accommodation\" requirement and the ADA's \"reasonable modification\" requirement, and therefore to determine the relevance of the ADA service animal regulations for actors covered by the RA, we must first understand the relationship between the two statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 \"was the first broad federal statute aimed at eradicating discrimination against individuals with disabilities.\"\n   <em>\n    Helen L. v.

The heart of the statute, \u00a7 504, established that \"[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability ... shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Specifically, in response to an inquiry about whether barring service dogs from a classroom violated the RA, the DOE stated-without indicating that any additional showing of \"reasonableness\" was required-that \"if not allowing a student to bring a service dog into the classroom would effectively deny the student the opportunity ... to participate in or benefit from the education program,\" i.e., if necessity were satisfied, \"then the recipient school would be in violation of Section 504 [of the RA] and its implementing regulation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Letter from Michael L.

In a notice regarding the obligations of housing providers under the Fair Housing Act and the RA, HUD explained that the ADA service animal regulations' limited definition of \"service animal\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"does not limit housing providers' obligations to make reasonable accommodations for assistance animals under ... Section 504 [of the RA].\" U.S. Dep't of Hous. &amp; Urban Dev.,\n   <em>\n    Service Animals and Assistance Animals for People with Disabilities in Housing and HUD-Funded Programs\n   </em>\n   1 (Apr. 25, 2013), https://www.hud.gov/sites/documents/SERVANIMALS_NTCFHEO2013-01.PDF. Rather, HUD explained, so long as an individual has a \"disability-related need for an assistance animal,\" \"[s]ection 504 require[s] the housing provider to modify or provide an exception to a 'no pets' rule or policy\" in order \"to permit a person with a disability to live with and use an assistance animal(s) in all areas of the premises where persons are normally allowed\n   to go, unless doing so would impose an undue financial and administrative burden or would fundamentally alter the nature of the housing provider's services.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Finally, two other agencies, in the exercise of their rule-making authority, have interpreted the RA to require accommodation of the use of service animals. In 2016, the Department of Labor (DOL) promulgated a regulation materially identical to the DOJ's service animal regulations, providing that a recipient of certain federal workforce development funds \"shall modify its policies, practices, or procedures to permit the use of a service animal by an individual with a disability\" unless the animal is \"out of control\" or \"not housebroken.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2038.16\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 38.16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (b)(1)-(2). Likewise, a Department of Transportation (DOT) regulation, promulgated in 2010 for \"[t]he purpose of ... carry[ing] out the [ADA] and Section 504 of the [RA] with respect to passenger vessels,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2039.1\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7 39.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , established that vessel owners and operators \"must permit service animals to accompany passengers with a disability ... in all locations that passengers can use on a vessel, including in lifeboats,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2039.1\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 39.91(a)-(b). Another DOT regulation similarly requires airports to establish \"relief areas for service animals that accompany passengers\" with disabilities.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2039.1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 27.71(h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The relevant agencies are thus unanimous in mandating that covered actors, as a general matter, accommodate the use of service animals by disabled individuals under both the RA and ADA, i.e., such an accommodation generally will be reasonable as a matter of law. And even though \"[r]esponsibility for administering the [RA] was not delegated to a single agency\" so that\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference may not be due to all agency interpretations, it is nonetheless the case that \"the well-reasoned views of the agencies implementing [this] statute 'constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance.' \"\n   <em>\n    Bragdon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11182853\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/624/#p645\">\n    524 U.S. at 642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11182853\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/624/#p645\">\n    118 S.Ct. 2196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Skidmore v.

We do not find its arguments persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   As a threshold matter, the School does not question the validity of the service animal regulations or dispute that they constitute reasonable interpretations of the ADA's prohibition of discriminatory practices-including the failure to make reasonable modifications-to which we accord\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference. Nor could it, because the service animal regulations, as we have explained,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Section IV.A.3, clearly \"promote[ ] the statute's overarching goals of ensuring equal opportunity for, and full participation by, individuals with disabilities,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    Alboniga\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4305953\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/87/1319/\">\n    87 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1334 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12609612\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/743/#p756\">\n    137 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   749 (citing to\n   <em>\n    Alboniga\n   </em>\n   as a case that \"requir[ed] an accommodation to permit use of a service animal\" under the ADA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Instead, the School points out that the DOJ's service animal regulations technically apply only to claims for \"reasonable modifications\" under the ADA. We do not disagree: The service animal regulations do not purport to interpret the RA\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   . But, as we have explained, because the statutes' substantive standards of liability are identical and because \"reasonable accommodations\" under the RA must be interpreted consistently with \"reasonable modifications\" under the ADA,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Section IV.A.1-2, the ADA service animal regulations necessarily inform our interpretation of the RA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The School also contends that, even if the service animal regulations are otherwise applicable, the unique needs of the education context warrant an exception to avoid imposing \"strict liability\" on schools that are not equipped to accommodate service animals. Appellee's Br. 20. Congress, however, has given no indication that the use of service animals should be less accommodated in the school setting than in other settings covered by the RA or the ADA. To the contrary, it made a specific finding in the RA that \"individuals with disabilities continually encounter various forms of discrimination in such critical areas as ... education,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20701\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5), just as it did in the ADA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012101\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3).

The jury instructions stated that, for a claim under the RA for failure to accommodate, \"the plaintiffs have the initial burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the requested accommodations they seek were reasonable. That is, necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability. In other words, the requested accommodations were necessary to permit [M.B.] meaningful participation.\" JA 1007. The jury was further instructed that only if it found that plaintiffs had met that burden would \"the burden shift[ ] to [the School] to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the requested accommodations were unreasonable.\" JA 1008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   These instructions were flawed for two reasons. First, they advised the jury that M.B.'s parents had the initial burden to prove their requested accommodation was reasonable when-in view of the service animal regulations and the fact that no exception to the regulations' mandate was invoked by the School, let alone appears applicable\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   -their requested accommodation was reasonable as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section IV.A.3.

With the assistance of school staff alone and in the absence of Buddy's therapeutic services, M.B. was subjected to additional safety risks, such as the onset of seizures without prior notice, hours of lying in the principal's office without intervention, and significant increased anxiety that medical providers indicated was contributing to increased seizure activity. Ultimately, M.B. had such a gaping educational deficit that she could not even qualify in the public school system to repeat fifth grade, regressing instead to the fourth. The record also indicates that the alternative of having Buddy wear the hypo-allergenic shirt-of dubious purpose after the allergic student's parents advised the principal they had arranged for allergy treatments and did not want M.B. excluded from the School on their son's behalf-caused Buddy to fail to respond when M.B. had seizures. In any event, as the DOJ has interpreted its service animal regulations, \"[a]llergies and fear of dogs are not valid reasons for denying access or refusing service to people using service animals,\" U.S. Dep't of Justice, Civil Rights Div.,\n   <em>\n    Service Animals\n   </em>\n   (July 12, 2011), https://www.ada.gov/service_animals_2010.htm, and that guidance, like the ADA service animal regulation itself, was fully applicable to the School as a \"public accommodation\" under the ADA,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   note 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Bearing in mind this record and the jury's own question seeking \"specific information re: service dogs pertaining to act #504/ADA,\" JA 1998, the School has hardly shown a \"high probability\" that the jury would have ruled in its favor if properly instructed. To the contrary, it is hard pressed to show that any reasonable jury, properly instructed, could so rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   We therefore will vacate and remand for the District Court to determine whether there is any remaining genuine issue of material fact concerning the School's liability or whether, in view of our holding today, trial should be limited to the matter of damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Finally, we briefly address the dismissal of the PHRA claim, which we will reverse. The District Court observed that \"the analysis of an ADA claim applies equally to a PHRA claim,\" JA 23, which is true as far as it goes,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

But it then dismissed both claims on the ground that M.B.'s parents could not obtain damages under the ADA. The problem is that, while the liability standard for the PHRA and the ADA is the same, the remedies are not: The PHRA expressly permits suits for damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20Pa.%20Stat.%20and%20Cons.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20962\">\n    43 Pa.
