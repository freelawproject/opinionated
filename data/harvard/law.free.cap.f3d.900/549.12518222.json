Specifically, he alleged that these officials were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical need by failing to take reasonable steps to abate the risk of\n   harm that secondhand smoke poses to him. He alleged that his long history of asthma and other respiratory conditions exacerbates these risks. The jury found in Washington's favor and awarded him $40,000 in compensatory damages and imposed a total of $71,000 in punitive damages as follows: $20,000 against Denney; $25,000 against Pash; $25,000 against Prudden; and $1,000 against Richey. The officials appeal, arguing that (1) Washington failed to offer sufficient evidence to prove that they violated his clearly established Eighth Amendment rights and, therefore, they are entitled to qualified immunity; and (2) punitive damages were improper because Washington failed to show that they were motivated by evil motive or intent or showed callous indifference to his Eighth Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   We hold that sufficient evidence exists that the officials violated Washington's Eighth Amendment rights, but we conclude that insufficient evidence justifies an award of punitive damages.

These attacks are more frequent when Washington is exposed to tobacco smoke.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In 2010, Washington was transferred to Crossroads. At that time, Denney was Crossroads's warden, Pash was Crossroads's deputy warden,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Prudden was the Missouri Department of Corrections Deputy Director for the Division of Adult Institutions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Richey was Washington's case manager.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Over 85 percent of prisoners at Crossroads smoke. The Missouri Department of Corrections has a smoking policy that prohibits smoking in any building and within 25 feet from any entryway, which applies to Crossroads. Staff and offenders have designated areas in which they smoke outside at Crossroads; those designated areas are the recreational yards for offenders and the walkways for staff. Crossroads also has offender rules consistent with the smoking policy. While \"sometimes the smoking policy is enforced,\" Transcript of Jury Trial, Vol. I, at 46, the \"policy is routinely violated,\" Transcript of Jury Trial, Vol. II, at 286. Prisoners are confined to their cells for 18 to 21 hours per day, and Crossroads allows prisoners to keep cigarettes, tobacco, rolling papers, rolling machines, and lighters in their cells. Corrections officers \"can smell smoke all the time\" in housing units.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"31320\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/439/983/#p986\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Shortly after Washington arrived at Crossroads, the medical staff enrolled him\n   in the asthma chronic care clinic. His treatments included nebulizers and inhalers. They also included \"lay-ins,\" which are nonpharmaceutical prescriptions that doctors at Crossroads order. Washington's lay-ins required that he be housed with nonsmoking roommates and given a painter's mask to protect him from smoke. Despite Washington's treatments and lay-ins, secondhand smoke continued to cause Washington to suffer asthma symptoms and attacks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Washington sent letters to Denney, Pash, and Richey to alert them of the smoking in Crossroads's housing units. He also raised the issue to Denney and Richey verbally. When Denney, Pash, and Richey ignored him, Washington began filing informal resolution requests (IRRs), the first step in Crossroads's grievance procedure. On March 13, 2014, Washington filed an IRR \"about [how] the staff was not enforcing the no-smoking policy\" or following the doctors' orders. Transcript of Jury Trial, Vol. I, at 53. Washington complained that his cellmate was smoking in the cell. He also described how he had suffered an asthmatic attack from exposure to the secondhand smoke and explained \"that the secondhand smoke was still repeatedly recycled, coming through the ventilation system.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55. Washington directed the IRR to Denney, Page, and Pash. When Washington's IRR was denied, he appealed by filing a grievance. Denney denied the grievance, stating, \"Your allegation of tobacco limitation restrictions not being enforced has been refuted and found to be without merit.\" Transcript of Jury Trial, Vol. II, at 231. Washington appealed Denney's decision to Prudden, but she denied the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On May 28, 2014, Washington filed a second IRR after corrections officers took away the mask that doctors had prescribed Washington to reduce his smoke exposure. Washington's IRR was denied, and he appealed to Denney. Denney did not dispute the medical staff's orders or that the mask had been taken, but he found \"no evidence to substantiate [Washington's] claim\" that he was \"denied medical care as a result of not being allowed to possess a face mask to protect [himself] from secondhand tobacco smoke.\" Transcript of Jury Trial, Vol. II, at 251-52. Denney explained, \"On May 29, 2014, you submitted a request for reasonable accommodation form requesting to be issued a face mask. It has been determined that a face mask ... is not a necessity, and you shall not be allowed to possess the same.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 252. Denney recited that tobacco use is prohibited in the housing units and advised Washington, \"Should you observe anyone violating this policy, I recommend that you report it immediately to a staff member.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Washington appealed Denney's decision to Prudden, who denied it. Prudden advised Washington that he did not \"need the face mask because CRCC is a nonsmoking environment,\" stating that the \"housing units at CRCC are considered a nonsmoking environment. CRCC staff will make every effort to ensure that Policy D2-11.9, Tobacco Use Limitations, is adhered to, and staff will issue conduct violations to an offender if he is caught smoking in the housing unit. This should resolve your complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 304.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On May 5, 2015, Washington filed an IRR asking to be transferred to another cell because his cellmate smoked. Medical staff had ordered that he have a nonsmoking cellmate to protect him from secondhand smoke. Despite the order, Washington was consistently housed with smokers. When Washington told this cellmate he had asthma and was \"allergic\" to secondhand smoke, the cellmate wrote a letter to Page, telling Page that he smoked. Washington and the cellmate spoke with a caseworker, who replied that the issue would\n   be resolved. When asked if the \"IRR was then handled, and [Washington's cellmate] was moved,\" Washington responded that \"this IRR wasn't handled because [he] had to go back and file another one to medical because [he] had an asthmatic attack, and [the cellmate] was still in the cell and smoking.\" Transcript of Jury Trial, Vol. I, at 62. According to Washington, he \"had to file another [IRR] to request that they move him from the cell.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On May 11, 2015, Washington filed another IRR requesting a nonsmoking cellmate. Washington again referred to the medical staff's order that he be housed with a nonsmoker. The responding officer informed Washington that the medical staff's orders requiring him to have a nonsmoking cellmate were \"discontinued, as Crossroads Correctional Center is a nonsmoking facility.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 80. Washington appealed by filing a grievance, but his grievance was denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On June 17, 2015, Washington filed yet another IRR asking to be housed with a nonsmoking cellmate. Because his lay-in for a nonsmoking cellmate was discontinued, his IRR was denied. The responding officer found that Washington's \"medical need ha[s] been met.\" Transcript of Jury Trial, Vol. II, at 275. Washington's grievance and appeal were also denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On December 1, 2015, Washington filed an IRR asking Crossroads to move the facility's designated smoking area away from the medical clinic. He complained that the walkway leading to the clinic's door required him to pass smokers on his way to get breathing treatments. After his IRR was denied, Washington filed a grievance detailing his concerns and their effects on this asthma. Pash denied the grievance because she found that the designated smoking area conformed to Crossroads's smoking policy. Washington appealed to Prudden. Prudden denied the appeal, explaining that the response that Washington received \"adequately addressed [his] complaint\" and stating that \"[t]he staff smoking area is appropriately located 25 feet from the entrance to the medical unit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 307. According to Prudden, Washington \"failed to provide any additional evidence to support [his] claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Washington brought suit against the corrections officials for violation of his Eighth Amendment rights under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, he alleged that these officials were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical need by failing to take reasonable steps to abate the risk of harm that secondhand smoke poses to him. He alleged that his long history of asthma and other respiratory conditions exacerbates these risks. The corrections officials moved for summary judgment, arguing that they were entitled to qualified immunity because no evidence existed that the corrections officials were deliberately indifferent to Washington's conditions of confinement. The district court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The case proceeded to trial. After the close of Washington's case-in-chief, the corrections officials moved for judgment as a matter of law (JML).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a)(1). They did not reassert qualified immunity, but instead argued that Washington failed to present sufficient evidence that they acted with deliberate indifference in failing to take reasonable measures to abate the risk of injury to Washington from secondhand smoke. They also contended that Washington failed to present sufficient evidence that he suffered harm as a direct result of their alleged failure. After the defense rested, they again moved for judgment as a matter of law on the same grounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Again, the motion did not mention qualified immunity. The district court took the corrections officials' motion under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The jury found in Washington's favor and awarded $40,000 in compensatory damages and imposed a total of $71,000 in punitive damages as follows: $20,000 against Denney; $25,000 against Pash; $25,000 against Prudden; and $1,000 against Richey. The district court entered judgment consistent with the jury's verdict. The corrections officials then renewed their motion for judgment as a matter of law and moved for a new trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b) ; Fed. R. Civ. P. 59. In addition to raising the arguments previously made in their Rule 50(a) motions, the corrections officials also argued that Washington failed to present sufficient evidence of outrageous, intentional, or malicious conduct to justify submission of a jury instruction for punitive damages to the jury. The corrections officials did not mention qualified immunity in their motion or opening brief. Instead, in their reply brief in support of their motion, they asserted for the first time that they did not violate Washington's clearly established constitutional rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The district court denied the corrections officials' Rule 50(b) and Rule 59 motions. The district court found that Washington sufficiently proved that he suffered from an objectively serious medical need and that the corrections officials knew of the need but deliberately disregarded it. The court also concluded that sufficient evidence supported the punitive damages award. The court declined to consider the corrections' officials argument that they did not violate Washington's clearly established rights because they did not raise qualified immunity in their opening brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The corrections officials appeal, arguing that (1) they are entitled to qualified immunity because Washington failed to offer sufficient evidence to prove that they violated his clearly established Eighth Amendment rights to be free from deliberate indifference to his serious medical need; and (2) punitive damages were improper because Washington failed to show that they were motivated by evil motive or intent or callous indifference to his Eighth Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"We review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   a district court's denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict.

But they argue that Washington failed to prove that they drew an inference that a substantial risk of serious harm existed to Washington based on these facts. First, they assert they changed Washington's cellmate on two occasions in response to his grievances. Second, they contend that \"Prudden and Denney denied Washington's grievance related to the surgical mask because prison staff determined it was a security issue and medical\" personnel determined it unnecessary.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755960\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/583/557/#p567\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 16-17 (citing Transcript of Jury Trial, Vol. II, at 315 (\"Masks determined to be custody risk and were removed from patient's possession by custody.

Third, they maintain that when Richey discussed an IRR with Washington, she informed him that he could find a nonsmoking cellmate who would agree to cell with him. She also advised him to report any violations of the smoking policy to custody staff so staff could write a violation. They maintain that while Richey could do cell assignments, she rarely did, and no evidence exists that she assigned any of the smoking cellmates to Washington's cell. Fourth, the corrections officials note that none of them prevented Washington from receiving medical care, including his medication and breathing treatments. Finally, while they acknowledge that Washington asked them to change the smoking policy to ban tobacco products at Crossroads, the corrections officials argue that Washington failed to prove they could do so. They contend they could only enforce the existing policy, direct their subordinates to enforce the policy,\n   and direct the offenders to follow the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In light of the \"high standard on overturning a jury verdict,\" we conclude that \"legally sufficient evidence ... support[s] the jury's liability finding.\"\n   <em>\n    Bavlsik\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275364\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/870/800/#p805\">\n    870 F.3d at 805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). First, sufficient evidence supports the jury's finding that Denney was deliberately indifferent to Washington's serious medical need. Washington proved that Denney knew of the serious risk tobacco smoke posed to Washington's health. Denney testified that he knew Washington has asthma and chronic bronchitis. He confirmed that Washington \"has been vocal with staff of Crossroads about the secondhand smoke that goes on.\" Transcript of Jury Trial, Vol. II, at 240. He also stipulated knowing that \"Washington required a nonsmoking cellmate as part of his medical treatment plan since at least as early as 2010.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 342. Washington testified he alerted Denney to the smoking problem at Crossroads both verbally and via letter prior to filing his IRRs. He then filed at least three grievances with Denney in which Washington attributed his asthmatic attacks to secondhand smoke. Denney admitted reviewing these grievances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Sufficient evidence also exists that Denney disregarded the risk that secondhand smoke poses to Washington's health. For instance, Washington complained about a cellmate smoking in his cell, described how he had suffered an asthmatic attack from exposure to secondhand smoke, and explained that the secondhand smoke was being recycled through the ventilation system. Denney denied Washington's grievance as \"without merit,\" despite admitting that prisoners did smoke in their cells and corrections officers violated the smoking policy. Denney admitted he never conducted \"any tests to determine the levels of environmental tobacco smoke in the housing units\" to verify Washington's complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 225. Despite acknowledging he \"developed the standard operating procedures based upon the departmental guidelines,\" Denney testified that he did not recall ever considering the possibility of \"provid[ing] matches or lighters near the receptacles outside\" instead of permitting \"prisoners to have lighters in their cells.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 225, 240. Denney admitted having access to Washington's lay-ins for a nonsmoking cellmate but still permitting Washington to be housed with offenders who were known smokers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Second, sufficient evidence supports the jury's finding that Pash was deliberately indifferent to Washington's serious medical need. As with Denney, Washington proved that Pash knew secondhand smoke was a serious risk to Washington's health. Pash testified that she knew Washington had been treated for asthma. Pash admitted knowing that Washington had \"filed grievances about the indoor smoking that goes on at Crossroads\" and that \"Washington ha[d] been vocal about his concerns about secondhand smoke at Crossroads.\" Transcript of Jury Trial, Vol. I, at 139, 148-49. Washington testified he alerted Pash to the smoking problem at Crossroads via letter prior to filing his IRRs. Through the grievance process, Washington informed Pash that the ventilation system circulated secondhand smoke through the housing units. His grievances also asserted staff was ignoring his lay-in for a nonsmoking cellmate. In addition, his grievances informed Pash that the smoking areas' proximity to the medical facility prevented him from avoiding secondhand smoke. Pash's signature appears on the grievance form immediately below Washington's handwritten notes linking secondhand smoke at Crossroads to his asthmatic attacks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As with Denney, sufficient evidence exists that Pash disregarded the risk that secondhand smoke poses to Washington's health. Pash admitted receiving violations stating that prisoners smoke in their cells yet never conducting \"any studies [on] whether environmental tobacco smoke exists in the housing units at Crossroads.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 129. She admitted knowing that \"Washington had a lay-in and restriction for a no-smoking roommate from September 12, 2014, to September 12, 2015,\" but she acknowledged that Washington was regularly celled with prisoners who violated the smoking policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 141. She acknowledged \"prisoners are allowed to have lighters and cigarettes in their possession at Crossroads\" and \"in their cells.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 131. When asked whether she could \"change the policy,\" she replied, \"I could try to pilot something, I guess.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Pash admitted she denied all of Washington's grievances, referring him to the smoking policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Third, sufficient evidence supports the jury's finding that Prudden was deliberately indifferent to Washington's serious medical need. Washington proved that Prudden knew secondhand smoke was a serious risk to Washington's health. Prudden reviewed and responded to at least three grievance appeals that Washington filed concerning secondhand smoke at Crossroads. She admitted that Washington generally claimed in these grievance appeals that \"his asthma was exacerbated by offenders smoking\" indoors. Transcript of Jury Trial, Vol. II, at 302. Prudden acknowledged in her disposition of Washington's grievance appeal that Washington was \"claim[ing] that the custody staff has failed to enforce the ban on tobacco usage in state buildings.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 293. In another disposition, Prudden acknowledged Washington's claim that he was \"not being permitted by custody staff to have a face mask that was approved by medical\" to \"protect against the tobacco smoke\" in his housing unit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 301.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Washington also produced sufficient evidence that Prudden disregarded the risk that secondhand smoke poses to Washington's health. Prudden denied each of Washington's grievance appeals. Prudden testified that although she investigates some of the grievance appeals on which she rules, she did not investigate any of Washington's grievance appeals. Despite not contacting anyone at Crossroads to inquire about Washington's conditions, Prudden disposed of Washington's appeal on one occasion by reciting that Crossroads is a \"nonsmoking environment\" with a tobacco-use limitations policy in place that \"should resolve [his] complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 304.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Finally, sufficient evidence supports the jury's finding that Richey was deliberately indifferent to Washington's serious medical need. Washington proved that Richey knew secondhand smoke was a serious risk to Washington's health. Washington testified he alerted Richey to the smoking problem at Crossroads via letter prior to filing his IRRs. Richey admitted knowing that Washington needed to be kept away from tobacco smoke and knowing that Crossroads's medical staff had ordered a lay-in for Washington to be assigned a nonsmoking cellmate. She acknowledged a conversation with Washington in which he asked her to move him to a different cell with a nonsmoking cellmate and their discussion of Washington's IRR in which he complained of prisoners smoking in their cells.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The jury also had sufficient evidence from which it could reasonably conclude that Richey disregarded the risk that secondhand smoke poses to Washington's health. Richey admitted that she was responsible\n   for assigning Washington's cellmates. Transcript of Jury Trial, Vol. III, at 382,\n   <em>\n    Washington v.

Part of Richey's job duties involved cell assignments when medical placed a \"bunk restriction\" on an offender.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Despite Washington's lay-in requiring a nonsmoking cellmate, Richey told Washington upon his request for a nonsmoking cellmate that Crossroads \"do[esn]'t track whether an offender smokes or not.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 383.
