BATCHELDER, Circuit Judge.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   After Nicholas Maslonka robbed two banks to obtain money to support his drug habit, he pleaded guilty in Michigan state court to armed robbery as a third habitual offender. During his plea-negotiation process, in an attempt to secure a better plea deal, Maslonka began to cooperate with federal authorities in a separate federal investigation. But when Maslonka did not cooperate to the full satisfaction of the federal authorities, the state prosecutor withdrew the favorable plea offer. Maslonka blames this on his state-appointed trial counsel, and brought this habeas corpus petition alleging that, among other things, his trial counsel rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance during the state plea negotiations. The district court agreed and granted Maslonka's petition. But we disagree. Even assuming Maslonka's trial counsel was constitutionally deficient, Maslonka\n   has not shown that this deficiency prejudiced him. We therefore\n   <strong>\n    REVERSE\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    REMAND\n   </strong>\n   for the district court to address only Maslonka's remaining ineffective-assistance-of-appellate-counsel claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Nicholas Maslonka is a Michigan state prisoner currently serving a sentence of fifteen to twenty-five years' imprisonment for armed robbery under Michigan Compiled Laws \u00a7 750.529 as a third habitual offender. This conviction arose from a December, 2008, armed bank robbery in which Maslonka, a heavy heroin user at the time, entered a bank in St. Clair Shores, MI, and told a teller that he had a gun and needed money. After the teller gave him money, Maslonka left. Maslonka was arrested and initially charged with armed robbery as a fourth habitual offender.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Days later, and before the state had even appointed an attorney for Maslonka, a state detective approached Maslonka about cooperating with federal Drug Enforcement Agency (\"DEA\") agents in a federal drug-trafficking investigation.\n   <em>\n    Maslonka v. Hoffner\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:13-CV-14110,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202666103\">\n    2017 WL 2666103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (E.D. Mich. June 21, 2017). In exchange, Maslonka would receive some consideration from the state. Although the details of this consideration were initially fuzzy, the state prosecutor eventually made his \"best offer\" to Maslonka in open court: in exchange for Maslonka's \"very best of cooperation,\" the state would dismiss Maslonka's fourth-habitual-offender charge outright, resulting in a state guidelines range of 81 to 135 months' imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. Privately, the state prosecutor told Maslonka's counsel that he would recommend a prison sentence at the low end of the state guidelines range. The state prosecutor could not offer any formal sentencing agreement, however, because the state judge overseeing Maslonka's case always adamantly refused to enter into any sentencing agreements with parties. Maslonka's \"very best of cooperation\" would have to include, at minimum, testifying before a federal grand jury in the federal drug trafficking case, if not also at a subsequent federal trial.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Maslonka understood this and agreed to testify before the grand jury. At no point, however, did either the federal or state authorities provide written details of the cooperation they expected from Maslonka, and at no point did Maslonka's counsel ask either state or federal authorities for a written cooperation agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *11. Maslonka's counsel apparently also never asked for Maslonka's cooperation to be limited to providing information about only some individuals, never sought additional details about what federal or state authorities expected from Maslonka beyond his grand jury testimony, and did not advise Maslonka about what was expected from him other than telling Maslonka to \"cooperate to the best of his ability.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As the state proceedings progressed, Maslonka had several meetings with DEA agents, and eventually with an Assistant United States Attorney (\"AUSA\") or two. The first of these meetings happened days after Maslonka's arrest, and before Maslonka first met with his state-appointed counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. Even after Maslonka had been appointed counsel, the federal authorities came to the jail on multiple occasions without giving Maslonka or his counsel notice. But Maslonka claims that during his third meeting with federal authorities they told him that his counsel had given them permission to proceed without her. Regardless, Maslonka's counsel did not attend any of these meetings between Maslonka and the federal authorities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When it came time for Maslonka to testify before the federal grand jury, his counsel was once again not present.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. An AUSA and the DEA agents met with Maslonka for a preparation session immediately before his scheduled testimony.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Maslonka and the federal authorities would later tell different stories about what happened during that preparation session. Maslonka claimed that the DEA agents began to ask him questions about his close friends and family and that he refused to provide any information about them to the federal authorities because he believed that his agreement to cooperate required only that he testify about three particular drug traffickers. According to Maslonka, when he would not provide this information about his close friends and family, the federal authorities became angry and did not allow Maslonka to testify before the grand jury. According to the federal authorities, Maslonka \"changed his story,\" \"became very belligerent\" and \"hostile,\" and did not want to testify before the grand jury. In any event, Maslonka ultimately did not testify before the grand jury.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When the state prosecutor learned that Maslonka had not cooperated to the satisfaction of the federal authorities, he rescinded his offer to dismiss Maslonka's fourth-habitual-offender charge.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Instead, the state prosecutor made an offer that he had planned to make before he learned about Maslonka's potential federal cooperation. Under this less-favorable offer, the state prosecutor would reduce Maslonka's habitual-offender charge from a fourth-habitual-offender charge to a third-habitual-offender charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Maslonka pleaded guilty to armed robbery under Michigan Compiled Laws \u00a7 750.529 as a third habitual offender. The resulting estimated state guidelines range was 108 to 270 months' imprisonment. While entering his plea, Maslonka testified that he was satisfied with his counsel's advice and services. Maslonka later testified that during this court appearance, his counsel had a sidebar conversation with the judge about his attempted cooperation, but that the judge said that Maslonka would \"g[e]t nothing for [his] cooperation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At sentencing, the state asked that Maslonka's sentence be \"as lengthy as possible.\" Maslonka's counsel asked the judge to \"go below the guidelines\" because Maslonka had \"hurt no one but himself\" and argued that his crimes were merely \"crimes against property\" to obtain drugs to satisfy his addiction. Maslonka's counsel did not, however, ask the judge for a downward variance based on Maslonka's attempted cooperation, even though Maslonka claims she promised to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Maslonka unsuccessfully challenged his plea and sentence through both direct appeals and state collateral proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Maslonka first raised his ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claims in his second motion for relief from judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. The Michigan Court of Appeals dismissed this as an impermissible successive motion for relief from judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Maslonka then filed a pro se\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   habeas corpus petition in the district court.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Altogether, Maslonka's petition and supporting affidavit, memorandum, and exhibits spanned over 1300 pages. The district court ordered the state to file a response, and the state filed an answer in which it attempted to summarize and categorize Maslonka's claims. Three years later, the district court appointed counsel to represent Maslonka in this habeas proceeding, and each side submitted supplemental briefs.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The district court then ordered an evidentiary hearing on Maslonka's ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claims, in which Maslonka, his\n   counsel, the state prosecutor, two DEA agents, and an AUSA testified.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    at *3-4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The state said it understood Maslonka's claims to fall into several \"basic categories,\" including that \"Maslonka was without counsel during critical stages of his attempts at cooperation with DEA agents as part of an alleged plea deal\" and that \"Maslonka was denied the effective assistance of counsel during plea negotiations, rendering his plea invalid.\" Despite understanding Maslonka's claims, the state nevertheless explicitly and deliberately waived its procedural-default defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We will not override the state's waiver, because to do so would be an abuse of discretion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Wood v.

The third prong is likely met as well, since the primary benefit that Maslonka hoped to receive was a dropped charge rather than\n   a predetermined sentence amount, and there is no indication on the record before us that the state judge had the discretion to prevent a state prosecutor from dropping a charge before trial.

And once Maslonka failed to testify, the state prosecutor testified, there was \"[a]bsolutely nothing\" that Maslonka's counsel could have done to obtain a better deal than the one Maslonka accepted. In fact, even before Maslonka failed to testify, his conduct during the state proceedings had already put his plea offer in jeopardy.

But the state prosecutor testified that because of his office's \"strict limitations and policies,\" he had never before entered into a formal cooperation agreement with a defendant and he was not aware that any other prosecutor in his office had ever done so either. Similarly, an AUSA testified that his office normally provided cooperation agreements only to federal defendants or persons about to become federal defendants, and that he did not offer Maslonka a cooperation agreement because \"Maslonka was never charged with a [federal] crime nor was he going to be charged with a federal crime.\" And even if he had, \"our written agreement simply says a defendant will provide substantial assistance. It's really quite broad and, to be honest with you, it's quite one sided.\" Maslonka has not demonstrated a reasonable probability that his counsel could have persuaded either the state prosecutor or the federal authorities to deviate from their normal practices by providing a formalized cooperation agreement, or even if his counsel had been able to do so, that such a formalized cooperation agreement would be any more specific than the oral offer Maslonka had already received. Maslonka has therefore failed to demonstrate that his counsel's failure to \"formalize his cooperation obligations\" prejudiced him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Maslonka also argues that his counsel did not \"effectively advocat[e]\" on Maslonka's behalf at the sentencing hearing. The district court agreed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *12. But Maslonka testified that at his plea-entry hearing his counsel had a sidebar conversation with the sentencing judge about Maslonka's attempted cooperation, but that the judge said that Maslonka would \"g[e]t nothing for [his] cooperation.\" Maslonka has not demonstrated a reasonable probability that the sentencing judge would have changed her mind and given Maslonka some benefit for his cooperation if Maslonka's counsel had stated on the record the details of Maslonka's cooperation or had filed a motion for a downward departure. Maslonka has therefore failed to demonstrate that his counsel's failure to \"effectively advocate\" at the sentencing hearing prejudiced him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Because Maslonka has not demonstrated that any constitutionally deficient performance by his counsel prejudiced him, he has not satisfied\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   's test. Maslonka was therefore ineligible for habeas relief on the ground that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance during Maslonka's state prosecution, and the district court erred by granting that relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we\n   <strong>\n    REVERSE\n   </strong>\n   the judgment of the district court. As the district court noted, however, Maslonka also alleged in his habeas petition that his three appellate attorneys were constitutionally ineffective in a variety of ways.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maslonka\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202666103\">\n    2017 WL 2666103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *13 n.2. Maslonka's appointed habeas counsel did not discuss these claims in any detail in Maslonka's supplemental briefing, nor did the district court rule on these claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202666103\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We therefore\n   <strong>\n    REMAND\n   </strong>\n   and instruct the district court to consider only Maslonka's ineffective-assistance-of-appellate-counsel claims.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    We recognize that this is not a normal waiver case, because the state did attempt to raise its procedural-default defense in a supplemental brief after the district court appointed counsel to represent Maslonka in his federal habeas proceedings. And it may seem unfair to hold the state to its initial briefing even though the district court allowed Maslonka a second round of supplemental briefing. But the state could have sought leave from the district court to amend its answer, and it did not do so.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Day v.

As it is, we are faced with the state's explicit and deliberate waiver of its procedural-default defense, and we may not override that waiver, despite the state's change of heart.
