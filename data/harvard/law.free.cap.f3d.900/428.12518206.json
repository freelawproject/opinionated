Johnson admitted to each detective that he drove the shooter to and from the scene but claimed not to know anything about his plan to kill Baity. State prosecutors charged Johnson for Baity's murder under an accountability theory. He was twice tried and convicted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Johnson moved to suppress his statements based on non-compliance with\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   . The trial judge denied the motion. The case proceeded to trial in October 2007, and Detectives Las Cola and Winstead testified about Johnson's statements. The jury found him guilty, but the Illinois Appellate Court reversed based on an instructional error and remanded for a new trial. At the second trial in March 2012, the detectives repeated their testimony about Johnson's statements. Once again Johnson was convicted, but the appellate court again reversed, this time based on insufficient evidence to support accountability liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In August 2015 Johnson sued Detectives Las Cola and Winstead for damages under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   alleging that they violated his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination by interrogating him without\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings and giving testimony about his unwarned statements at trial. The detectives moved to dismiss, arguing that the claims were untimely because Johnson filed suit more than two years after his statements were introduced at trial and accrual was not deferred under\n   <em>\n    Heck v. Humphrey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    512 U.S. 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    129 L.Ed.2d 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994). The district judge agreed and dismissed the claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We reverse in part.\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   blocks a \u00a7 1983 claim that necessarily implies the invalidity of a criminal conviction unless the plaintiff can show that the conviction has already been invalidated. As a corollary to that rule, if a claim is\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   -barred, accrual is deferred until the conviction is overturned. An officer's failure to give\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings is not itself a constitutional violation; rather, a Fifth Amendment violation occurs when an accused's unlawfully obtained confession is introduced as evidence to convict him in a criminal case. Johnson seeks damages arising from the admission of his (allegedly) unwarned statements at trial, resulting in two wrongful convictions. Claims of this kind necessarily imply the invalidity of the convictions,\n   so\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   's rule of deferred accrual applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Even so, to the extent Johnson seeks damages stemming from the first conviction, the claims are time-barred. That conviction was reversed in 2010, starting the two-year limitations clock. So the suit is untimely as to those claims. But the claims for alleged Fifth Amendment violations in the second trial are timely. That conviction was reversed in 2014, and Johnson sued less than a year later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Johnson's criminal case has a lengthy factual and procedural history. We limit our account to the portions of the story that are necessary to understand his \u00a7 1983 claims against these two detectives. We take the background from the operative complaint and the state appellate court's two opinions in the criminal case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Early in the morning on October 1, 2003, Brandon Baity was sitting in a car parked near the intersection of Emerald Avenue and 69th Street on the south side of Chicago when a gray Pontiac drove by and stopped in the middle of the street. A man emerged from the backseat, approached Baity's car, drew a gun, and opened fire. Baity was struck multiple times and died.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Police launched an investigation that eventually led them to Johnson. On December 4, 2003, Detective Robert Garza called Johnson and said that he'd heard he had some information about Baity's murder.\n   <em>\n    People v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=388%20Ill.%20Dec.%2018\">\n    388 Ill.Dec. 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20N.E.3d%201216\">\n    23 N.E.3d 1216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1232 (Ill. App. Ct. 2014) (second appeal). Johnson promised to call the detective back to discuss what he knew. That evening before the promised return call, Detective Garza spotted Johnson on the street and asked if he would accompany him to the police station to talk about the case. Johnson agreed and went with Garza to the station, but the detective didn't question him right away.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20N.E.3d%201216\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In the early morning hours of December 5, Detective Las Cola interviewed Johnson about the Baity murder. Johnson acknowledged that he drove the shooter to and from the scene and described the shooting in some detail.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20N.E.3d%201216\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=388%20Ill.%20Dec.%2018\">\n    388 Ill.Dec. 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20N.E.3d%201216\">\n    23 N.E.3d at 1233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Other detectives questioned Johnson in separate interviews after daybreak. Detective Winstead did so that afternoon; he testified without contradiction-at the suppression hearing and both trials-that he gave Johnson\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings and that Johnson said he understood them.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20N.E.3d%201216\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=388%20Ill.%20Dec.%2018\">\n    388 Ill.Dec. 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20N.E.3d%201216\">\n    23 N.E.3d at 1234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Johnson told Detectives Las Cola and Winstead more or less the same story. On the night of the murder, he was driving around Chicago in a Pontiac Grand Am owned by a friend. Johnson had two passengers in the car that night: Clayton Sims and Nolan Swain. While they were driving around, Sims recognized the driver of a cream-colored car heading in the opposite direction. Sims told Johnson to do a U-turn and follow the car so he could \"holler at that guy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20N.E.3d%201216\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Johnson followed Sims's instructions, and they tailed the car to Emerald and 69th, where it finally stopped. At Sims's direction Johnson pulled alongside and then parked the Pontiac slightly ahead of the other car, blocking its escape.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20N.E.3d%201216\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=388%20Ill.%20Dec.%2018\">\n    388 Ill.Dec. 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20N.E.3d%201216\">\n    23 N.E.3d at 1233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Sims got out, approached the other vehicle, drew a gun, and shot the driver multiple times. Johnson pulled forward and yelled to Sims, \"Come on or I'm going to leave you.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20N.E.3d%201216\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=388%20Ill.%20Dec.%2018\">\n    388 Ill.Dec. 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20N.E.3d%201216\">\n    23 N.E.3d at 1234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Sims sprinted to the Pontiac and jumped in, and they sped off. Johnson told both detectives that he had no idea Sims was planning to shoot the driver of the other car. He denied even knowing that\n   Sims was armed. No charges were issued at that time, and Johnson was released.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Several months later Chicago police arrested Swain and the owner of the Pontiac on unrelated drug charges, and the two men signed statements implicating Johnson in Baity's murder. Johnson claims the police coerced them to make and sign these statements. On June 1, 2004, Johnson was arrested for Baity's murder (he was already in custody on an unrelated murder charge), and a grand jury thereafter indicted both Sims and Johnson for the crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Johnson moved to suppress his statements to the detectives. After a suppression hearing on March 13, 2007, the trial judge denied the motion, ruling that Johnson was not in custody when he spoke to Detective Las Cola and that the other detectives (Winstead included) complied with\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   and used no coercive interrogation tactics. Sims then moved to sever his case from Johnson's. The judge granted the motion, and the cases were tried separately-Johnson's on a theory that he was accountable for Sims's actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Johnson's case was tried twice, first in October 2007 and again in March 2012. During the first trial, the prosecution called Detectives Las Cola and Winstead to the witness stand on October 5 and elicited testimony about the statements Johnson made to them four years earlier. Generally speaking, they testified that Johnson admitted that he tailed Baity's car at Sims's direction, parked next to Baity's car in a position that blocked his escape, called Sims back to the car after the shooting, and drove away from the scene with Sims in the car. The detectives also testified that Johnson disclaimed any knowledge of Sims's plan to shoot Baity. (There was more to the prosecution's case, of course, but it's not necessary to canvass the evidence here.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The defense called no witnesses and Johnson did not testify. The jury found him guilty. Johnson appealed, and the Illinois Appellate Court vacated the conviction and remanded for a new trial based on the judge's failure to clarify the law in response to a question from the jury.\n   <em>\n    People v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=402%20Ill.%20App.%203d%201187\">\n    402 Ill.App.3d 1187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=376%20Ill.%20Dec.%20786\">\n    376 Ill.Dec. 786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1%20N.E.3d%20119\">\n    1 N.E.3d 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) (unpublished order). In this first appeal, Johnson did not contest the suppression ruling or otherwise challenge the admission of his statements at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The case was retried in March 2012. On March 21 Detectives Las Cola and Winstead again took the stand and testified to Johnson's statements. This time Johnson called Sims as a defense witness; he had been acquitted in his own trial and thus faced no jeopardy. Sims denied that Johnson drove him away from the murder scene and claimed that Johnson had no idea that he was going to kill Baity. The jury found Johnson guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On December 31, 2013, the Illinois Appellate Court reversed the conviction based on insufficient evidence of accountability, relying on\n   <em>\n    People v.

(2014). On reconsideration the appellate court adhered to its original decision and reversed the conviction, issuing its decision on December 31, 2014.\n   <em>\n    People v.

In this second round of appellate proceedings, Johnson again raised no challenge to the admission of his statements at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On August 15, 2015-less than a year after the second conviction was reversed but more than two years after his second trial-Johnson filed a sprawling civil-rights suit under \u00a7 1983 naming the prosecutors, multiple Chicago police officers, and the City of Chicago as defendants. He asserted 30 federal and state claims, but this appeal is limited to two. As relevant here, Johnson alleged that Detectives Las Cola and Winstead violated his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination by interrogating him without\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings and testifying about his unwarned statements at both trials, each time resulting in a conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The detectives moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(6). They argued that the claims were time-barred because the alleged Fifth Amendment violations accrued when Johnson's statements were introduced at trial in October 2007 and March 2012, and accrual was not deferred under\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   . The judge agreed and dismissed the claims as untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

That makes sense in this context. Applying\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   categorically is sound as a matter of limitations law where the need for clear rules is especially acute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   points the way toward greater consistency in evaluating\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   questions. Applying it here, we hold that\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   's rule of deferred accrual applies to \u00a7 1983 claims for violation of the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. A claim of this kind seeks a civil remedy for a trial-based constitutional violation that results in wrongful conviction and imprisonment. Such a claim, if successful, necessarily implies the invalidity of the conviction and under\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   is neither cognizable nor accrues until the conviction has been overturned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   As we've noted, the Eighth Circuit reached the opposite conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Simmons v. O'Brien\n   </em>\n   , holding that\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   categorically does not apply to a \u00a7 1983 claim for violation of the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7644902\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/77/1093/#p1095\">\n    77 F.3d at 1095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . More specifically, in\n   <em>\n    Simmons\n   </em>\n   the plaintiff was convicted of murder based in part on his videotaped confession, and his conviction was upheld on direct appeal and post-conviction review. He then brought a \u00a7 1983 claim alleging that his confession was obtained without\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings and while he was under physical and mental duress. The district court thought the claim was premature under\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   \"until a habeas court ruled on the validity of [the] conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7644902\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/77/1093/#p1095\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7644902\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/77/1093/#p1095\">\n    at 1094\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Eighth Circuit disagreed. Leaning heavily on the reference to harmless-error doctrine in\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   's footnote 7, the court held: \"Because harmless error analysis is applicable to the admission at trial of coerced confessions, judgment in favor of [the plaintiff] on this \u00a7 1983 action challenging his confession will not\n   <em>\n    necessarily\n   </em>\n   demonstrate the invalidity of his conviction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7644902\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/77/1093/#p1095\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7644902\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/77/1093/#p1095\">\n    at 1095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   This misreads footnote 7 for the reasons we've already explained. More fundamentally, the Eighth Circuit's holding is irreconcilable with\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   itself. The claims at issue there included a challenge to the admission at trial of an unlawful voice identification.\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    512 U.S. at 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39868\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/477/\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A constitutional error in admitting identification evidence at trial is subject to harmless-error review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Sanders\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3541641\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/708/976/#p988\">\n    708 F.3d 976\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 988 (7th Cir. 2013). If the Eighth Circuit is right,\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   would have come out differently, at least as to the unlawful-identification claim. Finally, the Eighth Circuit's approach cannot be reconciled with our decision in\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   , which held that claims for trial-based constitutional violations are indeed\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   -barred until the conviction is overturned. For these reasons, we decline to follow\n   <em>\n    Simmons\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Our holding that\n   <em>\n    Heck\n   </em>\n   applies does not mean that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of Johnson's Fifth Amendment claims may proceed. To the extent that Johnson seeks damages associated with alleged Fifth Amendment violations at his first trial in 2007, the claims are indeed time-barred. That conviction was reversed in 2010, and the two-year time clock began to run then. The limitations period expired long before he filed this suit in 2015. The claims arising from the second trial in 2012 are timely, however. That conviction was reversed in 2014, and Johnson filed suit less than a year later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As an alternative ground for affirmance, the detectives invoke the absolute immunity that shields trial witnesses.\n   <em>\n    Rehberg v.
