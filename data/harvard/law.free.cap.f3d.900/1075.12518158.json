He also challenges the Board of Immigration Appeals' (\"BIA\") conclusion that Arizona third-degree escape is an aggravated felony. We deny the petition insofar as it raises due process and equal protection claims related to the citizenship determination; but we grant and remand insofar as the BIA ruled that the escape conviction is an aggravated felony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Petitioner was born in Honduras in 1967. He was admitted to the United States in early 1981, when he was 13 years old, on the basis of his then-pending adoption by Roma Dent, a United States citizen. The adoption was finalized later in 1981.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In January of 1982, the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") received an application filed by Petitioner's adoptive mother seeking to naturalize Petitioner (who was then 14 years old) as a United States citizen. Petitioner and his mother lived in Arkansas. The INS transferred the application to its New Orleans office because there was no office in Arkansas and because the Memphis office was overworked. More than 200,000 naturalization petitions were filed with the INS in 1982. At that time, it typically took about a year and a half, after the filing of an application for a child's naturalization petition, to schedule an interview.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The INS scheduled an interview on Roma Dent's application for August 4, 1983, less than 17 months after it was filed. The INS arranged for the interview to be held in Arkansas, near the Dents' home. But neither Petitioner nor his mother appeared at the appointed time and place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Petitioner's mother then asked for a new interview date, explaining that Petitioner would be in Honduras \"for 6 months probably.\" The INS obliged the request, setting a second interview date of March 13, 1984. There is no evidence that the INS knew that Petitioner would still be abroad at that time. Again, neither he nor his mother appeared.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    The Honorable Ivan L.R.

The INS responded:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n    So good to hear from you. Am unable to locate Sazar['s] records in our office as I do not have his Alien card number. Also\n    include Sazar['s] complete name and date of birth.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n    We will do all we can to get him his citizenship.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    Petitioner's mother wrote the requested information on the form, adding: \"Is 16 will be 17 Nov 15.\" That note was postmarked August 27, 1984.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    On June 10, 1985, the INS placed the following note in Petitioner's file:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n    Joan of U.S. Court Clerk's Office of Fort Smith, AR called this date to inquire about Sazar Dent's status. She advised he had been in a lot of trouble, had run away from several boy's homes, etc. They (the authorities) were hoping they could \"deport\" him. Advised her that he was a legal permanent resident; having been adopted by a U.S. citizen.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    The INS did not schedule any additional interviews on the application of Petitioner's mother. When Petitioner turned 18, he aged out of his mother's application, but he became eligible to naturalize on his own, as an adult.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201433\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1433\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a), 1445(b) (1980).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    The INS scheduled an interview for Petitioner on February 25, 1986. He missed that appointment, but the INS \"squeezed\" him in the next day. At that interview, the INS deemed Roma Dent's application \"nonfiled,\" thereby terminating that application. Also on February 26, 1986, Petitioner filed his own naturalization application and petition. The INS immediately recommended approval of the petition. In 1986, when the INS determined that an applicant was eligible to naturalize, the applicant would file a petition with the local federal district court and the INS would recommend its approval. Here, Petitioner filed a petition in the District Court for the Western District of Arkansas on the day it was approved by the INS. All that remained for him to do was to (1) submit to a preliminary examination by the INS, (2) appear in a district court for a final determination on naturalization, and (3) take the oath of naturalization.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201445\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1445\n    </extracted-citation>\n    - 48 (1986).\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    Thereafter, the INS scheduled Petitioner for the preliminary examination on at least two different dates between 1986 and 1987. He did not show up for any of the appointments. Although at least one notice was returned to sender, Petitioner admitted that he received at least one of the notices, and the INS sent all the notices to addresses that Petitioner had provided.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    Because Petitioner had failed to appear for at least two scheduled interviews on his own petition, the INS scheduled a final hearing for March 23, 1989, at which it would recommend denial of the application for failure to prosecute. The INS sent notice of that hearing to the address at which Petitioner had received one of the 1986 notices, which also was Petitioner's address of record, but the notice was returned to sender. Petitioner admitted that he had failed to notify the INS of his changes of address and that he had failed to appear for the final hearing. The district court denied his naturalization petition on March 23, 1989, for failure to prosecute.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    In 2003, Petitioner was convicted of two Arizona crimes: possession or use of narcotics (\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ariz.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2013-3401\">\n     Ariz.

Rev. Stat. \u00a7 13-2502\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ). Several months later, the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") initiated removal proceedings. DHS charged that Petitioner was removable under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(2)(A)(iii), on the\n    ground that the escape conviction is a crime of violence and, therefore, an aggravated felony. Later, DHS added a charge that Petitioner was removable under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n     8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(2)(B)(i), on the ground that possession of narcotics is a controlled substance offense.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    After the immigration judge and the BIA concluded that Petitioner was removable, he petitioned for review with this court, bringing a citizenship claim, among others. We transferred the case to the District of Arizona \"for a new hearing on [his] nationality claim.\"\n    <em>\n     Dent v.

But the statute does not distinguish between citizens and non-citizens. In all cases, a parent must be a citizen in order to confer citizenship on an adopted child.

Requiring adoptive parents to petition for their children's naturalization helped ensure that the child had a genuine relationship with the parent. Biological parents, by definition, need not provide assurance of a genuine parental relationship. And the intensive naturalization process gave the government the opportunity to inquire into naturalizing parents' relationships with their previously adopted children, even if the parents did not list their children on their application. Further, although citizen parents first had to go through a visa process for their foreign-born, adopted children, the fact that there were other safeguards against fraud is irrelevant under rational basis review. Because a legitimate governmental interest is rationally related to \u00a7 1433's requirement that citizen parents petition to naturalize their adopted, foreign-born children, we conclude that \u00a7 1433 does not violate the Fifth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Due Process\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Petitioner also contends that the INS violated his due process rights by acting with deliberate indifference, both during the processing of his mother's application on his behalf, as a child, and during the processing of his own application,\n    as an adult.

Had Petitioner attended either interview, he would have become a citizen. Nor is there any evidence that the INS knew, or should have known, that Petitioner was in Honduras when it scheduled the first interview.

Once the INS\n    <em>\n     approved\n    </em>\n    Petitioner's own application for citizenship (as an adult) in 1986, his mother's earlier petition became irrelevant. Nothing that happened while processing his mother's petition caused or contributed to Petitioner's failure to complete the adult naturalization process following the rapid approval of his application for citizenship. Had the adult naturalization process been more onerous than the child naturalization process, Petitioner could have suffered prejudice because the INS's errors would have resulted in a more burdensome naturalization process. But the processes were closely similar and equally burdensome.
