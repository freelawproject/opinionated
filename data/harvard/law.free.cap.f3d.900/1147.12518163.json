The district court denied that motion, but it did not enter judgment in a separate document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Kingsbury filed a notice of appeal just over two months after the district court denied his \u00a7 2255 motion. Whether his notice of appeal was timely depends on whether Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58 's requirement that a separate document be filed upon entry of judgment applies in \u00a7 2255 proceedings. The parties here agree that Rule 58 's separate document requirement does apply, but because this question determines whether we have appellate jurisdiction over Kingsbury's appeal, we must resolve it ourselves.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    WMX Techs., Inc. v. Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7640846\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/104/1133/#p1135\">\n    104 F.3d 1133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1135 (9th Cir.1997) (en banc). We now join the majority of our sister circuits in holding that Rule 58 's separate document requirement applies in \u00a7 2255 proceedings. Kingsbury's notice of appeal was therefore timely, and we accordingly have jurisdiction over his appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Kingsbury pled guilty to one count each of conspiracy to commit health care fraud, conspiracy to obstruct a Medicare audit, and making a materially false statement to\n   law enforcement officers. He was sentenced to 78 months in prison. Kingsbury appealed his convictions and sentence but voluntarily dismissed his appeal before filing an opening brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Kingsbury then filed a pro se sworn motion under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , seeking to vacate his conviction and sentence on several grounds, including that his counsel was ineffective and that his guilty plea was not knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. The district court denied the motion and declined to issue a certificate of appealability. But it did not file a document entering judgment separate from its order denying the \u00a7 2255 motion. Kingsbury filed a pro se notice of appeal, which also serves as a request for a certificate of appealability,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   9th Cir. R. 22-1(d), 64 days after the district court denied his motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Unsure whether the notice of appeal had been filed in time to give us jurisdiction, we appointed counsel and ordered briefing so we could \"determine whether entry of a separate judgment is required in section 2255 proceedings and whether this court has jurisdiction over appellant's request for a certificate of appealability.\" Our order recognized that it was \"an open question in this Circuit as to whether Fed.

Those rules set the time for the losing party to appeal from the district court's disposition of \u00a7 2255 motions. Rule 11 of the Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings for the United States District Courts (\"Rule 11\") states that \" Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a) governs the time to appeal an order entered under these rules.\" Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a), in turn, states that a notice of appeal must be filed \"within 60 days after entry of the judgment or order appealed from\" when the United States is a party, Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), and that a judgment or order is entered for purposes of Rule 4(a) when it is entered in compliance with Rule 58(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(7).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under Rule 58, an order that is dispositive of the proceedings is usually insufficient to enter judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 58(a). Instead, judgment must be expressly entered in a \"separate document,\" except when the district court decides certain listed motions-which do not include \u00a7 2255 motions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 58(a), (c)(2)(A). If a separate document is required, and one is not filed, judgment is entered automatically 150 days after the court enters an order disposing of a case. Fed. R. Civ. P. 58(c)(2)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Integral to the time for appeal in Rule 4, therefore, is the event that starts the time in which a party can appeal-specifically, either the filing of a separate document entering judgment or the passage of 150 days.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

It is true that Rule 58 is a civil rule and that \u00a7 2255 proceedings have some procedural characteristics that might appear to weigh against application of the civil rules. But given the specific wording of the applicable rules, which indicate that the civil requirements for the time to appeal apply here, we do not need to reach a conclusion about the civil or criminal nature of \u00a7 2255 proceedings generally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We therefore join the majority of our sister circuits in holding that Rule 58 's separate document requirement applies to \u00a7 2255 proceedings. If a separate document entering judgment is filed with the order resolving a \u00a7 2255 motion, the losing party has 60 days to file a notice of appeal.
