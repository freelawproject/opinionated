He is by all accounts a personable and kind boy and an enthusiastic learner. In fact, if there is one constant in this record, it is that every witness for either party has been complimentary of and affectionate toward L.H.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   From 2009 to 2013, L.H. attended Normal Park Elementary School, a public school operating under the Hamilton County (Tenn.) Department of Education (HCDE).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   To accommodate L.H.'s intellectual disability, a group (the \"IEP team\"), comprising his parents and several teachers and staff, prepared an annual \"individualized education program\" (IEP), which is a requisite planning document with goals and objectives based on L.H.'s past and expected performance. Through second grade, the annual IEPs followed the regular Tennessee school curriculum in a regular-education classroom with non-disabled children of the same age or grade (hereinafter \"grade-level peers\"), though with added special-education supports and services for L.H., such as daily \"pull-out time\" (one-on-one instruction with a special-education teacher outside the regular classroom), \"push-in time\" (a special-education teacher in the regular classroom), occupational therapy, speech-language therapy, and a full-time aide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   L.H.'s parents are fully invested in his education and participated in formulating his IEPs. Because they have expectations for L.H. and want him to reach his full potential, they pushed their preferences for his education and regularly sent information regarding Down Syndrome to assist in his educational development. Outside the classroom, they read with L.H., reviewed his homework daily, and did extracurricular activities with him. Moreover, it was their strong and clearly stated desire that L.H. be \"mainstreamed,\" i.e., educated in the standard public-school setting, integrated with non-disabled grade-level peers, and taught the standard curriculum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During his first three years at Normal Park (kindergarten and two first grades), L.H. made progress academically but did not keep pace with his grade-level peers. By May 2012, he had learned basic math concepts but overall was at a kindergarten level. His independent writing ability was also at or below a kindergarten level. But he was reading at a mid-to-late first-grade level, nearly on par with his grade-level peers, though his comprehension was behind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When the IEP team met to develop L.H.'s second-grade IEP in May 2012, some HCDE staff suggested moving L.H. to a Comprehensive Development Classroom (CDC), an isolated class comprising solely special-education students and located at a different school. L.H.'s parents opposed that suggestion and insisted that L.H. remain in the regular-education classroom. So L.H. remained at Normal Park with the aid of special-education supports and services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The 2012-2013 (second grade) IEP's educational goals followed regular second-grade curricular goals, which were a significant step up from the goals contained\n   in L.H.'s 2011-2012 (repeated 1st grade) IEP, both in number and in difficulty. The HCDE teachers and staff later claimed they thought the goals were unrealistic, but all members of the IEP team-including L.H.'s parents and eight HCDE teachers and staff-agreed to the goals and objectives then.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   When second grade started and L.H. struggled to meet the goals, his classroom teacher, Stefanie Higgs, and his special-education teacher, Lisa Hope, claimed that he lacked the prerequisite skills. Because both Higgs and Hope were relatively inexperienced, Hope consulted Jeanne Manley-an experienced special-education teacher designated by HCDE for teacher training and support-several times regarding teaching strategies to try with L.H. Despite these efforts, L.H. did not progress as fast or as far as they hoped. These teachers also reported that L.H.'s behavior was becoming disruptive (claiming he would invade his classmates' personal space, disobey teachers' directions, and \"shut down\" or refuse to work).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Surmising that the behavioral issues were due to L.H.'s frustration with the difficulty of the work, Hope modified his lessons to a kindergarten level (with the exception of reading, which remained at a first-grade level). Higgs and Hope also attempted to minimize distractions by isolating L.H. toward the back of the room, away from tables with containers of distracting work materials and the traffic of the other students. According to Hope, L.H.'s behavior improved noticeably after these changes, particularly the reduction of his work level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   L.H.'s behavior improved but progress toward the second-grade goals in his IEP did not, and Higgs and Hope doubted that he would meet the IEP goals by year end. When they relayed this in L.H.'s second-quarter IEP progress report, L.H.'s parents requested a meeting. At the meeting, HCDE staff stated that L.H. was working far below grade-level expectations. Jill Levine, the Normal Park Principal, told L.H.'s parents that although L.H. had benefitted from the regular-education setting in kindergarten and first grade, he had \"hit a wall\" and was no longer progressing, and she again suggested the CDC special-education classroom. L.H.'s parents opposed this, specifically objecting to the lack of interaction with non-disabled grade-level peers, the absence of a normal academic curriculum or standards, and separating L.H. from his friends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   During four IEP planning meetings over the next few months, HCDE staff insisted on the CDC placement. L.H.'s parents resisted. They contested HCDE's assessment of L.H.'s performance, questioned the teachers' qualifications, and relied on evidence of the benefits of mainstreaming and the downsides of segregation in the CDC. HCDE, in turn, emphasized L.H.'s poor performance, alleged disruptiveness, and the necessity of the CDC placement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In May 2013, over his parents' objections, the HCDE finalized L.H.'s 2013-2014 (third grade) IEP. HCDE asserted that L.H. needed more support than it could provide at Normal Park and unilaterally ordered L.H. transferred to the CDC at Red Bank Elementary, a segregated classroom for children with disabilities, with an alternative curriculum, at a different location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   According to L.H.'s parents, this new IEP resulted in a 40% reduction in L.H.'s academic instruction time, from five hours per day to three hours per day. According to HCDE, however, L.H. would spend 3.5 hours per day (90 minutes of reading, 90 minutes of math, and 30 minutes of pre-vocational instruction) in the segregated classroom with the other special-education students, and spend the rest of the day with non-disabled peers at lunch, music,\n   art, physical education, and 30 minutes of social/emotional special education push-in instruction. But, even by HCDE's account, some of the proposed instruction appeared questionable. For example, HCDE's director of Special Education, Margaret Abernathy, testified that L.H. would receive instruction in math and handwriting through his physical education (gym) class and, though conceding that the physical education teacher is not a state accredited math teacher, she insisted that the physical education standards require higher order thinking skills such as math.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The new curriculum was different qualitatively as well as quantitatively. This new IEP did not tie L.H.'s academic goals to third-grade regular-education standards in any way. Instead, the Red Bank CDC uses an online special-education software program called the Unique Learning System (ULS) to teach reading and math in the framework of monthly science and social studies units, which can be supplemented as necessary by more focused reading and math lessons. The ULS program follows Common CORE standards but it is not peer-reviewed, as the IDEA requires, nor is it tied to Tennessee's general-education standards. It does not provide standard report cards or track educational progress under state standards. Particularly distressing to L.H.'s parents is that this curriculum does not provide for any homework.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Physically, the Red Bank CDC was small and self-contained, with two teachers and nine students. Despite the attempted integration during lunch and arts classes, experts from both sides agreed that there would be little interaction between disabled and non-disabled students. While in music class or at lunch, CDC students sit and interact almost exclusively with each other. Also, while nearly all of the CDC students were verbal to some degree or another, and most demonstrated an ability to work with fewer adult prompts than L.H. had been requiring, none appeared to be as advanced as L.H. in reading or in their desire or ability to socialize. Thus L.H. would have been particularly isolated in the CDC, but likely unable to comprehend why.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   L.H.'s parents rejected the May 2013 IEP and, instead, enrolled L.H. at The Montessori School of Chattanooga (TMS) for the 2013-2014 schoolyear, where he has remained during resolution of this case. TMS is a private school, operating in the Montessori Method, with a curriculum aligned with Common CORE standards and covering language and math, as well as a variety of other subjects, such as botany, zoology, cooking, and history. Classrooms are multi-grade, and students proceed through the curriculum at their own pace. The teacher prepares an individualized lesson plan for each student, and the student picks the order in which to work on the lessons. When the student completes the plan, the teacher prepares a new plan based on the student's progress. L.H.'s classes had 17 or 18 students, a classroom teacher, and a full-time aide to help L.H. with his work and keep him on task. L.H.'s parents paid for the aide, though TMS actually employed her. L.H. got along well with his classmates, none of whom were disabled, and though he had some issues with personal space and behavior when he was overexcited, he was universally considered to be friendly, respectful, and well-behaved. It also bears mention that L.H.'s parents are pleased\n   with L.H.'s progress-academic, social, and behavioral-during his five years at TMS, covering third through seventh grades.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   According to TMS's testing and progress reports, L.H. made steady progress. HCDE disputed this, however, accusing TMS of misrepresenting the results and arguing that L.H. did not actually progress at TMS. L.H.'s parents and experts contend that much of this is rooted in prejudice on the part of public school employees against the Montessori Method, and it is hard to ignore the partisan motive of HCDE's teachers and staff, who are effectively parties in this case; TMS's teachers and staff have no such motive. But the district court found HCDE's witnesses more credible and sided with HCDE's assessment that, although the TMS teachers and the parents' experts assessed him as having achieved a much higher level, as of L.H.'s third or fourth grade year at TMS, his math skills were at a first-grade level, his ability to decode words was a third-grade level, and his reading comprehension an early-second-grade level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Meanwhile, L.H.'s parents had filed an IDEA administrative complaint to challenge the IEP. In that proceeding, an ALJ ruled for HCDE, finding that Normal Park was not appropriate for L.H. and, therefore, HCDE properly removed him to the Red Bank CDC. L.H.'s parents appealed to the district court, which heard additional evidence and rendered an independent decision, holding that placement at Red Bank CDC was more restrictive than necessary and therefore improper, but that L.H.'s parents' alternative private placement at TMS did not satisfy the IDEA, so they were not entitled to reimbursement.\n   <em>\n    L.H. #1\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206581235\">\n    2016 WL 6581235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Both parties appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201400\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , requires states that receive federal funds for education to provide every disabled child who wants it a \"free and appropriate public education\" (FAPE).\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201412\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A) ;\n   <em>\n    Endrew F. v.

The district court framed this in the obverse, showing that the mainstreamed placement would have \"some\" benefit. That is, because mainstreaming at Normal Park provided L.H. with \"some\" educational benefit, the\n   <em>\n    Roncker\n   </em>\n   \"no benefit\" exception did not apply and the IEP's segregated placement at Red Bank CDC could not overcome the LRE requirement on that basis. Whether Normal Park would or could provide a \"meaningful educational benefit\" in its own right (and thus satisfy the substantive requirement for the IEP) is a different question, but not a standalone question given that \"a placement which m[ight] be considered better for academic reasons m[ight] not be appropriate because of the failure to provide for mainstreaming.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1844643\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/700/1058/#p1063\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As for HCDE's contention that the district court must not have found that Normal Park could have provided L.H. with a\n   <em>\n    meaningful\n   </em>\n   educational benefit because the opinion did not use\n   <em>\n    that exact phrase\n   </em>\n   , that contention is unsupportable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although it is true that the district court's opinion did not state\n   <em>\n    expressly\n   </em>\n   that Normal Park could provide L.H. with a meaningful educational benefit, the totality of the court's findings clearly compel that conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   HCDE next argues that the district court erred by concluding that the State ALJ-who had to decide the larger challenge to the IEP's substantive component, not merely the LRE question raised to the district court on appeal-used the wrong standard for measuring whether L.H. was receiving a meaningful benefit (i.e., could remain mainstreamed) at Normal Park, which led the court to improperly reject the State ALJ's findings. As the court made clear, the State ALJ most certainly did use the wrong standard. At the \"due process hearing,\" HCDE-with support from its expert, Dr. Kabot-argued to the State ALJ that L.H. had to exhibit a \"mastery\" of the regular education grade-level curriculum. The State ALJ accepted that standard, found that L.H. could not meet it, and ruled for HCDE. But the district court rejected that\n   standard, holding: \"What the IDEA implies, the case law makes explicit: a child need not master the general-education curriculum for mainstreaming to remain a viable option. Rather, the appropriate yardstick is whether the child, with appropriate supplemental aids and services, can make progress toward the [ ] IEP['s] goals in the regular education setting.\"\n   <em>\n    L.H. #1\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206581235\">\n    2016 WL 6581235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *14-15 (citing multiple cases) (citations, quotation marks, editorial marks, and footnote omitted).

The court then recited the testimony of HCDE's teachers, staff, and expert (Dr. Kabot), each having used the improper \"mastery\" standard, and concluded with a note that: \"To be fair, in her testimony before this [c]ourt, Dr. Kabot retreated from that position, agreeing that the correct standard for a child with an IEP is not necessarily mastery of the general-education curriculum, but making progress on the child's individualized IEP goals.

Specifically, HCDE contends that \"[L.H.'s] parents' demands for grade level standards necessitated that the educators address those demands in their testimony\" and \"none of HCDE's educators testified that such a standard existed.\" This claim is disingenuous. It is true that L.H.'s parents demanded that his goals be tied to the general-education curriculum, perhaps even unreasonably so, as the district court commented.\n   <em>\n    L.H. #1\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206581235\">\n    2016 WL 6581235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *16.

Numerous teachers testified that L.H. was not benefitting from his placement at Normal Park\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   he could not master the grade-level curriculum-that standard was improper, as Dr. Kabot even conceded.

Importantly, HCDE is not arguing that L.H.'s experts were\n   <em>\n    unqualified\n   </em>\n   , which could be framed as a legal challenge; HCDE is arguing that their testimony was\n   <em>\n    unpersuasive\n   </em>\n   due to the foregoing accusations, which is a challenge to the court's weighing of the evidence and determination of the facts. We review that challenge for clear error,\n   <em>\n    Deal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9189963\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/392/840/#p858\">\n    392 F.3d at 850\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and HCDE comes nowhere close to showing any clear error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The crux of this argument is that the district court should have deferred to the opinions of HCDE's teachers and staff because they had spent far more time with L.H. and were more familiar with his academic record and individual idiosyncrasies, so they knew best how he should be educated. If the law were that a court must defer to the opinions of those who spend the most time with the student and presumably know him best, then there would be no place for experts. Moreover, parents could never prevail because the student's teachers will always spend more time with the student or know the student better than the parents' hired experts. On the other hand, the parents spend more time with the student and know the student better than any teacher. Taking HCDE's argument to this ultimate end, the district court would actually defer to the student's parents, who surely know the student the best, regardless of any expertise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The district court recounted testimony from all of the witnesses, both lay (e.g., HCDE teachers) and expert (from both sides). Although the court considered information about Down Syndrome generally, it then said \"this does little to advance [the parents'] case unless [the parents] can show the proposition holds true for L. H.\"\n   <em>\n    L.H. #1\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206581235\">\n    2016 WL 6581235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *13. From there, the court considered L.H. individually.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 13-18. There is no merit to HCDE's challenge to the district court's weighing of the testimony here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   HCDE argues that L.H.'s parents convinced the district court that \"mainstreaming\" is about physical location, whereas it is really about academic methodology. Not only is this contention wrong in many ways, it is a bit bizarre. HCDE's theory is that, because special-education students are so different from their classmates socially and intellectually, they are necessarily \"isolated\" from them even though they are physically in the same room. Thus, special-education students can never truly be \"mainstreamed.\" Specifically, HCDE contends that L.H. was not mainstreamed at Normal Park, asserting that L.H.'s second grade teachers at Normal Park placed him \"at his own table in the back of the classroom\" and treated him so differently from the general student population that he \"was essentially in a classroom of one even though he was physically located in the gen-ed classroom.\" HCDE then refers to a video of L.H. at TMS to claim that, even at TMS, \"L.H. [was] functionally isolated from typically developing peers despite sitting in their midst.\" This is common, HCDE says, because \"the academic gap between students with disabilities and typical peers can be so extreme that it is isolating and stigmatizing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   This is really an argument against \"mainstreaming\" as a concept, because HCDE believes it is impossible, impractical, or counterproductive. As defined in the statute, \u00a7 1412(a)(5)(A), \"mainstreaming\" means placing a disabled student \"with children who are not disabled,\" such as in\n   a general education classroom, whereas \"not mainstreaming\" would mean placing a disabled student in \"special classes, separate schooling, or [conducting] other removal of children from the regular education environment,\" such as the Red Bank CDC. This directly contradicts HCDE's premise that mainstreaming is somehow a function of the child's disability rather than his placement by the school. This might be merely the view of HCDE's appellate attorneys, but if it is truly HCDE's view, then it is worrisome and inadvertently supports L.H.'s parents' experts' opinions that HCDE teachers and staff reject mainstreaming because they do not understand it, do not believe in it, and need extensive training on why it is valuable and how to do it. These actions at Normal Park do not demonstrate a failure of mainstreaming as a concept, but a failure of L.H.'s teachers and the other HCDE staff to properly engage in the process of mainstreaming L.H. rather than isolating and removing him when the situation became challenging. Finally, these accusations about L.H.'s isolation at TMS, while typical of HCDE's exaggerated and questionable criticism of TMS, are directly refuted by TMS teachers and staff as well as L.H.'s parents, who have been pleased with L.H.'s performance and progress at TMS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    F.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Finally, HCDE argues that because this is actually a case about academic methodologies, the governing standard is one of deference to the school teachers and staff per\n   <em>\n    McLaughlin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9326382\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/320/663/#p673\">\n    320 F.3d at 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . First, HCDE repeats its claim that because L.H.'s Normal Park teachers had isolated him functionally, even though he was in a regular classroom, \"L.H. had never truly been in the LRE and that [by advocating for a regular classroom, such as he was in at Normal Park,] his parents were not advocating for the LRE.\" Next, HCDE contends that L.H.'s parents were only concerned with the\n   <em>\n    physical location\n   </em>\n   of L.H.'s placement (Normal Park Elementary rather than Red Bank Elementary), asserting that \"neither [L.H.'s] parents nor the district court have taken issue with any aspect of the 2013-14 IEP apart from the location where L.H. would have been served.\" Therefore, HCDE claims, because neither Normal Park nor Red Bank was actually mainstreaming L.H., the only complaint was \"geographic location,\" so the court \"repeated the same error that confused the trial court in\n   <em>\n    McLaughlin\n   </em>\n   ,\" namely the failure to defer \"to the educators' choice of methodologies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   As discussed above, this first premise is that L.H. should not be mainstreamed because the teachers and staff at Normal Park were unwilling or unable to properly engage in the process of mainstreaming L.H., as they deemed it futile or useless in light of his disability. This is the type of approach that the IDEA was designed to remedy, not encourage or protect. The second premise-that the only complaint about Red Bank CDC was \"geographic location\"-is another claim by HCDE that is at best disingenuous. L.H.'s parents' primary complaint about Red Bank CDC was its intentional segregation (non-mainstreaming), which HCDE attempts to morph into a mere difference in physical location. But, to be clear, L.H.'s parents opposed the CDC, not its location. They also complained that Red Bank CDC's curriculum was not \"mainstream\" in that it was not a regular curriculum, it set very low educational expectations (far too low for L.H.'s individual capabilities), it was not peer reviewed or tied to state standards, it provided no report cards or homework, and it had certain teachers in uncertified roles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    McLaughlin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9326382\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/320/663/#p673\">\n    320 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   670 n.2, the parents opposed a move to a CDC at a different school, but only because they \"wanted their daughter to attend [the neighborhood school,] Dimondale Elementary, and no other school,\" and conceded that \"if a [CDC] had been available at Dimondale, [they] would not have objected to the appropriateness of a [CDC] placement.\" Unlike this case, in which L.H.'s parents want more interaction with non-disabled peers, want a peer reviewed and regular state certified curriculum, and want a more typical educational experience with homework and report cards, \"the parties [in\n   <em>\n    McLaughlin\n   </em>\n   ] did not disagree about the extent to which [the student] would be mainstreamed with non-disabled peers ... [and] the disputed issue did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   involve determination of the least restrictive environment,\"\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 672. L.H.'s case is about which of two very different approaches provides the disabled student with the least restrictive environment; it is not merely about two different physical locations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   All in all, none of HCDE's arguments is persuasive. The district court was correct in finding that the proposed Red Bank CDC IEP did not provide the LRE, and therefore failed L.H.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In their cross-appeal, L.H.'s parents claim that the district court erred by finding that L.H.'s placement at TMS did not satisfy the IDEA. More importantly, due to that finding, the court concluded that the IDEA did not grant L.H.'s parents reimbursement for that placement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   As discussed, L.H.'s parents rejected the HCDE's segregated, disabled-students-only CDC at Red Bank, so they removed him from the HCDE public school system. According to their expert, Dr. Kathleen Whitbread, at that point they had two choices: homeschooling, which is obviously counterproductive to the idea of mainstreaming, or private schooling at TMS, at $7,500 annual tuition plus $9,000 to $17,128 per year for L.H.'s personal paraprofessional aide. L.H. has been at TMS for the past five schoolyears (third through seventh grades).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Parents who unilaterally move a child to a private school in response to an unacceptable IEP get reimbursement pursuant to the IDEA only upon a finding that both (1) the public school violated the IDEA and (2) the private school is appropriate under the IDEA.\n   <em>\n    Florence Cnty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"230315\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/7/#p15\">\n    510 U.S. at 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"230315\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/7/#p15\">\n    114 S.Ct. 361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The district court relied on HCDE's claims that the Montessori approach fails to provide this ambiguous \"systematic structure\"; those claims appear both overblown and unreliable. In fact, the parents' expert, Dr. Whitbread,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   testified that the Montessori approach is \"a curriculum that is well-suited for children with Down syndrome in many respects,\" and good for L.H. in particular. The court appears to have rejected TMS, at least in part (though a critical reading reveals it to be much more than merely in part) because the court rejects the Montessori approach in general.

Also, TMS satisfies the requirement that the private school must \"provide some element of special education services in which the public school placement was deficient\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9065919\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/348/513/#p523\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9065919\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/348/513/#p523\">\n    at 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . TMS provides mainstreaming, but it does not offer\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   the benefits of mainstreaming. Unlike Red Bank CDC, TMS provides a curriculum tied to the regular state standards. At TMS, L.H. produces a daily journal, has nightly homework, and receives report cards, all of which facilitate his parents' involvement, and convey to L.H. that this is a regular school experience. Red Bank CDC has no homework or report cards. As to L.H.'s need for focused, systematic instruction with individual motivation and feedback, TMS provides him with an involved, qualified teacher and an individual aide. Finally, the district court relied on its credibility assessments and HCDE's contrary views of L.H.'s progress at TMS to discount TMS's evidence that L.H. had made appropriate academic progress. But the court did not discuss L.H.'s parents' views about L.H.'s progress at TMS or their overall satisfaction with it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   HCDE further argues that we must also or alternatively deny reimbursement to L.H.'s parents because they could have invoked the IDEA's \"stay put\" provision, \u00a7 1415(j), and kept L.H. at Normal Park where, according to HCDE, he was receiving a FAPE.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to HCDE, L.H.'s parents did not believe that Normal Park \"had suddenly become an inappropriate placement,\" but rather \"were simply indignant that the teachers had suggested a part-time CDC placement\" at Red Bank CDC. Maybe it is true that L.H.'s parents were indignant at that \"suggestion,\" which was obviously more than a suggestion, but they also had reason to be concerned that those teachers-who had backed up that \"suggestion\" by insisting that they could not and would not provide the necessary support services to L.H. at Normal Park-were unwilling to teach L.H. under any circumstances. Moreover, as already discussed, these Normal Park teachers were openly unwilling or unable to properly engage in the process of mainstreaming L.H., rather than isolating and removing him when it became challenging.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   We conclude that the educational program at TMS satisfied the IDEA and, therefore, L.H.'s parents were entitled to reimbursement.

June 2, 2017) (citation and footnote omitted).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Dr. Whitbread has 35 years of experience with Down Syndrome children, as a teacher, researcher, author, and consultant, and testified that she knows of no one in the United States with such a focus on Down Syndrome. Consider, for purposes of comparison, Dr. Kabot, HCDE's proffered expert who is under contract with HCDE to provide training and consultation services to the special education department. Dr. Kabot testified that Down Syndrome and autism are significantly different conditions and that her expertise is in autism but not Down Syndrome ; she had not done research, published papers, or given presentations about children with Down Syndrome. Moreover, she did not review any published research before consulting and advising HCDE about placement for L.H.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    <em>\n     Amici Curiae\n    </em>\n    Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates cite two articles as support for the applicability and benefits of Montessori schooling for children with Down Syndrome : Jacqueline Cossentino,\n    <em>\n     Following All the Children: Early Intervention and Montessori\n    </em>\n    (2016) (available at https://www.public-montessori.org/wpcontent/uploads/2016/10/Following-All-the-Children-Early-Intervention-and-Montessori.pdf (last visited July 17, 2018) ), and Barbara Schramm,\n    <em>\n     Case Studies of Two Downs Syndrome Children Functioning in a Montessori Environment\n    </em>\n    (1974), (available at https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED111120.pdf (last visited July 17, 2018) ).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    But HCDE cannot have it both ways. If Normal Park was actually meeting all of L.H.'s needs and providing a FAPE, as HCDE here contends, there was no reason to remove L.H. to Red Bank CDC. HCDE's removal of L.H. to Red Bank CDC, over his parents' objections, was the entire reason for this suit.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
