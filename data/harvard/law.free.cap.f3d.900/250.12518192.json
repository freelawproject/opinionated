In 2012, the predecessor agency to Washtenaw County Community Mental Health, Washtenaw Community Health Organization, changed the budget calculation method to allow for billing of the personnel costs and the associated costs as separate line items. Amid budgeting struggles in 2015, WCCMH moved to revert to a single, all-inclusive budget method that allocated $13.88 to cover both personnel and the delivery costs of the Program. The reversion was to occur on\n   May 15, 2015. The budgeting change did not reduce the total number of service hours recipients were authorized to receive. The effect of utilizing an all-inclusive rate, however, was to reduce the total budget amount for each recipient. As a practical matter, service recipients had to reduce the hourly rate they paid service providers to maintain the level of hours authorized prior to the budget change. The notice to recipients acknowledged this reality, stating that \"[w]hile this is not a reduction in your current level of services, it may reduce the amount you can pay your staff.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Washtenaw Association for Community Advocacy (the Association), a nonprofit community organization assisting individuals with developmental disabilities, joined with three individual plaintiffs to challenge these budget reductions and the alleged lack of due process preceding them. They filed suit in federal district court against several entities involved in various capacities with the administration, funding, and oversight of the Program. Relevant to this interlocutory appeal, the plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction pending determination of the merits of their claims. The district court held a two-day evidentiary hearing prior to ruling on the motion for a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For the limited purpose of reviewing the district court's preliminary finding regarding associational standing, two pieces of the record stand out. First, the Association's Chief Executive Officer, Kathleen Homan, testified that 169 individuals had received notices from the defendants informing them of impending budget reductions. Second, Ms. Homan testified that the three named plaintiffs were among the individuals who received adverse budget notices and that each of them was a dues-paying member of the Association. The district court nevertheless concluded that the Association \"fails to have associational standing because the 169 people for whom it claims associational standing to bring the lawsuit have not been shown to be members of the organization.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The court also held that the Association's named members in their individual capacities were not entitled to injunctive relief. Among other things, the district court noted \"it is undisputed that all named plaintiffs did in fact appeal the reduction[s] and received ... favorable decision[s] from the administrative law judge.\" \"Therefore,\" the district court held, \"there can be no irreparable harm suffered by the named Plaintiffs as a result of the inadequate notice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Association-but not the individual plaintiffs\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   -now asks us to reverse the district court's denial of a preliminary injunction.

In this case, after evaluating testimony at an evidentiary hearing, the district court found the Association had not shown \"a likel[ihood] of success for finding associational standing,\" and thus it had not shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Waskul v.

If the district court had truly held that the Association\n   <em>\n    lacked\n   </em>\n   associational standing to assert any claim, it would have had to dismiss the Association from this suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United Food\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11745772\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/544/#p554\">\n    517 U.S. at 555-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11745772\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/517/544/#p554\">\n    116 S.Ct. 1529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting the first two\n   <em>\n    Hunt\n   </em>\n   factors are grounded in constitutional standing requirements). This it did not do. Thus, our review is limited to the district court's preliminary finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We also note the very narrow requested relief on this interlocutory appeal. While the Association and its three named members jointly and separately sought preliminary injunctive relief below, only the Association challenges the district court's denial of preliminary injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   note 2. And the Association does not seek all the relief it did below. The Association only requests that we direct entry of a preliminary injunction granting its unnamed members (1) \"fresh notices\" and (2) \"hearing rights with respect to the reductions in their CLS budgets.\" Put succinctly, the Association seeks relief that \"allows individuals whose services were reduced to have the opportunity to have an administrative law judge decide whether the May 2015 budget reduction was proper.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   So, with these two important clarifications in mind, does the Association enjoy standing to pursue these narrow types of injunctive relief? In short, no. Each of the Association's named members-and thus the Association-failed to establish a substantial likelihood of establishing standing to seek the very discrete and preliminary types of relief sought on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As the Association freely admits, \"[t]he three named [members] ... [received] administrative law hearings\" prior to the date of the complaint, the precise relief that the Association now seeks for its unnamed members. It's impossible to conclude that the\n   <em>\n    named\n   </em>\n   members were suffering actual or imminent injury at that time from a loss of due process that would find redress through (1) fresh notices and (2) hearing rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Steel Co. v.
