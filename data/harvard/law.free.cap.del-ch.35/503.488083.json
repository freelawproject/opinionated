Defendants challenged her right to sue on the ground that she is not a stockholder within the meaning of 8 <em>Del.C. </em>\u00a7 327, which provides in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-13\">\u201cIn any derivative suit instituted by a stockholder of a corporation organized under the laws of this State, it shall be averred in the complaint that the plaintiff was a stockholder of the corporation at the time of the transaction of which he complains * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>The facts are these:</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Plaintiff below on June 27, 1950 bought 100 shares of the common stock of Gamble-Skogmo, Inc., a Delaware corporation, through H. C. Wainwright &amp; Co., New York stock brokers. The purchase was \u201ccleared\u201d through another stock broker, Carl M. Loeb, Rhoades &amp; Co. Thereafter the shares were held by Rhoades for Wainwright\u2019s account until December 17, 1952, when they were transferred to a margin account for plaintiff. Thereafter plaintiff from time to time transferred her account to other brokers. At all times up to the present the stock has been held for the plaintiff in successive brokers\u2019 accounts, presumably in street names.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">In <em>Rosenthal v. Burry Biscuit Corp., </em>30 <em>Del.Ch. </em>299, 60 <em>A.2d </em>106, the Court of Chancery held that an equitable stockholder could maintain a stockholder\u2019s derivative suit. We do not understand defendants to assail the correctness of this holding; at all events, we are in accord with it. We gather, also, that defendants concede that under the Rosenthal case a stockholder whose stock is held on margin under the usual contract with the broker permitting the broker to repledge the shares is an equitable stockholder. This is obviously so, since the customer has the right at any time to pay his loan and receive a certificate evidencing legal ownership. But defendants contend that in this case the broker\u2019s contract was an unusual one, and that the general rule is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">The pertinent language of the customer\u2019s agreement involved here is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-8\">\u201c3. All securities and other property which may at any time be held by you for me, for any purpose whatever, including safekeeping, shall be security for, and may be applied upon, my indebtedness to you. All securities and other property held on margin may be held in your name or in such other name as you may choose, and may at any time, without notice to me, be loaned, pledged, repledged, hypothecated or rehypothecated by you, to yourselves as brokers, or to others, either separately or with additional securities and other property for any sum, irrespective of the amount of my indebtedness to you, <em>without retaining in </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number><em>your possession or under your control for delivery securities and other property of like kind and amount.\u201d </em>[Italics supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Defendants say the italicized language does more than authorize the broker to repledge the stock; it has the effect, they say, of divorcing the repledging broker of any control over the shares, and of relieving him of any liability to deliver the stock to plaintiff upon payment of her loan. Defendants point to other forms of customers\u2019 agreements with other brokers that do not contain the clause italicized above. The result, say defendants, is that upon the repledge of plaintiff\u2019s shares by Wainwright, plaintiff had no equitable or other interest in any stock of Gamble-Skogmo, Inc.; she had merely a right to demand from Wainwright any profit that might accrue to her from an increase in \"the value of the shares. The transaction with Wainwright, say defendants, was little more than a wager on the fluctuations in value of Gamble-Skogmo stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">We think that there is no substance in this contention. The purpose of the underlined language in the plaintiff\u2019s agreement is merely to make it clear that upon a repledge of the stock the broker need not carry in his own account other shares of like kind and amount. It only makes explicit what is implicit in every customer\u2019s agreement of this kind \u2014 the right of the br\u00f3lcer to repledge stock held on margin without buying other stock to replace it. We say such a right is implicit in the right to repledge, because there would be no advantage in rehypothecating the stock to obtain funds to finance the purchase if the broker had to invest other funds in replacing the stock repledged.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">The supposed distinction between the Wainwright agreement and what is called the ordinary or usual customers\u2019 agreement does not exist. Hence the argument based upon it falls.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">We may add that we find it somewhat difficult to believe that any form of customers\u2019 margin agreement with a member of the New York Stock Exchange would be designed to relieve the broker from his duty to deliver stock to his customer on payment of the customer\u2019s loan, or would permit a purchase of stock to be converted into a wagering transaction. Certainly, in our opinion, this agreement does not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Defendants say that plaintiff has the burden of proof to show that under the statute she is a stockholder. We think that by the showing made she has sustained that burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">We are in accord with the Chancellor\u2019s opinion upon the matter, and the order of the Court of Chancery is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
