An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">When, as here, a district court dismisses a \u00a7 2255 motion solely on procedural grounds, a certificate of appealability will not issue unless the movant can demonstrate both \u201c(1) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and (2) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u2019 \u2019 \u201d <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir.) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 941, 122 S.Ct. 318, 151 L.Ed.2d 237 (2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Spoone has not made the requisite showing. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). We deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We also deny Spoone\u2019s motion to consolidate the matter with another of Spoone\u2019s pending appeals, No. 02-7480. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
