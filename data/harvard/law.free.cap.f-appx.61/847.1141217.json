Williams and Terry challenge their arson convictions on the ground that the district court erred by denying their motions for judgment of acquittal under Fed.R.Crim.P. 29. Williams contends that the district court erred by denying his motion to suppress statements he made to federal agents on the day of the fire. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-22\">Williams and Terry contend that the district court should have granted their motions for a judgment of acquittal because the daycare center located in the church had only a passing connection to interstate commerce. <em>See United States v. Gullett, </em>75 F.3d 941, 947 (4th Cir.1996) (discussing elements of \u00a7 844(i) offense). We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision to deny a motion for judgment of acquittal. <em>United States v. Gallimore, </em>247 F.3d 134, 136 (4th Cir.2001) (stating standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-23\">The facts adduced by the Government at trial regarding the daycare center and its operations were nearly identical to the facts on which this court relied in <em>United States v. Terry, </em>257 F.3d 366 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1035, 122 S.Ct. 579, 151 L.Ed.2d 451 (2001), to conclude that \u201cthe commercial use of the property brings the building within \u00a7 844(i)\u2019s jurisdictional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>nexus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 371. In addition, we have carefully considered the arguments Williams and Terry raise on appeal and reject them. <em>See Terry, </em>257 F.3d at 369-71; <em>United States v. Aramony, </em>166 F.3d 655, 661 (4th Cir.1999) (discussing law-of-the-case doctrine). We therefore find that a rational factfinder, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, could conclude that the daycare center was used in or affected interstate commerce. <em>See Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>United States v. Stewart, </em>256 F.3d 231, 250 (4th Cir.) (citing <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862-63 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc)), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1049, 122 S.Ct. 633, 151 L.Ed.2d 553 (2001), <em>and cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 977, 122 S.Ct. 1451, 152 L.Ed.2d 392 (2002). Thus, the district court did not err in denying Williams\u2019 and Terry\u2019s Rule 29 motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">Next, Williams contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the statements he made to federal agents. Even assuming, as Williams contends, that his statements were involuntary and that the district court erred in admitting them, we find that any error was harmless. <em>See Arizona v. Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 306-10, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991) (applying harmless error analysis to improper admission of involuntary confession); <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967) (\u201c[BJefore a federal constitutional error can be held harmless, the court must be able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Williams argues that the only evidence against him\u2014other than the testimony regarding his confession\u2014was Terry\u2019s testimony implicating him in the charged offenses, which Williams contends was not credible. However, \u201cwe do not review the credibility of the witnesses and assume the jury resolved all contradictions in the testimony in favor of the government.\u201d <em>United States v. Sun, </em>278 F.3d 302, 313 (4th Cir.2002). In addition, \u201cthe testimony of a co-defendant standing alone and uncorroborated is sufficient to sustain a conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Patterson, </em>150 F.3d 382, 386 (4th Cir.1998). Because Terry clearly implicated Williams in the charged offenses, we conclude that the jury would have returned a guilty verdict and, therefore, that any error in the admission of Williams\u2019 statements was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">Accordingly, we affirm Williams\u2019 and Terry\u2019s convictions. We deny Appellants\u2019 motion for oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
