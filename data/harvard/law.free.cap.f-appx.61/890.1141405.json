Counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Additionally, Miller has filed a pro se supplemental brief. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-23\">In counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief, Miller contends the district court erred in including three prior allegedly uncounseled convictions in determining his criminal history level. In assessing challenges to a sentencing court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines, we review factual determinations for clear error and legal issues de novo. <em>United States v. Singh, </em>54 F.3d 1182, 1190 (4th Cir.1995). The district court, based on Miller\u2019s own testimony at his sentencing hearing, found Miller waived his right to counsel in each of the contested convictions. We find no error in this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-24\">We have reviewed the additional arguments and issues raised by Miller in his pro se supplemental brief and find them to be without merit. Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record and find no error. Accordingly, we affirm Miller\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
