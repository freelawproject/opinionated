Our review of the record discloses that the Board properly upheld the immigration judge\u2019s denial of the motion to reopen and that this petition is without merit. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review on the reasoning of the Board. <em>See Tadesse v. INS, </em>No. A-28-244-25 (B.I.A. July 15, 2002).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-22\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b929-19\"> Because Tadesse did not appeal the immigration judge\u2019s removal order to the Board, we cannot consider his claim that the immigration judge erred in deeming his first asylum application abandoned. <em>See Stewart v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 587, 595-96 (4th Cir.1999); <em>Farrokhi v. INS, </em>900 F.2d 697, 700 (4th Cir. 1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
