Fredman appeals his conviction and sentence on a guilty plea of possession of a firearm by a prohibited person, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(9) (2000). Specifically, Fredman asserts the district court clearly erred in finding that he was not eligible for an adjustment under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(b)(2) (2001), and further clearly erred in adjusting his offense level upward by two levels pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(A), on the basis that his offense involved three firearms. For the reasons set forth below, we find Fredman\u2019s claims on appeal to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-17\">According to the underlying facts of this case, Fredman pawned three shotguns, each on a different date, in October and November 1999. Two of the firearms were stolen, and Fredman entered pleas of guilty to grand larceny of a firearm for the two firearms in the Circuit Court of Shenandoah County. In the present case, Fredman was charged in connection with his possession of the firearm which was not stolen, based upon his previous conviction of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(9) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-18\">Fredman faced an imprisonment sentence between thirty-seven and forty-six months, based upon total offense level of fifteen and a criminal history category of V. At the sentencing hearing, Fredman testified that he was a long-time hunter, that he never discharged the firearms unlawfully, that he never hunted out-of-season, and that he never threatened anyone with the three guns. He admitted he pawned all three firearms, that two of the firearms were not his, and that he received money for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-19\">The district judge declined to give Fred-man the benefit of USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(2), finding that Fredman had pawned three firearms, including the two that were stolen, and then adjusted Fredman\u2019s offense level upward by two levels pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(1)(A). The district court sentenced Fredman to thirty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by thirty-six months of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>This court reviews the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines under a due deference standard. We review the factual findings of the district court in relation to the application of sentencing guidelines under a clearly erroneous standard, and the district court\u2019s legal conclusions as to the application of the guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 217-18 (4th Cir. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">The applicability of USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(2) to this appeal centers around the issue of whether Fredman possessed all three firearms \u201csolely\u201d for lawful sporting purposes or collection. Fredman asserts that the act of pawning the firearms, standing alone, is not sufficient to exclude him from eligibility for the reduction. The Government counters by claiming that Fredman\u2019s act in pawning the firearms constituted a use other than lawful sporting purposes or collection.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">We find, without difficulty, that the plain language of \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(2), as well as the vast majority of the existing case law, support the district court\u2019s decision that Fredman is not eligible for the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(2), reduction because he pawned the firearms. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Solomon, </em>274 F.3d 825, 829 (4th Cir.2001); <em>see also United States v. Clingan, </em>254 F.3d 624, 625 (6th <em>Cir.2001); United States v. Miller, </em>224 F.3d 247, 251 (3d Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Gresso, </em>24 F.3d 879, 881 (7th Cir.1994). We reject Fredman\u2019s attempts to invoke the rule of lenity, the intentions of the Sentencing Commission, and Application Note 10 in the Commentary to \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(2), to support his position. Even though he may be a sportsman, Fredman is not entitled to a reduction under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(2), because he did not possess the firearms exclusively for sporting or collection purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-12\">In addition to the basis on which the district court denied Fredman the benefit of the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(2) reduction, we note that a second basis exists to support the district court\u2019s denial of Fredman\u2019s request for a \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(2) reduction. Specifically, to qualify for the reduction, not only must Fredman have demonstrated that he used the firearms solely for hunting or collection purposes, he must also have demonstrated that he did not \u201cotherwise unlawfully use\u201d such firearms. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(2).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Because Fredman\u2019s two criminal convictions in state court for possession of a stolen firearm establish \u201cunlawful use\u201d of those two firearms under the language of \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(2), Fredman is precluded from the reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-13\">Under either section of the guideline provision, Fredman has not established eligibility for the USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(2) reduction. The district court did not clearly err in finding that Fredman\u2019s act of pawning three firearms, two of which were stolen, rendered him ineligible for the USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(2) reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-14\">Fredman\u2019s second and final claim on appeal is that the district court clearly erred in finding that his offense involved three firearms, and in increasing his offense level by two points under USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(A), based upon that finding. Application Note 9 to the Commentary for \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(A) provides, in pertinent part, that the court should count those firearms unlawfully possessed for purposes of calculating the number of firearms under subsection (b)(1). Further, for the purposes of enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l), courts evaluate \u201crelevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>conduct\u201d to assess the number of firearms that properly are included. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Santoro, </em>159 F.3d 318, 321 (7th Cir.1998); <em>see also </em>USSG \u00a7 1B1.1, comment. n. 1(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Here, Fredman does not contest the fact that he possessed the three firearms during the same general time period. Because he was a prohibited person during the time of his possession of each of the three firearms, we find proper the district court\u2019s increase in Fredman\u2019s offense level under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(A). Fredman\u2019s claim on appeal that the fact that one of the firearms he pawned was not stolen is not relevant to the district court\u2019s assessment of the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(l)(A) enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Fredman\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b134-8\"> USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(2) provides for a reduction\u201d[i]f the defendant ... possessed all ammunition and firearms solely for lawful sporting purposes or collection, <em>and </em>did not unlawfully discharge or otherwise unlawfully use such firearms or ammunition.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
