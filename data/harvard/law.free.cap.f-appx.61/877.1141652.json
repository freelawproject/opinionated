Jackson asserts that this term of incarceration exceeds the statutory maximum established by the classification of his offense. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-11\">Jackson pled guilty in 1996 to conspiring to distribute unspecified quantities of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (2000). The district court imposed a thirty-seven month custodial sentence followed by four years of supervised release. However, following Jackson\u2019s initial release in 1997, he twice violated the terms of that supervised release, for which the district court imposed twelve months\u2019 incarceration in 1999 and nine months\u2019 incarceration in 2000. Contending he has already served an aggregate of twenty-five months in custody for his prior violations of his supervised release and citing <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Jackson alleges the nine months\u2019 incarceration the district court imposed for the third revocation exceeds the maximum of two years\u2019 imprisonment authorized for violations of a term of supervised release imposed as punishment for a Class C felony. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-15\">Jackson\u2019s challenge incorrectly asserts he was originally sentenced for committing a Class C felony. Because the count of Jackson\u2019s indictment to which he pled guilty did not charge quantity, Jackson contends that only a sentence in accordance with \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), which is a Class C felony, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(a) (2000), was proper. Jackson\u2019s written plea agreement, however, clearly contemplated his sentencing for the Class B felony described in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), as it noted a potential term of incarceration of five to forty years and a supervised release term of four years. Further, evidence supporting a sentence in accordance with \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) was presented at Jackson\u2019s plea hearing. Hence, because felonies are classified by the relevant statutory maximum rather than the actual sentence imposed, <em>see United States v. Gonzalez, </em>922 F.2d 1044, 1049 (2d Cir.1991), and Jackson\u2019s guilty plea subjected him to a potential sentence of five to forty years\u2019 incarceration, the district court\u2019s imposition of a nine-month sentence following Jackson\u2019s third revocation of his supervised release was proper.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm Jackson\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b928-12\"> Further, although we do not decide the issue today, we note several recent decisions indicating that <em>Apprendi </em>is not retroactively applicable to the revocation of a term of supervised release. <em>See, e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Greene, </em>206 F.Supp.2d 811, 813-14 (S.D.W.Va.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
