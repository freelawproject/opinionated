Rice (\u201cRice I\u201d), </em>8 Fed.Appx. 214 (4th Cir.2001) (per curiam). On remand, the district court applied the appropriate guideline, and departed upward based on three factors. Because we conclude that one of these factors was an improper basis for departure, we must again remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">The underlying facts and procedural details are set forth in <em>Rice I. </em>Therefore, we will summarize only briefly. Thomas Dale Rice, who was 56, made contact in an Internet chatroom with \u201cMatt,\u201d an undercover officer posing as a 13-year-old boy. Over the Internet, Rice offered to perform various sexual activities with Matt. Eventually, Rice, who lived in West Virginia, agreed to meet \u201cMatt\u201d in Bedford, Virginia. Rice drove to Bedford, checked into a motel, and made preparations to engage in sexual activity with Matt. He was arrested later that day at a school where he believed he would be meeting Matt.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">Rice pled guilty to 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2423(b) (West 2000), which criminalizes \u201cinterstate travel with intent to engage in a sexual act with a juvenile.\u201d <em>Rice I, </em>8 Fed.Appx. at 215-16. Applying the 1998 version of the sentencing guidelines, which were then in effect, the district court determined that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.1 (\u201cCriminal Sexual Abuse; Attempt to Commit Criminal Sexual Abuse\u201d) was, of three potentially applicable guidelines, \u201cthe guideline most appropriate for the nature of the offense conduct charged in the count of which the defendant was convicted.\u201d U.S.S.G. app. A, introductory cmt. (1998); <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.2, cmt. n. 1 (1998). The district court concluded that Rice\u2019s conduct was more analogous to sexual abuse than statutory rape because of \u201cthe age disparity between Rice and \u2018Matt\u2019 as well as the supposed immaturity and naivety of the ostensible victim.\u201d <em>Rice I, </em>8 Fed.Appx. at 216. Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.1, which fixed a based offense level of 27, Rice received a 60-month term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-12\">On appeal, we concluded that the district court should have applied a different guideline. We held that the most analogous guideline for Rice\u2019s offense was U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.2, with a base offense level of 15, entitled \u201cCriminal Sexual Abuse of a Minor (Statutory Rape) or Attempt to Commit Such Acts.\u201d We explained that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.2 applied to conduct that \u201cwould be consensual but for the age of the victim,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 217-18, but that the guideline applied by the sentencing court, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.1, \u201cwas drafted to cover conduct prohibited by 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2241 and 2242 ... [which] criminalize conduct in which the victim, regardless of his or her age, has been coerced into sexual activity by force or threats,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 217. We concluded that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.2 was a better fit than \u00a7 2A3.1 in Rice\u2019s ease because Rice had not \u201cthreatened \u2018Matt\u2019 or attempted to place him in fear or otherwise overcome his will such that the intended sexual encounter would have been nonconsensual.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217. Rice had been \u201cforthcoming about his age, his own identity, and the conduct he proposed,\u201d and thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>we were unable to divine a \u201csecret scheme\u201d suggesting that Rice did not expect the proposed encounter to be consensual. <em>Id. </em>at 218. Because Rice\u2019s proposed conduct \u201cwould have ..., if completed, constituted the crime of statutory rape,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.2 was the appropriate guideline. <em>Id. </em>at 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">In remanding for Rice to be resentenced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.2, we stated \u201cthe factors identified by the district court\u2014 such as the ostensible victim\u2019s tender years and the age disparity between the two, as well as the use of the Internet\u2014 may indeed make Rice\u2019s offense different from the run-of-the-mill statutory rape and remove this case from the heartland of cases sentenced under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.2.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">On remand, neither Rice nor the government introduced new evidence, although the district court afforded them an opportunity to do so at an evidentiary hearing. Applying Rice\u2019s base offense level of 15 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.2, the district court awarded a downward adjustment of two levels for acceptance of responsibility, see U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) (1998), for an offense level of 13. The district court then granted the government\u2019s motion for an upward departure, relying on three grounds for the departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">First, the district court concluded that \u201cfacilitation of [the] underlying offense through the use of the Internet\u201d was neither an encouraged nor discouraged basis for departure under the 1998 version of the guidelines but nevertheless was one that \u201cadds a new and very dangerous element to the mix\u201d and \u201ctakes this case out of the heartland of the guidelines.\u201d J.A. 139. The court reaffirmed its observation during Rice\u2019s original sentencing that \u201c \u2018[t]he use of the Internet to facilitate ... predatory sexual conduct is, in the Court\u2019s view, ... an aggravating factor not adequately taken into consideration under 2A3.2.\u2019 \u201d J.A. 135-36. The second basis for departure identified by the district court was Rice\u2019s \u201cpreparation for anal intercourse with a person [he] believed to be a child of 13.\u201d J.A. 136. The court concluded that this aspect of Rice\u2019s conduct was an aggravating factor not adequately taken into consideration by the guidelines and took the case out of the heartland of statutory rape cases. The third and final basis for the district court\u2019s upward departure was the extreme difference in age between Rice and his ostensible victim. The court stated that the age disparity \u201ccarrie[d] a strong element of coercion.\u201d J.A. 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">Accordingly, the court departed upward, increasing Rice\u2019s offense level by two levels for each factor for a total offense level of 19, and then adjusting downward by one additional level to 18 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b), which yielded a sentencing range of 27-33 months based on Rice\u2019s criminal history category of I. Rice received 33 months, which was three months less than his original sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-11\">We review the district court\u2019s upward departure under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 91, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996); <em>see also United States v. Barber, </em>119 F.3d 276, 283 (4th Cir.1997) (en banc) (explaining that <em>Koon </em>\u201cadopt[ed] a traditional abuse of discretion standard\u201d for reviewing guideline departures).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-12\">A sentencing court must \u201cimpose a sentence of the kind, and within the range\u201d required by the guidelines \u201cunless the court finds that there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>should result in a sentence different from that described.\u201d 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3558(b) (West 2000). In determining \u201cwhether a potential basis for departure was adequately considered by the [Sentencing] Commission ..., a sentencing court must focus on whether the factor is taken into account by the guidelines, policy statements, or commentary and whether it is encompassed within the heartland of situations to which the applicable guideline was intended to apply.\u201d <em>Barber, </em>119 F.3d at 280. The Commission has \u201cadequately considered circumstances within the heartland of conduct encompassed by the guidelines and did not consider conduct falling outside the heartland.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The \u201cheartland\u201d of a given guideline is \u201ca set of typical cases embodying the conduct that each guideline describes.\u201d U.S.S.G. Ch. 1, PtA, introductory cmt. 4(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Moreover, the sentencing court must decide \u201cwhether the factor is forbidden, encouraged, discouraged, or unmentioned by the Sentencing Commission as a ground for departure.\u201d <em>United States v. LeRose, </em>219 F.3d 335, 339 (4th Cir.2000). With respect to an encouraged factor, \u201cthe court is authorized to depart if the applicable Guideline does not already take it into account.\u201d <em>Koon, </em>518 U.S. at 96, 116 S.Ct. 2035. If the factor is taken into account by the appropriate guideline, then the court may depart \u201conly if the factor is present to an exceptional degree or in some other way makes the case different from the ordinary case where the factor is present.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, a discouraged factor may serve as the basis for departure only if it is present to such an unusual degree that it cannot be said to come within the heartland of the applicable guideline. <em>See id.; see also Barber, </em>119 F.3d at 281. Finally, a sentencing court may depart on the basis of a factor that is unmentioned by the guidelines as a basis for departure if that factor removes the case from the heartland of cases contemplated by the applicable guideline, but such departures should only occur in \u201c \u2018rare\u2019 situations.\u201d <em>Barber, </em>119 F.3d at 281; <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. Ch. 1, Pt. A, introductory cmt. 4(b). With these general principles in mind, we consider the three bases used by the district court for its downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Use of the Internet to facilitate a crime involving sexual activity with a minor is not forbidden, discouraged, or encouraged as a basis for departure from a sentence imposed under the 1998 version of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.2. Because the Commission did not refer to this factor in the policy statements, commentary, or the text of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.2, it is an unmentioned factor. <em>See Barber, </em>119 F.3d at 280 (\u201cWhich of these categories a factor falls into is resolved by reference to the guidelines, policy statements, and commentary.\u201d). Essentially, the district court concluded that the use of the Internet makes it much easier to commit a crime covered by \u00a7 2A3.2 in that it allows a predator anonymous access to a large pool of potential victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">Rice contends that his use of the Internet in connection with his criminal activity does not present exceptional circumstances that would make his conduct different than the typical set of cases encompassed by \u00a7 2A3.2. He argues that the harm caused by statutory rape is the same, regardless of whether the perpetrator initiated contact in person, by telephone, or over the Internet. Thus, he suggests there is no reasonable basis for making a sentencing distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">We disagree. As illustrated by Rice\u2019s conduct, the use of the Internet fosters anonymous, predatory conduct that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>is not typical of the conduct encompassed by the statutory rape guideline. The Internet is not merely an alternate means for contacting and communicating with young victims. Rather, the Internet provides a powerful new tool for predators to locate potential victims in the first place. With the advent of internet \u201cchatrooms,\u201d adults seeking underage sexual partners have ready access to a nationwide pool of potential targets. As the district court observed, \u201c[y]oung children all over America use the Internet to stay in contact with their friends, they engage in research for homework and otherwise to learn about the world in which they live.\u201d J.A. 135. The Internet provides a much more efficient way for an adult to identify and meet minors who fit a desired profile without the inherent practical difficulties of identifying a potential victim in person and then establishing contact. The anonymity of the Internet also affords a hedge against detection and an opportunity for an adult such as Rice to develop trust and pursue a relationship with the juvenile in private. Moreover, as the government points out, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.2 encompasses crimes involving interstate travel. The nationwide and even worldwide nature of the Internet unquestionably increases the likelihood of meeting a potential underage partner located across state lines.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Alternatively, Rice argues that in departing upward two levels for his internet usage, the district court was actually applying the 2000 version of the guidelines, in violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. After Rice was sentenced under the 1998 Sentencing Guidelines, \u00a7 2A3.2 was amended to add a two-level enhancement \u201c[i]f a computer or an Internet-access device was used to ... persuade, induce, entice, or coerce the victim to engage in prohibited sexual conduct\u201d or to \u201cfacilitate transportation or travel, by the victim or a participant, to engage in prohibited sexual conduct.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.2, cmt. n. 6 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">A sentencing court ordinarily uses the version of the guidelines \u201cin effect on the date that the defendant is sentenced.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lBl.ll(a) (2000). However, if the application of the current version \u201cwould violate the <em>ex post facto </em>clause of the United States Constitution, the court shall use the Guidelines Manual in effect on the date that the offense of conviction was committed.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lBl.ll(b)(l). If a guideline is amended \u201cafter a defendant\u2019s offense but before sentencing,\u201d the district court should not apply it \u201cif doing so would increase the sentence, because that would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.\u201d <em>United States v. Heater, </em>63 F.3d 311, 331 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">Although the 2000 Guidelines Manual was in effect at Rice\u2019s resentencing, the district court was clearly applying the 1998 version. The district court not only made this clear during the resentencing hearing, but the court\u2019s application of the 1998 Guidelines Manual is also evident from the fact that the court identified two of the three bases for departure at the original sentencing, which occurred prior to the amendments. Accordingly, we conclude there was no ex post facto violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">Next, we consider the district court\u2019s two-level upward departure on the basis of the 43-year age disparity between Rice and his intended juvenile partner. In so departing, the court noted that such a difference in age \u201ccarries a strong element of coercion.\u201d J.A. 140. Rice argues that, despite the tremendous age difference, there is nothing in the record to suggest that he attempted to coerce Matt. And in <em>Rice I, </em>we observed that Rice \u201cnever threatened or attempted to coerce \u2018Matt,\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>and that we saw nothing in the record before us that would suggest \u201cthe proposed encounter would not have been consensual.\u201d 8 Fed-Appx. at 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Age disparity is a factor unmentioned by the 1998 Guidelines Manual as a basis for departure. Accordingly, the question is whether this circumstance removes Rice\u2019s case from the heartland of \u00a7 2A3.2. Unlike a statutory rape scenario involving, say, a 21-year-old male and his 16-year-old girlfriend, a proposed sexual encounter between a 56-year-old adult and a 13-year-old adolescent creates a much different and more dangerous situation. Typically, there are vast differences between a person Rice\u2019s age and one Matt\u2019s age in physical size and strength; mental and emotional development; life experience and, in particular, sexual experience; and material resources. In our view, these factors amount to an increased danger of physical injury to the juvenile, whether unintended or not, and an increased likelihood of psychological manipulation. Here, Rice attempted to gain Matt\u2019s trust from the beginning. Matt indicated that he was unsure about his own sexual orientation, and Rice, who asked to be called \u201cUncle Tom,\u201d offered to teach him. Rice also indicated that he could afford Matt exciting opportunities of a nonsexual nature as well. <em>See id. </em>at 217 n. 3. Rice held himself out as a father figure who could \u201cmentor\u201d Matt in learning about his sexuality, and Rice emphasized that he would be careful given Matt\u2019s inexperience. Rice gave Matt a credit card number to use for long distance calls and sent pictures of his flashy car. At various times, Rice told Matt that he trusted him, worried about him and really cared for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Although Rice is correct that, in <em>Rice I, </em>we indicated that we perceived no intent on Rice\u2019s part to coerce Matt into sexual activity, our discussion on this point was set in the context of determining whether to apply the criminal sexual abuse guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.1, which encompasses conduct \u201cin which the victim, regardless of his or her age, has been coerced into sexual activity <em>by force or threats.\u201d Id. </em>at 217 (emphasis added). We did not reject the government\u2019s suggestion that Rice employed \u201cpsychological force\u201d to persuade Matt to meet with him; we merely observed that it was not appropriate for us \u201cto consider this evidence <em>in the initial selection </em>of the proper guideline.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217 n. 3. Our focus in <em>Rice I </em>was on whether Rice had \u201cthreatened \u2018Matt\u2019 or attempted to place him in fear or otherwise overcome his will such that the intended sexual encounter would have been non-consensual.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">We conclude that the more than forty-year age difference between Rice and his intended juvenile partner removes this case from the heartland of cases encompassed within the statutory rape guideline set forth in \u00a7 2A3.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">Rice argues, alternatively, that the district court\u2019s two-level upward departure was the functional equivalent of applying the 2000 Guidelines Manual, which Rice argues would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. Section 2A3.2 was amended to include an upward two-level adjustment if \u201ca participant ... unduly influenced the victim to engage in prohibited sexual conduct.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.2(b)(2)(B) (2000). If the participant is at least 10 years older than the victim, \u201cthere shall be a rebuttable presumption ... that such participant unduly influenced the victim to engage in prohibited sexual conduct.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.2 cmt. n. 5 (2000). We reject this argument for the same reasons that we rejected Rice\u2019s contention that the upward departure based on the use of the Internet violated the Ex Post Facto Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>c.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Finally, we consider the district court\u2019s two-level upward departure based on Rice\u2019s intent to engage in \u201canal intercourse with a person [Rice] believed to be a child of 18.\u201d J.A. 139-40. This circumstance, too, is unmentioned in the guidelines as a basis for departure. We cannot agree, however, that it removes the case from the heartland of \u00a7 2A3.2, which expressly covers violations of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2243. Section 2243 criminalizes the commission of \u201ca sexual act with another person who ... has attained the age of 12 years but has not attained the age of 16 years; and ... is at least four years younger\u201d than the defendant. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2243(a) (West 2000). A \u201csexual act\u201d for purposes of this section includes \u201ccontact between ... the penis and the anus ... upon penetration, however slight.\u201d 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2246(2)(A) (West 2000). Accordingly, the act of \u201canal intercourse\u201d with a 13 year old falls squarely within the conduct prohibited by \u00a7 2243 and, in turn, falls squarely within U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A3.2. We conclude that this particular factor is not alone enough to set this case apart from the heartland of cases described by \u00a7 2A3.2.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the district court\u2019s two-level upward departure with respect to both Rice\u2019s use of the Internet and the age disparity between Rice and his intended victim, but we reverse as to the two-level upward departure based on Rice\u2019s intention to engage in anal intercourse with a 13 year old. We remand for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b71-8\"> The government attempts to recast the district court's basis for departure as the \u201ctender years\u201d of the intended victim. We do not believe this is completely accurate. Each time the court identified this particular factor, it emphasized not only the purported victim\u2019s age but also the fact that Rice intended to engage in \"anal intercourse\u201d with a child of 13.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
