(\u201cPWLC\u201d) against charges brought by Kelly Suggs in a separate state court lawsuit. The district court held that, while PWLC does have a valid commercial insurance policy with Continental, any liability for Suggs\u2019 claims against PWLC would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>be covered by that policy. It therefore issued a declaratory judgment in Continental\u2019s favor, absolving Continental from liability for any judgment against PWLC and authorizing Continental to withdraw its defense in the state court action. For the reasons that follow, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">PWLC is an Ohio-based corporation that has developed a number of proprietary weight loss programs that it licenses to approved franchisees located throughout parts of the midwestem and southern United States. Prospective PWLC clients are required to undergo several medical examinations and tests\u2014including blood work, EKGs, a physical examination, and a thorough review of their medical history\u2014 in order to determine whether they are healthy enough to participate in a PWLC weight loss program. Each PWLC franchise hires doctors to perform these examinations in accordance with mandatory protocols and procedures set forth in a corporate manual.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">PWLC doctors also prescribe weight loss drugs for clients who are participating in weight loss programs that include the monitored use of prescription medicine. PWLC requires that clients purchase such drugs directly through the PWLC franchises rather than filling the prescriptions themselves at independent local pharmacies. At least as practiced at the PWLC franchise in Greensboro, North Carolina, this process is fairly straightforward. A PWLC doctor writes and signs a prescription, which the client never actually sees. The client makes a direct payment to the PWLC franchise for the medication. The franchise faxes the prescription to a central pharmacy in Ohio, which fills the order after receiving credit card payment from the PWLC franchise. The pharmacy then mails the medication directly to the client. These prescriptions are approved in two-week increments, requiring frequent return visits to the PWLC franchise by the client. These frequent visits function in part as a management and monitoring mechanism for each individual\u2019s weight loss program.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">In March 1998, Kelly Suggs signed up for PWLC\u2019s weight loss program at a PWLC franchise in Greensboro, North Carolina. After undergoing the required medical evaluation, Suggs was assigned to a weight loss program, one component of which included a prescription weight loss drug called Meridia. As required by the program, Suggs purchased Meridia directly from PWLC for approximately $115 per two-week supply. Shortly after receiving her first prescription in the mail, however, Suggs discovered that she could purchase the same two-week supply of Meridia from a local pharmacy for $48. She therefore spoke with her PWLC physician and requested that he write a prescription and give it directly to her. The doctor refused to give her a separate written prescription, because he was forbidden to do so by the local franchise and by PWLC corporate regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">Suggs then filed a class action suit against PWLC in North Carolina state court, seeking both compensatory and punitive damages. She alleged violations of a wide variety of North Carolina laws, including the Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act, N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 75-1.1 (2003), the Pharmacy Practice Act, N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 90-85.2 (2003), the Controlled Substances Act, N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 90-95(a)(1), 90-108(a)(10),(13) (2003), the North Carolina RICO Act, N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 75D-1 (2003), and \u00a7 58-51-37 of North Carolina\u2019s health insurance regulations. Suggs also alleged intentional interference with fiduciary duty as well as both constructive and actual fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>At the time Suggs\u2019 state court action was filed, PWLC was covered by a professional Lability policy issued by Continental Casualty. In relevant part, that poLcy provides \u201ccoverage against professional LabiLty claims brought against [PWLC] resulting from professional services provided by [PWLC].\u201d Continental will thus cover any damages PWLC might become legaUy obhgated to pay as a result of the \u201cproviding or withholding of professional services\u201d either by PWLC directly or \u201cby anyone for whose acts [PWLC is] legally responsible.\u201d The poLcy further provides that \u201c[professional services are those health care or medical services [PWLC] normaLy provide[s] as a [weight loss program center].\u201d The poLcy is Lmited by two relevant exclusions. It does not cover \u201cliability arising out of the violation ... of any law or regulation imposing criminal penalties.\u201d And it does not cover \u201c[f)ines, penalties, [or] the return or withdrawal of fees or governmental payments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Continental initiaby informed PWLC that it would provide a defense in the North CaroLna action, but that it was reserving the right to challenge its purported duties to defend PWLC and cover any liabibty that might arise out of Suggs\u2019 lawsuit. Continental then filed the present action in federal court, naming most of the parties to Suggs\u2019 lawsuit as defendants and seeking a declaration of Continental\u2019s own rights and duties under the professional Lability insurance poLcy. On cross motions for summary judgment, the district court held that the Lability poLcy did not provide coverage for any of Suggs\u2019 claims and that Continental was entitled to withdraw its defense in the underlying action. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">We review the district court\u2019s rubng on summary judgment de novo. <em>Gallagher v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., </em>305 F.3d 264, 268 (4th Cir.2002). Summary judgment is appropriate only if \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In determining both grants and denials of summary judgment, we view aH evidence in the Lght most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Goldstein v. Chestnut Ridge Volunteer Fire Co., </em>218 F.3d 337, 341 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">The district court held that Ohio law governed its analysis of the parties\u2019 contractual rights under the insurance poLcy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In North CaroLna, it is a \u201cgeneral rule\u201d that \u201cthe principle of <em>lex loci contractus </em>mandates that the substantive law of the state where the last act to make a binding contract occurred, usually delivery of the policy, controls the interpretation\u201d of an insurance poLcy. <em>Fortune Ins. Co. v. Owens, </em>351 N.C. 424, 526 S.E.2d 463, 466 (N.C.2000). The district court observed that the poLcy in this case was dehvered to PWLC in Ohio; it further noted that PWLC is an Ohio corporation and that the policy was negotiated in Ohio with an Ohio-based insurance agency. The district court therefore held that Ohio law controbed the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-11\">As appehants point out, however, North CaroLna has created a statutory \u201cexception to [the] general rule\u201d of <em>lex loci contractus. Id. </em>Under that exception, \u201c[a]h contracts of insurance on property, lives, or interests in this State shall be deemed to be made therein.\u201d N.C. Gen Stat. \u00a7 58-3-1 (2003). Because of constitutional concerns,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> application of this provision has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>been limited to situations where there is a \u201cclose connection\u201d between North Carolina and the interests insured by the policy. <em>Collins &amp; Aikman, </em>436 S.E.2d at 246. Where such a connection exists, however, North Carolina law controls the interpretation of an insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">In this case, there is a sufficiently close connection between the interests insured by the policy and the state of North Carolina to mandate the application of North Carolina law in this case. At the time of trial, four of PWLC\u2019s roughly fifty franchises were located in North Carolina. Each of the North Carolina franchises serviced a great many North Carolina citizens: Suggs\u2019 second amended complaint alleges that there were roughly 5,000 PWLC customers in North Carolina between June 1995 and June 2000, and Continental itself estimates that there were at least 2,000. In light of these facts, North Carolina has \u201cmuch more than a casual connection with the substance of the insurance policy,\u201d and N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 58-3-1 requires that we interpret the insurance policy under North Carolina law. <em>Id. </em>at 245; <em>see also Martin v. Cont\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>123 N.C.App. 650, 474 S.E.2d 146, 149-50 (N.C.App.1996) (holding that the registration of 1,479 automobiles\u201418% of the insured\u2019s fleet\u2014in North Carolina created a sufficiently \u201cclose connection\u201d to justify applying North Carolina law to an insurance contract dispute).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">Under North Carolina law, an insurer\u2019s duty to defend is \u201cmeasured by the facts as alleged in the pleadings\u201d in the underlying lawsuit. <em>Waste Mg\u2019t of Carolinas, Inc. v. Peerless Ins. Co., </em>315 N.C. 688, 340 S.E.2d 374, 377 (N.C.1986). If the pleadings state facts that, were they proven, would \u201cdemonstrat[e] that the alleged injury is covered by the policy, then the insurer has a duty to defend, whether or not the insured is ultimately hable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This duty is broader than the duty to indemnify, such that even \u201cpleadings that disclose a mere <em>possibility </em>that the insured is hable (and that the potential liability is covered) suffice to impose a duty to defend upon the insure[r].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 377 n. 2 (emphasis added). In interpreting the scope of the policy itself, all ambiguities are \u201cstrictly construed against the insurer and in favor of the insured.\u201d <em>State Capital Ins. Co. v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>318 N.C. 534, 350 S.E.2d 66, 73 (N.C.1986). Thus, \u201cpolicy provisions which extend coverage are construed liberally in favor of coverage.\u201d <em>Spangler Constr. Co. v. Indus. Crankshaft and Eng\u2019g Co., </em>326 N.C. 133, 388 S.E.2d 557, 563 (N.C.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">PWLC argues that the \u201cprofessional services\u201d provision of the insurance policy requires Continental to cover any liability that might arise from Suggs\u2019 complaint. The pohcy defines \u201cprofessional services\u201d as \u201cthose health care or medical services [PWLC] normally provide[s] as a [weight loss program center].\u201d As further guidance in interpreting that brief definition, North Carolina courts have interpreted the term \u201cprofessional services\u201d as covering \u201cthose services where a professional relationship exists between plaintiff and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>defendant\u2014such as a physician-patient or attorney-client relationship.\u201d <em>Barger v. McCoy Hillard &amp; Parks, </em>346 N.C. 650, 488 S.E.2d 215, 223 (N.C.1997) (construing N.C. statute). In the context of insurance policy exclusions clauses, North Carolina courts have held that a \u201cprofessional service\u201d is generally defined as \u201cone arising out of a vocation or occupation involving specialized knowledge or skills, and [one in which] the skills are mental as opposed to manual.\u201d <em>Duke Univ. v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co., </em>96 N.C.App. 635, 386 S.E.2d 762, 765 (N.C.1990) (construing the term \u201cprofessional service\u201d narrowly because it was in an exclusion clause rather than in a coverage clause). And the determination of what constitutes a professional service \u201cdepends upon the nature of the activity rather than the position of the person responsible for the act or omissions.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">Continental argues that this is not a case about professional services, but rather a \u201cmere dispute over pricing.\u201d In particular, Continental emphasizes that as a substantive matter, Suggs was pleased with the clinical care she was receiving and only objected to the high payments for Meridia. This is a mischaracterization of Suggs\u2019 charges in the underlying action. Suggs\u2019 complaint clearly alleges that her PWLC doctor had \u201cviolated his fiduciary duty to Suggs\u201d when he \u201crefused to give Suggs her prescription.\u201d It also alleges that Suggs\u2019 doctor was \u201cacting pursuant to a contract [with PWLC] which controlled [his] actions and the exercise of [his] medical and professional judgment,\u201d and was therefore acting as \u201cPWLC\u2019s agent when he treated Suggs.\u201d It further alleges that the actions of all the PWLC defendants were \u201cpursuant to express and implied agreements among themselves and constitute[ ] a conspiracy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">A central focus of Suggs\u2019 allegations, then, is that PWLC required its agent (the physician) to deny Suggs a medically-indicated prescription, and that PWLC then leveraged that refusal to force Suggs to purchase the prescription from the central pharmacy. According to Suggs, in other words, the professional service was the dispensation of a necessary prescription, and the breach of the doctor\u2019s fiduciary duty in providing his medical services inhered in his refusal to dispense that prescription. Continental does not dispute that this prescription was medically indicated in Suggs\u2019 case. Nor does Continental dispute that writing medically-indicated prescriptions is one of \u201cthose health care or medical services [PWLC] normally provide[s] as a [weight loss program center].\u201d Nor does it dispute that writing prescriptions is a paradigmatically professional service, one which arises \u201cout of a vocation or occupation involving specialized knowledge or skills, [where] the skills are mental as opposed to manual.\u201d <em>St. Paul Fire and Marine, </em>386 S.E.2d at 765. Particularly since \u201cpolicy provisions which extend coverage are construed liberally in favor of coverage,\u201d <em>Spangler Constr., </em>388 S.E.2d at 563, we cannot say that prescription writing is not a professional service, or that a physician\u2019s refusal to write a necessary prescription is not the \u201cwitholding of [a] professional service [ ]\u201d under the terms of the policy. The underlying state court action therefore triggers Continental\u2019s duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">Continental next points to a clause in the insurance policy providing that \u201c[t]his agreement does not cover ... fines, penalties, the return or withdrawal of fees or government payments.\u201d Continental argues that because Suggs is seeking refunds for the amount she paid for prescription drugs, she is in effect seeking a \u201cre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>turn ... of fees.\u201d Continental therefore contends that it is absolved from any duty to defend PWLC in the underlying state court action.</p>\n<p id=\"AjL\">We disagree. In North Carolina, exclusions from coverage are construed narrowly in favor of coverage. <em>St. Paul Fire and Marine, </em>386 S.E.2d at 765. Particularly in light of this rule of construction, we cannot say that the \u201creturn of fees\u201d exception applies to the underlying state court action.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">To begin with, the plain language of the exception does not appear to apply to payments for goods or physical items. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>defines \u201cfee\u201d as a charge for \u201can official or professional service,\u201d for \u201ca particular act or service,\u201d for \u201clabor,\u201d for \u201cperformance of services or something done or to be done,\u201d for \u201cservices of public officers,\u201d or for \u201cuse of a privilege under control of government.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>(6th ed.1990); <em>see also Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary </em>(10th ed.1999) (\u201ca fixed charge\u201d or \u201ca sum paid or charged for a service\u201d). In common usage, in other words, \u201cfee\u201d refers to the price for a service.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But Suggs is seeking damages based on the inflated purchase price of a good, not a service. Moreover, the context of the exclusion suggests that it is limited to fees paid to the government: the other excluded payments in the relevant clause are \u201cfflines,\u201d \u201cpenalties,\u201d and \u201cgovernment payments\u201d\u2014all of which apply to payments paid to the government. Suggs is not seeking the return of any fees made to the government. We therefore hold that the \u201creturn of fees\u201d exclusion does not absolve Continental from its duty to defend PWLC in the underlying state court action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Av9\">yj</p>\n<p id=\"A1mG\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse and remand with directions to enter judgment for defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-10\">\n<em>REVERSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b894-6\">. We hold as a preliminary matter that the district court did not err in refusing to transfer or dismiss this case on the grounds of improper venue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b894-14\">. The North Carolina Supreme Court noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>that states may not apply their own law to interpret a contract if \"the interest of the forum has but slight connection with the substance of the contract obligations.\u201d <em>Collins &amp; Aikman Corp. v. Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co., </em>335 N.C. 91, 436 S.E.2d 243, 245 (N.C.1993) (citing <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. v. Delta &amp; Pine Land Co., </em>292 U.S. 143, 150, 54 S.Ct. 634, 78 L.Ed. 1178 (1934)). Appellants have not raised the constitutional issue, and we do not address it here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b895-12\">. As Continental itself acknowledges, this renders moot Ohio law's policy against insuring intentional torts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b897-8\">. Continental offers no authority to refute this proposition. The cases cited by Continental on this point all deal with the payment of attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See Hofing v. CNA Ins. Cos., </em>247 N.J.Super. 82, 588 A.2d 864 (N.J.Super.App.Div.1991), <em>Cont\u2019l Cas. Co. v. Brady, </em>127 Idaho 830, 907 P.2d 807 (Idaho 1995), <em>Cont\u2019l Cas. Co. v. Black and Black, P.A., </em>674 So.2d 163 (Fla.App.1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b897-9\">. Continental also argues that the policy excludes coverage for criminal penalties or liabilities that may arise from some of Suggs\u2019 claims in the underlying state court action. Continental does not argue, however, that the \"criminal penalties\u201d exclusion applies to <em>all </em>of Suggs' claims. This exclusion therefore does not affect Continental\u2019s duty to defend. If the allegations of a single count trigger the insurer\u2019s duty to defend, the insurer is obligated to defend the entire action. <em>E.g., Lambe Realty Inv., Inc. v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>137 N.C.App. 1, 527 S.E.2d 328, 331 (N.C.App.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
