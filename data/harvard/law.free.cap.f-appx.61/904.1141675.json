Brownlow appeals the district court\u2019s order awarding summary judgment to his former employer in his civil action in which he alleged constructive discharge, discriminatory discharge, discrimination with respect to other terms and conditions of his employment, and retaliation in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17 (2000). We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Brownlow v. Information Builders, Inc., </em>No. CA-02-786-A (E.D.Va. Dec. 5, 2002). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
