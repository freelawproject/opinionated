Huff, Jr., seeks to appeal from the magistrate judge\u2019s order denying relief on his petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). When, as here, the lower court dismisses a \u00a7 2254 petition solely on procedural grounds, a certificate of appealability will not issue unless the petitioner can demonstrate both \u201c(1) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right\u2019 and (2) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir.) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 941, 122 S.Ct. 318, 151 L.Ed.2d 237 (2001). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Huff has not satisfied this standard. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 1040, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-22\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b953-24\"> The parties consented to trial before a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c) (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
