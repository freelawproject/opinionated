Moten, a state prisoner, seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> An appeal may not be taken from the final order in a habeas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>corpus proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue for claims addressed by a district court on the merits absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000); <em>see Miller El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Moten has not satisfied this standard. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b147-11\"> Moten does not challenge on appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of two claims in a prior order for lack of subject matter jurisdiction or the court\u2019s dismissal of one claim on procedural default grounds. Moten has waived appellate review of these claims by failing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>raise them in his informal brief. 4th Cir. R. 34(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
