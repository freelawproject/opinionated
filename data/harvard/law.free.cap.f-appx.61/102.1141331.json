Garry Okpala seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order accepting the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation to dismiss some claims and defendants from his civil rights action and the court\u2019s order denying his motion filed under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e). This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2000), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (2000); Fed. R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). The orders Okpala seeks to appeal are neither final orders nor appealable interlocutory or collateral orders. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
