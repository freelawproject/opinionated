The immigration judge had denied her application for asylum and withholding of deportation, and the Board was not per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>suaded to reconsider. We have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reconsider. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(a), (b)(1) (2002). We accordingly deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
