Dover\u2019s counsel has a filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising one possible sentencing issue on appeal, but stating that, in her view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Dover was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-15\">Dover\u2019s sentence was enhanced for possession of a firearm during drug transactions under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guideline Manual </em>\u00a7 2D1.1 (2000) based on cooperating witnesses\u2019 statements that Dover routinely carried firearms during drug transactions. Dover objected to the presentence report\u2019s recommendation of that enhancement but withdrew the objection at the sentencing hearing. We find the district court did not commit clear error in its application of the firearm enhancement. <em>See United States v. McAllister, </em>272 F.3d 228, 234 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-16\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Dover\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform her client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-17\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-18\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
