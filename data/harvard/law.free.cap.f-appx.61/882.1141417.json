We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Lora v. Hollenhorst, </em>No. CA-02-757-2 (E.D. Va. Sept. 30, 2002; Dec. 11, 2002). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b933-16\"> <em>Bivens v.
