The first motion is for a hearing to consider releasing Nagy, who is incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution in Butner, North Carolina, to his native Romania. In the second motion, Nagy seeks expedited consideration of the first motion. Nagy filed the motions on January 14, 2003, and March 11, 2003, respectively. We find that mandamus relief is not warranted because the delay in ruling on the motions is not unreasonable. Accordingly, although we grant the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we deny the petition. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-20\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
