Pruitt was sentenced to eighty-seven months imprisonment. Pruitt did not appeal his conviction or his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>In August 2000, Pruitt moved to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000), alleging his guilty plea was involuntary and he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Both claims related to the enhancement of his sentence for possession of a weapon under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) (2000). The district court denied this motion. In his appeal of that denial, Pruitt raised five issues for the first time on appeal. To the extent he appealed the dismissal of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, Pruitt asserted a jury would not have found him guilty of weapons possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">In an opinion issued on February 12, 2003, we considered the merits of Pruitt\u2019s claims. We determined that those claims did not merit relief and accordingly denied a certificate of appealability and dismissed Pruitt\u2019s appeal. Pruitt petitioned for panel rehearing, asserting that we incorrectly analyzed the underlying merits of his claims rather than determining whether he was entitled to the requested certificate of appealability as addressed by <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). Upon consideration of Pruitt\u2019s petition, we grant panel rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">To be entitled to a certificate of appealability, Pruitt must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). \u2018Where a district court has rejected the constitutional claims on the merits, the showing required to satisfy \u00a7 2253(c) is straightforward: The petitioner must demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">Upon examination of Pruitt\u2019s appeal, we conclude that Pruitt has failed to demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of his constitutional claims debatable or wrong. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
