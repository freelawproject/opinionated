We have reviewed the administrative record and find no error in the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Guled was firmly resettled in Canada and is thus ineligible for asylum. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(C) (2000); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(2)(A)(vi) (2000); <em>Mussie v. INS, </em>172 F.3d 329, 331-32 (4th Cir.1999). As the firm resettlement bar applies here, Guled\u2019s contentions that he suffered past persecution and challenging the IJ\u2019s additional findings that he could safely relocate in Somalia, or go to Ethiopia, are misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-12\">We accordingly deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-13\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
