Recognizing that there was autopsy evidence that showed lesions of 2 centimeters and autopsy evidence that showed evidence of 1.2 centimeter lesions, the ALJ made an equivalency determination, finding that \u201cregardless of whether [the lesions] exceeded 2 centimeters ... or were 1.2 centimeters ..., [they] would be expected on x-ray to yield one or more large opacities (i.e., greater than 1 centimeter in diamater)\u201d and that \u201cit is undisputed that [Fultz] had at least 1.2 centimeter lesions of coal workers pneumoconiosis on autopsy and I find that these autopsy findings satisfy the statutory and regulatory definition.\u201d (J.A. at 215.) Because the record in this case lacks any evidence establishing that the size of a lesion on autopsy is equivalent to the size of a lesion on x-ray that would support this equivalency determination, we remand this case for such testimony and any other further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-14\">Clarence Fultz worked for at least thirty years as a coal miner, ending in 1982. He died in 1999, and according to his death certificate, the cause of his death was respiratory failure due to extensive squamous cell carcinoma with coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis listed as an underlying condition. Following his death, Dorothy Fultz, his widow, filed an application for survivor\u2019s benefits under the Act. The Department of Labor determined that Mrs. Fultz was eligible for benefits, and the claim was referred to the Office of Administrative Law Judges. Clinchfield Coal agreed that it was the \u201cresponsible operator\u201d and therefore would be liable for the payment of benefits if any were to be awarded to Mrs. Fultz. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 725.490, 725.492 (2002). Clinchfield Coal has also agreed that Mr. Fultz had pneumo-coniosis and that he had 30 years of coal mine employment. On the issue of whether the miner died due to pneumoconiosis, the administrative law judge (ALJ) found that Mrs. Fultz successfully invoked the irrebuttable presumption of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.304 that the miner\u2019s death was due to pneumoconiosis. Although the ALJ considered x-ray evidence, CT scans, autopsy evidence and medical reports, in awarding benefits, the ALJ concluded that only the autopsy evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>dence supported the invocation of the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">Reviewing the autopsy evidence, the ALJ considered an autopsy report prepared by Dr. Brooks. Upon gross examination, Dr. Brooks found \u201cmultiple tracheobronchial lymph nodes showing anthracotic changes and fibrosis\u201d in the trachea, \u201csevere\u201d anthracosis in the lungs, shown by \u201cmultiple areas of black macular discoloration,\u201d and \u201cmultiple areas of fibrosis and firm nodules in both lungs.\u201d (J.A. at 32.) In the autopsy report, Dr. Brooks listed, but did not discuss, twenty-two slide cassettes of tissue taken during the autopsy. Dr. Brooks concluded that \u201c[t]he immediate cause of this patient\u2019s death is respiratory failure due to complicated coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis, COPD, metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the lungs, and multifocal post obstructive acute pneumonia.\u201d (J.A. at 33.) In her deposition in the administrative proceeding, Dr. Brooks testified that \u201cvirtually every slide has no viable lung tissue left. It\u2019s mostly fibrotic.\u201d (J.A. at 110.) Asked whether she had found \u201clesions ... resulting from coal-dust exposure on his lung in excess of two centimeters,\u201d Dr. Brooks replied that she had, and that the lesions meeting that description were \u201c[t]oo numerous to count.\u201d (J.A. at 119.)</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">The ALJ also considered the opinions of Dr. Kleinerman and Dr. Caffrey, who reviewed Mr. Fultz\u2019s medical records and tissue slides from the autopsy. In his report, Dr. Kleinerman found \u201ca moderate profusion of lesions of simple CWP,\u201d \u201c[l]esions of simple nodular silicosis,\u201d and \u201c[mjacronodular lesions of silicosis,\u201d in addition to lesions of squamous cell carcinoma. (J.A. at 44.) Dr. Kleinerman concluded that \u201cMr. Fultz had a moderate extent of <em>simple CWP and simple nodular silicosis,\u201d </em>but that his death was the result of \u201cextensive squamous cell carcinoma involving his lungs.\u201d (J.A. at 45.) The ALJ noted that Dr. Kleinerman \u201cdid not provide an estimate of the size of the lesions attributable either to coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis or to silicosis.\u201d (J.A. at 214.)</p>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">In his report, Dr. Caffrey gave a diagnosis based on the autopsy slides of \u201csimple coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis and macro-nodular coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis, extensive,\u201d as well as squamous cell carcinoma, emphysema, bronchopneumonia, and pleuritis. (J.A. at 85.) Dr. Caffrey concluded that \u201cthe patient\u2019s immediate cause of death was due to extensive keratinizing, squamous cell carcinoma\u201d with \u201cterminal!], acute bronchopneumonia.\u201d (J.A. at 87.) Dr. Caffrey also concluded that Mr. Fultz \u201cshowed a moderately severe case of simple coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis and nodular coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis.\u201d (J.A. at 87.) He reported that \u201c[t]he size of the macronodular lesions that were present on the [autopsy] slides that [he] reviewed were up to 1.2 cms.\u201d (J.A. at 87.)</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">Based on these reports, the ALJ found \u201cthat the lesions found on autopsy, regardless of whether they exceeded 2 centimeters as Dr. Brooks found or were 1.2 centimeters as Dr. Caffrey found, would be expected on x-ray to yield one or more large opacities (i.e., greater than 1 centimeter in diameter).\u201d (J.A. at 215.) The ALJ held that considering all of the evidence together, the pathological evidence, including the well-reasoned opinions of Dr. Brooks and Dr. Caffrey, outweighed the other evidence. (J.A. at 215.) Accordingly, the ALJ held that Mrs. Fultz was entitled to the irrebuttable presumption of death due to pneumoconiosis under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.304 and awarded benefits to Mrs. Fultz.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>The Benefits Review Board affirmed the ALJ\u2019s award of benefits, and Clinchfield Coal filed this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">We review Mrs. Fultz\u2019s claim for benefits under the Act to determine whether substantial evidence supports the factual findings of the ALJ and whether the legal conclusions of the Board and the ALJ are rational and consistent with applicable law. <em>Bill Branch Coal Corp. v. Sparks, </em>213 F.3d 186, 190 (4th Cir.2000). When reviewing a factual finding, we must affirm the ALJ\u2019s decision if it is supported by substantial evidence, <em>Thom v. Itmann Coal Co., </em>3 F.3d 713, 718 (4th Cir.1993), which is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion,\u201d <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971) (citations omitted). Under the Act, an eligible claimant is entitled to survivor\u2019s benefits if the miner\u2019s death was \u201cdue to\u201d pneumoconiosis. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.205 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">When a miner is \u201cafflicted with complicated pneumoconiosis, [it] is \u2018irrebuttably presumed\u2019 ... that his death was due to pneumoconiosis.\u201d <em>Usery v. Turner Elkhorn Mining Co., </em>428 U.S. 1, 11, 96 S.Ct. 2882, 49 L.Ed.2d 752 (1976). The irrebuttable presumption applies if \u201c(A) an x-ray of the miner\u2019s lungs shows at least one opacity greater than one centimeter in diameter; (B) a biopsy or autopsy reveals \u2018massive lesions\u2019 in the lungs; or (C) a diagnosis by other means reveals a result equivalent to (A) or (B).\u201d <em>Eastern Associated Coal Corp. v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, </em>220 F.3d 250, 255 (4th Cir.2000) (citing 30 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 921(c)). We have held that the three methods of invoking the irrebuttable presumption found in clauses (A), (B), and (C) \u201cdescribe a single, objective condition.\u201d <em>Eastern, </em>220 F.3d at 255. Therefore, the ALJ must make an equivalency determination \u201cto make certain that regardless of which diagnostic technique is used, the same underlying condition triggers the irrebuttable presumption.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Double B Min</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number><em>ing, Inc. v. Blankenship, </em>177 F.3d 240, 244 (4th Cir.1999). Because clause (A) sets out an entirely objective scientific standard, i.e., an opacity on an x-ray greater than one centimeter, we have held that it is the benchmark to which evidence under the other clauses in compared. <em>See Eastern, </em>220 F.3d at 256; <em>Double B, </em>177 F.3d at 244. Accordingly, \u201cmassive lesions\u201d sufficient to invoke the irrebuttable presumption under clause (B) are those that \u201cwhen x-rayed ... would show as opacities greater than one centimeter.\u201d <em>Eastern, </em>220 F.3d at 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">After reviewing the evidence in this case, the ALJ concluded \u201cthat the lesions found on autopsy, regardless of whether they exceeded 2 centimeters as Dr. Brooks found or were 1.2 centimeters as Dr. Caffrey found, would be expected on x-ray to yield one or more large opacities (i.e., greater than 1 centimeter in diameter).\u201d (J.A. at 215.) There was no testimony or medical report or evidence indicating that the lesions discovered on autopsy would be expected on x-ray to yield one or more opacities of greater than one centimeter or that the size of a lesion on autopsy was equivalent or less than the expected size on x-ray. In fact, both Dr. Caffrey and Dr. Brooks declined to offer an opinion on that point. When asked whether he could state to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the lesions he saw on the autopsy slides were \u201cthe medical equivalent of a one centimeter x-ray reading,\u201d Dr. Caffrey stated \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (J.A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>at 213-14.) Similarly, when asked if she could opine as to whether the lesions found on autopsy \u201cwere complicated pneumoconiosis [that] would have shown up on a chest x-ray,\u201d Dr. Brooks stated, \u201cI can\u2019t comment on that.\u201d (J.A. at 122.) Thus, when specifically questioned, Dr. Brooks herself was unable to correlate her findings on autopsy with the expected size of the lesions on x-ray.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">While there may be lesions so large that it is self-evident that they would have shown as opacities greater than one centimeter on x-ray, we cannot presume that lesions of 1.2 centimeters<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> are so large that there need be no further testimony or evidence as to whether they would have shown on x-ray as opacities of greater than one centimeter. <em>Cf. Double B, </em>177 F.3d at 244 (concluding that evidence of lesions of 1.3 centimeters, standing alone, was insufficient to determine whether miner had complicated pneumoconiosis and remanding for an equivalency determination); see <em>also id. </em>(noting that \u201c \u2018nodules are generally larger on autopsy examination than they appear on a chest radiograph\u2019\u201d (quoting N. LeRoy Lapp, M.D., <em>A Lawyer\u2019s Medical Guide to Black Lung Litigation, </em>83 W. Va. L. Rev. 721, 736 (1981))). Without more, we cannot conclude that the ALJ\u2019s finding that the lesions would have shown as one or more opacities of greater than one centimeter is supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b921-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-11\">Because there was insufficient evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s finding that Mr. Fultz had lesions that would have shown as greater than one centimeter on x-ray, we vacate the Board\u2019s decision upholding the award of benefits to Mrs. Fultz and direct the Board to remand the case to an ALJ for further proceedings consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>with this opinion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AJ7\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b919-7\">. Our dissenting sister is correct that the ALJ must make an equivalency determination. <em>See post </em>at 873-874. That determination, however, must be supported by substantial evidence. The dissent\u2019s reliance on <em>Eastern Associated Coal Corp. v. Director, OWCP, 220 </em>F.3d 250, 254 (4th Cir.2000), is misplaced. In <em>Eastern, </em>the ALJ considered x-ray evidence including readings by several doctors who read the x-ray as showing one or more opacities larger than one centimeter and autopsy evidence showing lesions of 1.7 centimeters. <em>Eastern, 220 </em>F.3d at 253-57. We held that although the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that prong (B) was satisfied by the autopsy evidence was based on an incorrect analysis, the autopsy evidence did not undermine the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that prong (A) was satisfied by the x-ray evidence, <em>id. </em>at 257, because where \"the x-ray evidence vividly displays opacities exceeding one centimeter, ... the x-ray evidence can lose force only if other evidence affirmatively shows that the opacities are not there or are not what they seem to be, perhaps because of <em>an </em>intervening pathology, some technical problem with the equipment used, or incompetence of the reader,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 256. The autopsy evidence did not undermine the x-ray evidence because \u201d[w]e [were] given no reason to believe that nodules of 1.7 centimeters would not produce x-ray opacities greater than one centimeter. To the contrary, the 1991 x-ray, showing opacities greater than one centimeter in diameter, provide[d] persuasive evidence that the miner\u2019s lesions did in fact show as opacities of that size.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-9\">Thus, in <em>Eastern, </em>we did not find that autopsy evidence of lesions of 1.7 centimeters supported invocation of the irrebuttable presumption. Instead, we held that where doctors read the x-ray evidence as showing lesions of greater than one centimeter in diameter, autopsy evidence of lesions of 1.7 centimeters did not undermine the x-ray evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-10\">In this case, however, the ALJ found that none of the x-ray readings \"indicated] opacities of 1 centimeter in diameter or more.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>(J.A. at 210.) Accordingly, here we are considering whether the autopsy evidence by itself supports invocation of the irrebuttable presumption, not whether the autopsy evidence undermines other evidence. The ALJ's equivalency determination in this case is not supported by substantial evidence because we have no testimony, medical report, or evidence indicating that the lesions discovered on autopsy would be expected on x-ray to yield one or more opacities of greater than one centimeter.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">The rule that my dissenting colleague posits, that the ALJ\u2019s equivalency determination need not be supported by substantial evidence, has no boundaries. For example, it would allow the ALJ to make an equivalency determination that a lesion of 0.75 centimeters on autopsy would show as greater than one centimeter on x-ray.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b920-7\">. The dissent reads too much into Dr. Caffrey\u2019s deposition testimony. The entire sequence of questions is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-8\">Q. Okay. Do you feel that you could state to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, Dr. Caffrey, that from what you saw on the slides, do you think that that\u2019s a medical equivalent of a one centimeter x-ray reading of a nodule of coal dust?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-9\">A. I don\u2019t know, sir. It\u2019s very difficult, in my opinion, to be very objective in comparing the size of the lesion grossly or microscopically with the x-ray changes, unless you're looking at them at the same time. In other words, if you had the x-ray in the autopsy suite, up on the Roentgenogram, the x-ray view boxes, and you looked at those, then measured the size\u2014and you had a highly skilled radiologist with you\u2014and then you saw the lesions at the autopsy table and you compared them; that, to me, is the only real objective way to determine if the sizes are very similar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-12\">Q. Okay. But the x-rays are done on a scale of 1\u2014to\u20141; in other words, there\u2019s no enlargement or decrease in size on an x-ray, is there\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-13\">A. Not that I know of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-14\">Q. \u2014unless it's noted or something?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-15\">A. Not that I know of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-16\">Q. Okay. So do you think it\u2019s very possible that the 1.2 centimeter size could be the medical equivalent of a one centimeter measurement on a x-ray?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-17\">A. It could be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-18\">Q. And would you go as far as to say, very likely it would be the equivalent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-19\">A. I don\u2019t know. That would be speculation on my part.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b920-20\">(J.A. at 164-65.) This testimony is hardly the substantial evidence required to support the ALJ\u2019s finding of equivalency. Rather than being a concession that lesions of 1.2 centimeters would show on x-ray as greater than one centimeter, <em>see post </em>at 872-873, 874-875, Dr. Caffrey\u2019s testimony \"it could be\u201d is simply part of his string of responses indicating that he did not know how the lesions would show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>on x-ray and that any guess would be speculation. The ALJ noted that Dr. Caffrey \"declined to say that the two [the autopsy and the x-ray] would be equivalent as it would involve speculation on his part.\u201d (J.A. at 214.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b921-7\">. The dissent would have us rely on the testimony of Dr. Brooks to support the equivalency determination, even though the ALJ explicitly did not. <em>See post </em>at 874-875. The ALJ held that even if the lesions \"were 1.2 centimeters as Dr. Caffrey found,\u201d the lesions would be expected to show as greater than one centimeter on x-ray and that \"it is undisputed that the Miner had at least 1.2 centimeter lesions of coal workers pneumoconiosis on autopsy and I find that these autopsy findings satisfy the statutory and regulatory definition.\u201d (J.A. at 215.) Our review of an ALJ\u2019s findings, as affirmed by the Board, is very limited. \u201cWe may not reweigh the evidence or substitute our views for those of the ALJ....\u201d <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Union Carbide Corp., </em>105 F.3d 166, 170 (4th Cir.1997). As the ALJ\u2019s finding was lesions of 1.2 centimeters satisfied the statutory and regulatory definition, it is that finding that we must review. Plainly, Dr. Brooks\u2019s testimony does nothing to support this finding. As there is no medical report, testimony or other evidence indicating that the lesions of 1.2 centimeters would be expected to show as greater than one centimeter on x-ray, the finding is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b921-13\">. Clinchfield Coal argues that the autopsy report should not have been considered because it did not comply with 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.106 (2000). Mrs. Fultz argues, and the BRB concluded, that the autopsy report, when considered with Dr. Brooks's later deposition testimony, substantially complied with the requirements of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.106. We assume without deciding that the ALJ properly considered the autopsy report. Even making this assumption, there is insufficient evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s finding that the lesions would have shown as opacities of greater than one centimeter. We thus reach neither the issue of whether substantial compliance with the regulation is sufficient nor the issue of whether evidence outside the autopsy report itself may be considered in determining whether the requirements of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.106 are met.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b922-8\">. The tenor of the dissent would suggest that this opinion precludes the miner\u2019s widow from obtaining benefits. To the contrary, we axe remanding for the ALJ to make a factual finding based on testimony, medical reports or other evidence that the opacities would show as greater than one centimeter. Nothing in this opinion precludes the miner\u2019s widow from receiving benefits or precludes invocation of the irrebuttable presumption based on an equivalency determination supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b922-4\">DIANA GRIBBON MOTZ, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A9G5\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">The majority vacates the award of black lung benefits to the widow of Clarence Fultz, who died in 1999 after working as a coal miner for more than 30 years.

Rather, a court <em>\u201cmust </em>affirm\u201d an ALJ\u2019s decision if, \u201cin light of the whole record,\u201d the decision is supported by evidence of \u201csufficient quality and quantity \u2018as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support the finding under review.\u2019\u201d <em>Piney Mountain, </em>176 F.3d at 756 (quoting <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971) (internal quotation marks omitted)) (emphasis added). Thus, \u201cthe Supreme Court has directed us to uphold decisions that rest within the realm of rationality; a reviewing court has <em>no license </em>to \u2018set aside an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>inference merely because it finds the opposite conclusion more reasonable or because it questions the factual basis.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 756 (quoting <em>Doss v. Director, OWCP, </em>53 F.3d 654, 659 (4th Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks omitted)) (emphasis added). Unfortunately, however, even a quick review of the record evidence here demonstrates that the majority has appropriated for itself precisely such a \u201clicense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">The record reveals that Mrs. Fultz offered powerful evidence of lesions on Mr. Fultz\u2019s lungs resulting from coal-dust exposure, which exceeded not one, but two, centimeters. Dr. Brooks, who performed the autopsy of Mr. Fultz and diagnosed the cause of death as due, in part, to complicated pneumoconiosis, explained in detail that she found many\u2014\u201ctoo numerous to count\u201d\u2014large coal-dust lesions \u201cin excess of two centimeters.\u201d Dr. Brooks\u2019 autopsy report confirmed that \u201c[ajnthracosis [wa]s severe\u201d with \u201cmultiple areas of black macular discoloration,\u201d that \u201c[t]he bronchi contain copious amounts of purulent material,\u201d and \u201cmultiple areas of fibrosis and firm nodules\u201d were found in both lungs. Although the company\u2019s expert, Dr. Caffrey, disagreed with Dr. Brooks\u2019 ultimate conclusion (i.e., that Mr. Fultz had complicated rather than \u201cmoderately severe\u201d simple pneumoconiosis), he too found lesions on the autopsy slides exceeding one centimeter (albeit only lesions of 1.2, rather than two, centimeters). Moreover, when asked if there would be \u201cenlargement or decrease in [the] size [of these lesions] on x-ray,\u201d Dr. Caffrey testified, \u201cnot that I know of,\u201d and while he also did not know whether the autopsy and x-ray measurements were \u201cvery likely\u201d equivalent, he acknowledged that \u201cit could be\u201d \u201cvery possible that the 1.2 centimeter size [of autopsy lesions] could be the medical equivalent of a one centimeter measurement on x-ray.\u201d Relying on this evidence, the ALJ found that even Dr. Caffrey (the company\u2019s expert) \u201cstated no basis for determining that the 1.2 centimeter lesions observed on the pathology slides would equate to less than the 1.2 centimeters on x-ray\u201d and that the lesions on Mr. Fultz\u2019s lungs, whether 2 centimeters (Dr. Brooks\u2019 view) or 1.2 centimeters (Dr. Caffrey\u2019s view), \u201cwould be expected on x-ray to yield one or more large opacities ... greater than 1 centimeter in diameter.\u201d Certainly, a \u201creasonable mind\u201d could \u201caccept\u201d the record evidence as \u201cadequate\u201d to support this equivalency determination by the ALJ. <em>See Piney Mountain, </em>176 F.3d at 756 (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, proper application of the substantial evidence standard requires us to \u201cuphold\u201d the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">I confess that I do not fully understand the majority\u2019s refusal to do so. That refusal seems to stem from the majority\u2019s misunderstanding of the relevant law and from its unjustified disregard of crucial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\">As to the former, the majority appears to believe that, in order to establish equivalency, the law requires a claimant to offer evidence that a <em>medical professional, </em>rather than the ALJ, has made the equivalency determination. Thus, the majority rejects the ALJ\u2019s express equivalency determination because there was \u201cno testimony or medical report or evidence indicating that the lesions discovered on autopsy would be expected on x-ray to yield one or more opacities of greater than one centimeter.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 869-870 n. 1. Imposing a requirement that medical evidence contain the equivalency determination is, however, directly at odds with circuit precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-9\">Indeed, when we first announced the equivalency requirement in <em>Double B Mining, </em>we made it plain that <em>the ALJ </em>is to make the equivalency determination. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>In that ease, the miner\u2019s physician observed a nodule of 1.3 centimeters on biopsy of the miner\u2019s lung and opined that a nodule in excess of one centimeter indicated complicated pneumoconiosis; the company\u2019s expert contended that \u201ccomplicated pneumoconiosis exists [only] where there are nodules on the lungs that are larger than two centimeters in greatest dimension.\u201d We expressly refused \u201cto impose the two-centimeter rule on the Benefits Review Board,\u201d reasoning that the \u201cstatute d[id] not mandate\u201d such a rule. <em>Id. </em>at 243. Instead, we held that because \u201cnothing in the record ... demonstrate^] that <em>the ALJ made thfe] equivalency determination </em>as required by the statute,\u201d we would remand the case <em>\u201cto the ALJ </em>to find whether the 1.3-centimeter lesion would, if x-rayed prior to removal of that portion of Blankenship\u2019s lung, have showed as a one-centimeter opacity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 244 (emphasis added); <em>see also id. </em>(concluding that <em>the ALJ </em>must make the \u201cequivalency determination\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">Thus, in <em>Double B Mining, </em>we emphasized that <em>the ALJ </em>is to make the necessary equivalency determination. Moreover, a year later in <em>Eastern Associated Coal Corp. v. Director, OWCP, </em>220 F.3d 250, 254 (4th Cir.2000), we <em>affirmed </em>an award of benefits even though <em>no </em>medical expert made an equivalency determination. In fact, we upheld the ALJ\u2019s determination in part because there was \u201cno reason to believe\u201d that autopsy evidence of nodules greater than one centimeter \u201cwould not produce x-ray opacities greater than one centimeter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258. Yet the majority rejects the ALJ\u2019s similar reasoning here that nothing (not even the company doctor\u2019s testimony) indicates that autopsy evidence of nodules greater than one eentimeter would not \u201cequate\u201d to x-ray opacities greater than one centimeter. The rationale for the majority\u2019s apparent imposition of a requirement that a medical expert make the equivalency determination is thus very puzzling.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">Even more puzzling is the only other basis the majority offers for its refusal to find the ALJ\u2019s equivalency determination not supported by substantial evidence. That is, the majority\u2019s statement that although \u201cthere may be lesions so large that it is self-evident that they would have shown as opacities greater than one centimeter on x-ray,\u201d such a \u201cself-evident\u201d conclusion is not possible here because it cannot be \u201cpresume[d] that lesions of <em>1.2 centimeters </em>are so large that there need be no further testimony or evidence as to whether they would have shown on x-ray as opacities greater than one centimeter.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 871 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted). In arriving at this conclusion, the majority disregards Dr. Brooks\u2019 powerful testimony of numerous (\u201ctoo many to count\u201d) lesions in excess of <em>two (not 1.2) </em>centimeters.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The majority\u2019s failure to consider this evidence is important because through it, Mrs. Fultz presented autopsy evidence of black lung lesions which <em>exceed </em>the apparent two-centimeter \u201cgold standard\u201d frequently advanced by the American College of Pathologists and employers as conclusively establishing complicated pneumoconiosis. <em>Cf. Double B Mining, </em>177 F.3d at 243-44; <em>Piney Mountain, </em>176 F.3d at 761 n. 8. Surely such evidence suffices to meet the majority\u2019s own \u201cself-evident\u201d standard. Yet the majority completely rejects it.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">In sum, despite Dr. Brooks\u2019 findings of multiple lesions greater than two centimeters, Dr. Caffrey\u2019s findings of lesions of at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>least 1.2 centimeters, and his concession that \u201cit could be\u201d \u201cvery possible\u201d that such lesions are \u201cthe medical equivalent of a one centimeter measurement on x-ray,\u201d the majority concludes that the ALJ did not have substantial evidence to support her equivalency determination. Because this conclusion is based on a failure to apply the governing standard of review, an imposition of an unauthorized legal burden, and the disregard of record evidence, I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b922-13\">. Such a condition \"is commonly referred to as 'complicated\u2019 pneumoconiosis.\u201d <em>Piney Mountain Coal Co. v. Mays, </em>176 F.3d 753, 757 n. 3 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b924-5\">. The majority criticizes my reliance, in part, on Dr. Brooks\u2019 testimony. The ALJ clearly relied on this evidence, although she declined to resolve the differing opinions on the size of the lesions based on the undisputed findings of lesions of \"at least 1.2 centimeter[s].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
