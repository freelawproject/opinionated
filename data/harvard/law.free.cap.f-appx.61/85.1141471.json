On appeal, Narcisse raises four issues: (1) insufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions; (2) the improper admission of evidence concerning where the firearms purchased by Narcisse were recovered; (3) the district court\u2019s failure to find Narcisse a \u201cminor participant\u201d in the offense; and (4) the district court\u2019s failure to give Narcisse a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-14\">Narcisse\u2019s first argument on appeal is that the district court erred by declining to grant his motion for acquittal due to insufficiency of the evidence. To determine whether there was sufficient evidence to support a conviction, this Court considers whether, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, any reasonable trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. </em>60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). This Court does not weigh the evidence or determine the credibility of the witnesses. Rather, the jury verdict must be upheld if there is substantial evidence to support the verdict. <em>Id.; United States v. Murphy, </em>35 F.3d 143, 148 (4th Cir.1994). A defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction faces a heavy burden. <em>United States v. Beidler, </em>110 F.3d 1064, 1067 (4th Cir.1997). In light of trial testimony supporting the jury\u2019s verdict, including evidence that Narcisse purchased fifteen guns from federally licensed firearm dealers with money given to him by Rayshawn Rucker; that Rucker could not purchase the guns himself because he was on probation; and that several of the guns were recovered in various cities along the East Coast in connection with crimes, Narcisse\u2019s claim of insufficiency of the evidence fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-15\">Next, Narcisse argues the Government\u2019s rebuttal evidence, establishing that the firearms purchased by Narcisse were recovered outside of North Carolina, was not relevant to whether he made false statements in the acquisition of those firearms. Narcisse also argues that this evidence was highly prejudicial and misleading be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>cause it made Narcisse appear to be involved in the illegal distribution of the firearms, although his conduct was limited to their purchase only. A district court\u2019s rulings on the admission and exclusion of evidence will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Bostian, 59 </em>F.3d 474, 480 (4th Cir.1995). This Court will find an abuse of discretion only if the district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling was arbitrary or irrational. <em>United States v. Achiekwelu, </em>112 F.3d 747, 753 (4th Cir.1997). Evidence is relevant and may be admitted if it tends to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence. Fed.R.Evid. 401; <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Evid. 402. Even if evidence is relevant, it can only be admitted if its probative value outweighs its prejudicial effect. Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Despite Narcisse\u2019s claims, evidence of the recovery of the firearms outside of North Carolina was, in fact, relevant to prove that he was purchasing guns for others, and to disprove his assertion that the guns would be returned to him. To the extent Narcisse also complains that he was prejudiced by testimony that several handguns he purchased were ultimately used by others engaged in criminal activity, we note that this evidence was not introduced in the Government\u2019s case in chief, but was elicited by defense counsel during cross-examination of two Government witnesses. We accordingly reject Narcisse\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Narcisse\u2019s third argument is that he should have received a reduction in his offense level for being a minor participant as defined by <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3B1.2 (2000). This Court reviews a district court\u2019s determination regarding the defendant\u2019s role in the offense for clear error. <em>United States v. Daughtrey, </em>874 F.2d 213, 218 (4th Cir.1989). A defendant seeking a mitigating adjustment under \u00a7 3B1.2 bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he is entitled to the adjustment. <em>United States v. Palinkas, </em>938 F.2d 456, 460 (4th Cir.1991). A defendant may play a minor role if he is less culpable than most other participants but has more than a minimal role. USSG \u00a7 3B1.2 comment, (n.3). However, the court should not only compare the defendant\u2019s culpability to that of the other participants, but also measure it against the elements of the offense of conviction. <em>United States v. Reavis, </em>48 F.3d 763, 769 (4th Cir.1995). The critical inquiry is thus not just whether the defendant has done fewer bad acts than [his] codefendants, but whether the defendant\u2019s conduct is material or essential to committing the offense. <em>Palinkas, </em>938 F.2d at 460. Having fully considered the evidence and the district court\u2019s ruling, we conclude that the district court did not commit clear error in refusing to find Narcisse was a minor participant.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">Finally, Narcisse asserts the district court erred by denying him a downward adjustment for his acceptance of responsibility. The denial of an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility is a factual determination reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>77 F.3d 71, 74 (4th Cir.1996). The determination of the district court on review is due great deference. <em>United States v. Nale, </em>101 F.3d 1000, 1005 (4th Cir.1996) (citing <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n.5) (1993)). The burden is on the defendant to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he is entitled to the adjustment. <em>United States v. Urrego-Linares, </em>879 F.2d 1234, 1238-39 (4th Cir. 1989). Application note 2 of USSG \u00a7 3E1.1 states that the downward adjust<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>ment for acceptance of responsibility is not intended to apply to a defendant who puts the Government to its burden of proof at trial by denying the essential factual elements of guilt, is convicted, and only then admits guilt and expresses remorse. Although application note 2 to section 3E1.1 states that the reduction is available to a defendant who goes to trial solely to assert and preserve issues unrelated to his factual guilt, this exception does not apply in Narcisse\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">The district court found that Narcisse was not eligible for a two level reduction for acceptance of responsibility because Narcisse put the Government to the effort and expense of trial, and because the court had difficulty with the story that Narcisse thought those guns were going to be his. In fact, even at sentencing Narcisse continued to claim that he honestly believed the guns would be returned to him. At no time during his trial or sentencing did Narcisse take responsibility for his criminal actions; therefore, the district court did not err in denying Narcisse a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Narcisse\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
