We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Vaughan v. United States, </em>No. CA-02-569-5-H(3) (E.D.N.C. Oct. 9, 2002). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
