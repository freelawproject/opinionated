The action was brought to recover the sum of three hundred and forty dollars for services rendered by the plaintiff in effecting a sale of defendant\u2019s land. On the trial the court refused to hear evidence of the contract on the ground it was hot in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">The case comes directly under the provisions of section 1634, subdivision 6, of the Civil Code; and similar contracts have uniformly been held invalid by this court. <em>(McCarthy v. Loupe, </em>62 Cal. 300; <em>Myres v. Surryhne, </em>67 Cal. 657; <em>Zeimer v. </em>Antisell, 75 Cal. 509; <em>McPhail v. Buell, </em>87 Cal. 115; <em>Shanklin v. Hall, </em>100 Cal. 26.) The case of <em>Clark v. Allen, </em>125 Cal. 276, cited by appellant, has no application. In that case the contract was in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The judgment and order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">Haynes, C., and Gray, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">Garoutte, J., Van Dyke, J., Harrison, J,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
