From the affidavits and exhibits used on the motion to dissolve the attachment, embodied in the hill of exceptions, it appears that the defendants reside in and do business in the city and county of San Francisco; that the plaintiffs reside in the city of Hew York, and are engaged in the business of manufacturing hats in said city; that on or about the first day of August, 1897, Charles Rosenberg, one of the defendants, while in said city of Hew York, entered into a contract with the plaintiffs for the manufacture of a large number of hats, and to ship the same when manufactured to the defendants in the city and county of San Francisco; that by the terms of the purchase so made in the city of Hew York it was agreed between the plaintiffs and said Rosenberg that the defendants \u25a0should have sixty days\u2019 time to pay for said hats, and that such payments were to be made in Hew York. In accordance with this agreement of purchase the plaintiffs manufactured and shipped to the defendants said hats so purchased, and sent a statement or bill of the same, a copy of which is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>\u201cStatement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-5\">\u201cNew York, September 30, 1897. \u201cM.

It is very hard to dispose of small shapes, also lined hats, on this coast.

Yours,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-24\">\u00abG. ROSENBERG &amp; SONS.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>The action was commenced December 9, 1897, for the sum of six hundred and seventy-three dollars and seventy-five cents, the amount contained in the statement sent out to the defendants, and the affidavit on which the attachment was issued states that the action is founded upon contract, to wit, an account stated, which was made in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">It is not disputed on the part of the appellants that the transaction between the parties was as stated\u2014that is, the contract of purchase of the goods was made in New York by one of the defendant firm with the plaintiffs, to be paid for on sixty days\u2019 time in the city of New York upon the delivery of the goods here. But it is contended that a new contract sprang up in the nature of an account stated upon the receipt here by the defendants of the bill of the goods mailed by plaintiffs in New York, inasmuch as said defendants did not repudiate or refuse to pay said bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">To constitute an account stated \u201cit must appear that at the time of the accounting certain claims existed, for and concerning which an account was stated; that a balance was then struck and agreed upon, and that defendant expressly admitted that a certain sum was then due from him as a debt. Hence, it follows that an account cannot be stated with reference to a debt payable on a contingency.\u201d (2 Chitty on Contracts, 11th Am. ed., 962.) Here it is shown from the correspondence between the parties that the defendants, upon receiving the bill of goods, wrote to the plaintiffs that they were unable to dispose of certain kinds of hats sent out, and said: \u201cCan you use the same?\u201d It appears, also, that other hats were to be ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">In speaking of an account stated, this court in <em>Coffee v. Williams, </em>103 Cal. 556, says: \u201cBut the account, in order to constitute a contract, should appear to be something more than a mere memorandum; it should show upon its face that it is intended to be a final settlement up to date. And this should be expressed with clearness and certainty.\u201d The facts here did not bring this case within the rule in reference to an account stated so as to constitute a new and independent contract. According to the contention of appellants, in case of any contract made and payable outside of this state it would only be necessary for the creditor to send to his debtor in this state a note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>or memorandum of the amount due, and thereupon, in case the claim was not disputed, commence proceedings in attachment as upon a new contract made in this state. This would he a simple and easy mode of annulling or evading the law authorizing the summary process of attachment. We cannot agree with this contention of appellants; it would not he in accordance with the letter or spirit of the law, which permits an attachment only \u201cwhere the contract is made or is payable in this state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\u201cProceedings by attachment are statutory and special, and the provisions of the statute must be strictly followed, or no rights will be acquired thereunder.\u201d (Gow <em>v. Marshall, </em>90 Cal. 567; <em>Rudolph v. Saunders, </em>111 Cal. 233.)</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Harrison, J., and Garoutte, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
