The answer contains specific denials of certain averments of the complaint and also certain affirmative allegations which, if true, constitute a defense to the action. Judgment went for the plaintiffs, and the defendant appeals \" from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-3\">The defendant contends that the findings do not support the judgment, and this contention must he sustained. The only findings made by the court are as follows: \u201cThat all the allegations of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint in said action are true. That all the allegations of defendant\u2019s answer in said action, so far as they are inconsistent with the allegations of said complaint, are not true.\u201d It has been established by a long line of decisions in this state that such a finding is insufficient to support a judgment. <em>(Ladd v. Tully, </em>51 Cal. 277; <em>Johnson v. Squires, </em>53 Cal. 37; <em>Harlan v. Ely, </em>55 Cal. 340, 344; <em>Bank of Woodland v. Treadwell, </em>55 Cal. 379; <em>Goodnow v. Griswold, </em>68 Cal. 599.) Of course, as was held in <em>Williams v. Hall, </em>79 Cal. 606, and in many other cases, a finding that \u201call the allegations of the complaint are true and all the averments of the answer are untrue,\u201d is sufficient; but the findings in the case at bar that the allegations of defendant\u2019s answer, \u201cso far as they are inconsistent with the allegations of said complaint, are not true,\u201d leave entirely undecided what allegations of the answer are inconsistent with the allegations of the complaint. The case at bar cannot be distinguished from <em>Harlan v. Ely, supra, </em>where the court, having made some special findings, then found generally that all the allegations of the answer are untrue, \u201cexcept only in so far as the same accord with the foregoing facts.\u201d This court in reversing that case said: \u201cThe court below should have assumed the labor of comparing the allegations of the answer with the facts by it found; as it is,' we are not informed which allegations of the answer were, in the opinion of the court below, true, which untrue. We cannot assume the function of determining for the first time the truth or falsity of any of them, either by reference to the testimony or to the facts actually found. A finding that all the \u2018material\u2019 averments of a,pleading are true or untrue is insufficient. <em>(Ladd v. Durkin, </em>54 Cal. 395. See <em>Johnson v. Squires, supra.) </em>But the fifth finding is no more certain than a finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>which refers only to material allegations.\u201d In <em>Bank of Woodland v. Treadwell, supra, </em>this court said: \"The court found That all the allegations of the complaint are true, and all the allegations and denials of the answer contradicting the complaint in any respect are untrue.\u2019 This is not a finding upon the issue tendered by the answer as above given; the judgment must therefore be reversed for want of sufficient finding.\u201d In <em>Ladd v. Tully, supra, </em>the finding was that all the \"material\u201d facts stated in the complaint are true; and this court said: \u201cBut we have no means of determining what facts the court deemed \u2018material,\u2019 and have no information from the findings upon this point. So loose a method of finding the facts cannot be tolerated, and would lead to most serious perplexities.\u201d In <em>Goodnow v. Griswold, supra, </em>the finding was that \"the several allegations of said complaint not in conflict with the foregoing findings are true\u201d; and this court said: \u201cWe are not informed which of the other findings were, in the opinion of the court below, in conflict with the findings referred to as the \u2018foregoing facts\u2019\u201d; and the court said, quoting the language of <em>Harlan v. Ely, supra: </em>\u201cWe cannot assume the function of determining for the first time the truth or falsity of any of them, \u2018either by reference to the testimony\u2019 or to the facts actually found.\u201d The case at bar is clearly within the foregoing decisions; and we cannot disregard the established law in order to meet the exigencies of a particular case. We have heretofore called attention to the fact that the announcement of a trial court of its intention to decide a case a particular way does not end the case, but that care must be taken, under our system, in preparing findings which will support the judgment that is to be rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Temple, J., and Henshaw, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
