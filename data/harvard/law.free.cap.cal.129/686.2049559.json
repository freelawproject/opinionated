Donzelli, though not united to him in the bonds of matrimony, .... and that the said defendant is not a fit or proper person to have care, control, custody, and education of said children.\u201d The petition concludes with a prayer that the decree be modified so far as relates to said children, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The petition was ordered to be heard on November 26, 1897, of which defendant had due notice, and came on to be heard on November 30th, plaintiff appearing in person and by counsel, and defendant appearing by counsel, Mr. F. D. Brandon.' A continuance was asked by defendant\u2019s counsel on the certificate of her attending physician that defendant was \u201ctoo sick and ill to be personally present in court.\u201d By consent of the parties the testimony of several witnesses was taken and the further hearing was postponed until December 3, 1897, at which time defendant\u2019s counsel again moved for a continuance on the same ground as before, and the court denied the motion. Counsel for defendant thereupon orally denied the allegations of the petition except as to the alleged illicit cohabitation of defendant with the said Donzelli, which he admitted to be true. The matter was submitted to the court for its decision, and on December 8, 1897, the court made its order modifying its decree in the divorce case and awarded the custody of the children to plaintiff. The order recites, among other things, that \u201call the allegations set forth in plaintiff\u2019s petition were proven to the satisfaction of the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Error is claimed: 1. In refusing to grant defendant\u2019s motion for a continuance; 2. For insufficiency of the evidence to support the order; and 3. In considering the admission of the counsel for defendant at the time it was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">The first objection is grounded on the assumption that the certificate of the physician alone gave defendant an absolute right to a continuance. There was then no answer to the petition, no denial of its verified averments, no affidavit of defendant nor even an oral statement of her counsel that if permitted to be present defendant would testify to the untruthfulness of the facts stated in the petition or to any facts whatever, and no showing that her presence was necessary as a witness or as adviser to her counsel in conducting the hearing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Under such circumstances it was not error to refuse the motion. (Pa<em>ulucci v. Verity, </em>1 Kan. App. 121.)</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The evidence was sufficient to support the order. It appeared by the testimony of witnesses who were in position to know the character of the house in which defendant was residing with her children that it was notoriously of the character alleged, and that its immediate surroundings were such as to warrant the court in causing the removal of the children and in determining that they should be taken from defendant and given to plaintiffs custody and care.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">Counsel strenuously contend that it was error to receive and consider the admission of counsel as to the immoral conduct of his client; that the admission was in excess of the authority given him by section 283 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and several pages of the reply, brief are devoted to an argument the purpose of which is to show that the decision in <em>Hearne v. De Young, </em>111 Cal. 377, \u201cis highly technical and not warranted in reason or principle.\u201d Other cases giving construction to this section are <em>Preston v. Hill, </em>50 Cal. 53,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and <em>Smith v. Whittier, </em>95 Cal. 279, and these cases were referred to approvingly in <em>Reclamation Dist. v. Hamilton, </em>112 Cal. 603. We do not feel called upon to discuss the point in the present matter. The admission was made in open court at the hearing by the then attorney of defendant, who now, with associate counsel, seeks to take advantage of it by this appeal. Some testimony was given tending to show the truth of the fact admitted; no objection was made to the admission, and, of course, no ruling made or exception reserved thereto. Besides, the testimony was such as to clearly show that defendant was not injured by this admission of her counsel if it be conceded to be error.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">The order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">Gray, C., and Haynes, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the order is affirmed.
