When received by the clerk he must immediately deliver them to the judge, if he be in the county.....When received from the clerk the judge must designate the time at which he will settle the bill, and the clerk must immediately notify the parties of such designation.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., sec. 650.)</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">The answer of the respondent in this case having raised a question as to a matter of fact essential to the determination of the cause, this court ordered the case referred to Judge Edward I. Jones, of San Joaquin county, to take and report the testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>mony and Ms findings upon the issue of fact. Judge Jones finds from the testimony taken before him, as \"fact, \u201cthat the petitioner did not, on the eighth day of July, 1899, or at any time prior to the sixteenth day of October, 1899, hand the proposed bill of exceptions or the proposed amendments thereto, specified in the petition and answer, to the clerk of the superior court in and for the county of San Joaquin, or to any of his deputies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The other findings on the issues presented are in favor of the respondent, and show that his refusal to settle the bill of exceptions was on the ground solely that the same was not presented in time, and that he had no authority in law to settle the same. Upon the coming in of the report of the testimony and findings of Judge J ones, as referee, the petitioner\u2019s attorney filed exceptions to said findings on the ground that the referee failed to find all of the material issues raised by the pleadings, and that said findings are not supported by the evidence, and that they are against law.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">All the material issues raised by the pleadings necessary to enable the court to pass upon the application.for the writ are covered by the findings, and the evidence is sufficient to support the findings. Upon the facts as found the respondent, as judge of the court who tried the cause in question, was not reqMred to settle the bill of exceptions. In fact, it was his duty not to do so without some showing why the same was not presented as required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">Writ denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">McFarland, J., Garoutte, J., Temple, J., Beatty, G.
