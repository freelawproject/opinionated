Plaintiffs brought this action to require certain liability insurers to absorb costs plaintiffs incurred in defending an action the City brought against them in 1988. The trial court entered judgments on demurrer in favor of defendants Liberty National Fire Insurance Company and Maryland Casualty Company, and granted judgment on the pleadings in favor of defendants American Guaranty &amp; Liability Insurance Company, Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company, and Western Heritage Insurance Company. We will affirm the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-7\">Related matters have been before us on at least three prior occasions. In <em>Bullock v. City and County of San Francisco </em>(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 1072 [271 Cal.Rptr. 44] <em>(Bullock </em>I), we reviewed certain orders made in an action brought by Bullock against the City, as well as orders made in an action brought by the City against Bullock in October 1988 (the underlying action here, discussed in more detail below). We referred to an earlier, unpublished decision setting aside the dismissal of yet another action by plaintiffs, or persons associated with them, against the City. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1092, fn. 10.) However, in <em>City and County of San Francisco v. Bullock </em>(Nov. 10, 1996, A068409), review denied and opinion ordered nonpublished February 19, 1990, we affirmed the ultimate dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-8\">In this action plaintiffs seek to recover costs of defense they incurred in the City\u2019s 1988 action against them, parts of which were before us in <em>Bullock I. </em>In its complaint in that action, a copy of which was incorporated by reference in the complaint here, the City alleged as follows: The Abigail Hotel contained 20 \u201ctourist units\u201d and 42 \u201cresidential units\u201d regulated by the City\u2019s Residential Hotel Conversion and Demolition Ordinance (see San Francisco Ord. No. 400-83, added in 1983; San Francisco Ord. No. 217.85, added in 1985) (the Ordinance). The Ordinance imposed restrictions on the rental of residential units to persons other than permanent residents. For at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1439\">*1439</page-number>least six years preceding the filing of the complaint, plaintiffs violated these restrictions, renting too many residential units to persons other than permanent residents. From late 1984 to mid-1988, plaintiffs acted under a preliminary injunction that \u201cpermitted [plaintiffs] to rent all of the hotel\u2019s vacant rooms to tourists.\u201d However, on July 6, 1988, the superior court dissolved the injunction and denied plaintiffs any exemption from the terms of the Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-5\">Based on these allegations the City asserted five causes of action: (1) that by the conduct described above, and also by failing to post certain required notices and reports and maintain certain daily logs, plaintiffs were violating the Ordinance; (2) that by offering (advertising) the premises for use as a \u201ctourist hotel,\u201d plaintiffs were violating the City Planning Code (Planning Code); (3) that plaintiffs\u2019 violations of the Planning Code and the Ordinance were a public nuisance, abatement of which was authorized by state and municipal laws; (4) that plaintiffs\u2019 conduct constituted unfair and unlawful business practices under Business and Professions Code section 17200 et seq.; and (5) that plaintiffs\u2019 conduct warranted the imposition of various \u201ccivil penalties\u201d under the Planning Code, the Ordinance, and Business and Professions Code section 17206.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-6\">The City prayed for (1) preliminary and permanent injunctions prohibiting plaintiffs from renting residential units to nonresidential renters in violation of the Ordinance; (2) injunctions against violating the posting and log-keeping provisions of the Ordinance; (3) injunctions against violating the Planning Code restrictions on tourist hotels; (4) injunctions against, and abatement of, \u201cthe public nuisances presented by the premises\u201d; (5) appointment of a receiver under Business and Professions Code section 17203 \u201cto take over management and control of the premises\u201d in order to prevent continuing unfair practices; (6) civil penalties of $500 per day under the Planning Code; (7) civil penalties of $250 per day per violation of the Ordinance; (8) civil penalties of $2,500 per violation under the Business and Professions Code; (9) costs and attorneys\u2019 fees; and (10) \u201csuch further and other relief as the court deems just.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-7\">The City apparently dismissed its 1988 complaint on or about October 6, 1994. Two years later\u2014eight years after the City filed its complaint\u2014 plaintiffs brought this action against 10 insurance companies they alleged had sold them liability insurance during the period of \u201cat least 1980 to 1993.\u201d Plaintiffs alleged that they had \u201ctendered the defense of [the City\u2019s] action separately to each defendant, but each defendant refused to defend the action and denied coverage,\u201d and that each defendant repeated that refusal when plaintiffs asked them to reconsider. Plaintiffs further alleged that defendants failed to fully and fairly investigate the renewed tender of defense, and that \u201c[s]ome\u201d defendants failed to respond in a timely manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1440\">*1440</page-number>Based on these allegations, plaintiffs asserted claims for breach of contract, bad faith, and fraud. The five defendants now before us challenged the complaint by general demurrer or motion for judgment on the pleadings. The trial court sustained each of these challenges, reciting in all but one case that the orders were made \u201cwithout leave to amend.\u201d The one exception was silent as to leave to amend, but the court thereafter entered judgment on that order, as on the others. Plaintiffs filed three timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-6\">\n<em>The Duty to Defend.</em>\n<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-8\">\n<em>Compliance Costs.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-9\">\n<em>A. Introduction.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-10\">Plaintiffs contend that the City\u2019s complaint exposed them to potential liability for \u201cdamages\u201d because it implicitly sought to compel their compliance with provisions of the Ordinance requiring them to incur or pay what plaintiffs refer to as \u201cmitigation\u201d costs. In particular they cite former section 41.10 of the Ordinance (section 41.10), which requires that any owner seeking to convert a hotel to nonresidential use must, as a condition of the required \u201cconversion permit,\u201d provide or pay for housing to replace the units that will be removed from the residential market. <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Plaintiffs also cite provisions making it unlawful to change the use of a unit, or eliminate or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1441\">*1441</page-number>convert a unit, without a conversion permit, and empowering the superintendent of building inspection to \u201cinstitute a civil proceeding for injunctive relief\u2019 in response to \u201cany action unlawful under this Chapter.\u201d (Ord. \u00a7 41.16, subds. (a)(1) &amp; (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-5\">Plaintiffs contend that these provisions bring the City\u2019s complaint within the rationale of <em>AIU Ins. Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 807 [274 Cal.Rptr. 820, 799 P.2d 1253] <em>(AIU), </em>where the Supreme Court held that comprehensive general liability policies, materially similar to those at issue here, could be reasonably understood to cover toxic cleanup costs imposed in litigation under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601 et seq.) and related state and federal laws. The City\u2019s claim against plaintiffs, however, differs in several critical respects from those before the court in <em>AIU.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1203-6\">The insured in <em>AIU </em>sought to establish coverage with respect to a number of suits by public agencies alleging that the insured was responsible for the contamination of certain waste disposal sites. The agencies sought injunctions to prevent further contamination and to require the cleanup of contamination already caused, plus \u201creimbursement of [the agencies\u2019] costs of investigating, monitoring, and initiating cleanup of hazardous waste for which [the insured] allegedly is responsible.\u201d <em>(AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 816.) The Supreme Court concluded that the monetary reimbursement sought by the agencies (\u201cresponse costs\u201d) could fall within the reasonable expectations of an insured as to what constitutes \u201cdamages.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 833, 837.) The court further held that cleanup costs incurred by an insured under compulsion of an injunction could also be covered, primarily because they appeared to be the functional equivalent of reimbursing publicly incurred costs, and an insured would not expect coverage to depend on the prosecuting agency\u2019s fortuitous choice of remedies. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 838-841.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-7\">In seeking to apply this holding to the present case, plaintiffs focus almost exclusively on the supposed \u201cmitigative\u201d nature of the remedy at issue in <em>AIU, </em>arguing that the City\u2019s action exposed them to similar \u201cmitigative\u201d measures. Quoting our own opinion in <em>Bullock I, </em>plaintiffs assert that section 41.10 operates to \u201cmitigate[] the adverse impact on the persons who will be displaced by plaintiff\u2019s conversion\u201d <em>(Bullock I, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d at p. 1101), and that their exposure to the imposition of such \u201cmitigation costs\u201d makes the City\u2019s suit indistinguishable from the actions considered in <em>AIU. </em>We reject this contention, first because plaintiffs have failed to allege, and apparently cannot allege, that they were in danger of being \u201clegally obligated\u201d to incur the \u201cmitigation\u201d expenses in question, and second because those expenses are not comparable to the remedies held in <em>AIU </em>to be the equivalent of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1442\">*1442</page-number>B. <em>\u201cLegally Obligated to Pay.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1204-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 exclusive emphasis on the supposed \u201cmitigative\u201d character of the expenses at issue overlooks a critical part of the <em>AIU </em>analysis. The court there declared that the question of coverage turned on three subsidiary questions: (1) whether an adverse order in the underlying suits would \u201c \u2018legally obligate\u2019 [the insured] to pay\u201d cleanup costs; (2) whether the costs would \u201cconstitute \u2018damages\u2019 \u201d under the terms of the policies, and (3) whether the costs would be \u201cincurred because of \u2018property damage.\u2019 \u201d <em>(AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 818.) \u201cOnly if all three conditions are fulfilled,\u201d the court wrote, \u201cwill the insurers\u2019 duty to provide coverage arise under the policies.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em> In other words, it is not enough that a claimant seeks to exact by some means a payment that might serve the function of \u201cdamages.\u201d The lawsuit must expose the insured to the possibility of being \u201clegally obligated\u201d to make such payments. In <em>AIU </em>this obligation was in little doubt; the underlying suits expressly sought judgments or court orders compelling the insured to pay or incur the expenses at issue. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 824.) The only point of controversy was whether the phrase \u201clegally obligated\u201d extended to payments compelled by <em>equitable </em>remedies, such as injunctive or specific relief, as distinguished from the quintessentially <em>legal </em>remedy of a judgment for damages. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Not surprisingly, the court found the law-equity distinction inadequate to defeat coverage. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 825.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-5\">Here the insureds face a difficulty not present in <em>AIU, </em>because it does not appear that an order obligating plaintiffs to pay or incur \u201cmitigation\u201d costs either was sought, or could have been made. Apart from some correspondence outside the complaint, which we discuss below, plaintiffs have offered no reason to suspect that the City ever contemplated seeking a judgment requiring plaintiffs to comply with section 41.10. So far as the pleadings and the terms of the Ordinance show, the City lacked the authority to obtain such relief, and made no attempt to seek it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-6\">Nothing in the City\u2019s complaint suggests the possibility of an order compelling compliance with section 41.10. The City did not pray for an award of \u201cin lieu fees\u201d; nor did it seek an injunction compelling plaintiffs to construct, acquire, or otherwise provide substitute housing, as contemplated by section 41.10. Instead the City prayed for (1) injunctions <em>prohibiting violations </em>of the Ordinance and abating the public nuisances allegedly arising from those violations, (2) appointment of a receiver, and (3) civil penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1204-7\">Nor does it appear that the Ordinance authorized the City to seek, or a court to issue, the mandatory \u201cmitigative\u201d relief on which plaintiffs\u2019 argument depends. The Ordinance specifically authorized City officials to (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1443\">*1443</page-number>recover \u201ccivil penalties\u201d in specified amounts for such infractions as \u201cinsufficient filing\u201d or failing to post and submit certain required reports (Ord., \u00a7\u00a7 41.7, subds. (d) &amp; (e), 41.8, subd. (d)); (2) recover a \u201ccivil penalty\u201d for \u201cunlawful conversion,\u201d consisting of \u201cthree . . . times the daily rate per day,\u201d not to exceed $5,000 (Ord. \u00a7 41.16, subd. (c)); and (3) obtain \u201cinjunctive relief,\u201d implicitly against \u201cany action unlawful under this Chapter\u201d (Ord., \u00a7 41.16, subd. (e)). In addition, the Ordinance provided that any \u201cpermanent resident injured by any action unlawful under this Chapter\u201d could bring an action for \u201cinjunctive relief <em>and </em>damages.\u201d (Ord., \u00a7 41.16, subd. (e), italics added.) The Ordinance did not authorize the <em>City </em>to recover damages of any kind, and it did not authorize <em>anyone </em>to obtain <em>any </em>kind of relief mandating compliance with section 41.10. The specific enumeration of some remedies while not mentioning others strongly implies that the excluded forms of relief are not in fact available. (See <em>Dyna-Med, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379, 1390-1391 [241 Cal.Rptr. 67, 743 P.2d 1323] [applying maxim <em>expressio unius exclusio alterius est, </em>i.e., to express one thing is to exclude another].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-5\">Section 41.10 itself contains no remedial terms; it provides for no relief in the legal sense at all. Rather it prescribes conditions under which a permit may be issued. The only apparent effect of failure to satisfy these conditions is that no permit will issue, and the owner will be prohibited by the Ordinance from engaging in the regulated conduct\u2014most notably, renting residential rooms to nonresidential occupants. An owner subject to the permit requirement may choose either to comply with the condition, refrain from the regulated conduct, or (as plaintiffs did) engage in the regulated conduct <em>without </em>a permit, thereby violating the Ordinance. In none of these situations does that person become \u201clegally obligated to pay\u201d the costs of complying with section 41.10. He or she remains <em>legally </em>free not to pay them. Section 41.10 imposes on hotel owners no \u201clegal[] obligation]\u201d whatsoever. By its plain terms it imposes only a <em>condition </em>on a permit required under the Ordinance to engage in specified activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1205-6\">Rather than discuss the actual text of the Ordinance, or its logical effect, plaintiffs cite our opinion in <em>Bullock I </em>for the proposition that \u201c[b]y its complaint, the City sought to compel Dr. Bullock\u2019s compliance with section 41.10.\u201d The short answer to that assertion is that compulsion comes in many forms, only one of which\u2014\u201clegal[] obligation]\u201d\u2014triggers coverage under defendants\u2019 policies. In <em>Bullock I </em>we were concerned only with the validity of the Ordinance insofar as it interfered with plaintiffs\u2019 right under state law to \u201c \u2018go out of [the residential hotel] business.\u2019 \u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 7060, 7060.7, quoted in <em>Bullock I, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.3d at p. 1099.) We held in effect that section 41.10 imposed an undue burden on that right, and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1444\">*1444</page-number>preempted. (221 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1099-1102.) We had no occasion to decide, and did not even contemplate, the distinctions relevant to the issue now before us. Even so, our analysis there is <em>explicitly </em>consistent with those ' distinctions. We wrote that section 41.10 <em>\u201cconditions issuance of a permit to </em>convert... on the owner either furnishing comparable units ... or making a substantial \u2018in lieu\u2019 payment\u201d (221 Cal.App.3d at p. 1099, italics added), and that the City sought to \u201ccondition\u201d plaintiff\u2019s departure from the residential hotel business \u201cupon the payment of ransom\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 1101).</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-4\">Our vivid description of the act contemplated by the condition does nothing to alter the fact that a conditional regulatory imposition simply is not, without more, a <em>legal obligation to pay. </em>The City may well have intended, as plaintiffs asserted below, to coerce compliance with section 41.10 by enjoining Dr. Bullock in his operation of the hotel until he complied with those provisions. Alternatively, the City may have hoped to prevent the removal of plaintiffs\u2019 hotel from the residential housing market. In either case, the City made no apparent effort to legally obligate plaintiffs to pay the expenses or undertake the acts described in section 41.10. The coercive tool employed\u2014and the only tool the Ordinance appeared to provide\u2014was a traditional prohibitory injunction barring plaintiffs, on pain of contempt, from continuing to rent rooms to nonresidents without a permit. Such an injunction would not become the equivalent of \u201cdamages\u201d merely because it would compel plaintiffs to choose, on pain of contempt, between complying with the conditions of a permit and refraining from conduct requiring a permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-5\">We are satisfied that neither the City\u2019s complaint nor the terms of the Ordinance suggest any potential for making plaintiffs \u201clegally obligated to pay\u201d the costs contemplated by section 41.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-6\">C. <em>The 1989 Letters.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1206-7\">Plaintiffs contend somewhat obliquely that whether or not the City was entitled to <em>obtain </em>a judgment compelling compliance with section 41.10, the City <em>sought </em>such a judgment, or threatened to do so, thereby triggering a duty to defend. This suggestion tacitly invokes the principle that a liability insurer \u201cmay not decline to defend a suit merely because it is devoid of merit.\u201d <em>(Montrose Chemical Corp. v. Superior Court </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 287, 298 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 467, 861 P.2d 1153].) However, the principle does not apply here because the City in fact never asserted the meritless claim in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1206-8\">As evidence to the contrary, plaintiffs refer to letters and a notice they apparently received from City officials in April 1989. These documents were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1445\">*1445</page-number>offered below in support of plaintiffs\u2019 request for leave to amend the complaint. They are cited here as evidence that \u201c[t]he City . . . had determined that Dr. Bullock had already converted the units, and therefore was no longer able to comply with the Residential Hotel Ordinance other than by payment of the mitigation payments.\u201d This statement apparently asks us to infer that when the letters were written, the City contemplated seeking an injunction to compel such compliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-5\">The 1989 letters are far from a direct threat to pursue any such claim. At most they suggest a tentative positioning by City officials and attorneys as a possible move toward such a strategy. We seriously doubt that correspondence outside the pleadings which merely hints at a possible litigation strategy\u2014one never actually pursued\u2014is sufficient to establish a duty to defend an otherwise noncovered lawsuit. In <em>Foster-Gardner, Inc. v. National Union Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 857 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 107, 959 P.2d 265] (Foster-Gardner), the court held that notices from environmental agencies requiring an insured to undertake cleanup measures did not trigger coverage under liability policies in which the insurer undertook to defend any \u201csuit\u201d against the insured. The policies before us all likewise refer to the defendants\u2019 undertakings to defend \u201csuit[s]\u201d against plaintiffs. If a formal notice directly imposing legal burdens on the insured under applicable law is insufficient to trigger liability insurance coverage, we fail to see how the mere unexecuted threat to pursue a potentially covered legal remedy can have a greater effect. (See <em>id. </em>at pp. 878-879 [discussing meaning of terms \u201csuit\u201d and \u201cclaim\u201d in context of liability policies].) Here of course a \u201csuit\u201d was filed, but not one asserting the claims to which plaintiffs allude. The duty to defend generally depends upon the allegations of the complaint in the underlying action. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 880.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-6\">We need not ultimately decide whether a threat to compel compliance with section 41.10 would effectively enlarge the allegations of the City\u2019s complaint, for coverage purposes, because\u2014as we discuss immediately below\u2014the costs contemplated by that section are not equivalent to those at issue in <em>AIU </em>and could not be reasonably understood as \u201cdamages\u201d under the rationale of that case. Thus even if the City had explicitly prayed for an order requiring plaintiffs to comply with section 41.10 by providing replacement housing or paying \u201cin lieu\u201d fees, that claim would not have triggered a duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-7\">D. <em>Compliance Costs as \u201cDamages.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1207-8\">The essential reason coverage was found in <em>AIU </em>is that the government agency claimants sought to compel the insured to pay or incur costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1446\">*1446</page-number>that served the same function as traditional damages in that they compensated for, or sought to alleviate, harm caused by <em>past conduct. </em>The court carefully limited its holding to cleanup expenses and \u201cresponse costs\u201d incurred <em>after </em>a \u201crelease of hazardous waste.\u201d (51 Cal.3d at p. 833.) The court explicitly withheld coverage for \u201cprophylactic costs . . . incurred to pay for measures taken in advance of any release of hazardous waste\u201d <em>{id. </em>at p. 843), elsewhere writing, \u201cBecause the third party suits here . . . rest on allegations of <em>past and present damage </em>to land and water on and surrounding hazardous waste sites, they concern reimbursement not for prophylactic purposes, but rather for <em>remedial and mitigative </em>actions.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 832-833, italics added.) The court was careful to say that its holding did not extend to, and no duty to defend arose under, \u201cgovernment regulations or court orders requiring businesses such as [the insured] to undertake purely prophylactic measures designed to prevent future discharges of hazardous waste.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 832; see <em>id. </em>at p. 833, fn. 13; see also <em>Foster-Gardner, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th 857, 878.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-4\">This distinction between remedial and prophylactic measures is fatal to plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to bring costs incurred in complying with section 41.10 within the rationale of <em>AIU. </em>The expenses described in section 41.10 are not intended to make anyone whole for, or compensate for the damaging effects of, past conduct. They are intended to avert the <em>future </em>loss of housing units that <em>will </em>result from the conversion of residential hotel rooms to nonresidential use. In this sense they are prospective only, and are thus the functional equivalent of traditional injunctive remedies, not compensatory damages. (See <em>Cutler-Orosi Unified School Dist. v. Tulare County School etc. Authority </em>(1994) 31 Cal.App.4th 617, 629 [37 Cal.Rptr.2d 106] <em>(Cutler-Orosi Unified School Dist.) </em>[No duty to defend action to enforce federal voting rights act; \u201cthe equitable declaratory and injunctive remedies authorized by the Voting Rights Act as a means of enforcing its proscriptions are not the \u2018functional equivalent\u2019 of a form of monetary indemnification or recoupment which may be classified as \u2018damages.\u2019 Rather, such equitable remedies retain their traditional character as prospective and essentially prophylactic methods of preventing the future reoccurrence of past illegal actions.\u201d]; <em>Aerojet-General Corp. </em>v. <em>Transport Indemnity Co. </em>(1997) 17 Cal.4th 38, 56 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 118, 948 P.2d 909] <em>(Aerojet-General) </em>[Describing <em>AIU </em>as holding that duty to indemnify \u201cis not narrowly confined to money that the insured must give under law as <em>compensation </em>to third parties, but may also include money that the insured must itself expend in equity in order to provide <em>relief of the same sort.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-5\">Here an order compelling plaintiffs to provide replacement housing or pay in-lieu fees under section 41.10 would not compensate anyone for harm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1447\">*1447</page-number>already inflicted, e.g., by prior violations of the Ordinance. Its sole function would be to avert <em>future </em>harm from the <em>future </em>displacement of residents. Residents already displaced in violation of the Ordinance would receive nothing from plaintiffs\u2019 compliance with section 41.10. Their only means of redress would be to maintain their own causes of action for damages. Thus, while an order compelling compliance with section 41.10 might be \u201cmitigative\u201d in some broad societal sense, the mitigation would be prophylactic, not remedial, and thus outside the zone of coverage described in <em>AIU.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1209-5\">Even if plaintiffs\u2019 argument were on sounder precedential footing we are extremely reluctant to extend <em>AIU </em>s rationale to costs incurred as a condition of compliance with a regulatory permit requirement. An insured should not be encouraged to engage in regulated activity while foregoing a required permit, or failing to comply with its conditions, in the hope that the costs of any enforcement proceeding, and perhaps even the costs of compliance, can be shifted to a liability insurer as \u201cmitigative\u201d expenses. Land use regulators commonly condition permits for development on the developer\u2019s acquisition and dedication of property or rights, or the payment of some kind of \u201cmitigation fee.\u201d We do not believe a developer purchases liability insurance in the expectation that his or her insurer will pay for the costs of resisting enforcement of such conditions\u2014let alone of complying with them. To impose such an obligation would not only exceed the bounds of an insured\u2019s reasonable expectations, but would offend public policy by encouraging landowners and others to defy regulations in the expectation that the costs of litigation, if not of compliance, can be shifted, ultimately, to other policyholders. Such a regime goes far beyond anything contemplated by the Supreme Court in <em>AIU. </em>(See <em>Cutler-Orosi Unified School Dist. supra, </em>31 Cal.App.4th 617, 630, review den. [noting \u201csubstantial public policy reasons\u201d not to permit coverage of school districts\u2019 costs to comply with federal voting rights statutes]; <em>Bank of the West v. Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1254, 1267 [10 Cal.Rptr.2d 538, 833 P.2d 545] [\u201ccosts of disgorgement\u201d under restitution order pursuant to Unfair Business Practices Act, Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17203, are not damages covered under liability insurance policy; alternative rule would mean that \u201ca person found to have violated the act would simply shift the loss to his insurer and, in effect, retain the proceeds of his unlawful conduct\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1209-6\">Plaintiffs cite <em>Vandenberg v. Superior Court </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 815 [88 Cal.Rptr.2d 366, 982 P.2d 229], as \u201cadditional conclusive authority that warrants determining this appeal in [plaintiffs\u2019] favor.\u201d We see nothing of particular relevance in that case, which holds that damages for breach of contract can, depending on circumstances, fall within the coverage provisions of a comprehensive general liability policy. Plaintiffs contend that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1448\">*1448</page-number>case confirms their functional approach to the question of what constitutes damages. As we have seen, however, such an approach does not help them. Even if the City had explicitly sued for an order compelling plaintiffs to comply with section 41.10, the mitigation contemplated by such an order would not be the functional equivalent of damages, would not fall within the rationale of AIU, and would not have placed defendants under a duty to defend the City\u2019s lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-5\">\n<em>Penalties.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-6\">Plaintiffs also argue that the City\u2019s prayer for civil penalties triggered a duty to defend. They cite a provision of the Ordinance stating that \u201cproceeds from the filing fees and civil fines assessed shall be used exclusively to cover the costs of investigation and enforcement of this ordinance.\" (Ord., \u00a7 41.8, subd. (e).) From this they argue that the penalties were \u201cdamages\u201d under <em>AIU </em>because they would compensate the City for an injury to the \u201cpublic fisc.\u201d <em>(See AIU, supra, </em>51 Cal.3d at p. 829.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-7\">The decision in <em>AIU </em>does not stand for the proposition that whenever a public agency seeks to recoup costs of enforcement, a judicial award embodying such recoupment constitutes damages for purposes of typical liability policies. To adopt such a blanket rule would result in an enormous private subsidy to finance regulatory enforcement litigation and would encourage, at least indirectly, noncompliance with all manner of regulation. The role of the \u201charm to public fisc\u201d rationale in <em>AIU\u2019s </em>overall reasoning is not entirely clear, but we are confident that the court did not intend to bring all government efforts to recoup enforcement costs within the coverage of comprehensive general liability policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-8\">In any event, we need not here determine the scope and effect of the \u201charm to public fisc\u201d rationale because it surely cannot establish coverage of <em>penalties. </em>The court in <em>AIU </em>emphasized that the awards and expenditures at issue there were not punitive. (51 Cal.3d at p. 836.) The same cannot be said of the sums at issue here, which both the Ordinance and the City\u2019s complaint expressly describe as \u201cpenalties.\u201d Given that characterization and the absence of any attempt by plaintiffs to detract from its plain meaning and effect, public policy would not permit defendants to insure those sums.

Code, \u00a7 533.5 [\u201c \u2018No policy of insurance shall provide, or be construed to provide, any coverage or indemnity for the payment of any fine, penalty, or restitution in any civil or criminal action or proceeding brought by the Attorney General, any district attorney, or any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1449\">*1449</page-number>city prosecutor . . . .\u2019 \u201d] and Stats. 1988, ch. 489, \u00a7 3, p. 1897 [\u201cstating that section 533.5 \u2018does not constitute a change in, but is declaratory of, the existing law\u2019 \u201d]; see also Ins.
