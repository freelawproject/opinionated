With respect to appellant, we reverse the orders under review, to the extent they apply to appellant\u2019s four biological children, for lack of personal jurisdiction. We remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The dependent minors are appellant\u2019s stepdaughter, Arlyne A. (born in 1989), and appellant\u2019s biological children, Marcus (born in 1993), Alfred (born in 1994), Daniel (born in 1995), and Alyssia (born in 1998). The minors\u2019 biological mother, Ramona A., is not a party to her husband\u2019s appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">About June 1998, Arlyne reported that appellant had been sexually molesting her for several years. At the time, appellant and Ramona were separated. Ramona was then living with all of the minors, at their maternal grandmother\u2019s (Elena M.) house in El Monte. Appellant was then living with his parents in Rialto.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Ramona reported Arlyne\u2019s sexual molestation allegations to the Temple substation of the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department. The sheriff\u2019s department transferred the report to the Colton Police Department for investigation. (Before their separation, Ramona, appellant, and minors were living on Meadow Lane in Colton, where the alleged sexual abuse occurred.) The police report correctly listed appellant\u2019s home address and phone number as that of his parents\u2019 home in Rialto. It also listed his (apparently correct) business address and telephone number in Ontario.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">The district attorney declined to press charges against appellant. The Department filed a dependency petition regarding the sexual molestation allegations, but closed the case after determining that appellant was not living at Elena\u2019s home, and that Arlyne was receiving sexual abuse counseling.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">About September 1998, Ramona and her children, with the exception of Arlyne, moved to Rialto. Ramona did not give Arlyne or Elena her new address. Ramona abandoned Arlyne with Elena without making any provisions for her support or medical care. As a result of this abandonment, the Department reopened Arlyne\u2019s dependency case in October 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>On November 4, 1998, the Department filed a dependency petition (amended in January 1999) regarding all five minors. The petition alleged among other things that appellant had: (1) regularly physically abused all of the minors; (2) sexually abused Arlyne for several years, thereby placing the other minors at risk of similar sexual abuse; (3) physically assaulted Ramona in the minors\u2019 presence; and (4) acquired convictions for weapons violations and spousal abuse. The petition listed appellant\u2019s last known address as the family\u2019s former Meadow Lane address in Colton. The petition listed as unknown the whereabouts of Ramona and the four minors in her custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">At the November 5, 1998, detention hearing, the trial court ordered the Department to provide due diligence reports regarding its efforts to locate appellant and Ramona. Arlyne\u2019s attorney, Ms. Padilla, stated that according to Elena, \u201cthe mother [Ramona] may be with her in-laws in [either] Colton or . . . Rialto, California, and that the [other four] minors are with her.\u201d Based on this statement, the court ordered the Department \u201cto investigate the whereabouts of the minors. The grandmother has information that could lead to their whereabouts.\u201d The court ordered all of the minors detained.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Before the next hearing, the Department filed \u201cDeclaration[s] Regarding Due Diligence,\u201d dated January 27, 1999. Regarding Ramona, the Department reported that a Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) check had turned up her last known address in Colton, but there was no telephone listing for her in Colton. As for appellant, the Department reported that a DMV check had turned up a Fontana address from 1994, but there was no telephone listing for appellant in Fontana. (The Department sent notices to appellant at the Fontana address.) As for both Ramona and appellant, the Department stated (despite Elena\u2019s statement that appellant\u2019s parents lived in either Colton or Rialto) there were, \u201cNo other known area[]s of possible residence.\u201d The Department also stated, \u201cMaternal grandmother [Elena] does not know [appellant\u2019s] whereabouts.\u201d \u201cNeither minor [Arlyne] nor maternal grandmother [Elena] know[s] the whereabouts of the minor\u2019s mother.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">On January 28, 1999, the trial court found the Department had demonstrated due diligence in attempting to locate appellant, but not Ramona. Elena, who was present at the hearing, stated: \u201cYou know, ... the police department in Colton knows where the father works. I don\u2019t see why they can\u2019t just follow him home and try to see where they are at. She told me that she is in walking distance from the in-laws\u2019 house, and I know the police department has the address of the in-laws\u2019 house.\u201d The following colloquy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>transpired: \u201cThe Court: You need to talk to the social worker about that. HQ The Maternal Grandmother: I\u2019ve told them. [^] The Court: Well, the social worker is ordered to follow through on the information that the maternal grandmother has on the whereabouts of the parents. They are to address that in the supplemental report, ffl] The Court Officer: Your Honor, I did interview the grandmother. I talked to the D.I. She just knows around the area, ftl] The Court: She stated that the police department does know their whereabouts and wants you to contact the police station near that home, ffl] The Maternal Grandmother: When they ma[d]e the police report on the child molestation, my daughter was still living with me, and I heard her give his address, his Social Security number, his work address, and everything to the police department. So it\u2019s on the police report. [^] The Court: Okay. If they are still there. But they need to investigate that.\u201d The trial court continued the matter to allow the Department time to provide notice to Ramona. The January 28, 1999, minute order stated in relevant part: \u201cC[hildren\u2019s] Services] W[orker] is to follow thr[ough] on information provided by Maternal] Grandmother] re: parents[\u2019] whereabouts.\u201d (Some capitalization omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The matter was continued to April 8, 1999, for a pretrial resolution conference. Before that hearing, the Department filed a children\u2019s services worker\u2019s (CSW) report and two more \u201cDeclaration^] Regarding Due Diligence,\u201d dated April 7, 1999. The April due diligence declarations provided no new information concerning appellant\u2019s or Ramona\u2019s whereabouts. The CSW\u2019s report stated that the parents\u2019 and their four minors\u2019 whereabouts remained unknown. Regarding Elena\u2019s information that the police report contained appellant\u2019s address, the CSW stated: \u201cThis writer has spoken with Detective Reed at the Colton Police Department. She informed this writer that she is not aware of the whereabouts of the mother and minors Marcos, Alfred, Daniel, and Alyssia. fl[] The maternal grandmother, Elena M[.], states that the mother and children live within walking distance of [appellant\u2019s] parents\u2019 home. She is not aware of the mother\u2019s address or the telephone number of the [paternal] grandparents. In addition, she stated that the Los Angeles Sheriff\u2019s Department (Temple Station) took a report on 5/30/98 and listed the address of the [paternal] grandparents in that report. However, when I called the Temple Station, there was no record of this report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">At the April 8, 1999, hearing, the trial court found that the Department had demonstrated due diligence in attempting to locate both appellant and Ramona. The court declared the minors to be dependent minors under Welfare and Institutions Code section 300, subdivisions (a), (b), (d), (g), and (j). As for Arlyne, the court set a permanent plan hearing in November. As for the other four minors, the court would conduct a disposition hearing on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>In late April or early May 1999, a CSW finally made contact with Ramona. After obtaining Ramona\u2019s address, the CSW took the other four minors into protective custody on May 4, 1999. All of the minors were placed with Elena.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">On May 7, 1999, both Ramona and appellant appeared in court for a detention hearing. Appellant orally moved to set aside the jurisdictional and due diligence findings, and was directed to file a written notice of motion and motion. The court set a disposition hearing for July 2, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">In June 1999, appellant filed a written motion to set aside the adjudication findings. Appellant\u2019s motion was set to be heard at the July 2, 1999, disposition hearing. Ramona filed a notice of joinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Appellant\u2019s motion alleged the Department could have located him at his parents\u2019 Rialto address by simply consulting its own records. The motion stated: \u201cthe department knew or should have known of father\u2019s address since the Department had previously investigated this matter during the period of July through October 1998, and closed this case. HQ . . . Father contends that the notice is defective and that the Department knew, or should have known the father\u2019s mailing address in Rialto, California, since the Department had contact with him back in the summer of 1998, which is the current address of father.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">The Department opposed the motion, contending neither appellant nor Ramona had supplied evidence to support their contention that the Department knew or should have known of appellant\u2019s parents\u2019 Rialto address. The Department pointed out: \u201cThe father\u2019s declaration states that he had been living with his father in Rialto from some time in April 1998 but does not indicate that the Department was aware of this fact. Father\u2019s counsel, in the memorandum of Points and Authorities, asserts that the Mother had informed Mr. Harris [of the Department] that the father was living with his father in Rialto. However, it is interesting to note that the mother, in her own declaration, does not make this assertion. The mother merely states that she and her husband separated in April 1998 but neither states where the father moved to nor whether she was aware of his address.\u201d The Department submitted the declaration of CSW Stacy Phan, who stated that she was unaware of the parents\u2019 whereabouts until she finally spoke with Ramona in late April 1999. The Department also submitted letters from Arlyne\u2019s therapist, Dr. Toni Cavanagh Johnson, regarding the unsuccessful efforts the therapist had made to locate Ramona.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">The trial court continued appellant\u2019s motion several times, to allow him to obtain the Department\u2019s records of the prior case to support his assertion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>the Department knew, or should have known, his parents\u2019 Rialto address. (It is undisputed that the records eventually obtained from the Department failed to reveal that the Department was aware of appellant\u2019s parents\u2019 address in Rialto.) At an interim hearing on August 6, 1999, the trial court asked appellant\u2019s counsel if there was any evidence showing the Department knew to look for appellant in Rialto. The trial court noted the Department\u2019s written reports did not indicate that the Department knew appellant\u2019s parents lived in Rialto.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court inquired whether counsel had obtained the police report that allegedly contained the Rialto address. Appellant\u2019s counsel stated he had not: \u201cAnd that has always been my client\u2019s complaint. I\u2019ve tried to get those reports from the Department\u2019s own logs, emergency logs, and I\u2019ve never been able to get those\u2014any report from June of \u201998.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Immediately before the final November 5, 1999, hearing on appellant\u2019s motion, the Department finally obtained the police report from the Colton Police Department, and submitted it to the trial court. The police report, as Elena had stated it would, correctly listed appellant\u2019s address as that of his parents\u2019 home in Rialto.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">On November 5, 1999, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion to set aside the adjudication findings for lack of due diligence. The court found that as for Ramona, the police report did not show her current address. As for appellant, the court found that even if the police report \u201cwas written in November [1998, in time for the January 27, 1999, dependency hearing], I don\u2019t believe that this Department had any way of knowing any other whereabouts of these parents, and I don\u2019t believe that they\u2019re remiss in their notice obligations. And, in fact, Mother\u2019s due diligence was repeated for completion. You can\u2019t disappear, not tell anyone where you go, and then complain when they can\u2019t find you. All right? That\u2019s the bottom line.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Appellant appeals from the orders: (1) adjudicating minors Marcus, Alfred, Daniel, and Alyssia to be dependent minors as described by Welfare and Institutions Code section 300; (2) denying his motion to set aside the adjudication order for lack of due diligence; and (3) declaring the four minors to be dependents of the juvenile court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Appellant contends the Department failed to exercise due diligence because his parents\u2019 Rialto address was readily available through: (1) the police report from the Colton Police Department, which Elena had accurately stated would contain appellant\u2019s current home and work addresses; and (2) directory assistance information for the City of Rialto. Appellant points out that the Department was aware, as early as the November 5, 1998, detention hearing, that his parents lived in either Colton or Rialto. (We note that appellant and his father share the same first and last names.)</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">The \u201cinterest of a parent in the companionship, care, custody, and management of his children is a compelling one, ranked among the most basic of civil rights [citations] [.] [T]he state, before depriving a parent of this interest, must afford him adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re B. G. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 679, 688-689 [114 Cal.Rptr. 444, 523 P.2d 244].) \u201cThe means employed to give notice \u2018must be such as one, desirous of actually informing the absentee, might reasonably adopt to accomplish it.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Antonio F. </em>(1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 440, 450 [144 Cal.Rptr. 466].) \u201cThe term \u2018reasonable diligence\u2019 as used to justify service by publication \u2018denotes a thorough, systematic investigation and inquiry conducted in good faith . . . .\u2019 [Citation.] Where the party conducting the investigation ignores the most likely means of finding the defendant, the service is invalid even if the affidavit of diligence is sufficient. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(David B. v. Superior Court </em>(1994) 21 Cal.App.4th 1010, 1016 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 586].)</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">In <em>David B. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>21 Cal.App.4th 1010, the appellate court concluded the children\u2019s services department\u2019s efforts to locate the father in a dependency proceeding were insufficient. In <em>David B., </em>the child\u2019s birth certificate listed both the father\u2019s name and \u201cthe fact that he was in the United States Marines. [The department] failed to take the one step which patently appeared to hold the most promise of locating [the father]\u2014an inquiry addressed to that organization. That such an inquiry would have been fruitful is evidenced by the fact that the district attorney was able to find [the father\u2019s] address by the time the child was three months old.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1016.)</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">In this case, the Department filed declarations of due diligence that, in and of themselves, demonstrated a reasonable degree of diligence in trying to locate appellant. The record, however, plainly demonstrates that the Department <em>ignored </em>the more timely information supplied by both Arlyne\u2019s attorney and Elena that appellant\u2019s parents were living in Rialto. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Department failed to take the simple and most direct step of calling directory assistance to find the parents\u2019 number in Rialto. Instead, the Department unreasonably limited its directory assistance search to Fontana, based on the DMY\u2019s <em>1994 </em>address for appellant, which <em>was five years old. </em>The unreasonableness of the Department\u2019s reliance on the stale Fontana address is amply demonstrated by the fact that the Department <em>knew </em>appellant\u2019s last known address was on Meadow Lane in Colton. Despite that knowledge, the Department purported to notify appellant by sending the hearing notices to the old Fontana address.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">In addition, the Department failed to thoroughly and systematically investigate Elena\u2019s tip regarding the Colton Police Department. Elena stated that the Colton Police Department knew appellant\u2019s home and work addresses because they were listed on the police report. Although the trial court directed the Department to investigate that information, the Department again failed to make a sufficiently thorough inquiry. While the CSW tried, unsuccessfully, to obtain the police report from the Los Angeles Sheriff\u2019s Department (Temple Station), the CSW neglected the next reasonable step of seeking a copy of the report from the Colton Police Department, the actual investigating agency. Instead, the CSW merely asked a Colton detective if she knew of Ramona\u2019s whereabouts. There is nothing in the record to indicate the CSW asked the detective for the police report. It was not until after the trial court specifically asked about the police report at the August 6, 1999, hearing that the Department finally obtained the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">In this case, as in <em>David B. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>21 Cal.App.4th at page 1016, \u201cWhere the party conducting the investigation ignores the most likely means of finding the defendant, the service is invalid even if the affidavit of diligence is sufficient. [Citations.]\u201d Although the Department searched the standard avenues available to help locate a missing parent, it failed to search the specific ones most likely, under the unique facts known to the Department, to yield appellant\u2019s address. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s finding of reasonable diligence is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">Due to a lack of personal jurisdiction over appellant, with respect to appellant only, we reverse the following orders to the extent they apply to Marcus, Alfred, Daniel, and Alyssia: (1) adjudicating the minors to be dependent minors as described by Welfare and Institutions Code section 300; (2) denying appellant\u2019s motion to set aside the adjudication order for lack of due diligence; and (3) declaring the minors to be dependents of the juvenile court. Regarding the four minors named above, we direct the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>court to start over with the dependency proceedings after providing appellant with proper notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Spencer, P.
