Appellants paid product liability claims which would have been paid by two insurance carriers, now insolvent, of a predecessor company. We review the trial court\u2019s decision de novo <em>{Hunter v. Pacific Mechanical Corp. </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1282, 1285 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 335]; <em>Iverson v. Muroc Unified School Dist. </em>(1995) 32 Cal.App.4th 218, 222 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 35]) and conclude that it properly granted summary judgment to CIGA.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">Between 1971 and 1984, American Hospital Supply Company (AHSC) manufactured silicone breast implants. In each of those years, AHSC purchased between $75 million and $135 million of general liability insurance to cover product liability claims. AHSC purchased excess insurance from Transit Casualty Company (Transit) and Midland Insurance Company (Midland) during this period. Named insureds under the Transit and Midland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>policies included AHSC and its subsidiary, associated or affiliated companies, or owned and controlled companies \u201cas now or hereafter constituted</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">In March 1984, AHSC sold its breast implant business to Mentor Corporation while retaining responsibility for product liability claims before the closing date of the sale. Baxter Travenol Laboratories, Inc. (Baxter Travenol), later purchased all of the stock of AHSC. On November 25, 1984, AHSC merged into and was absorbed by Baxter Travenol. Baxter Travenol was the surviving corporation after the merger. On the same day, Baxter Travenol signed a document entitled \u201cAssignment and Assumption\u201d that transferred to Baxter Acquisition Sub., Inc. (BASI) substantially all of the assets formerly owned by AHSC. The Assignment and Assumption stated that the transfer would be \u201c[effective simultaneously\u201d with the merger between AHSC and Baxter Travenol. Also on the same date, BASI changed its name to American Hospital Supply Corporation (AHSCORP).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">In December 1986, AHSCORP merged into Travenol Laboratories, Inc., which then changed its name to appellant Baxter Healthcare Corporation (BHC). Eight months later, Baxter Travenol changed its name and became Baxter International, Inc. (BII).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">Because they had acquired AHSC, BII and BHC were named as defendants in thousands of product liability lawsuits concerning silicone breast implants. In 1994, appellants filed this coverage action against the insurance carriers that sold excess liability insurance policies to AHSC between 1972 and 1984. Prior to the filing of the coverage action, Transit and Midland had been declared insolvent. CIGA was joined as a defendant in their place.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">\n<em>The Guarantee Act</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">Every liability insurer, as a condition of its authorization to conduct business in California, is a member of CIGA. (Ins. Code, \u00a7 1063.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cThe statutory duty of CIGA is to provide for each member insolvency insurance to pay some (but not all) claims arising out of an insurance policy of an insolvent insurer.\u201d <em>(,Interstate Fire &amp; Casualty Ins. Co. v. California Ins. Guarantee Assn. </em>(1981) 125 Cal.App.3d 904, 908 [178 Cal.Rptr. 673].)</p>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">CIGA is not an insurance company and its duties are not co-extensive with the insolvent insurer\u2019s obligations under its policies. <em>(Walters </em>v. <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn. </em>(1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 1187, 1192-1993 [281 Cal.Rptr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>291].) Instead, CIGA \u201cis a statutory entity that depends on the Guarantee Act for its existence and for a definition of the scope of its powers, duties, and protections.\u201d <em>(Isaacson </em>v. <em>California Ins. Guarantee Assn. </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 775, 786 [244 Cal.Rptr. 655, 750 P.2d 297].) Its authority is limited to the payment of \u201ccovered claims\u201d as that term is defined by the Guarantee Act. <em>{Industrial Indemnity Co. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 548, 556-557 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 295].) \u201c \u2018Covered claims\u2019 do not include all claims that would have been covered by the insurer had it not become insolvent.\u201d <em>{California Ins. Guarantee Assn. v. Superior Court </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 219, 221-222 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 461].)</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">The Guarantee Act, which created CIGA in 1969, requires CIGA to \u201cpay and discharge covered claims and in connection therewith pay for or furnish loss adjustment services and defenses of claimants when required by policy provisions.\u201d (\u00a7 1063.2, subd. (a).) The term \u201ccovered claims\u201d means, \u201cthe obligations of an insolvent insurer, including the obligation for unearned premiums, (i) imposed by law and within the coverage of an insurance policy of the insolvent insurer; (ii) which were unpaid by the insolvent insurer; (iii) which are presented as a claim to the liquidator in this state or to the association on or before the last date fixed for the filing of claims in the domiciliary liquidating proceedings; (iv) which were incurred prior to the date coverage under the policy terminated and prior to, on, or within 30 days after the date the liquidator was appointed; (v) for which the assets of the insolvent insurer are insufficient to discharge in full; (vi) in the case of a policy of workers\u2019 compensation insurance, to provide workers\u2019 compensation benefits under the workers\u2019 compensation law of this state; and (vii) in the case of other classes of insurance if the claimant or insured is a resident of this state at the time of the insured occurrence, or the property from which the claim arises is permanently located in this state.\u201d (\u00a7 1063.1, subd. (c)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Excluded from the definition of \u201ccovered claims\u201d is \u201cany claim by any person other than the original claimant under the insurance policy in his or her own name, . . . and . . . any claim asserted by an assignee . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1063.1, subd. (c)(9)(ii).)</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\n<em>CIGA\u2019S Motion for Summary Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">In its motion for summary judgment CIGA contended, and the trial court agreed, that appellants\u2019 claim was excluded from coverage under section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(9)(ii) because they are not the \u201coriginal claimants, under the insurance policy in his or her own name,\u201d and because they acquired their rights under the AHSC policies by assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Appellants argued their claim was covered because, as a result of the merger, BII had acquired by operation of law all of AHSC\u2019s rights under the Transit and Midland policies, including \u201cCIGA rights.\u201d Appellants relied upon Corporations Code section 1107, subdivision (a) which provides: \u201cUpon merger pursuant to this chapter the separate existence of the disappearing corporations ceases and the surviving corporation shall succeed, without other transfer, to all the rights and property of each of the disappearing corporations and shall be subject to all the debts and liabilities of each in the same manner as if the surviving corporation had itself incurred them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Appellants\u2019 theory was that as a result of merger, AHSC \u201cbecame\u201d BII. It simultaneously transferred to BHC the assets of the former AHSC, including its insurance policies. That transfer, although referred to in the merger documents as an \u201cassignment,\u201d did not trigger the statutory exclusion for claims asserted by an assignee. (\u00a7 1063.1, subd. (c)(9)(h).) First, the transfer accomplished only a distribution of assets among members of the BH corporate family. Second, it did not assign a \u201cmatured claim\u201d for CIGA benefits. Instead, BHC obtained the right to access coverage under AHSC insurance policies, should a claim be made against it in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">\n<em>Contentions on Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">Appellants contend the trial court\u2019s ruling undermines California\u2019s public policy, expressed in Corporations Code section 1107, to allow the surviving corporation in a merger to succeed to all the \u201crights and property\u201d of the disappearing corporation including so-called \u201cCIGA rights.\u201d Appellants assert that because the Guarantee Act does not expressly exclude CIGA coverage for claims asserted by the surviving corporation based on insurance policies owned by the disappearing corporation, they pass by operation of Corporations Code section 1107, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">Appellants claim that because AHSC \u201cbecame\u201d BH through the merger they are entitled to CIGA benefits. In that transaction, BII acquired by operation of law all of AHSC\u2019s interest in the insurance policies, including \u201cCIGA benefits\u201d under the Guarantee Act. (Corp. Code, \u00a7 1107, subd. (a).) AHSC was \u201creconstituted\u201d as BII and then BHC. Appellants contend these transactions are not assignments subject to exclusion under section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(9)(ii) because they transferred rights under insurance policies, not \u201cCIGA rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">CIGA again contends the term \u201coriginal claimant\u201d in section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(9)(ii) is synonymous with \u201coriginal insured\u201d and that appellants are not the original insured under the AHSC policies. Even if AHSC\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>right to CIGA benefits survived the merger with BII, the right was lost when BII assigned the policies to BHC. BII lost the right to make a claim against CIGA because it assigned away its entire interest in the AHSC policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">\n<em>\u201cOriginal Claimant Under the Insurance Policy in His or Her Own Name\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Like the trial court, we conclude that appellants\u2019 claim against CIGA is barred because appellants are not the \u201coriginal claimant[s] under the insurance policy in his or her [or their] own name [or names]\u201d under the AHSC policies. Our inquiry is limited to the question of whether CIGA coverage exists under the Guarantee Act. We need not consider, and do not decide, whether the merger and assignment would affect coverage under the AHSC policies had Transit and Midland remained solvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Appellants contend the \u201coriginal claimant\u201d exclusion does not apply. Instead, appellants contend they are \u201cclaimants\u201d under the definition provided in section 1063.1, subdivision (g): A \u201c[c]laimant [is] any insured making a first party claim or any person instituting a liability claim . . . .\u201d Appellants assert that they are the owners of insurance policies that cover losses incurred in the products liability cases. A claim for insurance policy benefits brought by the owner or beneficiary of the policy is a \u201c \u2018first party\u2019 claim.\u201d <em>(Nowlon v. Koram Ins. Center, Inc. </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 1437, 1443-1444, fn.5 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 683]; <em>Zephyr Park v. Superior Court </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 833, 834 fn. 2 [262 Cal.Rptr. 106].) Appellants are making such a claim and are therefore \u201cclaimants\u201d under section 1063.1, subdivision (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Even if appellants come within the definition of a \u201cclaimant\u201d pursuant to section 1063.1, subdivision (g), they do not survive the legislative choice that they are not \u201coriginal claimants\u201d pursuant to section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(9). Appellants are not the \u201coriginal claimants\u201d under this definition. The policies are not in their names and AHSC, the named insured under the policies, no longer exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">Appellants contend they have \u201cCIGA rights\u201d because the named insured under the policies includes AHSC\u2019s subsidiaries, its associated or affiliated companies, and companies owned and controlled by AHSC \u201cas now or hereafter constituted . . . .\u201d We disagree for two reasons. First, even if appellants would be entitled to benefits under the policies as AHSC \u201chereafter constituted,\u201d that status does not inexorably entitle them to CIGA benefits. CIGA\u2019s statutory obligations are not co-extensive with the obligations imposed by contract on insolvent insurers. <em>(California Ins. Guarantee Assn. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>64 Cal.App.4th at pp. 221-222.) The Guarantee Act limits CIGA\u2019s liability to claims asserted by an \u201coriginal claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>under the insurance policy in his or her own name.\u201d (\u00a7 1063.1, subd. (c)(9)(ii).) Neither Transit nor Midland issued a policy to appellants in their own names, and the corporation to which policies were issued no longer exists. CIGA\u2019s contention that \u201coriginal claimant\u201d means \u201coriginal insured\u201d is the only rational way to read the phrase, \u201coriginal claimant under the insurance policy in his or her own name.\u201d Any other reading of the statute would do violence to the phrase.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Second, appellants do not fall within the class of named insureds under the policies. The policies cover AHSC and certain entities related to it. BII was briefly the parent corporation of AHSC. Parent corporations are not named insureds under the policies. AHSC then merged into BII and disappeared. (Corp. Code, \u00a7 1107.) BII assigned the AHSC assets to BHC. Again, BII is the parent corporation of BHC and not a named insured under the policies. For similar reasons, BHC is not a named insured. It received an assignment of AHSC\u2019s assets only after AHSC had disappeared by merging into BII. Thus, BHC is not a subsidiary, nor is it owned or controlled by AHSC. It is not an associated or affiliated company of AHSC\u2019s because AHSC did not exist when BHC was created. BHC is a new entity, not AHSC as \u201chereafter constituted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Appellants contend that, if BHC is not AHSC as \u201chereafter constituted,\u201d then BII is. However, if BII became a named insured under the AHSC policies after the merger, it lost that status when it assigned to BHC both the policies and the potential liability for defective AHSC products. That BII was sued along with BHC does not create coverage for BII under policies it no longer holds. <em>(General Accident Ins. Co. v. Superior Court </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1444, 1454 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 781].) Nor does it create a \u201ccovered claim\u201d that CIGA is obligated to pay. (\u00a7 1063.1, subd. (c)(l)(i).)</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">Our result is consistent with <em>Westoil Terminals Co. </em>v. <em>Harbor Ins. Co.. </em>(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 634, 639-640 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 636], which held that a de facto merger passes to the successor entity by operation of law rights under insurance policies held by the predecessor entity. <em>Westoil </em>considered only whether a solvent insurance carrier was required to provide coverage and a defense to the successor of its insured following a de facto merger. No CIGA issue was presented. This case involves a de jure merger where the carriers are insolvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">\n<em>Step Transaction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">Appellants urge us to apply the step transaction doctrine to treat the merger and assignment as a single transaction that resulted in nothing more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>significant than a change in stock ownership and a name change. Based on the \u201c \u201cfamiliar principle that in applying the [tax laws], the substance rather than the form of the transaction is controlling[,]\u201d \u2019 \u201d the step transaction doctrine is used to determine whether a series of transactions ought to be combined into one for tax purposes. <em>(Shuwa Investments Corp. v. County of Los Angeles </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 1635, 1650 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 783].) This doctrine treats as a single transaction a series of purportedly separate \u201cstep\u201d transactions where each step is taken for the purpose of reaching the ultimate result, where the separate steps have no meaning unless the series is completed, or where taking the first step creates a binding commitment to complete the series. <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 1650-1652.)</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">The step transaction doctrine, even if it may be applied in this nontax context, does not assist appellants. Baxter Travenol, the predecessor of BII, could have acquired the assets and operated the business of AHSC without dissolving AHSC or distributing its assets to a newly formed subsidiary corporation. Baxter Travenol was not legally obligated to take these steps, nor were they required for it to obtain the economic benefit of owning AHSC. As a result, the step transaction doctrine does not dictate that these events be treated as a single transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">\n<em>Assignee</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Section 1063.1, subdivision (c)(9)(ii) also excludes from the definition of covered claims, \u201cany claim asserted by an assignee[.]\u201d Appellants contend their claim is not barred by this exclusion because the assignment through which BHC acquired the policies did not transfer a \u201cmatured claim\u201d for CIGA benefits and served only to distribute assets within a single corporate family. We are not persuaded. The Guarantee Act excludes from coverage claims asserted by an assignee. That term is not defined or qualified by the act. It must be read in the context of the entire statute and given the meaning it bears in ordinary usage. <em>(DuBois v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>,(1993) 5 Cal.4th 382, 387-388 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 523, 853 P.2d 978]; <em>Lungren v. Deukmejian </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 727, 735 [248 Cal.Rptr. 115, 755 P.2d 299].)</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">BHC acquired its interest in AHSC\u2019s insurance policies because BII executed a document entitled Assignment and Assumption. This document assigned to BHC the right to claim benefits under the policies. BHC is, therefore, an assignee of rights under the insurance policies. Its claim for CIGA benefits is, therefore, excluded by the plain meaning of the statute. Any other reading of the statute would do violence to the word selected by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>Appellants contend that, despite its unqualified language, the statutory exclusion applies only to the assignment of \u201cmature claims\u201d for CIGA benefits, and not to the assignment of the right to make a claim against an insurance policy. This limitation does not appear in the statute and we may not rewrite the statute to include it. \u201cOur office, of course, \u2018is simply to ascertain and declare\u2019 what is in the relevant statutes, \u2018not to insert what has been omitted, or to omit what has been inserted.\u2019 (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1858.) We are not authorized to insert qualifying provisions not included, and may not rewrite the statute to conform to an assumed intention which does not appear from its language. <em>(Napa Valley Wine Train, Inc. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Com. </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 370, 381 [267 Cal.Rptr. 569, 787 P.2d 976].)\u201d <em>(Stop Youth Addiction, Inc. v. Lucky Stores, Inc. </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 553, 573 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 731, 950 P.2d 1086].)</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The Guarantee Act expressly excludes from the definition of \u201ccovered claims\u201d any claim asserted by an assignee. BHC obtained its interest in the AHSC insurance policies by assignment from BII. The trial court correctly ruled that BHC is not entitled to CIGA benefits, because it is an assignee.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">The judgment is affirmed.
