His parents, plaintiffs Jose and Lupe Silva, filed a wrongful death action. Identified in the complaint as \u201csignificant factors in the death of [the] deceased\u201d were \u201cnegligent operation\u201d of the train and the failure \u201cto maintain fences protecting the public from the train tracks [.sic].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">The heart of Union Pacific\u2019s litigation strategy has been the preemption of state common law liability by virtue of the extensive federal regulation of the railroad industry. The key to that strategy has been to establish that the train that killed Lucas Silva was traveling within a federally authorized speed limit. Union Pacific obtained a summary judgment on the ground that it had established that the train had been operating within that speed limit. That judgment was reversed because the evidentiary showing establishing the speed limit was insufficient. <em>(Silva v. Union Pacific Railroad Co. </em>(Sept. 30, 1997, A076412) [nonpub. opn.].)</p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>When the cause was returned to the superior court and called for trial, both sides made a number of competing in limine motions. The first category of motions concerned whether Union Pacific should or should not be precluded from offering evidence that it had no duty to fence its right-of-way at the accident site. The second category involved motions relating to the preemption issue and ancillary matters such as speed, brakes, and track classification. After hearing extensive argument on the motions, the trial court ruled that Union Pacific had no duty to fence. At the conclusion of an evidentiary hearing the court ruled that Union Pacific had established federal preemption. After plaintiffs advised the court that they were \u201cunable to proceed, solely because of the rulings on [the] motions in limine,\u201d the parties stipulated to a judgment for Union Pacific that would allow plaintiffs to obtain appellate review of those rulings. Following entry of that judgment, plaintiffs perfected this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Review</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 attack on the first ruling\u2014that Union Pacific had no duty to fence off the right-of-way through which Lucas Silva entered upon the tracks\u2014concedes that the issue has previously been decided in favor of railroads, but plaintiffs argue the issue is ripe for reexamination in light of an intervening decision by our Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">Up until 1968 it was generally settled throughout the country that railroads had no duty to fence access to their tracks in order to prevent injury to unauthorized entrants, particularly children. (See, e.g., <em>Holland </em>v. <em>Baltimore &amp; O. R. Co. </em>(App. D.C. 1981) 431 A.2d 597, 603, fn. 11, and decisions cited; Annot., Duty of Railroad to Fence Track as against Children (1922) 16 A.L.R. 944.) California analyzed the issue as one involving attractive nuisance as defined by section 339 of the Restatement of Torts. The leading California decision had this to say: \u201cMany miles of railroad track run on or along streets and roads in California. To fence rights-of-way on public streets would be impractical if not an unlawful obstruction of public thoroughfares. . . . [f] The problem presents other ramifications which must be considered. It seems more reasonable to expect children to play on an open right-of-way running through a residential or a suburban area than on a city street used for vehicular traffic. Thus, were the attractive nuisance doctrine applied in the case of a train traveling on a street, and on those facts alone, it would be equally applicable to trains traversing populated areas. Dwellings flank hundreds of miles of right-of-way in California and the sight of children playing on a right-of-way is not uncommon. To hold that railways <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>must install childproof fences ... in order to prevent children from being attracted to moving trains, would place an unreasonable if not intolerable burden upon the possessor maintaining the condition.\u201d <em>(Joslin v. Southern Pac. Co. </em>(1961) 189 Cal.App.2d 382, 387-388 [11 Cal.Rptr. 267]; accord, <em>Durham v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1979) 91 Cal.App.3d 567, 574 [154 Cal.Rptr. 243]; see also <em>Herrera v. Southern Pacific Ry. Co. </em>(1961) 188 Cal.App.2d 441, 450 [10 Cal.Rptr. 575].)</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\"><em>Rowland v. Christian </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 108 [70 Cal.Rptr. 97, 443 P.2d 561, 32 A.L.R.3d 496] is the celebrated decision abolishing distinctions in the duty of care owed by a landowner to trespassers, licensees, or invitees. \u201cUnder <em>Rowland v. Christian, </em>the liability of a possessor of property to trespassing children is no longer limited by the conditions set out in Restatement Second Torts, \u00a7 339 [citations], or by the terms of other special doctrines and theories created as exceptions to a general rule barring trespassers from recovery for negligence, but is governed by Civil Code, sec[t]ion 1714, which imposes general liability on every person for injuries occasioned to others by want of ordinary care in the management of his property. The status of a claimant at the time of his injury no longer affects the general duty of the possessor of property to exercise ordinary care with respect to reasonable foreseeable risks of personal injury to persons coming on the property. The possessor\u2019s duty of ordinary care extends to invitees and trespassers alike, although the foreseeability of injury, and hence the degree of care required of a possessor, continues to be influenced by the likelihood that persons will be present on the property at a particular time and place, a likelihood normally considerably greater for invitees than for trespassers. [Citation.] The former gradations of degree in the possessor\u2019s duty of care, which varied with the status of persons on the property, have been superseded by a generic duty owed to all persons on the property based on the reasonable foreseeability of harm to them. Under <em>Rowland </em>v. <em>Christian </em>the extent of a possessor\u2019s duty is controlled by the foreseeability of the risk and not by the status of the person injured.\u201d <em>(Beard v. Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. </em>(1970) 4 Cal.App.3d 129, 135-136 [84 Cal.Rptr. 449].)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\"><em>Rowland </em>listed a number of factors to be considered in determining whether to allow an exception to the general principle that a person is liable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>for injury caused by the failure to exercise reasonable care\u2014\u201cthe foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff, the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury, the closeness of the connection between the defendant\u2019s conduct and the injury suffered, the moral blame attached to the defendant\u2019s conduct, the policy of preventing future harm, the extent of the burden to the defendant and consequences to the community of imposing a duty to exercise care with resulting liability for breach, and the availability, cost, and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved.\u201d <em>(.Rowland v. Christian, supra, </em>69 Cal.2d 108, 112-113.)</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">\u201cThe sine qua non of any negligence action is, of course, the existence of a duty of care owed by the alleged wrongdoer to the person injured, or to a class of which he is a member. [Citations.] Although the determination of duty is primarily a question of law, its existence may frequently rest upon the foreseeability of the risk of harm. [Citations.] Foreseeability may be decided as a question of law only if, under the undisputed facts, there is no room for a reasonable difference of opinion.\u201d <em>(Gregorian v. National Convenience Stores, Inc. </em>(1985). 174 Cal.App.3d 944, 948 [220 Cal.Rptr. 302].)  We have found no authority subsequent to <em>Rowland </em>holding that a railroad has no duty as a matter of law to fence its tracks. An unusual complication in our assaying this inquiry is the unusual manner in which the issue comes to us.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Our Supreme Court has decided issues of duty in three contexts: (1) by demurrer, which takes facts as alleged in the complaint (e.g., <em>Ballard v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number><em>Uribe </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 564 [224 Cal.Rptr. 664, 715 P.2d 624]; <em>Hedlund v. Superior Court </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 695 [194 Cal.Rptr. 805, 669 P.2d 41, 41 A.L.R.4th 1063]); (2) on summary judgment granted on the basis of evidentiary showings by the parties (e.g., <em>Kentucky Fried Chicken of Cal., Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1997) 14 Cal.4th 814 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 756, 927 P.2d 1260]; <em>Ann M. </em>v. <em>Pacific Plaza Shopping Center </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 666 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 137, 863 P.2d 207]; <em>Rowland </em>v. <em>Christian, supra, </em>69 Cal.2d 108); or (3) after a full trial (e.g., <em>Weirum v. RKO General, Inc. </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 40 [123 Cal.Rptr. 468, 539 P.2d 36]). In each of these contexts the court has an established factual universe, contradicted or not. That is what is lacking here.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">The trial court appears to have made its ruling that \u201cthere\u2019s no duty to fence\u201d solely on the basis of the moving papers of the parties\u2019 respective in limine motions and argument from counsel. Although both sides made evidence-related or factual references in those papers, neither provided much in the nature of a factual context. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel made what would ordinarily look like an offer of proof,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but there is no indication whether it played any part in the trial court\u2019s ruling. In neither the parties\u2019 papers nor the reporter\u2019s transcript of the arguments on those motions is there any discussion of the <em>Rowland </em>factors quoted above. To judge by the remarks of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, the issue of foreseeability would figure prominently in the analysis of those factors. (See fn. 2, <em>ante.) </em>With the basis of the facts used in determining foreseeability thus uncertain, the trial court may not have been able to decide the question of duty as an issue of law. (See <em>Gregorian v. National Convenience Stores, Inc., supra, </em>174 Cal.App.3d 944, 948.) An additional complication is that it deprives this court of the basis for undertaking an informed review of the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">We conclude that the unusual posture in which the issue was decided constituted error. This is not to say that such a ruling could not be made on an in limine motion. It is to say, however, that such a ruling can only be made with a clear factual or evidentiary basis, even if contradicted. That may be done when this matter is returned to the trial court. But for either the trial court or this court to decide an issue of duty atop an evidentiary void is far too perilous for comfort.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>II<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings in accordance with part I of this opinion.

J., and Sepulveda, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b798-10\"> Judge of the San Francisco Superior Court, assigned by the Chief Justice pursuant to article VI, \u00a7 6 of the California Constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b800-6\"> The <em>Beard </em>court treated <em>Rowland </em>as effectively abolishing the doctrine of attractive nuisance. <em>(Beard v. Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co., supra, 4 </em>Cal.App.3d 129, 135-137.) This court reached the same conclusion. <em>(Smith v. Americania Motor Lodge </em>(1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 1, 7 [113 Cal.Rptr. 771, 88 A.L.R.3d 1188].)</p>\n<p id=\"Aou\">Civil Code section 1714.7 provides: \u201cNo person who is injured while getting on, or attempting to get on, a moving locomotive or railroad car, without authority from the owner or operator of the railroad, or who, having gotten on a locomotive or railroad car while in motion without such authority, is injured while so riding or getting off, shall recover any damages from the owner or operator thereof for such injuries unless proximately caused by an intentional act of such owner or operator with knowledge that serious injury is the probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>result of such act, or with a wanton and reckless disregard of the probable result of such act.\u201d This statute, which was. enacted in response to <em>Beard </em>(see <em>Perez v. Southern Pacific Transportation Co. </em>(1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 462, 467-469 [267 Cal.Rptr. 100]), is much discussed in the parties\u2019 briefs. As there is nothing to suggest that Lucas Silva was engaged in trying to get on or off the train, this statute has no relevancy to this appeal. Parenthetically, we note that <em>Durham v. City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>91 Cal.App.3d 567, which is a train-hopping case, is erroneously read by Union Pacific as holding that there is no duty to fence after <em>Rowland. </em>The only discussion of <em>Joslin </em>and the <em>pre-Rowland </em>rule occurs within that part of the opinion holding that section 1714.7 does not violate equal protection. (Durham, at pp. 572-574.) For purposes of our inquiry, <em>Durham </em>is pure dicta.</p>\n<p id=\"APV\">Likewise immaterial here is Public Utilities Code section 7626, which provides: \u201cEvery railroad corporation shall make and maintain a good and sufficient fence on both sides of its track and property. If it does not and if its engine or cars kill or maim any cattle or domestic animals upon its line of road, except where the road runs through or upon public land it shall pay to the owner of the cattle or other domestic animals a fair market price for them, unless the killing or maiming occurred through the neglect or fault of the owner of the animal.\u201d Statutes of this nature have been construed as not making a railroad liable for injury to minors who stray upon tracks at an unfenced spot. (See, e.g., <em>Di Caprio </em>v. <em>New York C. R. Co. </em>(1921) 231 N.Y. 94 [131 N.E. 746, 16 A.L.R. 940] &amp; Annot., Duty of Railroad to Fence Track as against Children, <em>supra, </em>16 A.L.R. 944, 946-948.) Public Utilities Code section 7626 had been construed in a similar fashion, with the additional restriction to adjoining property owners. <em>(Baker v. Southern Cal. Ry. Co. </em>(1895) 110 Cal. 455, 456 [42 P. 975]; <em>Barbee v. Southern Pacific Co. </em>(1908) 9 Cal.App. 457, 459-460 [99 P. 541].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b802-6\">\u201cBased on the principles of <em>Rowland </em>v. <em>Christian, . . . </em>I\u2019m prepared to prove that people crossing the tracks is foreseeable.
