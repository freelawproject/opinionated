(a)), making terrorist threats (count IV; \u00a7 422) and two misdemeanor violations of battery (counts V &amp; VI; \u00a7 242). By bench trial, the court found true the allegations that defendant had suffered a serious prior felony conviction, attempted robbery, within the meaning of the three strikes law (\u00a7 667, subd.

In the published portion of defendant\u2019s appeal, we reject defendant\u2019s attacks on the sufficiency of the evidence and the jury instructions regarding the charge of making a terrorist threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">\n<em>Factual History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">On March 17, 1998, Kelly Mendoza lived in an apartment complex in Modesto with her husband and their two children, a one-year-old daughter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>and a five-year-old son. Kelly was three months pregnant at the time. About noon that day, Kelly was in the laundry room of the complex and spoke to defendant\u2019s mother about vandalism at the complex. Kelly complained that her son had been cut on the foot while walking on the sidewalk by some beer bottles defendant and his twin brother, David, had broken. Defendant was present in the laundry room and told Kelly it was none of her \u201cfucking business.\u201d When Kelly told defendant to wait until her husband got home, defendant stated he was going to beat her husband with a baseball bat. Kelly called the landlady from her apartment and told her what had happened. The landlady then posted something on defendant\u2019s apartment door.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">About 3:00 p.m. that afternoon, after Andy Mendoza, Kelly\u2019s husband, got home, a bunch of \u201cgang banger teenagers\u201d were outside his apartment. Defendant, David and defendant\u2019s teenage friends banged on the Mendozas\u2019 glass patio door, calling Kelly a bitch and threatening to kill the family. Kelly noticed that one of defendant\u2019s friends had a crowbar. Andy described it as a black metal club. Kelly\u2019s children began to cry and she called the 911 operator. However, the group dispersed when the police arrived. After the police left the area, the group returned about 4:30 p.m., and again tormented the Mendozas. Andy was terrified\u2014he was afraid to leave his house for fear defendant and his gang would come into his apartment and hurt his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Later that evening Kelly and Andy went to Juan and Virginia Seaberry\u2019s apartment, about three doors down, to attend a prayer meeting and pray about the problems they were having with the Butlers. Virginia was aware the Mendozas, fellow parishioners, were having problems with the Butlers and were afraid, and invited them to pray. Phil Henderson and Steve Seaberry arrived at the Seaberry apartment shortly after the Mendozas. Kelly realized she had forgotten her purse, so she and Virginia went to Kelly\u2019s apartment to retrieve it. Kelly noticed defendant, David and their friends standing outside. Kelly ran into her apartment to get her purse. When she came out, she saw defendant grab Virginia\u2019s arm and curse at her. Kelly walked back to Virginia\u2019s apartment and told Virginia to come with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Virginia testified that defendant and David stood in front of her, and some of defendant\u2019s friends had surrounded her. In total, there were about five or six individuals. Defendant grabbed her arm and told her she should mind her own business, that his gang, \u201cEl Norte,\u201d owned the apartments. Defendant called Virginia \u201ca fucking bitch,\u201d and again told her she needed to mind her own business or she \u201cwas going to get hurt.\u201d Virginia felt very intimidated because the group had followed her and surrounded her while she was alone; she perceived defendant\u2019s statement as a threat; and she was afraid they would hurt her. She tried to calm the situation by telling defendant that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>Mendozas had come over to her house just for a prayer meeting and not for a conflict with defendant. However, as she walked back home when Kelly came out, the group followed to the door of her apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">With assistance from the people inside the apartment, Kelly and Virginia entered the apartment and attempted to close the door. Defendant and his brother blocked the doorway so the door could not be shut, and their friends stood behind them. Defendant told Kelly, \u201cWe\u2019re Norte\u00f1os .... These are our apartments.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re outta here. You fucking bitch.\u201d They also threatened to return and shoot Kelly and her friends with a gun. Juan and Virginia asked defendant and his group to move so they could shut the door. Andy and Juan then tried to shut the door but could not do so. Virginia heard the group say they wanted Kelly, and if they gave her to them the situation would be resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Shortly after, one of the twins hit Steve Seaberry in the face and he fell back. Defendant, David and their gang then rushed into the apartment, pushing Juan and causing his three-year-old daughter, Samantha, to fall to the floor. All the occupants backed away, but one of the Butler twins slapped Phil Henderson. The occupants continued to avoid a confrontation, hoping the intruders would go away; however, the gang continued their assault. Defendant pulled out a knife and went toward Andy, who backed up to the comer of the living room. Defendant was about a foot away from Andy when he first flashed the knife. Defendant subsequently came within eight inches of Andy, while pointing the knife in a threatening manner as though he were going to lunge at Andy with it. David hit Andy and then defendant dropped the knife as he and David began punching Andy together. Andy attempted to defend himself for awhile and then retreated to the rear of the apartment to hide.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Defendant turned his attention to Steve, and began punching him in the face. Steve did not defend himself, but tried to cover up his face and prayed. He told defendant, \u201cStop, stop, I\u2019m a preacher, don\u2019t do that,\u201d and defendant hit him in the head. Andy returned and fought defendant for awhile, and then David jumped on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">After defendant pulled out the knife, everyone but Andy and Steve ran for safety, locking themselves in the bathroom. As Kelly ran into the bathroom, some unidentified person grabbed her hair. While Kelly, Virginia, Phil, Juan and Samantha were locked in the bathroom, Virginia attempted to call the police, but the telephone did not work.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">Someone in defendant\u2019s group said the police were coming, and they all fled. The police arrived and recovered the knife defendant had dropped when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>he and David were physically attacking Andy. Andy suffered a swollen and black eye as a result of the attack. Steve received a cut on his lip.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">\n<em>Defense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">David Butler was the sole witness called by the defense. He testified that the argument in the laundry room was with him, not defendant. Kelly threatened to have her husband take care of the matter. David responded by telling her that if Andy came to his house, he would hit him in the head with a bat.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">David saw Andy arrive home from work, and shortly after, David went to Andy\u2019s apartment. He told Andy to tell Kelly to stop causing problems and \u201cdisrespecting\u201d people. When Andy refused to do as David suggested, David left and stood in front of the Butlers\u2019 apartment. The police came and spoke with David and the Mendozas, but left without making any arrests. After the police left, Andy went outside and said the police were going to get David, and the Mendozas were going to continue to disrespect the Butlers. David ran toward Andy, causing Andy to retreat inside his apartment to call the police. The police arrived and spoke with both parties before leaving.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">Subsequently, David, defendant and two friends were hanging out when the Mendozas arrived at the Seaberrys\u2019 apartment followed by three men who arrived in a car. Virginia came outside and told the men that David had disrespected her. David admitted having cursed at Virginia, but denied grabbing her arm. Phil Henderson, who was one of the three men, approached David, followed by Juan and Andy. Henderson said, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d and put his hands up. David took this as a challenge to fight, so he pushed Henderson as Henderson started to back away. Virginia was instigating the fight. David threw the first punch and backed Henderson up to the doorway of the Seaberrys\u2019 apartment. David saw Andy in the doorway, went after him, and hit him. Andy retreated into the apartment and David followed him, eventually knocking Andy down into a couch. Someone jumped on David\u2019s back, and defendant began hitting this other guy. Then everyone started fighting.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">David eventually left the apartment with one of his. friends, but returned when he realized defendant was still inside. When David returned, he saw Andy knock defendant down with a punch. David ran in and punched Andy.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">Although David recognized the knife recovered by the police as belonging to defendant, David never saw defendant with the knife during the fight. David acknowledged that he wanted to protect his brother and did not want <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>to see him get into trouble. He also acknowledged that as a result of his involvement, he had pled guilty to first degree burglary and assault with intent to commit great bodily harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">\n<em>I. The terrorist threat charge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Count IV of the information alleged a violation of section 422, and was based oh the threat defendant made to Virginia Seaberry. Defendant contends the evidence is insufficient to sustain his conviction in count IV for making a terrorist threat because no evidence proved (1) the specific, identified crime threatened, or (2) that the crime threatened would result in death or great bodily injury. Continuing the same theme, defendant also argues the court committed prejudicial error by failing to (1) identify the crime threatened, and (2) failing to instruct, sua sponte, on the elements of that identified crime. We reject these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">\n<em>A. Sufficiency of the evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">\u201c \u2018When the sufficiency of the evidence is challenged on appeal, the court must review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it contains substantial evidence\u2014i.e., evidence that is credible and of solid value\u2014from which a rational trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Jennings </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 334, 364 [279 Cal.Rptr. 780, 807 P.2d 1009].)</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">There is no merit to defendant\u2019s contention that his threat was too ambiguous to constitute a threat within the meaning of section 422.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A threat is sufficiently specific where it threatens death or great bodily injury. A threat is not insufficient simply because it does \u201cnot communicate a time or precise manner of execution, section 422 does not require those details to be expressed.\u201d <em>(In re David L. </em>(1991) 234 Cal.App.3d 1655, 1660 [286 Cal.Rptr. 398].)</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>\u201cIn order to find appellant guilty of making a terrorist threat in violation of section 422, evidence to prove the following elements was required: 1) appellant willfully threatened to commit a crime which if committed would result in death or great bodily injury; 2) he made the threat with the specific intent that the statement be taken as a threat; 3) the threatening statement, on its face and under the circumstances in which it was made, was so unequivocal, unconditional, immediate and specific as to convey to the person threatened a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution of the threat; and 4) the threatening statement caused the other person reasonably to be in sustained fear for his [or her] own safety [or for his or her immediate family\u2019s safety], regardless of whether appellant actually intended to carry out the threat. (See CALJIC No. 9.94.)\u201d <em>(People v. Melhado </em>(1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 1529, 1536 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 878].)</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Virginia testified defendant called her \u201ca fucking bitch,\u201d and told her she needed to mind her own business or she \u201cwas going to get hurt.\u201d Defendant questions what crime it is to \u201churt\u201d a person, and whether that crime would result in death or great bodily injury. However, we answered these questions in <em>People </em>v. <em>Martinez </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1212, 1218 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 303]:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">\u201cDefendant argues his threat to lorio was vague and did not specifically convey a threat of great bodily injury or death; he claims it was little more than \u2018mouthing off\u2019 and posturing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-7\">\u201cWe agree that the words, \u2018I\u2019m going to get you,\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll get back to you,\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll get you,\u2019 may not, standing alone, convey a threat to commit a crime which will result in death or great bodily injury. But, as shall be discussed, we find that the meaning of the threat by defendant must be gleaned from the words and all of the surrounding circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-8\">\u201cAppellate courts have disagreed whether a threat is to be judged solely on the words spoken or if the words should be interpreted based on all the surrounding circumstances. Although we acknowledge these cases involve a different aspect of section 422 than the aspect we are determining here, the discussions regarding the interpretation of a threat based on only the facial content of the language used, versus an interpretation based on all the surrounding circumstances, are pertinent to our decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">Thus, it is the circumstances under which the threat is made that give meaning to the actual words used. Even an ambiguous statement may be a basis for a violation of section 422. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>724, 727-728 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 258], citing <em>People v. Bolin </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 297 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 412, 956 P.2d 374].)</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">\u201c[T]he determination whether a defendant intended his words to be taken as a threat, and whether the words were sufficiently unequivocal, unconditional, immediate and specific they conveyed to the victim an immediacy of purpose and immediate prospect of execution of the threat can be based on all the surrounding circumstances and not just on the words alone. The parties\u2019 history can also be considered as one of the relevant circumstances. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Martinez[, supra,] </em>53 Cal.App.4th 1212, 1218 . . . [the meaning of the defendant\u2019s threat must be gleaned from the words and all of the surrounding circumstances]; . . . <em>People </em>v. <em>Stanfield </em>[(1995)] 32 Cal.App.4th 1152, 1159 [38 Cal.Rptr.2d 328] [the statute does not concentrate on the precise words of the threat but whether the threat communicated a gravity of purpose and immediate prospect of execution of the threat].)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mendoza </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1340-1341 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 728].)</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">In <em>Mendoza, </em>the appellant stated: \u201c \u2018you fucked up my brother\u2019s testimony. I\u2019m going to talk to some guys from Happy Town\u2019. . . .\u201d <em>(People v. Mendoza, supra, </em>59 Cal.App.4th at p. 1340.) The court agreed with the appellant that this \u201cdid not articulate a threat to commit a specific crime resulting in death or great bodily injury.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>However, in looking at the circumstances under which the threat was made, the court concluded, as we did in <em>Martinez, </em>that it was sufficient for a violation of section 422. \u201cThus, although appellant\u2019s words were ambiguous, did not mention a particular criminal act or give other particulars, a rational juror could have found\u2014 based on all the surrounding circumstances\u2014appellant\u2019s words were sufficiently unequivocal,. unconditional, immediate and specific to convey to Arambula a gravity of purpose and immediate prospect of death or serious bodily injury.\u201d (59 Cal.App.4th at p. 1342.)</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">The circumstances here also establish that defendant\u2019s threat to hurt Virginia was a violation of section 422. Virginia was aware the Mendozas were in fear because defendant and his friends had been terrorizing them. Defendant and four or five other teenagers surrounded Virginia at her apartment complex. Defendant not only confronted her, he impressed upon Virginia just how serious he was by grabbing her arm, i.e., committing a battery upon her when he made his threat. In doing so, he emphasized his willingness and intent to hurt her if she did not mind her own business. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>McCray </em>(1997) 58 Cal.App.4th 159, 172 [67 Cal.Rptr.2d 872] [past physical abuse is probative on whether the victim was reasonably in fear for her safety by the defendant\u2019s threats]; <em>People v. Garret </em>(1994) 30 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>Cal.App.4th 962, 967 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 33] [same].) Defendant further impressed upon Virginia the gravity of the situation by bragging that his gang, \u201cEl Norte,\u201d owned the apartments. Defendant also demeaned Virginia by gratuitously calling her \u201ca fucking bitch.\u201d Virginia felt very intimidated because the group surrounded her while she was alone, and she perceived defendant\u2019s statement to be a threat.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While there was no evidence presented at trial, other than defendant\u2019s own statements, that defendant was a member of the Norte\u00f1os gang, there was no basis for Virginia to doubt this alleged association.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Standing alone, these circumstances are sufficient evidence for a violation of section 422; however, there is more. Immediately after making his threat, defendant and his so-called El Norte gang followed Virginia to her apart- . ment and tried to stop her from entering the apartment. Defendant threatened to get a gun and kill everyone inside. He then forcibly invaded her home and knocked down her young daughter, and committed an assault with a deadly weapon upon Andy by using a knife. When Virginia left the safety of her locked bathroom, she could see defendant and his friends had physically assaulted Andy and Steven Seaberry. This conduct further showed that defendant specifically intended his statement to be interpreted as a threat. Additionally, the threatening statement was so unequivocal, unconditional, immediate and specific as to convey a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution of the threat. <em>{People v. Bolin, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at pp. 337-340.) All these factors taken in conjunction with defendant\u2019s threats and assaultive conduct, led Virginia to reasonably be in sustained fear for her safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">\n<em>B. No requirement to identify a specific crime or instruct on its elements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Defendant argues the court committed prejudicial error by failing to (1) identify the crime threatened, and (2) instruct, sua sponte, on the elements of that identified crime. As can be seen from our earlier discussion, however, to constitute a section 422 violation, there is no requirement that a specific crime or Penal Code violation be threatened. It follows that no specific crime must be identified for the jury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It further follows that the court is not required to instruct the jury on the elements of any specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>Penal Code violations that might be subsumed within the actual words used to communicate the threat.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">The only support cited by defendant for his position is the CALJIC Committee\u2019s Use Note to CALJIC No. 9.94. It states: \u201cThe court must instruct on the elements of the threatened crime.\u201d The use note cites no authority for imposing this requirement. In light of the manner in which the Courts of Appeal and the Supreme Court have interpreted section 422, we conclude there is no basis for imposing such a requirement as a general rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">We begin with the history of section 422, which opens with the phrase, \u201cAny person who willfully threatens to commit <em>a crime </em>. . . .\u201d (Italics added.) The history is concerned with the statute\u2019s ability to pass constitutional muster, and was not intended to require that the person specifically threaten an enumerated offense prohibited by the Penal Code. (See <em>In re Ge M. </em>(1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 1519, 1524 [277 Cal.Rptr. 554] [former \u00a7 422 was declared unconstitutional and new version was intended to overcome unconstitutionality of the former section].)</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">\u201cThe genesis of the language in Penal Code section 422 is well known. In 1981, the California Supreme Court invalidated former section 422 as unconstitutionally vague. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mirmirani </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 375, 388 [178 Cal.Rptr. 792, 636 P.2d 1130].) The statute was repealed in 1987, and a substantially revised statute was enacted in 1988. (Stats. 1987, ch. 828, \u00a7 28, p. 2587; Stats. 1988, ch. 1256, \u00a7 4, pp. 4184-4185.) The relevant statutory language was adopted almost verbatim from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kelner </em>(2d Cir. 1976) 534 F.2d 1020 [34 A.L.R.Fed. 767], a case which discussed the boundaries imposed by the First Amendment on the punishment of threats. [Citation.] Because the language of the California statute was drafted to comport with <em>Kelner, </em>we can gain insight on the meaning of the statutory language from <em>Kelner, </em>its antecedents, and subsequent interpretations by other courts of the <em>Kelner </em>language incorporated into section 422 of the Penal Code.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Stanfield, supra, </em>32 Cal.App.4th at p. 1159, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">In <em>In re M.S. </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 698, 710-711[42 Cal.Rptr.2d 355, 896 P.2d 1365], the Supreme Court further explained the development of the law in discussing the constitutionality of sections 422.6 and 422.7, the \u201chate crime\u201d statutes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>\u201c[T]he state may penalize threats, even those consisting of pure speech, provided the relevant statute singles out for punishment threats falling outside the scope of First Amendment protection. [Citations.] In this context, the goal of the First Amendment is to protect expression that engages in some fashion in public dialogue, that is, \u2018 \u201ccommunication in which the participants seek to persuade, or are persuaded; communication which is about changing or maintaining beliefs, or taking or refusing to take action on the basis of one\u2019s beliefs ....\u2019\u201d [Citations.] As speech strays further from the values of persuasion, dialogue and free exchange of ideas, and moves toward willful threats to perform illegal acts, the state has greater latitude to regulate expression. [Citation.] Nonetheless, statutes criminalizing threats must be narrowly directed against only those threats that truly pose a danger to society. [Citation.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">\u201cA threat is an \u2018 \u201cexpression of an intent to inflict evil, injury, or damage on another.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] When a reasonable person would foresee that the context and import of the words will cause the listener to believe he or she will be subjected to physical violence, the threat falls outside First Amendment protection. [Citations.]\u201d (10 Cal.4th at pp. 710-711.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">As can be seen, to pass muster under the First Amendment, a threat may be punishable only if it expresses the intent to inflict evil, injury or damage on another person, or to perform illegal acts, i.e., only those threats that truly pose a danger to society may be punished. In enacting section 422, the phrase \u201cwillfully threatens to commit a crime\u201d is necessary in order to criminalize the threats. With reference to the hate crime statutes, the court concluded they \u201crequire proof of a specific intent to interfere with a person\u2019s right protected under state or federal law. This requirement helps protect against unconstitutional application to protected speech. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re M.S., supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 713, fn. omitted.) Similarly, with regard to section 422, it requires the threat to commit crimes or illegal acts in order to take it out of First Amendment protection. (See <em>People v. Dias, supra, 52 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 51 [\u201cthe federal courts after <em>Kelner </em>have concluded that not all threats to perform illegal acts are protected by the First Amendment\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">\u201cViolence and threats of violence . . . fall outside the protection of the First Amendment because they coerce by unlawful <em>conduct, </em>rather than persuade by expression, and thus play no part in the \u2018marketplace of ideas.\u2019 As such, they are punishable because of the state\u2019s interest in protecting individuals from the fear of violence, the disruption fear engenders and the possibility the threatened violence will occur. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re M.S., supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 714.)</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">As noted by the court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Brooks </em>(1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 142, 149 [31 Cal.Rptr.2d 283], this is precisely why section 422 was enacted: \u201cPenal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>Code section 422 was passed by the Legislature as part of the \u2018California Street Terrorism Enforcement and Prevention Act\u2019 of 1988. A portion of that act provides: \u2018The Legislature hereby finds and declares that it is the right of every person ... to be <em>secure and protected from fear, intimidation, </em>and physical harm caused by the activities of violent groups and individuals. It is not the intent of this chapter to interfere with the exercise of the constitutionally protected rights of freedom of expression and association, ffl] The Legislature, however, . . . finds that the State of California is in a state of crisis which has been caused by violent street gangs whose' members <em>threaten, terrorize, </em>and commit a multitude of crimes against the peaceful citizens of their neighborhoods. These activities . . . present a clear and present danger to public order and safety and are not constitutionally protected.\u2019 (Pen. Code, \u00a7 186.21, italics added.)\u201d (26 Cal.App.4th at p. 149.)</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">In light of the clear legislative intent and history pertaining to the enactment of section 422, there is no basis for concluding that before a jury may determine whether that section has been violated, a specific crime must be identified. Likewise, there is no basis for instructing the jury on the elements of the threatened crime. The CALJIC Committee\u2019s suggestion that such an instruction must be given is unsupported by case law or legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Here, the court properly discharged its duty by instructing the jury pursuant to CALJIC No. 9.94, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">\u201cDefendant is accused in Count [IV] of having violated Section 422 of the Penal Code, a crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\">\u201cEvery person who willfully threatens to commit a crime which will result in death or great bodily injury to another person, with the specific intent that the statement is to be taken as a threat, even if there is no intent of actually carrying it out, which threat, on its face and under the circumstances in which it is made, is so unequivocal, unconditional, immediate and specific as to convey to the person threatened, a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution of the threat, and thereby causes that person reasonably to be in sustained fear for his or her own safety or for his or her immediate family\u2019s safety, is guilty of a violation of Penal Code section 422, a crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\">\u201cGreat bodily injury means significant or substantial bodily injury or damage; it does not refer to trivial, insignificant, or moderate injury or harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-9\">. \u201c \u2018Immediate family\u2019 means any spouse, whether by marriage or not, parent, child, or any other person who regularly resides in the household, or who, within the prior six months, regularly resided in the household.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>\u201cIn order to prove this crime, each of the following elements must be proved:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">\u201c1.A person willfully threatened to commit a crime which if committed would result in death or great bodily injury to another person;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">\u201c2. The person who made the threat did so with the specific intent that the statement be taken as a threat;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">\u201c3. The threatening statement on its face, and under the circumstances in which it was made, was so unequivocal, unconditional, immediate and specific as to convey to the person threatened, a gravity of purpose and an immediate prospect of execution of the threat; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\">\u201c4. The threatening statement caused the other person reasonably to be in sustained fear for his or her own safety or for her immediate family\u2019s safety.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-9\">\u201cIt is immaterial whether the person who made the threat actually intended to carry it out.\u201d ^</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">The instruction sufficiently identifies the elements of the crime that the jury was required to find to convict under section 422. Further instruction on the elements of the threatened crime is unnecessary. Indeed, there are at least two reasons why imposing a requirement on the trial court to so instruct would be unwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">First, as the facts in <em>Martinez </em>(\u201c \u2018I\u2019m going to get you\u2019 \u201d), <em>Mendoza </em>(\u201cI\u2019m going to talk to some guys from Happy Town\u2019 . . .\u201d) and this case (\u201cmind [your] own business or [you\u2019re] going to get hurt\u201d) show, punishable threats can be nonspecific and ambiguous so long as they reasonably may be construed, under the circumstances, as threatening death or great bodily injury. Identifying a specific Penal Code violation and instructing on its elements for such nonspecific and ambiguous threats would be, in practice, almost impossible. It would be unrealistic to saddle our overworked trial judges with such an onerous task\u2014a requirement that almost ensures failure and built-in instructional error.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">Second, an instruction on the elements of the threatened crime will almost always conflict with the instructions regarding the elements for a section 422 violation; Specific intent to carry out the threatened crime is not required. <em>(People v. Fisher </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 1556, 1558 [15 Cal.Rptr.2d 889].) Yet, the elements of the threatened crime will almost certainly have a mens rea element to it. For example, if an element of the threatened offense is the specific intent to kill, how does the jury reconcile this requirement with CALJIC No. 9.94\u2019s instruction advising it that \u201cIt is immaterial whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>person who made the threat actually intended to carry it out\u201d? Can a person simultaneously have a specific intent to kill and no actual intention of killing when that person unlawfully threatens to kill another? A jury presented with this type of question would likely become confused.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Similarly, every crime has an actus reus element. For example, to be guilty of an assault with a deadly weapon a person must \u201ccommit an assault upon the person of another with a deadly weapon or instrument . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 245, subd. (a).) Yet, there is no requirement under section 422 or CALJIC No. 9.94 that the person making the threat must make any attempt to actually carry out the threat, let alone complete the act. How does a jury reconcile such conflicting instructions without the danger of confusion?</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">In his reply brief, defendant analogizes the CALJIC Use Note with a similar one provided in CALJIC No. 8.21 on first degree felony murder. Defendant\u2019s analogy to felony murder, however, misses the mark. The felony-murder law requires the actual commission of an unlawful killing of a human being during\" the actual commission or attempted commission of a felony and the specific intent to commit the felony. In addition, it requires that the specific intent to commit the felony and the commission or attempted commission of the felony must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. (See CALJIC No. 8.21.) Under these requirements, it is critical for the jury to be instructed on the elements that constitute the felony th\u00e1t the defendant is charged with committing or attempting to commit. In contrast, section 422 does not require the commission or attempted commission of the threatened crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Finally, because experience shows punishable threats may be made in a variety of ways, it is possible that an instruction on the elements of the threatened crime may be helpful to the jury. For example, a person might threaten, \u201cif you testify tomorrow, I\u2019m going to find you and 187 your sorry behind.\u201d In such a situation, the jury may need instruction on what a \u201c187\u201d refers to. We leave it to the parties, however, to request any supplemental instructions to CALJIC No. 9.94, and for the trial court to rule on whether supplemental instructions would be more helpful than confusing to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">H.-IV.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The judgment is modified by striking all sentence enhancements for the prior serious felony and prior prison term except the five-year enhancement imposed on count I pursuant to section 667, subdivision (a), and affirmed in all other respects.
