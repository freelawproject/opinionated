Code, \u00a7 211; all further section references are to the Penal Code) and found that defendant personally inflicted great bodily. injury during the commission of the crimes (\u00a7 12022.7). The trial court thereafter found that defendant had suffered a prior conviction for robbery (\u00a7\u00a7 211, 667, subds. (a), (b)-(i), 1170.12) and had served two prior prison terms (\u00a7 667.5, subd. (b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">Sentenced to a total state prison term of 19 years, defendant contends: (1). The trial court erred prejudicially in instructing the jury as to accomplice testimony. (2) The court lacked jurisdiction to order defendant at sentencing to submit blood and saliva samples under section 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-11\">In the unpublished portion of the opinion, we shall conclude that the trial court\u2019s error in instructing on the testimony of an accomplice did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number>prejudice defendant. In the published portion of the opinion, we shall conclude the trial court erroneously ordered defendant to submit blood and saliva samples under section 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">We shall therefore strike the order to submit blood and saliva samples, but otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Facts<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">I*</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">At sentencing on June 11, 1999, the trial court ordered defendant to submit samples of his blood and saliva, along with a right thumbprint and full palm print impressions of each hand, under the purported authority of sections 296 and 296.1. Defendant did not object.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-11\">Defendant contends that these sections did not authorize the court to order him to submit blood and saliva samples. We agree. We further conclude that defendant\u2019s failure to object does not waive the issue because an unauthorized sentencing condition may be attacked for the first time on appeal. <em>(People v. Scott </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 331, 354 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 627, 885 P.2d 1040]; <em>People v. Sanchez </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 997, 1000, fn. 4 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 880].)</p>\n<p id=\"b743-12\">As it read at the time of defendant\u2019s sentencing, on June 11, 1999, section 296 provided as relevant that any person who is convicted of \u201cany of the following crimes\u201d must provide \u201ctwo specimens of blood, a saliva sample, right thumbprints, and a full palm print impression of each hand for law enforcement identification analysis.\u201d (Former \u00a7 296, subd. <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The offenses enumerated thereafter in subdivision (a)(l)(A)-(a)(l)(H) and (a)(2) did not include robbery. Nor does the current version of section 296 list robbery as a qualifying offense. (See Stats. 1999, ch. 475, \u00a7 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b744-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>The Attorney General asserts that the court was authorized to make its order under section 296.1, subdivision (c), which purportedly mandates collection of samples from anyone convicted of \u201ca crime similar to any listed in\u201d section 296. According to the Attorney General, robbery with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>personal infliction of great bodily injury, of which defendant was convicted, is \u201csimilar\u201d to assault and battery, offenses listed in section 296, subdivision (a)(1)(F); therefore the court\u2019s order was proper. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Section 296.1, subdivision (c) provided at the time of sentencing and currently provides that a convicted person may be required to provide samples \u201conce it has been determined that both of the following apply: ffl] (1) <em>The person has been convicted in California of a qualifying offense described in subdivision (a) of Section 296 or of a similar crime under the laws of the United States or of any other state that would constitute an offense described in subdivision (a) of Section 296. </em>[5] (2) The person\u2019s blood specimens, saliva samples, and thumb and palm print impressions authorized by this chapter are not in the possession of the Department of Justice DNA Laboratory as part of the DNA data bank program.\u201d (Italics added.) Section 296.1, subdivision (c)(1) on its face does not cover any and all California crimes arguably \u201csimilar\u201d to those enumerated in section 296, subdivision (a): it covers only crimes committed \u201cunder the laws of the United States or any other state\u201d that correspond to offenses enumerated in section 296, subdivision (a). The Attorney General in effect would have us rewrite section 296.1 to replace its precise literal language with an open-ended \u201csimilarity\u201d test, but cites no authority and offers no argument for doing so. Since there is no ambiguity in the statute\u2019s plain language, we need not and may not indulge in judicial construction. <em>(Beverly v. Anderson </em>(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 480, 485 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 545].)</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Furthermore, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Sanchez, supra, </em>52 Cal.App.4th 997, the court reached the same conclusion we now reach in construing a predecessor provision to section 296. Under subdivision (a) of former section 290.2 (repealed by Stats. 1998, ch. 696, \u00a7 1; see now \u00a7 296, subd. (a)(2)), \u201c[a]ny person who is required to register under Section 290 because of the commission of, or the attempt to commit, a felony offense specified in Section 290, or who is convicted of murder in violation of Section 190 or 190.05, or who is convicted of a felony offense of assault or battery in violation of Section 217.1, 220, 241.1, 243, 243.1, 243.3, 243.4, 243.7, 244, 245, 245.2, 245.3, or 245.5\u201d had to provide blood and saliva samples. The court held that the defendant, who had been convicted of attempted murder, could not be required to provide samples under section 290.2 because his crime was not one of those enumerated therein. (52 Cal.App.4th at p. 1000.) In so holding, the court relied on the rule of statutory construction that when the Legislature has chosen to expressly include certain things in a statute, it means to exclude those it has not mentioned. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1001; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Brun </em>(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 951, 954-955 [260 Cal.Rptr. 850].) We think the reasoning of <em>People </em>v. <em>Sanchez, supra, </em>applies equally well to section 296 and requires the same result in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>Moreover, like the court in <em>People v. Sanchez, supra, </em>52 Cal.App.4th 997 we conclude that defendant\u2019s failure to object below does not waive the issue because the trial court\u2019s order was unauthorized. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1000, fn. 4; see <em>People v. Scott, supra, </em>9 Cal.4th at p. 354.) Therefore, we shall direct the trial court to strike the order it made under the purported authority of sections 296 and 296.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">The sentence imposed is modified to strike the order that defendant comply with the requirements of sections 296 and 296.1. As modified, the judgment is affirmed. The trial court is directed to amend its records to reflect our modification of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">Scotland, P. J., and Blease, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied April 11, 2001.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b743-13\">See footnote,
