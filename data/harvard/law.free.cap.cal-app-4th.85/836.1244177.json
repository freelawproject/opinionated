This Incentive Pay was created by a memorandum of understanding (MOU) negotiated between the Police Protective League (representing appellants) and the City of Los Angeles, and expressly provides that it is not to be pension-based. Appellants contend that the Incentive Pay is \u201cSpecial Pay\u201d and/or \u201cAssignment Pay\u201d as defined in the Los Angeles City Charter, and consequently under the charter is required to be pension-based. We find that the Incentive Pay is neither Special Pay nor Assignment Pay as defined by the city charter, and affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of appellants\u2019 petition for writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">\n<em>The Pension Plans</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">\n<em>The New Pension System</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b611-12\">Appellants Morgan and Preciado are members of the \u201cNew Pension System,\u201d which is set forth in article XVIII of the city charter,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 190.01 et seq. The New Pension System was established in 1967, and includes police officers hired between its enactment and 1980, when a new plan was adopted. System members are entitled to a pension, based on the \u201cNormal Pension Base\u201d as defined in city charter section 190.02, subdivision (s), to be \u201cthe sum of: (1) his monthly salary; (2) any length of service pay which he had received immediately preceding the date of his retirement or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>death or upon the last day he had performed duties as a Department Member; (3) any special pay which he had received immediately preceding the date of his retirement or death . . . and (4) any hazard pay . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Charter section 190.02, subdivision (r-2), provides that Assignment Pay, as defined in the subdivision, shall be included in the pension base to the same extent and upon the same conditions as \u201cHazard Pay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">\n<em>Safety Members\u2019 Pension Plan</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Appellant Jones is a member of the \u201cSafety Members Pension Plan\u201d (the Plan), which appears in article XXXV, section 520 et seq. of the charter. The Plan was created in 1980 and applies to all police officers hired after that date. Plan members are entitled to a pension based upon \u201cFinal Average Salary\u201d (the \u201cpension base\u201d) as defined in charter section 521, subdivision (n) to be: \u201can amount equivalent to a monthly average of salary actually received during any twelve (12) consecutive months of service as a Plan Member as designated by the Plan Member. . . .\u201d Paragraph 4 of this subdivision states: \u201cIncluded in the calculation of Final Average Salary shall be Length of Service Pay, Special Pay Assignment Pay, and Hazard Pay actually received during the twelve (12) consecutive months used to determine Final Average Salary. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">\n<em>The Pension Board</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">The City of Los Angeles Board of Pension Commissioners is vested with the responsibility and authority to administer the Plan (charter, art. XXXV, \u00a7 520), including the predecessor New Pension System. (Charter, \u00a7 524.)</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">\n<em>Memorandum of Understanding</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">Appellants\u2019 wages, hours, and other conditions and terms of employment are determined as a result of negotiations memorialized in an MOU between their collective bargaining agent and the city. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 3504.)  A member of an employee bargaining unit is bound by the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, even though the member is not formally a party to the agreement, and may not even belong to the union which negotiated it. <em>(Relyea v. Ventura County Fire Protection Dist. </em>(1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 875, 882 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 614].)</p>\n<p id=\"b612-12\">MOU No. 24 between the league (representing the bargaining unit of police officers, lieutenant rank and below) and the city was entered into on July 31, 1996, for the period from July 1, 1996, to June 30, 2000. Article 5.4 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>of the MOU provides that the city will pay eligible members of the unit 2 percent of their base salary as a form of non-pension-based compensation denominated \u201cUniform Field Assignment Incentive.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To be eligible for the Incentive Pay, an officer must be subject to the MOU and be \u201cassigned to a division or other organizational component which works in the field in uniform.\u201d No provision in the MOU identifies the Incentive Pay as either Special Pay or Assignment Pay, terms which are discussed below. Approximately 5,000 of 9,000 officers in the bargaining unit receive the Incentive Pay and no pension contributions are deducted from it, because it is designated non-pension-based.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Article 1.7 of the MOU states that if any article, part, or provision is in conflict with or inconsistent with any charter provision, that article, part, or provision shall be severed, suspended and superceded.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>\n<em>The Petition for Writ of Mandate</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Appellant Morgan requested the pension board to treat Incentive Pay as part of the final average salary for pension calculation purposes. Following denial by the board, Morgan filed a petition under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, alleging on behalf of himself and all current and former members of the Plan who had received Incentive Pay that the board had a ministerial duty to include Incentive Pay in the pension base. The petition was apparently amended to include appellants Preciado and Jones as named plaintiffs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The petition was heard and denied on the ground that the unambiguous intention of the parties to the MOU, in adding additional compensation in the form of Incentive Pay, was that this compensation be excluded from the base from which pension benefits were calculated. This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Appellants\u2019 Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Appellants contend that: Incentive Pay constitutes Special Pay and/or Assignment Pay within the meaning of the Los Angeles City Charter; the charter requires inclusion of Special Pay and Assignment Pay in an officer\u2019s pension base; consequently, the MOU exclusion of Incentive Pay from pension base must be deleted under article 1.7 of the MOU, which requires severance of any MOU provision inconsistent with the city charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b614-10\">A writ of mandate \u201cmay be issued by any court... to compel the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins, as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station . . . .\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1085.) To obtain issuance of a writ of mandamus under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, the petitioner must demonstrate that there is no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy, that the respondent has failed to act on a clear ministerial duty to do so, and that the petitioner has a clear right to such performance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number><em>(Quirk v. Board of Education </em>(1988) 199 Cal.App.3d 729, 733 [244 Cal.Rptr. 924].) A ministerial act is one which a public officer is required to perform in a prescribed manner in obedience to the mandate of legal authority, without regard to his own judgement or opinion. <em>(Transdyn/Cresci JV v. City and County of San Francisco </em>(1999) 72 Cal.App.4th 746, 752 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 512].) Mandamus is also available to \u201ccorrect those acts and decisions of administrative agencies which are in violation of the law . . . .\u201d <em>(Bodinson Mfg. Co. v. California E. Com. </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 321, 329 [109 P.2d 935].)</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The interpretation of a contract is subject to de novo review where the interpretation does not turn on the credibility of extrinsic evidence. <em>(Sunniland Fruit, Inc. </em>v. <em>Verni </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 892, 898 [284 Cal.Rptr. 824].) The interpretation of statutes and regulations is similarly subject to de novo review. <em>(Carmona </em>v. <em>Division of Industrial Safety </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 303, 310 [118 Cal.Rptr. 473, 530 P.2d 161].)</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">With these principles in mind, we examine the MOU between the city and the league<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the charter provisions relied upon by the league.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">\n<em>The Memorandum of Understanding</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">The express language of article 5.4, subdivision (A) of the MOU states that Incentive Pay is not pension-based.  \u201cA contract must be interpreted to give effect to the mutual, expressed intention of the parties. Where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>the parties have reduced their agreement to writing, their mutual intention is to be determined, whenever possible, from the language of the writing alone.\u201d <em>(Ben-Zvi v. Edmar Co. </em>(1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 468, 473 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 12].)  The unambiguous intention of the parties to the MOU is that eligible police officers may receive Incentive Pay, a non-pension-based form of compensation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Appellants concede that Incentive Pay is not a pay category specified in the charter as contributing to a pension base. But they contend that Incentive Pay fits the charter definitions of Special Pay and Assignment Pay, both of which are pension-based under the charter. Appellants urge that the sever-ability clause in article 1.7 of the MOU, applicable to any \u201cArticle, part, or provision\u201d inconsistent or in conflict with existing law, must be applied to excise that part of article 5.4 which provides that Incentive Pay not be pension-based, but that the remainder of the article which creates the Incentive Pay must be retained. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Having entered into a collective bargaining agreement, a party cannot retain that part of an agreement which creates a benefit, while rejecting a less favorable provision, such as limitations on that agreed-upon benefit. <em>(San Bernardino Public Employees Assn. v. City of Fontana </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 1215, 1224-1225 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 634].)  Assuming, as appellants suggest, that the non-pension-based designation of Incentive Pay in article 5.4 of the MOU is in conflict with the city charter, there is no support for appellants\u2019 argument that application of the severability clause should be limited to that part of article 5.4 which excludes Incentive Pay from the pension base. Appellants have not explained why article 1.7 would not require that the entirety of article 5.4 be severed and stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Moreover, appellants\u2019 contention that MOU article 5.4 be retained in its entirety, except for the non-pension-based designation of Incentive Pay, is not supported by application of the three-part test used by courts in applying severability clauses to statutes.  In analyzing severability clauses, courts first apply a mechanical test to determine whether language is grammatically severable, then look to whether the unexcised language is functionally complete and capable of separate enforcement. <em>(People\u2019s Advocate, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number><em>Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 316, 330-332 [226 Cal.Rptr. 640].) These two tests are met here. The third test requires that the \u201c \u2018 \u201cremainder [must not only be] complete in itself [but] <em>would have been adopted by the legislative body had </em>[zY] <em>foreseen the partial invalidation of the statute.\u201d </em>\u2019 . . . This test logically requires that the remaining provisions must be viewed from the perspective of the enacting body.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 332.)  There is no evidence that the city council would have adopted the MOU containing Incentive Pay had the council foreseen that the MOU\u2019s designation of Incentive Pay as non-pension-based would have been invalidated. Consequently, we reject appellants\u2019 contention that designation of Incentive Pay as non-pension-based must be stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">\n<em>Charter Provisions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">We address the basic premise of appellants\u2019 appeal, that Incentive Pay, although not among the categories of pay listed in the city charter as contributing to pension base, is nonetheless pension-based under the charter, because it is equivalent to Special Pay and or Assignment Pay as defined in the charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">An administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute the agency is charged with implementing is entitled to great weight, and the agency\u2019s interpretation will be accepted unless clearly erroneous. <em>(American Federation of Labor v. Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd. </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 1017, 1027 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 109, 920 P.2d 1314].)  It is uncontroverted that the pension board, the agency charged with implementing charter provisions governing appellants\u2019 retirement plans, regarded Incentive Pay as neither Special Pay nor Assignment Pay with respect to either contributions or benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">We agree with the board\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">\n<em>Special Pay</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">Charter section 521, subdivision (p), which governs the Plan, and section 190.02, subdivision (q-2), which governs the system, define Special Pay as additional pay by reason of assignment to perform special duties other than hazardous duties, as provided by ordinance.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">Appellants argue Incentive Pay constitutes Special Pay because it is dependent upon an assignment to a unit whose primary function is to provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>services to the field in uniform, and these assignments are \u201cspecial\u201d under the dictionary definition as \u201cdistinguished by some unusual quality\u201d or \u201cfavored.\u201d This proposed definition does not address the charter requirement that Special Pay be provided by ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">There is no ordinance which provides that Special Pay is merited by assignment to units whose primary function involves uniformed field services. We are not persuaded by appellants\u2019 contention that the passage of an enabling ordinance that incorporated and implemented the provisions of the MOU constituted the enactment of an ordinance establishing Special Pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Furthermore, Special Pay assignments are listed in Los Angeles Administrative Code (LAAC) section 4.159, subdivision <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and uniform field assignments are not included. Although LAAC section 4.159, subdivision (g)(3), makes provision for the designation of positions not listed to qualify for special or hazard pay,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Incentive Pay was never designated as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>\n<em>Assignment Pay</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Assignment Pay is any additional gross monthly pay or one-twelfth of any additional gross annual pay which is provided by ordinance, for performance of special or hazardous duties, or duties in a higher class, position, grade, code or other title within the system member\u2019s permanent rank.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Here again appellants argue that Incentive Pay should be regarded as Assignment Pay because it is assignment based and \u201cfavored.\u201d But there is no evidence that uniform field assignments meet the charter requirements under which Assignment Pay may be granted. While appellants contend that the MOU appendices show that the base pay of officers receiving Incentive Pay places them in higher pay categories than the lowest paid officers in the same rank, there is no competent evidence that these pay scales reflect a higher class, position, grade, code, or title within the officers\u2019 permanent rank. Again, we are not persuaded that adoption of an MOU is equivalent to \u201cadditional . . . pay . . . provided by ordinance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">Insofar as we find that Incentive Pay is not Special Pay or Assignment Pay within the meaning of the city charter, and that the MOU creating Incentive Pay expressly excludes this compensation from pension base, we decide the appeal solely on these issues, and do not reach other remedy-related issues raised by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">We find appellants failed to establish a clear ministerial duty on the part of the pension board to include uniform field assignment incentive pay in appellants\u2019 pension base and therefore we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">Boren, P. J., and Cooper, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-11\">Appellants\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied March 28, 2001. Mosk, J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b611-13\">A11 references herein are to the governing provision of the City of Los Angeles Charter prior to July 1, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"A6X\">The charter was amended July 1, 2000; article XVIU is now tier 2 of the Fire and Police Pension Plans; article XXXV now consists of tiers 3 and 4 of the Fire and Police Pension Plans.
