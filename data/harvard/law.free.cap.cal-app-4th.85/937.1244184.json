When a deputy sheriff responded, Warner was quite \u201cadamant that he wanted some action taken being that he was working for the City . . . .\u201d Warner demanded that Dallas be detained and cited, which he was. Dallas was charged by petition (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 602) with misdemeanor indecent exposure (Pen. Code, \u00a7 314, subd. I),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and an adjudication hearing was held. The juvenile court found this was \u201ca mooning case,\u201d and that Dallas had \u201cexposed his buttocks . . . with the intent to annoy and affront people.\u201d The court specifically found that Dallas did <em>not </em>act with \u201csexual intent in the sense that he intended to arouse himself or a third person by his act. I think he did it strictly to annoy and to affront people.\u201d The petition was nevertheless sustained, and Dallas was made a ward of the court. He appeals. Because the court found Dallas acted without any sexual intent, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Dallas contends the evidence is insufficient to support the finding of indecent exposure because there is no evidence that he bared his buttocks \u201clewdly.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">As relevant, section 314 provides that \u201c[e]very person who willfully and lewdly . . . [ft| [e]xposes his person, or the private parts thereof, in any public place, or in any place where there are present other persons to be offended or annoyed thereby!,] . . . [^] ... is guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d (\u00a7 314, subd. 1.) Under section 314, \u201clewd\u201d intent is an essential element of the offense, and \u201csomething more than mere nudity\u201d must be shown. <em>(In re Smith </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 362, 365 [102 Cal.Rptr. 335, 497 P.2d 807].) \u201c[A] person does not expose his private parts \u2018lewdly\u2019 within the meaning of section 314 unless his conduct is sexually motivated. Accordingly, a conviction of that offense requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the actor not only meant to expose himself, but intended by his conduct to direct public attention to his genitals for purposes of sexual arousal, gratification, or affront.\u201d <em>(In re Smith, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at p. 366.) In <em>Smith, </em>the Supreme Court held that, without evidence that a sunbather had \u201cintentionally directed] attention to his genitals for sexual purposes,\u201d the sunbather\u2019s nude sunbathing on an isolated beach did not \u201c \u2018lewdly\u2019 expose his private parts within the meaning of section 314.\u201d <em>(In re Smith, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at p. 366.)</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">The juvenile court thought it was enough that Dallas had acted with the intent to \u201caffront.\u201d It was not. As used in <em>Smith, </em>the word \u201csexual\u201d modifies \u201carousal,\u201d gratification,\u201d and \u201caffront,\u201d not just \u201carousal\u201d and \u201cgratification.\u201d <em>(In re Smith, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at p. 366.) \u201cAffront\u201d must be read as \u201csexual affront.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">Depending upon how it is read, CALJIC No. 16.220 may be inconsistent with <em>Smith </em>and, therefore, with the result we reach in this case\u2014because it defines \u201clewdly\u201d as used in subdivision 1 of section 314 to mean \u201cwith specific intent to direct public attention to one\u2019s person [or] genitals for the purpose of one\u2019s own <em>sexual arousal or gratification, </em>or that of another, <em>or to affront </em>others.\u201d (Italics added.) In Dallas\u2019s case, the juvenile court read \u201cto affront others,\u201d as set out in the instruction, as a nonmodified independent clause (so the affront need not be sexual). So construed, the instruction is not a proper statement of the law. <em>(In re Smith, supra, </em>7 Cal.3d at p. 366; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Swearington </em>(1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 935, 943 [140 Cal.Rptr. 5] [sexual motivation is a prime requisite for conduct to constitute lewd conduct under section 314]; <em>Eckl v. Davis </em>(1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 831, 842 [124 Cal.Rptr. 685] [nudity, in and of itself, is not within the proscription of section 314]; <em>Wainwright </em>v. <em>Procunier </em>(9th Cir. 1971) 446 F.2d 757.)</p>\n<p id=\"b712-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>We leave it to others to straighten out the problem with CALJIC No. 16.220. For us, the bottom line is the juvenile court\u2019s finding that Dallas acted only to annoy and affront people and <em>not </em>with \u201csexual intent in the sense that he intended to arouse himself or a third person by his act.\u201d Dallas may have been guilty of some other offense (see \u00a7\u00a7 370, 372), and he certainly exhibited bad judgment and poor taste\u2014but the trial court\u2019s findings make it clear that Dallas did not violate section 314.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The order sustaining the petition is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">Spencer, P. J., and Mallano, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">A petition for a rehearing was denied January 17, 2001, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above. Respondent\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied March 28, 2001.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b710-10\"> To \u201cmoon\u201d is \u201c[t]o exhibit one\u2019s bare buttocks as a defiant or amusing gesture, usu[ally] at a window.\u201d (Chapman, American Slang (Harper Paperbacks 1987) p. 289.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b710-11\"> Undesignated section references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
