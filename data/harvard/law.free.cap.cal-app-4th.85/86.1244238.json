We conclude that the statute\u2019s blanket prohibition against public utilities\u2019 protected speech is facially unconstitutional. Thus, the Public Utilities Commission\u2019s May 13, 1999 order enforcing the statute is set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) includes in its monthly billings a newsletter, the contents of which \u201crange from energy-saving tips to stories about wildlife conservation, and from billing information to recipes.\u201d <em>(Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Public Util. Comm\u2019n </em>(1986) 475 U.S. 1, 8 [106 S.Ct. 903, 907, 89 L.Ed.2d 1].) The newsletters sent in June, July and August of 1987, then entitled PG&amp;E Progress, included information regarding federal regulations that PG&amp;E was seeking to have changed. PG&amp;E does not dispute that some of the subject matter discussed in the newsletters in June, July, and August of 1987 fell within the purview of section 453, subdivision (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">On December 15, 1987, real parties in interest, Independent Energy Producers Association, California Manufacturers Association, and Toward Utility Rate Normalization (collectively, complainants), filed a complaint with the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) against PG&amp;E alleging that the utility violated section 453, subdivision (d), by using the June, July, and August 1987 billing envelopes for its political advocacy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The complaint sought enforcement of the statute against the utility, arguing that, because the cost of postage for mailing monthly bills is an expense allocated to ratepayers, the insertion of political literature into the unused space in the billing envelopes forced the ratepayers to subsidize PG&amp;E\u2019s political advocacy in violation of their First Amendment rights. On January 19, 1988, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>PG&amp;E filed an answer and a motion to dismiss the complaint contending, among other things, that enforcement of section 453, subdivision (d), would violate its constitutional right to freedom of speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">At proceedings held before PUC on September 17, 1990, the parties agreed that an evidentiary hearing was unnecessary and stipulated to the following facts: \u201c1. The Parties agree that there is no incremental postage cost associated with inserting PG&amp;E Progress in billing envelopes. Postage costs for mailing PG&amp;E customers bills, which are borne by ratepayers, would be the same, whether or not Progress is included in the billing envelope. HQ 2. The Parties agree that ratepayers are not charged any of the labor or overhead cost associated with the insertion of Progress into PG&amp;E\u2019s billing envelopes, pursuant to CPUC Decision (D.) 83-12-047. HD 3. The Parties agree, for purposes of this litigation only, that ratepayers receive direct financial benefits from articles appearing in Progress, including the three editions of Progress at issue in this proceeding. Ratepayers are able to save money by taking advantage of the rate, energy conservation, and safety information provided in Progress. HQ 4. The Parties agree that D.86-12-095, pertaining to PG&amp;E\u2019s 1987 General Rate Case (GRC), found that articles in Progress provide the same type of information which must otherwise be provided by PG&amp;E\u2019s customer service representatives when they respond to customers inquiries by phone or in person. As a result, Progress contributes to reduced customer accounts expense which, in turn, results in lower rates, all else held constant. The Parties further agree that the above-mentioned conclusions reached in D.86-12-095 shall be controlling for purposes of this proceeding.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After the filing of briefs, PUC took no further action in the case until October 21, 1998, at which time it requested the filing of new briefs and informed the parties that it would issue a decision based on the record developed in 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">On May 13, 1999, PUC issued decision No. 99-05-032, ordering PG&amp;E to refund to its customers $920,000, representing 40 percent of the cost of postage for the billings in June, July, and August 1987, based upon its finding that PG&amp;E violated section 453, subdivision (d), by including \u201cwith bills for services to its customers literature designed or intended to promote or defeat any change in federal legislation or regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>On December 2, 1999, PUC issued decision No. 99-12-022 [1999 WL 1990195], denying PG&amp;E\u2019s application for rehearing of decision No. 99-05-032. PG&amp;E filed a timely petition for writ of review of both decisions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We granted review of the petition on August 7, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">In its May 13, 1999 decision, PUC made the following findings of fact: (1) The stipulation of facts was adopted; (2) The June, July, and August 1987 issues of the PG&amp;E Progress contained articles seeking to promote a change in current federal regulations in regard to purchasing power from private power producers; (3) The cost of mailing the three issues was approximately $2.3 million; and (4) PG&amp;E, a public utility, violated section 453, subdivision (d)(4), in that PG&amp;E did include with bills for services to its customers literature designed or intended to promote or defeat any change in federal legislation or regulations. PUC also made the following conclusions of law: (1) PG&amp;E violated section 453, subdivision (d)(4); and (2) PG&amp;E should be required to refund to its customers 40 percent of the cost of postage ($920,000) for the three issues\u2014June, July, and August 1987, plus interest commencing April 1, 1998, in the manner set forth in the order. Based upon the foregoing findings of fact and conclusions of law, PUC ordered PG&amp;E to refund $920,000 to its customers.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">Relying upon <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n </em>(1980) 447 U.S. 530, 532, 544 [100 S.Ct. 2326, 2331, 2337. 65 L.Ed.2d 319] <em>(Con Ed), </em>PG&amp;E contends that PUC\u2019s May 13, 1999 order must be reversed because section 453, subdivision (d), directly infringes upon its freedom of speech as protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments and cannot be upheld as a reasonable time, place or manner restriction, a permissible subject matter regulation, or a narrowly tailored means of serving a compelling state interest. (447 U.S. at pp. 532, 544 [100 S.Ct. at pp. 2331, 2337].) Relying upon <em>Abood </em>v. <em>Detroit Board of Education </em>(1977) 431 U.S. 209 [97 S.Ct. 1782, 52 L.Ed.2d 261] <em>(Abood), </em>respondents argue that PUC construed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>the statute constitutionally in this case in accordance with the Legislature\u2019s intention to prevent the infringement of ratepayers\u2019 freedom of speech resulting from forced <em>subsidization </em>of public utilities\u2019 political speech. We hold that section 453, subdivision (d), is reasonably susceptible of only one interpretation, that the statute is unconstitutional on its face, and that PUC\u2019s order enforcing the unconstitutional statute must, therefore, be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">I. <em>Section 453, Subdivision (d), Can Only Be Interpreted as Prohibiting the Inclusion of Political Advocacy in Billing Envelopes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The goal in interpreting a statute is to determine and effectuate legislative intent. <em>(Woods v. Young </em>(1991) 53 Cal.3d 315, 323 [279 Cal.Rptr. 613, 807 P.2d 455].) To determine that intent, however, we must look first to the <em>words </em>of the statute, giving them their usual and ordinary meaning. <em>(Ibid.; DaFonte v. Up-Right, Inc. </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 593, 601 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 238, 828 P.2d 140].) Courts may look to legislative history to construe a statute <em>only </em>when the statutory language is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation. <em>(Souza v. Lauppe </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 865, 872 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 494].) \u201cIf there is no ambiguity in the language of the statute, \u2018then the Legislature is presumed to have meant what it said, and the plain meaning of the language governs.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Lennane </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 263, 268 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 563, 885 P.2d 976].) Succinctly stated, \u201c[w]here the statute is clear, courts will not \u2018interpret away clear language in favor of an ambiguity that does not exist.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Hartford Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Macri </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 318, 326 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 813, 842 P.2d 112].) Although \u201c[a] statute should be construed whenever possible so as to preserve its constitutionality\u201d <em>(Dyna-Med, Inc. v. Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379, 1387 [241 Cal.Rptr. 67, 743 P.2d 1323]), when statutory language is \u201cclear and unambiguous there is no need for construction, and courts should not indulge in it.\u201d <em>(Solberg v. Superior Court </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 182, 198 [137 Cal.Rptr. 460, 561 P.2d 1148].)</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">On its face, section 453, subdivision (d), unambiguously prohibits the inclusion of specified political literature \u201cwith <em>any </em>bill for services or commodities furnished <em>any </em>customer or subscriber . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) Because the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, it would be improper for us to refer to extrinsic evidence, such as legislative history, in an attempt to create an ambiguity from which to construe the -statute as prohibiting <em>ratepayer subsidization </em>of the utilities\u2019 political advocacy. (See <em>Hartford Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Macri, supra, </em>4 Cal.4th at p. 326; <em>Solberg v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number><em>Superior Court, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at p. 198; <em>Farnow v. Superior Court </em>(1990) 226 Cal.App.3d 481, 486 [276 Cal.Rptr. 275] [\u201ca court may not rewrite a law, supply an omission or give words an effect different from the plain and direct import of the terms used\u201d].) The only reasonable interpretation of which the statutory language in section 453, subdivision (d), is susceptible is that it prohibits all political bill inserts, not just political bill inserts subsidized by ratepayers. (See <em>Souza </em>v. <em>Lauppe, supra, </em>59 Cal.App.4th at p. 872.)</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">II. <em>The Statute\u2019s Prohibition Against Inserting Political Literature in Billing Envelopes Is Facially Unconstitutional.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">The First Amendment, made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, \u201cwas fashioned to assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people.\u201d <em>(Roth </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1957) 354 U.S. 476, 484 [77 S.Ct. 1304, 1308, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498].)  It is well established that corporations such as PG&amp;E have the right to freedom of speech, since \u201c[t]he inherent worth of the speech in terms of its capacity for informing the public does not depend upon the identity of its source, whether corporation, association, union, or individual.\u201d <em>(First National Bank of Boston </em>v. <em>Bellotti </em>(1978) 435 U.S. 765, 777 [98 S.Ct. 1407, 1416, 55 L.Ed.2d 707].) Moreover, the newsletter inserted by PG&amp;E in its customers\u2019 bills \u201cincludes the kind of discussion of \u2018matters of public concern\u2019 that the First Amendment both fully protects and implicitly encourages.\u201d <em>(Pacific Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Public Util. Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>475 U.S. at p. 9 [106 S.Ct. at p. 908].) Thus, \u201c[t]here is no doubt that . . . <em>[PG&amp;E] Progress </em>receives the full protection of the First Amendment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 8 [106 S.Ct. at p. 907.) Because section 453, subdivision (d), purports to prohibit constitutionally protected speech, we must determine whether the regulation can be upheld as: \u201c(i) a reasonable time, place, or manner restriction; (ii) a permissible subject-matter regulation; or (iii) a narrowly tailored means of serving a compelling state interest.\u201d <em>(Con Ed, supra, </em>447 U.S. at p. 535 [100 S.Ct. at p. 2332].) For the reasons discussed below, the statute\u2019s blanket prohibition against political bill inserts cannot withstand the constitutional scrutiny required by the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">A regulation that restricts only the time, place, or manner of speech is constitutional as long as the restriction is reasonable. <em>(Con Ed, supra, </em>447 U.S. at pp. 535-536 [100 S.Ct. at pp. 2332-2333]; <em>LinmarkAssociates, Inc. v. Willingboro </em>(1977) 431 U.S. 85, 93 [97 S.Ct. 1614, 1608-1619, 52 L.Ed.2d 155].) However, a statute that regulates speech on the basis of its subject matter \u201c \u2018. . . slip[s] from the neutrality of time, place, and circumstance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>into a concern about content.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Police Department of Chicago v. Mosley </em>(1972) 408 U.S. 92, 99 [92 S.Ct. 2286, 2292, 33 L.Ed.2d 212], fn. omitted.) \u201cTherefore, a constitutionally permissible time, place, or manner restriction may not be based upon either the content or subject matter of speech.\u201d <em>(Con Ed, supra, </em>447 U.S. at p. 536 [100 S.Ct. at p. 2333], fn. omitted.)  Section 453, subdivision (d), is clearly content-related. PG&amp;E is free to include its newsletter in the billing envelopes as long as the newsletter does not contain discussion of the restricted political issues. Indeed, the statute seeks \u201cto suppress certain bill inserts precisely because they address [political] issues.\u201d (447 U.S. at p. 537 [100 S.Ct. at p. 2333].) Thus, the statute cannot be upheld as a <em>content-neutral </em>time, place, or manner regulation. (I<em>bid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Nor is the statute justified as a permissible subject-matter regulation. (See <em>Con Ed, supra, </em>447 U.S. at pp. 537-540 [100 S.Ct. at pp. 2333-2334].) In <em>Con Ed, </em>the United States Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of an order issued by the New York Public Service Commission prohibiting utilities from including in monthly bill envelopes inserts discussing controversial issues of public policy. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 532 [100 S.Ct. at pp. 2330-2331].) The New York Public Service Commission argued that the subject-matter regulation in that case was permissible because it was viewpoint-neutral and was justified by the special interests of a government in overseeing the use of its property. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 537-540 [100 S.Ct. at pp. 2333-2334].) In rejecting these arguments, the high court held that \u201c[t]he First Amendment\u2019s hostility to content-based regulation extends not only to restrictions on particular viewpoints, but also to prohibition of public discussion of an entire topic.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 537 [100 S.Ct. at p. 2333].) It further held that the utilities\u2019 billing envelopes did not constitute government property, the protection of which could justify a refusal to allow partisan political advocacy. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 540 [100 S.Ct. at pp. 2334-2335].) As with the remarkably similar regulation at issue in <em>Con Ed, </em>section 453, subdivision (d), attempts to restrict public utilities\u2019 discussion of entire topics and cannot be justified as a permissible subject-matter regulation. (See <em>Con Ed, supra, </em>at pp. 537-540 [100 S.Ct. at pp. 2333-2335].)</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Finally, section 453, subdivision (d), cannot be justified as a narrowly tailored means of serving a compelling state interest. (See <em>Con Ed, supra, </em>447 U.S. at pp. 540-544 [100 S.Ct. at pp. 2334-2337].) Respondents argue that section 453, subdivision (d)\u2019s ban on the insertion of political literature in billing envelopes serves the state\u2019s compelling interest in preventing ratepayers from being forced to subsidize PG&amp;E\u2019s political speech in violation of <em>Abood, supra, 431 </em>U.S. at page 210 [97 S.Ct. at pages 1786-1787]. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number><em>Abood, </em>the United States Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of an agency shop clause under which the Detroit Board of Education required its employees to pay dues to the board\u2019s representative union, which utilized the dues, in part, to further its political purposes. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 209 [97 S.Ct. at p. 1786].) The high court held that requiring employees to contribute to the support of ideological causes they may oppose unconstitutionally infringed upon their freedom of association protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. (431 U.S. at p. 210 [97 S.Ct. at pp. 1786-1787].) Although we may conclude from <em>Abood </em>that the state has a compelling interest in preventing a governmental entity, or in this case an entity regulated by the government, from unconstitutionally infringing upon individuals\u2019 First Amendment rights, the question remains whether section 453, subdivision (d), is a narrowly tailored means of accomplishing that end.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Regulations related to the subject matter of speech are subject to strict scrutiny and will pass constitutional muster only if they \u201cserve a compelling state interest in a manner which imposes the least possible burden on expression.\u201d <em>(U.S. Sound &amp; Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>Township of Brick </em>(3d Cir. 1997) 126 F.3d 555, 558.) Because, as discussed above, section 453, subdivision (d), is related to the content of the prohibited speech, in order for the statute to survive constitutional scrutiny, it must represent the least restrictive means of serving the state\u2019s interest. (126 F.3d at p. 558; <em>Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union </em>(1997) 521 U.S. 844, 874 [117 S.Ct. 2329, 2345-2346, 138 L.Ed.2d 874].) It does not. If the Legislature\u2019s intention in enacting section 453, subdivision (d), was to follow <em>Abood, supra, </em>431 U.S. 209, by preventing forced contribution to the support of public utilities\u2019 political advocacy in violation of the ratepayers\u2019 First Amendment rights, then the Legislature could easily have utilized more precise language to achieve that goal without completely banning the inclusion of political literature in billing envelopes. Instead, the sweeping language implemented by the Legislature unconstitutionally fails \u201cto avoid unnecessary abridgement\u201d of public utilities\u2019 protected speech. <em>(Buckley </em>v. <em>Valeo </em>(1976) 424 U.S. 1, 25 [96 S.Ct. 612, 638, 46 L.Ed.2d 659].) Thus, the regulation cannot be justified as a narrowly tailored means of serving a compelling state interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Because section 453, subdivision (d), can only be inteipreted as prohibiting the inclusion of protected speech in billing envelopes, and the prohibition cannot be justified as a reasonable time, place or manner restriction, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>permissible subject-matter regulation, or a narrowly tailored means of serving a compelling state interest, the statute \u201cpose[s] a present, total and fatal conflict\u201d with the First Amendment and is, therefore, unconstitutional <em>on its face </em>and cannot be applied under any circumstances. <em>(Pacific Legal Foundation </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 168, 180-181 [172 Cal.Rptr. 487, 624 P.2d 1215]; <em>Kunz </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1951) 340 U.S. 290, 304 [71 S.Ct. 312, 320, 95 L.Ed. 280] [a statute which discloses \u201cby its very language that it is impossible of construction in a manner consistent with First Amendment rights\u201d is facially unconstitutional]; <em>Women\u2019s Medical Professional Corp. </em>v. <em>Voinovich </em>(6th Cir. 1997) 130 F.3d 187, 193 [\u201c[i]f a statute is unconstitutional on its face, the State may not enforce the statute under any circumstances\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">III. <em>PUC\u2019s Order Enforcing the Facially Unconstitutional Statute Must Be Set Aside.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Respondents\u2019 argument that PUC\u2019s May 13, 1999 order was necessary to prevent forced ratepayer subsidization of PG&amp;E\u2019s political speech in violation of <em>Abood, supra, </em>431 U.S. 209, is misleading and meritless.  \u201c[A]n administrative order cannot be upheld unless the grounds upon which the agency acted in exercising its powers were those upon which its action can be sustained.\u201d <em>(Securities Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Chenery Corp. </em>(1943) 318 U.S. 80, 95 [63 S.Ct. 454, 462, 87 L.Ed. 626].) The complaint in this case alleged that PG&amp;E violated section 453, subdivision (d).  Complainants argued for PUC\u2019s jurisdiction based upon violation of the statute and sought to have PUC enforce the statute against PG&amp;E. In its decision, PUC did not find that the inclusion of the subject literature in the customers\u2019 bills resulted in ratepayers\u2019 contribution to the support of PG&amp;E\u2019s political advocacy in violation of <em>Abood. </em>On the contrary, in response to PG&amp;E\u2019s argument that none of the costs associated with the printing and insertion of the literature into the billing envelopes were recovered from ratepayers, in violation of title 16 of the United States Code section 2623(b)(5), the commission stated in its decision: \u201cBecause of the view we take of the violation of Pub. Util. Code \u00a7 453(d), we do not reach this issue.\u201d Instead, PUC\u2019s May 13, 1999 order was based directly upon its finding that PG&amp;E violated section 453, subdivision (d), \u201cin that PG&amp;E did include with bills for services to its customers literature designed or intended to promote or defeat any change in federal legislation or regulations.\u201d Since \u201can agency\u2019s order must be upheld, if at all, \u2018on the same basis articulated in the order by the agency itself\u2019 \u201d <em>(FPC v.
