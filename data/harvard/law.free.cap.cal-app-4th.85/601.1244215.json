City maintains applicant is not entitled to section 4850 benefits because the parties have stipulated applicant\u2019s condition is permanent and stationary according to medical evidence. This stipulation gives it the unqualified right, argues City, to retire applicant consistent with Government Code section 21164 and, therefore, terminate entitlement to Labor Code section 4850 benefits, notwithstanding applicant\u2019s participation in vocational rehabilitation. We disagree. Although we affirm the result reached by the Board, we granted review because we find no decisional law directly discussing the complex issues presented in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">The pertinent facts are not disputed. City employed respondent applicant as a full-time police officer when she sustained industrial injuries to her right knee on September 17, 1991, and February 12, 1992. Originally, by stipulated Board award on March 22, 1994, the parties agreed to a permanent partial disability rating of 15 1/2 percent and a precautionary need for future medical treatment. Following two surgeries and light duty assignments in the parking reimbursement program, the condition of applicant\u2019s knee eventually declined to the point where she could no longer perform the full-time patrol duties required of a police officer. Applicant\u2019s temporary light duty position ended on June 16, 1995, her last date of employment with City.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Applicant\u2019s treating physician, Frederic W. Bost, M.D., had reported to City on May 1, 1995, stating applicant\u2019s medical condition was \u201cpermanent and stationary\u201d for rating her permanent disability, and she was a \u201cqualified injured worker\u201d ready for vocational rehabilitation. A petition to reopen had been timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">City commenced vocational rehabilitation services. However, City refused to pay applicant the balance of her section 4850 benefits in lieu of maintenance allowance payments. Instead, City advanced PERS disability pension payments under section 4850.3 and sought to retire applicant on a PERS industrial disability pension, effective June 17, 1995. Applicant disputed the separation date, claiming entitlement to the balance of her section 4850 benefits while she was participating in vocational rehabilitation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">A pretrial hearing was held before the workers\u2019 compensation administrative law judge (WCJ) on August 25, 1995. At the hearing, the parties stipulated to June 16, 1995, the last date applicant worked for City, as the date her condition was \u201cpermanent and stationary.\u201d Pretrial briefs were filed. The case proceeded to trial on September 22, 1995. The WCJ deemed the matter submitted on October 10, 1995, after the parties filed posttrial briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">On October 18, 1995, the WCJ ordered submission vacated for further briefing, stating as pertinent: \u201cParties having stipulated that applicant\u2019s condition became medically permanent and stationary as of June 16, 1995; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>parties having briefed the issue of whether [City] under [Government Code section 21164], could without applicant\u2019s consent, unilaterally elect to retire applicant effective June 17, 1995, prior to her condition becoming permanent and stationary vocationally as relating to entitlement of [section 4850] one year salary; the undersigned having reviewed the recent decision of <em>[Fogle </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. {Fogle) </em>(1995) 60 Cal.Comp.Cases 760, writ denied], <em>Fogle </em>having not been addressed by the parties . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The parties briefed <em>Fogle </em>in light of an earlier Board panel decision after reconsideration, <em>Tognetti </em>v. <em>Town of Hillsborough </em>(WCAB) SFO 354134, 356695, filed on June 10, 1992, which reached the opposite result. Like <em>Fogle, </em>review was summarily denied by Division Four of this appellate court. <em>(Tognetti v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., Town of Hillsborough </em>(1993) 58 Cal.Comp.Cases 170, writ den.) The record in the case at bar contains <em>Tognetti, supra, </em>SFO 354134, 356695, as well as the Board panel opinion and order denying reconsideration in <em>Fogle (Fogle v. City of South San Francisco </em>(WCAB, Jan. 13, 1995) SFO 367313). <em>Fogle </em>supported City\u2019s position; and <em>Tognetti </em>supported applicant\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Following submission after additional briefing, the WCJ issued his decision, finding applicant\u2019s condition was \u201cmedically permanent and stationary\u201d on June 16, 1995. However, the WCJ further determined applicant\u2019s condition was not \u201cvocationally permanent and stationary.\u201d Hence, City could not invoke Government Code section 21164 to retire applicant without her consent while she was undergoing vocational rehabilitation. The WCJ ordered City to pay applicant the balance of her section 4850 benefits until completion of vocational rehabilitation. The WCJ did not find the Board decision in <em>Fogle </em>dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">The Board granted City\u2019s petition for reconsideration. The Board likewise was not persuaded by <em>Fogle </em>and soundly rejected City\u2019s position that the 1989 amendment to section 139.5(c) creating \u201cmaintenance allowance\u201d payments changed the meaning of \u201cpermanent and stationary\u201d as defined by the Supreme Court. <em>(LeBoeuf v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 234, 242-243 [193 Cal.Rptr. 547, 666 P.2d 989] <em>(LeBoeuf), </em>citing with approval <em>Ponce De Leon v.

Beck and Co. </em>(1978) 43 Cal.Comp.Cases 3, 7 <em>(Tangye </em>v. <em>Beck). </em>Citing <em>LeBoeuf, Tangye v. Beck </em>and <em>Ponce De Leon, </em>the Board concluded applicant\u2019s condition was not \u201cpermanent and stationary\u201d for purposes of Government Code section 21164 until it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>was both medically <em>and </em>vocationally permanent and stationary. Hence, City could not retire applicant without her consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">This petition for writ of review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Essential to the proper application of Government Code section 21164 on this record, in conjunction with Labor Code sections 139.5(c) and 4850, is an understanding of the historical basis of the key workers\u2019 compensation concepts and corresponding statutory benefits and lexicon. To place City\u2019s specific contentions in proper context, our discussion will include a review of basic workers\u2019 compensation concepts, when appropriate, including temporary and permanent disability indemnity; the purpose of vocational rehabilitation and its statutory evolution in California; the historical meaning of the term \u201cpermanent and stationary\u201d; its development by the Supreme Court in <em>LeBoeuf, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d 234; the special benefits available to injured police officers under the Government and Labor Codes; and the role of the Margolin-Bill Greene Reform Act of 1989; in particular, the resultant key amendments to sections 139.5(c) and 4850.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">\n<em>Basic Workers\u2019 Compensation Concepts and Benefits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">\n<em>Temporary Disability Benefits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">Temporary disability indemnity is the basic benefit payable to an injured employee who is temporarily disabled due to industrial injury; it serves as a substitute for wages lost by the employee during the time he or she is actually incapacitated from working. <em>(Jimenez </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 61, 63 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 660].) Temporary disability benefits cease when the employee returns to work or is deemed medically able to return to work, or when the employee\u2019s medical condition becomes permanent and stationary. <em>(Ritchie v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 1174, 1179 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 722] <em>(Ritchie).) </em>\u201cDisability ceases to be temporary, and is therefore permanent, when treatment has restored the employee to the full extent that the permanent character of the injury will permit.\u201d (1 Hanna, Cal. Law of Employee Injuries and Workers\u2019 Compensation (rev. 2d ed., 2000) Temporary Disability Benefits, \u00a7 7.02[2], p. 7-9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b468-11\">\n<em>Permanent Disability Benefits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b468-12\">Permanent disability, like temporary disability, may compensate for an employee\u2019s actual incapacity to work; it also compensates for residual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>physical and mental impairments, with \u201cconsideration being given to the diminished ability of such injured employee to compete in an open labor market\u201d (\u00a7 4660, subd. (a)). (See generally 1 Hanna, Cal. Law of Employee Injuries and Workers\u2019 Compensation, <em>supra, </em>Permanent Disability Benefits, \u00a7 8.01, pp. 8-5 to 8-6.) In general terms, a \u201cpermanent disability\u201d is the condition remaining after an injured employee\u2019s condition has stabilized, i.e., is permanent and stationary. <em>(Id., </em>at p. 8-5; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 8, \u00a7 10152 [\u201cA disability is considered permanent after the employee has reached maximum medical improvement or his or her condition has been stationary for a reasonable period of time.\u201d].) An injured employee cannot be temporarily and permanently disabled at the same time; thus, permanent disability payments do not begin until temporary disability payments cease. <em>(Ritchie, supra, </em>24 Cal.App.4th at p. 1180; \u00a7 4650, subd. (b).) Moreover, a permanent disability rating cannot be calculated until an injured employee\u2019s medical condition is permanent and stationary. <em>(LeBoeuf, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d at p. 238.) Permanent disability benefits are in addition to any temporary disability benefits, which may be paid or are owing. (\u00a7 4661.)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">\n<em>Vocational Rehabilitation Prior to January 1, 1990</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Vocational rehabilitation is the hub of workers\u2019 compensation: it embraces both physical and vocational restoration. <em>(Moyer v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 222, 232-233 [110 Cal.Rptr. 144, 514 P.2d 1224]; 2 Hanna, Cal. Law of Employee Injuries and Workers\u2019 Compensation, <em>supra, </em>Vocational Rehabilitation, \u00a7 35.01, p. 35-8.) To reach this end, the law encourages qualified injured employees to engage in vocational rehabilitation by providing for specified services and payment of designated benefits and costs. <em>(Ritchie, supra, </em>24 Cal.App.4th at p. 1180; see generally 2 Hanna, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 35.10 to 35.19, pp. 35-22 to 35-37.)</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Prior to January 1, 1990, the issue at bar could not have been presented. Whether an employee\u2019s condition was permanent and stationary was immaterial to involuntary retirement under Government Code section 21164 where the employee was qualified for vocational rehabilitation. Under Labor Code former Labor Code section 139.5(c),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> entitlement to temporary disability payments was extended during vocational rehabilitation, and accordingly, for a police officer such as applicant, section 4850 benefits existed in lieu of temporary disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>In theory, the Legislature had \u201ccontemplated the \u2018ideal situation\u2019 in which the [injured employee] is identified as being in need of vocational rehabilitation <em>while still medically temporarily disabled </em>and that immediate steps would be taken to initiate the vocational rehabilitation process.\u201d (2 Hanna, Cal. Law of Employee Injuries and Workers\u2019 Compensation, <em>supra, </em>Vocational Rehabilitation, \u00a7 35.02, p. 35-10, italics added; <em>Ponce De Leon, supra, </em>42 Cal.Comp.Cases 962, 968.) The fully rehabilitated employee would quickly reenter the work force before his or her condition became permanent and stationary, having received the benefit of continuing temporary disability payments during vocational rehabilitation. <em>(Ritchie, supra, </em>24 Cal.App.4th at p. 1181.) Thereafter, permanent disability would be rated, and a finite number of permanent disability payments would commence to help ease the employee\u2019s return to the labor market. The employer, on the other hand, received the benefit of a permanent disability rating reflecting the injured employee\u2019s fully rehabilitated medical <em>and vocational </em>status. In actual practice, however, the ideal situation rarely occurred. (2 Hanna, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 35.02, p. 35-10; <em>Ponce De Leon, supra, </em>42 Cal.Comp.Cases 962, 968.) Usually, for any number of reasons, vocational rehabilitation procedures did not begin until after the injured employee was \u201cmedically rehabilitated\u201d and had \u201cbecome stationary from a purely medical standpoint.\u201d <em>(Ponce De Leon, supra, </em>at p. 968.) Because temporary disability and permanent disability cannot be paid at the same time, it was customary to defer the latter until vocational rehabilitation was completed. (2 Herlick, Cal. Workers\u2019 Compensation Law (5th ed. 2000) \u00a7 21.3, pp. 21-20 to 21-22; <em>Tangye v. Beck, supra, </em>43 Cal.Comp.Cases 3, 7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\"><em>LeBoeuf </em>was decided within this milieu, and the judicially created distinction between medically and vocationally permanent and stationary was embedded in workers\u2019 compensation law for purposes of accurately assessing permanent disability entitlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">\n<em>LeBoeuf: Judicial Genesis of \u201cVocationally Permanent and Stationary\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\"><em>LeBoeuf, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d 234 arose in the context of a petition to reopen for an increased permanent disability award <em>after </em>completion of the vocational rehabilitation process. Initially, injury and permanent disability were contested and litigated in <em>LeBoeuf </em>A determination regarding vocational rehabilitation entitlement was deferred pending the Board\u2019s decision on injury. The Board found injury and awarded permanent disability benefits to the employee based on a 60 percent rating. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 238.) The Rehabilitation Bureau (currently the Rehabilitation Unit (hereafter RU)) then issued its determination regarding employee LeBoeuf\u2019s entitlement to vocational rehabilitation. It was not disputed he was <em>medically </em>eligible for vocational <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>rehabilitation because his injury prevented him from returning to his usual and customary occupation. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 239.) However, due to the severity of the disability, the RU found the employee was not likely to benefit from vocational rehabilitation and return to suitable gainful employment. Accordingly, the RU determined the employee was <em>vocationally </em>ineligible for vocational rehabilitation and thus not a qualified injured worker (QIW) under former section 139.5(c). (34 Cal.3d at pp. 239-240.)</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">LeBoeuf then filed a petition to reopen his prior permanent disability award, seeking an increase in his rating to 100 percent based on his total inability to compete in the open labor market. <em>(LeBoeuf, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d at p. 240.) The primary issue presented to the Supreme Court was whether a decision by the RU finding the injured employee was not a QIW for vocational rehabilitation purposes constituted good cause to reopen his prior permanent disability award. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 240-241.) The Supreme Court held that it was and remanded the matter to the Board to take further evidence on the issue of increased permanent disability. Inability to be retrained for any suitable employment, stated the court, was a factor to be considered in calculating an injured employee\u2019s permanent disability rating. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 243.) \u201cThe statutory scheme envisions that vocational rehabilitation will be provided an injured worker <em>before </em>a final decision is reached on the nature and extent of his or her permanent disability.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 242, italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">The court additionally opined as follows: \u201cIf job training makes it possible for a worker to compete in a new sector of the labor market for which he or she was previously unprepared, the worker\u2019s permanent disability rating and award will reflect this fact.\u201d <em>(LeBoeuf, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d at p. 243.) The court emphasized \u201c \u2018\u201c[i]t seems clear that [the Legislature] intended a worker\u2019s disability should not be permanent and stationary until he was both vocationally and medically rehabilitated.\u201d \u2019 <em>(Webb </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>[(1980)] 28 Cal.3d [621,] 627 [170 Cal.Rptr. 32, 620 P.2d 618], quoting from <em>Ponce De Leon </em>v. <em>Glaser Bros.[, supra,] </em>42 Cal.Comp.Cases 962, 968; see also <em>Tangye </em>v. <em>Henry C. Beck and Co.[, supra,] </em>43 Cal.Comp.Cases 3, 7.) This is to ensure that the permanent disability rating upon which an award is based accurately reflects both the permanent and vocational disabilities. HQ Establishing the right to rehabilitation benefits prior to any final determination of a worker\u2019s permanent disability is consistent with the general rule that consideration should be given to the injured workers\u2019 \u2018diminished ability ... to compete in an open labor market.\u2019 \u201d <em>(LeBoeuf, supra, </em>at pp. 242-243; accord, <em>Gill </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1985) 167 Cal.App.3d 306, 309-310 [213 Cal.Rptr. 140].)</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">From a procedural standpoint, this court acknowledges a <em>LeBoeuf </em>situation is unlikely to occur under the current vocational rehabilitation statutes; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>nonetheless, we emphasize that <em>LeBoeuf </em>remains good law. Against this background, the Legislature in 1989 created \u201cmaintenance allowance\u201d to replace \u201ctemporary disability\u201d as compensation for injured employees during vocational rehabilitation <em>after </em>their condition is declared medically permanent and stationary.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">\n<em>Vocational Rehabilitation Benefits After January 1, 1990</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">As part of the Margolin-Bill Greene Reform Act of 1989, the Legislature enacted sections 4635 through 4647, which significantly changed many of the requirements imposed on employers and employees concerning vocational rehabilitation for injuries on or after January 1, 1990. (See generally 2 Hanna, Cal. Law of Employee Injuries and Workers\u2019 Compensation, <em>supra, </em>Vocational Rehabilitation, \u00a7 35.03[2], pp. 35-12 to 35-13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Section 139.5(c) also was amended to provide for the continuation of temporary disability payments during vocational rehabilitation until the employee\u2019s medical condition is permanent and stationary, at which time the temporary disability payments cease and the employee becomes entitled to receive \u201cmaintenance allowance\u201d payments.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (2 Hanna, Cal. Law of Employee Injuries and Workers\u2019 Compensation, <em>supra, </em>Vocational Rehabilitation, \u00a7 35.03[2], p. 35-12.) Maintenance allowance payments are compensated at a lower weekly rate than vocational rehabilitation temporary disability payments. (\u00a7 139.5, subd. (d)(1).) Like temporary disability payments (\u00a7 4653), maintenance allowance payments are computed at two-thirds of the employee\u2019s average weekly earnings on the date of injury (\u00a7 139.5, subd. (d)(1)). However, maintenance allowance payments are paid currently at a weekly maximum of $246 <em>(ibid.); </em>whereas, the current weekly statutory maximum for temporary disability payments is $735 (\u00a7 4453, subd. (a)(7)). Obviously, the intent of the Legislature in creating maintenance allowance payments once an employee\u2019s condition is permanent and stationary was to provide a financial incentive to quickly complete vocational rehabilitation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (See <em>Ritchie, supra, </em>24 Cal.App.4th at p. 1183.) \u201cIn no event shall temporary disability indemnity and maintenance allowance be payable concurrently.\u201d (\u00a7 139.5, subd. (d)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>Employees have the \u201coption\u201d under subdivision (d)(2) of section 139.5 to supplement the lower weekly maintenance allowance payments with advances deducted from \u201cpermanent disability indemnity due or payable\u201d up to an amount not to exceed the temporary disability rate. This provision clearly requires the employee\u2019s medical condition to be permanent and stationary and ratable because permanent disability \u201cdue or payable\u201d to supplement the maintenance allowance payments during vocational rehabilitation cannot otherwise be estimated or assessed. Consequently, injured employees in vocational rehabilitation routinely have their permanent disability' rating determined either before or while engaged in vocational rehabilitation. (See <em>Mosier v. Travelers Ins. Co. </em>(1992) 12 Cal. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rptr. 12, 13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">We turn our attention now to an overview of the workers\u2019 compensation benefits and issues exclusive to police officers in the PERS system such as applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">\n<em>Special Compensation Benefits and Issues Exclusive to PERS Police Officers</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">Section 4850 provides an eligible injured police officer full salary \u201cin lieu of temporary disability payments <em>or maintenance allowance payments </em>under [sjection 139.5\u201d for one year or until such earlier date when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>officer is retired on a disability pension.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>(Ritchie, supra, </em>24 Cal.App.4th at p. 1180, italicized text added by Stats. 1990 (1989-1990 Reg.

It is not disputed that section 4850 benefits terminate upon a valid retirement, even if not exhausted, even if a police officer\u2019s condition is not yet permanent and stationary, and even if a police officer later receives vocational rehabilitation services. <em>(Ritchie, supra, </em>24 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1186-1189.) In <em>Gourley </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number><em>City of Napa </em>(1975) 48 Cal.App.3d 156 [121 Cal.Rptr. 290], this court emphasized: \u201cIf the Legislature had intended to give a disabled employee an absolute right to leave of absence with pay for one year, in all probability it would not have included the words \u2018or until such earlier date as he is retired on permanent disability pension\u2019 in Labor Code section 4850.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 161.) Moreover, \u201c[i]n like manner, if the Legislature had intended that the employee\u2019s retirement (and subsequent termination of his leave of absence under \u00a7 4850) was to be at his option, it would not have included the wording \u2018is retired\u2019 in the subject statute.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 162.) This decisional law is consistent with the' involuntary retirement provision inherent in Government Code section 21164.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Here, City\u2019s reliance on <em>Ritchie, supra, </em>24 Cal.App.4th 1174 to support its attempt to retire applicant without her consent under Government Code section 21164 while she was engaged in vocational rehabilitation, however, is misplaced. <em>Ritchie </em>easily is distinguished. Officer Ritchie, a police detective, was injured on August 20, 1991, was declared medically permanent and stationary sometime between February and April 1992 and was retired under PERS industrial disability and receiving pension benefits on April 26 or 27, 1992. (24 Cal.App.4th at p. 1178.) He did not contest the retirement, and it became final. He also was evaluated and declared suitable for vocational rehabilitation services on April 27, 1992. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The parties finally agreed on a modified plan for law school, but not on the officer\u2019s request for regular maintenance allowance payments under Labor Code section 139.5(c) subsequent to the date of his retirement. A conference was held before the RU on October 14, 1992. The RU\u2019s denial of Officer Ritchie\u2019s request was upheld by the Board under Labor Code section 4853.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On review, the Fifth Appellate District affirmed and held section 4853 prohibited receipt of maintenance allowance payments under section 139.5 after the effective date of a valid disability retirement. (24 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1188-1189.)</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">In our case, unlike <em>Ritchie, </em>applicant neither consented to retirement nor was she retired when she sought vocational rehabilitation. The source of the dispute here is City\u2019s unilateral attempt to involuntarily retire applicant on a disability pension effective on the last day of her light duty assignment and employment with City in her capacity as a police officer. Her right thereafter to vocational rehabilitation was undisputed. Applicant consistently has maintained she is entitled to the balance of her section 4850 benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>(approximately four months) in lieu of maintenance allowance payments under section 139.5(c) while she was engaged in vocational rehabilitation prior to her disability pension retirement. The disputed retirement date was properly before the Board and is now before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">\n<em>Meaning of \u201cPermanent and Stationary\u201d in Government Code Section 21164</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Government Code section 21164 provides: \u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of this article, the retirement for disability of a local safety member, other than a school safety member, shall not be effective without the member\u2019s consent earlier than the date upon which leave of absence without loss of salary under Section 4850 of the Labor Code because of the disability terminates, or the earlier date during the leave as of which the disability is permanent and stationary as found by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board.\u201d The pivotal issue we resolve here is the meaning of \u201cpermanent and stationary\u201d in Government Code section 21164 in light of both the 1989 change to Labor Code section 139.5(c) replacing temporary disability payments with maintenance allowance payments for employees engaged in vocational rehabilitation after their condition is permanent and stationary, and the 1990 change to Labor Code section 4850 specifying police officers are entitled to section 4850 benefits in lieu of maintenance allowance payments as well as temporary disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">The applicable canons of statutory construction, which guide our analysis, are well established. The fundamental rule is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature in enacting the statutes. <em>(Moyer v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>10 Cal.3d 222, 230.) In determining the intent, we examine first the words of the statutes. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 231.) Words, however, do not have fixed meanings; they are symbols of thought whose meanings may vary depending upon the context and circumstances in which they are used. <em>(Henry v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 981, 984 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 631].) We consider the consequences of our interpretation and avoid constructions that defy common sense, frustrate the apparent intent of the Legislature or might lead to absurdity. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 985.) It is presumed the Legislature is aware of the existence of all relevant statutes when it considers a change or amends others. <em>(Nickelsberg v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 288, 298 [285 Cal.Rptr. 86, 814 P.2d 1328].) The statutes \u201cshould be interpreted in such a way as to make them consistent with each other, rather than obviate one another.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">We emphasize that statutes in the Labor Code and Government Code concerning the same subject matter must not only be read together but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>reconciled whenever feasible toward the common goal of granting additional benefits to public sector law enforcement employees. (See <em>Tuolumne County Deputy Sheriffs\u2019 Assn. v. Board of Administration </em>(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 1236, 1239-1240 [257 Cal.Rptr. 824].)  This latter principle is particularly compelling in the case at bar, where Government Code section 21164 explicitly defers to the \u201cWorkers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board\u201d to determine when an employee\u2019s condition is permanent and stationary.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">This reviewing court, like the Board, is enjoined by section 3202 to construe the workers\u2019 compensation provisions of the Labor Code liberally \u201c \u2018with the purpose of extending their benefits for the protection of persons injured in the course of their employment.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Mathews </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 719, 726 [100 Cal.Rptr. 301, 493 P.2d 1165]; accord, <em>Smith v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 530, 537 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 186].) As well, any ambiguity or uncertainty in the meaning of PERS legislation is to be liberally construed in favor of the public employee, as long as such construction is consistent with the clear language and purpose of the statute. <em>(Ventura County Deputy Sheriffs\u2019 Assn. v. Board of Retirement </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 483, 490 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 304, 940 P.2d 891]; <em>Thelander </em>v. <em>City of El Monte </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 736, 748 [195 Cal.Rptr. 318].)</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">With these principles in mind, we address the precise arguments raised by City.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">\n<em>Creation of Maintenance Allowance Neither Overruled LeBoeuf Nor Changed the Subtext of Permanent and Stationary in Workers\u2019 Compensation Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">City argues the creation of maintenance allowance to replace temporary disability as compensation for employees in vocational rehabilitation once their medical condition is declared permanent and stationary under section 139.5(c) substantially changed the analysis of permanent and stationary in <em>LeBoeuf, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d 234, 242-243, <em>Ponce De Leon, supra, </em>42 Cal.Comp.Cases 962, 968, and <em>Tangye v. Beck, supra, </em>43 Cal.Comp.Cases 3, 7. We find no support for this assertion in the statutes, the legislative history or the decisional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-12\">The clarification of section 4850 by the Legislature in 1990 to allow for full salary in lieu of maintenance allowance payments during vocational rehabilitation left no doubt a PERS police officer continues to receive section 4850 benefits through the covered period while other employees will receive the reduced maintenance allowance payments under section 139.5(c) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>during vocational rehabilitation. Regarding the 1990 amendment to section 4850, a report from Senator Greene, who was one of the authors of the 1989 reform legislation and chair of the Senate Committee on Industrial Relations, indicated, in relevant part, as follows: \u201cFull Salary in Lieu of Maintenance Allowance. It is clarified that public safety officers who receive full salary in lieu of temporary disability benefits, which used to continue during participation in rehabilitation, <em>continue to receive full salary in lieu of the new maintenance allowance </em>payable during rehabilitation.\u201d (Sen. Com. on Industrial Relations, com. on Assem. Bill No. 2910 (1989-1990 Reg. Sess.) Aug. 8, 1990, p. 8, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\"> Qty relies primarily on <em>Mosier </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., supra, </em>12 Cal. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rptr. 12 <em>(Mosier).</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em>\n</em> Reading <em>Mosier </em>broadly and out of context, City posits: by replacing temporary disability payments with maintenance allowance payments, the Legislature intended to overrule, sub silentio, the <em>LeBoeuf </em>line of cases and then to provide a vehicle by way of Government Code section 21164 to allow City to promptly and unilaterally retire an officer in vocational rehabilitation as soon as her condition is declared medically permanent and stationary. We find nothing in <em>Mosier </em>to support City\u2019s theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">In <em>Mosier, </em>the carrier objected to a trial setting on the issue of permanent disability because the injured employee was participating in vocational rehabilitation and receiving a maintenance allowance. The WCJ sustained the objection and dismissed the application, relying on <em>Harklerode v. Young\u2019s Market Co. </em>(1979) 44 Cal.Comp.Cases 561 [7 Cal. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rptr. 120] <em>(Harklerode). </em>In <em>Harklerode, </em>the Board, en banc, had held a permanent disability may be determined pending vocational rehabilitation only if neither party objects or if vocational rehabilitation benefits are not actually being received. (44 Cal.Comp.Cases at p. 562 [7 Cal. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rptr. 120].) The WCJ in <em>Mosier </em>therefore assumed he could not determine permanent disability if one party objected and dismissed the application for adjudication of permanent disability. Employee Mosier filed a petition for removal. In response, the WCJ confessed error and recommended the Board grant removal, which it did. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The Board panel rescinded the dismissal order. In <em>Harklerode, supra, </em>44 Cal.Comp.Cases at page 562, the Board declared it had followed its decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>in <em>Tangye v. Beck, supra, </em>43 Cal.Comp.Cases 3. <em>(Mosier, supra, </em>21 Cal. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rptr. 12.) And in <em>Tangye v. Beck, </em>the Board had held an employee\u2019s disability could not be finally determined to be permanent and stationary until vocational rehabilitation was completed to ensure temporary disability payments throughout the duration of vocational rehabilitation and to avoid concurrent receipt of permanent disability and temporary disability payments. <em>(Mosier, supra, </em>21 Cal. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rptr at p. 13.) However, <em>Mosier </em>recognized the 1989 amendment to section 139.5 not only provides for a maintenance allowance after an employee\u2019s medical condition is permanent and stationary, but additionally allows the employee to supplement the decreased weekly maintenance allowance payments with advances from permanent disability. Because the indirect economic incentive of cases leading to its decision in <em>Harklerode </em>was no longer necessary after the Margolin-Bill Greene Reform Act of 1989, it \u201ctherefore seems no longer valid that an applicant cannot have a determination of permanent disability while receiving vocational rehabilitation benefits.\u201d <em>(Mosier, </em>at p. 13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Here, City clearly reads too much into Mosier\u2019s recognition that the 1989 and subsequent legislative changes may require a determination of permanent disability prior to the conclusion of vocational rehabilitation. <em>Mosier </em>does not discuss <em>LeBoeuf </em>for the obvious reason that no change in the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>LeBoeuf </em>was intended by <em>Mosier. </em>In <em>Mosier, </em>the Board merely recognized the obvious: a determination during vocational rehabilitation, for permanent disability rating purposes, of whether an employee\u2019s medical condition is permanent and stationary will allow for a more accurate calculation of the amount of the employee\u2019s ultimate permanent disability award than might be expected to be available to supplement the maintenance allowance. (See \u00a7 139.5, subds. (c) &amp; (d).) Contrary to City\u2019s insistence, we find no indication in <em>Mosier </em>of legislative intent to enact a meaningless provision with its 1990 clarification of section 4850. Canons of statutory construction, as well as common sense and logic, prevent us from construing section 4850 to provide for a maintenance allowance benefit in addition to temporary disability <em>and </em>simultaneously make the full salary in lieu of maintenance allowance provision unavailable to injured police officers in vocational rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">The Board decision in <em>Girard </em>v. <em>West Sacramento Police Dept. </em>(1997) 25 Cal. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rptr. 339 is more to the point. In <em>Girard, </em>the Board rescinded a WCJ decision refusing to award section 4850 benefits to a police officer who was medically permanent and stationary but who was participating in a vocational rehabilitation program. Like City in this case, when Officer Girard became eligible for section 4850 benefits in lieu of a maintenance allowance while participating in vocational rehabilitation, the City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>of Sacramento placed the officer on involuntary disability retirement status under Government Code section 21164 and terminated his section 4850 benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">The Board in <em>Girard, </em>as here, emphasized the 1990 amendment to section 4850 clarified that police officers are entitled to full pay, not just in lieu of temporary disability, but specifically and expressly in lieu of the maintenance allowance paid under section 139.5(c). The Board opined the Legislature itself specifically differentiates the medically permanent and stationary element of permanent disability by denoting the maintenance allowance under section 139.5(c) is not payable until an employee\u2019s medical condition becomes permanent and stationary. (\u00a7 139.5(c); <em>Girard v. West Sacramento Police Dept., supra, </em>25 Cal. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rptr. 339.)</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Turning to the provision on involuntary retirement in Government Code section 21164, the panel in <em>Girard, </em>like the instant panel, noted that a police officer could not be retired involuntarily prior to expiration of Labor Code section 4850 benefits or the earlier date \u201cas of which the disability is permanent and stationary as found by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a721164.) <em>Girard </em>reviewed the well-accepted Board definition of \u201cpermanent and stationary\u201d set out in <em>Ponce De Leon, supra, </em>42 Cal.Comp.Cases 962, 968, and approved in <em>LeBoeuf, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d 234. Reading the 1989 and 1990 amendments in light of existing law, the Board correctly concluded the existing definition of permanent and stationary remained intact because the statutory changes specified that an employee\u2019s disability need only be found medically permanent and stationary in order to trigger provision of the maintenance allowance during vocational rehabilitation. Clearly, finding an officer\u2019s medical condition is permanent and stationary for purposes of terminating a temporary disability and commencing maintenance allowance payments during vocational rehabilitation is not equivalent to a Board final finding that the officer\u2019s condition is medically and vocationally permanent and stationary for purposes of Government Code section 21164. The attempt to involuntarily retire Officer Girard while he was in vocational rehabilitation, as here, was not legally effective because the officer was entitled to continued payment of his section 4850 benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Similarly in <em>Tognetti </em>v. <em>Town of Hillsborough, supra, </em>SFO 354134, 356695, the Board correctly determined involuntary retirement was not valid where the police officer was only medically permanent and stationary. Rather, he was entitled to receive section 4850 benefits in lieu of maintenance allowance payments while engaged in vocational rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Furthermore, the Board decisions on this issue contradict City\u2019s argument, with a single isolated exception. In <em>Fogle, supra, </em>60 Cal.Comp.Cases 760, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>the Board panel reached a result opposite from <em>Tognetti </em>and from the subsequent decisions in this case and <em>Girard. Fogle </em>is an anomaly. It is not dispositive of the issues raised in this case. It is not to be cited as authority for a municipality such as City to invoke Government Code section 21164 to involuntarily retire a police officer in vocational rehabilitation and terminate Labor Code section 4850 benefits simply because the officer\u2019s medical condition is \u201cpermanent and stationary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">In summary, we readily discern that the Legislature did not intend to change the long-standing meaning of \u201cpermanent and stationary\u201d in the context of the workers\u2019 compensation law for purposes of involuntary retirement under Government Code section 21164. The Legislature clearly referred to \u201cmedically\u201d permanent and stationary in Labor Code section 139.5(c) and, aware that the existing definition included both medically <em>and </em>vocationally \u201cpermanent and stationary,\u201d declined to amend Government Code section 21164.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Moreover, by express statutory language in Labor Code section 4850, the Legislature mandates payment of full salary in lieu of maintenance allowance payments during vocational rehabilitation under section 139.5(c). Applicant, accordingly, is entitled to the balance of her section 4850 benefits for the time she engaged in vocational rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">\n<em>Effect of the Stipulation of Permanent and Stationary Status</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">City argues the parties in this case stipulated applicant\u2019s status was permanent and stationary as of June 16, 1995, and applicant should be held to the stipulation as an admission of her status for purposes of involuntary retirement. The minutes of an August 25, 1995 hearing before the WCJ contained the following stipulation: \u201cApplicant\u2019s permanent and stationary date is June 16, 1995.\u201d This one-page report of the minutes continuing the matter for a hearing set forth one other stipulation and three issues to be decided. It also noted the Board would obtain informal ratings for the reports from the medical-legal evaluators.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">Courts may interpret stipulations to determine their effect. <em>(Western Pioneer Ins. Co. v. Estate of Taira </em>(1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 174, 182 [185 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 887].) On September 12, 1995, applicant\u2019s attorney notified the WCJ and clarified the stipulation on permanent disability pertained specifically to applicant\u2019s medical status because she was not yet vocationally permanent and stationery. Counsel\u2019s explanation of the stipulation was obvious, as the issues to be addressed concerned applicant\u2019s medical status. The stipulation was necessary in order for the Board to render a permanent disability rating. We will not twist the language of the stipulation in this case in a manner that disposes of the major issue presented. (See, e.g., <em>Burrows v. State of California </em>(1968) 260 Cal.App.2d 29, 33 [66 Cal.Rptr. 868] [\u201cObviously, plaintiffs did not intend to stipulate away their case while urging it\u201d].) The stipulation did not apply to applicant\u2019s vocational permanent and stationary status or amount to a finding of permanent and stationary under Government Code section 21164. It merely reflected the obvious; to wit, applicant\u2019s condition was appropriate for permanent disability determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">\n<em>Effect of Repeal of Government Code Section 21025.6</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">City finds significance in the Legislature\u2019s 1990 repeal of Government Code section 21025.6.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> According to City, repeal of this provision shows an intent to allow involuntary retirement at any time and consequential termination of Labor Code section 4850 benefits without restriction, even though an employee is in a vocational rehabilitation program. We note former Government Code section 21025.6 does not address the involuntary aspects of retirement covered by Government Code section 21164. The latter section expressly states: <em>\u201cNotwithstanding any other provision of this article, </em>the retirement . . . shall not be effective without the member\u2019s consent earlier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>than [the termination of \u00a7 4850 benefits or the Board determines the disability is permanent and stationary].\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Former Government Code section 21025.6 addressed the effective date of retirement for employees in rehabilitation programs and delayed the date until completion or termination of the rehabilitation program. By repealing Government Code section 21025.6, the Legislature no longer required an employee to terminate a rehabilitation program in order to receive disability retirement benefits. (See, e.g., Assem. Com. on Ways and Means, Sen. Bill No. 2471 (1989-1990 Reg. Sess.) June 27, 1990 [\u201cThis bill would make various changes to [PERS] Law. Specifically, the bill would: [^] 1) Delete a requirement that if a member has been offered enrollment in a rehabilitation program, the program must be terminated as specified before the member may receive disability retirement benefits.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">We interpret the legislative intent, as relevant, to allow a PERS police officer engaged in vocational rehabilitation, who otherwise has exhausted her section 4850 benefits, to receive disability pension payments rather than being restricted to the lower paying section 139.5(c) maintenance allowance payments. In summary, the repealed provision said nothing about forced retirement. We decline to view its repeal as an expression of legislative intent to negate the amendment of section 4850 continuing a police officer\u2019s full salary benefit, as available, through the period of receipt of vocational \u2022rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">In conclusion, to accept City\u2019s construction of the 1989 and 1990 legislative changes to Labor Code sections 139.5(c) and 4850, we must turn a blind eye to unequivocal statutory language. We then would have to endorse City\u2019s untenable position and determine as soon as a police officer is medically permanent and stationary, and therefore eligible for continuation of payment of section 4850 benefits while engaged in vocational rehabilitation, he or she can be involuntarily retired under Government Code section 21164, thereby defeating the entitlement to section 4850 benefits during the period the maintenance allowance is payable under section 139.5(c). We cannot ignore the precepts of statutory construction and common sense.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">Accordingly, we decide that, as a matter of law, applicant is entitled to the balance of her section 4850 benefits in lieu of maintenance allowance payments under section 139.5 for the period of time she engaged in vocational rehabilitation. The parties shall make the appropriate adjustments to take into consideration credit for the disability pension payments, if any, advanced to applicant during the relevant time frame.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>II<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Consistent with and for the reasons discussed above, the Board\u2019s decision after reconsideration is affirmed.

However, it was repealed, renumbered and replaced in 1995 by Government Code section 21164, which contains virtually identical language. \u201cIt is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this act to reorganize the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement Law and the Internal Revenue Code Compliance and Replacement Benefit Program in order to facilitate administration. It is not the intent of the Legislature to make any substantive change in the law. . . . No current or future benefit under this act shall be revised in any way because of this act.\u201d (Historical and Statutory Notes, 33B West\u2019s Ann. Gov.
