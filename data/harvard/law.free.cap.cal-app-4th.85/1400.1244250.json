We hold that in order to effectuate the purpose of the anti-SLAPP statute and the Legislature\u2019s intent to deter SLAPP suits, a defendant who appears in a SLAPP action in propria persona and later retains specially appearing counsel who successfully brings on behalf of the defendant a special motion to strike the complaint under section 425.16 is entitled to recover an award of reasonable attorney fees under the mandatory provisions of subdivision (c) of that section in order to compensate the retained counsel for the legal services provided in connection with both the special motion to strike, and the recovery of attorney fees and costs under that subdivision. Because we also conclude the court in the instant case properly granted Zimmerman\u2019s special motion to strike the complaint under the anti-SLAPP statute, and its modest award of fees in her favor under subdivision (c) of that statute is not excessive in amount,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-5\">In his separate petition, Dowling seeks a writ of supersedeas barring Zimmerman from attempting to enforce the portion of the judgment awarding her attorney fees and costs under the anti-SLAPP statute pending disposition of his appeal in this matter.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Dowling appealed from the judgment without filing an appeal bond or other undertaking. When Zimmerman attempted to enforce the judgment by serving Dowling with a subpoena duces tecum and an order to appear at a judgment debtor\u2019s examination, Dowling unsuccessfully moved to quash the subpoena and vacate the debt- or\u2019s examination, contending that enforcement of the judgment was automatically stayed under section 917.1, subdivision (d), by the perfecting of his appeal. Dowling challenged the court\u2019s ruling by filing the instant writ petition. We granted a de facto stay of execution of the judgment by requesting Zimmerman to answer the petition and brief the legal issues presented therein, and by thereafter deferring a ruling on the petition until disposition of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-6\">The petition presents a question of first impression: Whether a prevailing SLAPP defendant\u2019s enforcement of a judgment awarding attorney fees and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1406\">*1406</page-number>costs under subdivision (c) of section 425.16 is automatically stayed by the SLAPP plaintiff\u2019s perfecting of an appeal from that judgment. We hold that a SLAPP plaintiff\u2019s perfecting of an appeal from a judgment awarding attorney fees and costs to a prevailing SLAPP defendant under subdivision (c) of section 425.16 does not automatically stay enforcement of the judgment. We further hold that to stay enforcement of such a judgment, the SLAPP plaintiff must give an appropriate appeal bond or undertaking under the money judgment exception to the automatic stay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-4\">The petition for writ of supersedeas and the appeal have been consolidated for disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-5\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-6\">Appellant Dowling and his wife<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (together the Dowlings) owned a townhouse in the Penasquitos Townhouse complex in the City of San Diego. Respondent Zimmerman is an attorney. Edward White and his wife Grace White (together the Whites) lived in the Dowlings\u2019 townhouse. Harvey Pollack (Pollack) was the property manager of the Penasquitos Townhouse Owners Association (PTOA). In January 1995, the Dowlings and the Whites entered into an agreement under which the Whites leased the townhouse with intent to purchase it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-7\">A. <em>The Underlying Unlawful Detainer and Harassment Litigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1168-8\">In July 1996, after a dispute arose between the Dowlings and the Whites involving the Whites\u2019 payment obligations and title to and possession of the subject townhouse, the Dowlings commenced the first of three unsuccessful unlawful detainer actions against the Whites in a four-month period (July-October). The Dowlings were represented by counsel (John W. Kopp, Jr. (Kopp)) in all three actions. The Whites represented themselves in the first two actions. The Dowlings voluntarily dismissed the first action without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-9\">The Dowlings\u2019 second unlawful detainer action against the Whites proceeded to trial. The court found the statutory three-day notice was defective and entered a judgment of dismissal in favor of the Whites.</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-10\">On October 9, 1996, before the Dowlings filed their third unlawful detainer action, Edward White petitioned for and obtained a restraining order prohibiting Dowling from harassing the Whites for a period of one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1407\">*1407</page-number>On October 23, 1996, the Dowlings filed their third unlawful detainer action against the Whites.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Shortly thereafter, Zimmerman agreed to represent the Whites in that action<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> on a pro bono basis. When the Whites reported to her that Dowling was continuing to harass them, Zimmerman sent several letters to Dowling\u2019s attorney, Kopp, between October 31 and November 14 in an effort to investigate the matter and stop the claimed harassment pending the outcome of the unlawful detainer proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-5\">1. <em>The November 15 letter</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1169-6\">Eventually, the Whites asked Zimmerman to petition the PTOA board of directors through the PTOA\u2019s property manager, Pollack, to investigate the Whites\u2019 claims regarding certain disturbances in the neighborhood, and to assist them in stopping the claimed harassment by Dowling so that the Whites could have the quiet use and enjoyment of the townhouse in the PTOA complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-7\">In her capacity as the Whites\u2019 attorney and based on information they provided to her, Zimmerman on November 15, 1996, sent a four-page letter (hereafter referred to as the letter or the November 15 letter) to Pollack, the PTOA\u2019s property manager. The Whites had informed Zimmerman that Pollack, as the property manager, was the appropriate person to whom PTOA homeowner complaints should be directed regarding safety concerns, ingress and egress problems, and nuisances in the complex. Based on information provided by the Whites, Zimmerman sent the letter to five other individuals she believed were members of the PTOA board of directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-8\">In the November 15 letter, Zimmerman identified herself as the Whites\u2019 attorney, and explained the purpose of the letter: \u201cThe purpose of this letter is to advise you of certain unusual and even dangerous conditions occurring on the . . . property and complex, and to give you the opportunity to correct and eliminate them. The situation interferes with the Whites\u2019[] use and enjoyment of their property and may very well affect other residents\u2019 enjoyment. HQ . . . HD This letter is notice to the PTOA, its board of directors, officers, and agents that the safety of your residents and owners may be at risk and we hope you will assist us in our efforts to create a more pleasant environment in the complex.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-9\">In the letter, Zimmerman provided information about the dispute between the Dowlings and the Whites, and then made reference to Dowling\u2019s harassment of the Whites: \u201cIn July 1996, Mr. Dowling began a concerted plan of harassment against the Whites and entered into a series of behaviors which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1408\">*1408</page-number>have now come to the attention of the San Diego Police Department. Mr. Dowling repeatedly tells residents that the Whites are tenants, refuse to pay rent, and refuse to move. This is untrue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-4\">Zimmerman stated in the letter that the July 1996 unlawful detainer action filed by Dowling was dismissed based on evidence he had \u201crel[ied]\u201d on a \u201cforged document\u201d:<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cIn July 1996, Mr. Dowling filed an unlaw\u00f1il detainer action which his attorney dismissed once it was learned that <em>Mr. Dowling was relying on a forged document </em>to support his case. <em>(Someone forged Mr. White\u2019s name on a rental agreement.) </em>... In September 1996, Mr. Dowling lost the second unlawful detainer action against the Whites even though [or because] he offered the forged rental agreement as evidence.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-5\">Zimmerman also listed various \u201cunusual occurrences\u201d (such as the phone company\u2019s disconnecting the Whites\u2019 telephone service and the utility company\u2019s scheduling of a disconnecting of service at the telephonic direction of an unnamed male, among others), and asserted that Dowling\u2019s \u201ccontinuous threats against the Whites and his daily prowling around their condo creates fear and apprehension\u201d in Grace White.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-6\">2. <em>March 1997 stipulation for judgment in the third unlawful detainer action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1170-8\">In March 1997, Dowling and the Whites entered into a stipulated judgment in favor of Dowling in the third unlawful detainer action. Zimmerman, acting as the Whites\u2019 counsel, negotiated the stipulated judgment on their behalf. The stipulation required the Whites to return possession of the townhouse to the Dowlings, but contained a provision that the parties reserved the right to recover damages through legal action at a later date.</p>\n<p id=\"b1170-9\">B. <em>The Instant Litigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1170-10\">1. <em>Dowling\u2019s SLAPP complaint</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1170-11\">In November 1997, Dowling filed his SLAPP complaint naming Zimmerman and Edward White<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> as the defendants, and alleging 11 causes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1409\">*1409</page-number>action.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Of these, the following four were alleged against Zimmerman: <em>defamation </em>(fifth cause of action), <em>misrepresentation </em>(sixth cause of action), <em>intentional infliction of emotional distress </em>(tenth cause of action), and <em>negligent infliction of emotional distress </em>(eleventh cause of action).</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-5\">Dowling\u2019s defamation cause of action was based only on the following allegation: \u201c[Zimmerman] by [her] words and actions [has] impugned the reputation of Plaintiff[]. These words and actions have been false. [Zimmerman has] consistently published [her] false allegations to others on numerous occasions. [Zimmerman\u2019s] words have lowered the Plaintiff[\u2019]s reputation[] in the eyes of [his] business associates and tenants and thus adversely affected present and future businesses. Plaintiff[] [has] been damaged in an amount according to proof at trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-6\">Dowling\u2019s misrepresentation cause of action was based on allegations that Zimmerman knowingly made unspecified false \u201crepresentations,\u201d and concealed unspecific \u201cmaterial facts,\u201d during unspecified \u201cnegotiations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-7\">Last, Dowling\u2019s two emotional distress claims were both based on his allegation that Zimmerman \u201cpublished a false letter\u201d (presumably the November 15 letter, discussed <em>ante).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1171-8\">Dowling served Zimmerman with the summons and complaint in March 1998. Acting in pro se, Zimmerman answered the complaint and alleged various affirmative defenses, including the defense that Dowling\u2019s complaint was barred by the litigation privilege (set forth in Civ. Code, \u00a7 47, subd. (b)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>).</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-9\">2. <em>Zimmerman\u2019s special motion to strike under section 425.16</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1171-10\">In May 1998, Zimmerman filed her timely special motion to strike Dowling\u2019s complaint against her under the anti-SLAPP statute (\u00a7 425.16). Zimmerman argued that the complaint was a meritless SLAPP suit intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1410\">*1410</page-number>to \u201cintimidate and punish\u201d her for assisting the Whites in exercising their lawful right to petition the courts and the PTOA on the public issue of residential safety and nuisances within the meaning of subdivision (e)(2) and (4) of section 425.16 (see fn. 2, <em>ante). </em>Zimmerman also argued that Dowling was unable to meet his burden under the anti-SLAPP statute of establishing a probability of prevailing on his claims because the complaint contained only legal conclusions; her statements in the November 15 letter were not provably false factual assertions, and thus were not defamatory; and those statements were privileged under the litigation privilege codified in subdivision (b) of Civil Code section 47 (see fn. 13, <em>ante), </em>the common interest privilege codified in subdivision (c) of Civil Code section 47,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. In support of her motion, Zimmerman submitted her own declaration, the declarations of the Whites, and documentary evidence that included (among other things) the November 15 letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-4\">Dowling opposed the motion to strike, contending (among other things) that the anti-SLAPP statute did not apply because no public issue was involved in the case. He also contended that Zimmerman failed to make the requisite prima facie showing under the anti-SLAPP statute because the right to petition or exercise free speech, \u201cif any,\u201d belonged to the Whites, not to Zimmerman; the November 15 letter involved a private dispute between the Whites and him; the anti-SLAPP statute did not apply to a defamation action; his papers showed a probability he would prevail in the action; and Zimmerman\u2019s statements in her November 15 letter were not privileged under Civil Code section 47. In support of his opposition, Dowling submitted his own declaration, the declaration of his attorney (Kopp), and a copy of Zimmerman\u2019s executed substitution of attorney form from the underlying unlawful detainer proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-5\">Zimmerman filed reply papers in which she challenged Dowling\u2019s evidence, and argued (among other things) that subdivision (e)(1) and (2) of section'425.16 contained no public issue requirement, and she published the November 15 letter in connection with the unlawful detainer proceedings and in good faith contemplation of renewing the restraining order previously granted to her clients, the Whites. She submitted her own supplemental declaration and that of Edward White. Dowling filed an unauthorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1411\">*1411</page-number>response to Zimmerman\u2019s reply papers. Following oral argument on the motion, the court took the matter under submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-5\">i. <em>Decision and judgment of dismissal </em>'</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-6\">In July 1998, the court issued its written decision granting Zimmerman\u2019s special motion to strike Dowling\u2019s complaint under the anti-SLAPP statute. The court determined that Zimmerman had met her initial burden on the motion by showing that the November 15 letter constituted \u201cconduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right to free speech on matters of public concern and the constitutional right of petition under . . . section 425.16, subdivisions (e)(2) and (e)(4).\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The court explained that the letter addressed the public concerns of nuisance and safety (at the Penasquitos Townhouse complex); it was written in connection with the Dowlings\u2019 underlying unlawful detainer action against the Whites; and it was \u201cdirected to persons who held themselves out to be members of the board of directors of [Zimmerman\u2019s] client\u2019s homeowner\u2019s association.\u201d The court also explained that the letter made reference to conduct by Dowling that might constitute a nuisance or a safety hazard, and Zimmerman wrote it to advise the PTOA of the \u201cpotential nuisance and/or hazard.\u201d Giving the anti-SLAPP statute the broad construction expressly mandated in subdivision (a) of section 425.16 (see fn. 2, <em>ante </em>[\u201cthis section shall be construed broadly\u201d]), and noting that the letter discussed the underlying unlawful detainer and harassment litigation, the court found that \u201cthe letter would not have been written but for the pending litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-7\">The court also determined that Dowling had not met his statutory burden under section 425.16, subdivision (b) (see fn. 2, <em>ante), </em>of showing a probability of prevailing on the merits of his complaint. The court explained: \u201cThe complaint is pled without specificity and is without merit. While Zimmerman was not yet counsel of record at the time the letter was written, the facts disclose that she was [the Whites\u2019] attorney when she wrote the letter. Moreover, the facts show that Zimmerman wrote the letter within the course and scope of her representation of [the Whites]. Zimmerman\u2019s letter was privileged under Civil Code section 47. Therefore, [Dowling] has not met his burden of showing a probability of prevailing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1412\">*1412</page-number>3. <em>Judgment and Zimmerman\u2019s motion for attorney fees (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (c))</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1174-5\">On August 18, 1998, noting it had granted Zimmerman\u2019s special motion to strike Dowling\u2019s SLAPP complaint under section 425.16, the court entered a judgment dismissing the complaint with prejudice. The judgment also awarded to Zimmerman reasonable attorney fees and costs under subdivision (c) of that statute in an amount to be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-6\">Zimmerman thereafter brought a motion for recovery of reasonable attorney fees under the mandatory provisions of section 425.16, subdivision (c).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In her supporting declaration, Zimmerman stated she had retained an attorney, James J. Moneer (Moneer), for the \u201cnominal\u201d retainer fee of $1,300 to represent her in the instant case \u201cas special counsel of record for the sole purpose of handling the [ajnti-SLAPP motion per [section] 425.16.\u201d She also stated that Moneer\u2019s fee was contingent on the result of her motion under subdivision (c) of the anti-SLAPP statute, and without the mandatory attorney fees provision of that subdivision she would not have been able to afford his services as an anti-SLAPP specialist. In his supporting and reply declarations, Moneer provided evidence of his experience and expertise, and of the services he had rendered to Zimmerman. He stated he had spent 176.5 hours of billable time on her behalf at the rate of $350 per hour, and the total amount of attorney fees requested in the motion was $61,862.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-7\">In September 1998, the court awarded Zimmerman, under subdivision (c) of section 425.16, the sum of $9,300 (62 hours at the rate of $150 per hour) as reasonable attorney fees for Moneer\u2019s legal services, plus costs incurred in furtherance of the special motion to strike in the amount of $580. The court amended the judgment to incorporate these attorney fees and cost awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-8\">4. <em>Dowling\u2019s appeal and Zimmerman\u2019s \u201ccross-appeal\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1174-9\">On October 5, 1998, Dowling filed his timely notice of appeal without posting an appeal bond. Zimmerman thereafter filed notice of her now-dismissed \u201ccross-appeal\u201d from the order on her motion for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-10\">5. <em>Dowling\u2019s motion to quash subpoena and vacate judgment debtor\u2019s exam</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1174-12\">Zimmerman attempted to enforce the judgment by serving Dowling with a subpoena duces tecum and an order to appear at a judgment debtor\u2019s examination that was eventually scheduled for February 11, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1413\">*1413</page-number>On January 8, 1999, Dowling challenged Zimmerman\u2019s attempted enforcement of the judgment by bringing a motion to quash the subpoena and vacate the debtor\u2019s examination order, contending that the perfecting of his appeal without the filing of an appeal bond or other undertaking automatically stayed enforcement of the judgment under section 917.1, subdivision (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-5\">On January 29, 1999, the court denied Dowling\u2019s motion. The court found that the award of attorney fees in favor of Zimmerman under section 425.16 was a judgment directing \u201cpayment of money\u201d within the meaning of section 917.1, subdivision (a)(1), and thus the perfecting of Dowling\u2019s appeal did not automatically stay enforcement of the judgment. The court also found that an undertaking \u201cconsistent with the relevant statutes\u201d was required to effect a stay pending the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-6\">6. <em>Dowling\u2019s petition for writ of supersedeas</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1175-7\">On February 9, 1999, Dowling challenged the court\u2019s ruling by filing his pending petition for writ of supersedeas (the petition), seeking a stay of enforcement of the judgment pending disposition of his appeal. In his petition, Dowling contends that the perfecting of his appeal automatically stayed enforcement of the judgment under the provisions of various statutes (discussed, <em>post), </em>and thus he was entitled to such stay without filing an appeal bond or other undertaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-8\">On February 10, 1999, this court issued an order (the February 10 stay order) staying the judgment debtor\u2019s examination (scheduled for the following day, February 11) pending Zimmerman\u2019s response to the petition and disposition of the matter, and until further order of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-9\">On February 26, 1999, this court issued another order stating the February 10 previous stay order \u201cshall remain in effect until further order,\u201d and further ordering that this court would \u201cdefer ruling on the [petition for] writ of supersedeas until disposition of the appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-10\">Zimmerman thereafter filed a request for immediate disposition of the petition. On March 15, 1999, this court denied Zimmerman\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-11\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-12\">I. <em>Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1175-13\">In his appeal, Dowling contends the anti-SLAPP statute (\u00a7 425.16) does not bar his tort action against Zimmerman, and thus the court erred by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1414\">*1414</page-number>granting Zimmerman\u2019s special motion to dismiss the action under this statute, because (1) her November 15 letter is not protected by subdivision (e)(4) of section 425.16 , the letter is outside the scope of section (e)(2) of that section, and the letter \u201cis contrary to\u201d the anti-SLAPP statute; and (2) he has established the requisite probability of prevailing in this action by showing that Zimmerman\u2019s conduct is not privileged. Alternatively, Dowling contends the court abused its discretion by awarding Zimmerman reasonable attorney fees under section 425.16, subdivision (c), because she elected to appear in pro se, a pro se litigant cannot recover attorney fees, and the fee award was excessive. We reject these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-4\">A. <em>Overview of Section 425.16</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1176-5\">A SLAPP lawsuit is generally defined as a \u201cmeritless suit filed primarily to chill the defendant\u2019s exercise of First Amendment rights.\u201d <em>(Wilcox </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 809, 815, fn. 2 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 446] <em>(Wilcox).) </em>SLAPP suits \u201care brought, not to vindicate a legal right, but rather to interfere with the defendant\u2019s ability to pursue his or her interests. Characteristically, the SLAPP suit lacks merit; it will achieve its objective if it depletes defendant\u2019s resources or energy. The aim is not to win the lawsuit but to detract the defendant from his or her objective, which is adverse to the plaintiff. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Church of Scientology </em>v. <em>Wollersheim </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 628, 645 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 620] <em>(Church of Scientology).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1176-6\">Section 425.16 was enacted in 1992 to deter and prevent SLAPP suits, and is \u201cdesigned to protect citizens in the exercise of their First Amendment constitutional rights of free speech and petition.\u201d <em>(Church of Scientology, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.4th at pp. 636, 644.)

(\u00a7 425.16, subd. (b)(1); <em>Church of Scientology, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.4th at p. 646.) We conclude Zimmerman met her burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-6\">Dowling\u2019s complaint shows that his defamation cause of action was based only on the allegation that Zimmerman\u2019s unspecified \u201cwords and actions\u201d had \u201cimpugned\u201d his reputation, and that she had \u201cconsistently published\u201d unspecified \u201cfalse allegations\u201d that had \u201clowered\u201d his reputation \u201cin the eyes of [his] business associates and tenants . . . .\u201d The complaint also shows that Dowling\u2019s misrepresentation cause of action was based on his allegation that Zimmerman knowingly made unspecified false \u201crepresentations,\u201d and concealed unspecific \u201cmaterial facts,\u201d during unspecified \u201cnegotiations,\u201d presumably Zimmerman\u2019s negotiation on behalf of her clients, the Whites, of the stipulated settlement of the Dowling\u2019s third unlawful detainer action against the Whites. Last, Dowling\u2019s two emotional distress claims were both based on his allegation that Zimmerman \u201cpublished a false letter,\u201d presumably the November 15 letter (discussed, <em>ante).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1180-7\">In support of her special motion under the anti-SLAPP statute to strike Dowling\u2019s complaint, Zimmerman argued that the complaint was a meritless SLAPP suit intended to \u201cintimidate and punish\u201d her for assisting the Whites in exercising their lawful right to petition the courts and the PTOA on the public issue of residential safety and nuisances within the meaning of subdivision (e), clauses (2) and (4), of section 425.16 (see text in fn. 2, <em>ante). </em>She submitted her own declaration, the declarations of the Whites, and documentary evidence that included (among other things) the November 15 letter, and a harassment restraining order that Edward White obtained in October 1996 prohibiting Dowling from harassing the Whites.</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-8\">The submitted declarations show that in October 1996, after the Dowlings filed their third unlawful detainer action against the Whites, Zimmerman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1419\">*1419</page-number>agreed to represent the Whites in that action on a pro bono basis. When the Whites reported to her that Dowling was continuing to harass them, Zimmerman sent several letters to Dowling\u2019s attorney, Kopp, in an effort to investigate the matter and stop the claimed harassment pending the outcome of the unlawful detainer proceeding. In her declaration, Zimmerman states she negotiated a stipulated settlement of that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-5\">The declarations also show that the Whites asked Zimmerman to petition the PTOA board of directors through the PTOA\u2019s property manager, Pollack, to investigate the Whites\u2019 claims regarding certain disturbances in the neighborhood and to assist them in stopping the claimed harassment by Dowling so that the Whites could have the quiet use and enjoyment of the townhouse in the PTOA complex. In her capacity as the Whites\u2019 attorney and based on information they provided to her, Zimmerman prepared the November 15 letter and sent it to Pollack, the PTOA\u2019s property manager. The declarations show the Whites had informed Zimmerman that Pollack, as the property manager, was the appropriate person to whom PTOA homeowner complaints should be directed regarding safety concerns, ingress and egress problems, and nuisances in the complex. Zimmerman and Edward White state that, based on information the Whites provided to her, Zimmerman sent the letter to five other individuals she believed were members of the PTOA board of directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-6\">In the November 15 letter, Zimmerman identified herself as the Whites\u2019 attorney, and explained that the purpose of the letter was \u201cto advise you of certain unusual and even dangerous conditions occurring on the . . . property and complex, and to give you the opportunity to correct and eliminate them. The situation interferes with the Whites\u2019[] use and enjoyment of their property and may very well affect other residents\u2019 enjoyment, [f] . . . ft[] This letter is notice to the PTOA, its board of directors, officers, and agents that the safety of your residents and owners may be at risk and we hope you will assist us in our efforts to create a more pleasant environment in the complex.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-7\">In the letter, Zimmerman provided information about the unlawful detainer dispute between the Dowlings and the Whites, and made reference to Dowling\u2019s harassment of the Whites. Without expressly accusing Dowling of forgery, the letter also stated that the July 1996 unlawful detainer action filed by Dowling was dismissed based on evidence he had \u201creified]\u201d on a \u201cforged document.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The letter also described various \u201cunusual occurrences\u201d and asserted that Dowling\u2019s \u201ccontinuous threats against the Whites <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1420\">*1420</page-number>and his daily prowling around their condo creates fear and apprehension\u201d in Grace White.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-4\">We conclude the court properly found that Zimmerman met her initial burden of establishing a prima facie showing that Dowling\u2019s action arose both from statements she made \u201cmade in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a . . . judicial body\u201d within the meaning of section 425.16, subdivision (e)(2), and from conduct \u201cin furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue\u201d within the meaning of section 425.16, subdivision (e)(4). The complaint and the evidence submitted by Zimmerman established that all four of the tort causes of action alleged against her in Dowling\u2019s complaint arose from her acts of negotiating a stipulated settlement of a pending unlawful detainer action against the Whites, and of writing and publishing the November 15 letter, while she was acting in her capacity as pro bono counsel for the Whites. The letter was written in connection with the pending unlawful detainer action. The letter also addressed conduct by Dowling that arguably involved public issues of nuisance and safety. It stated, for example, that someone had twice entered the Whites\u2019 locked garage and turned the dial of their water heater off, which \u201ccould be extremely dangerous, even fatal, to anyone in that building should the gas remain on, the flame be extinguished, and had the gas collected in the garage.\u201d Zimmerman stated in her declaration that she directed the letter regarding the Whites\u2019 complaints about the \u201cneighborhood disturbances\u201d to Pollack at his request, as he would forward such complaints to PTOA board members. The letter expressly stated that its purpose was to advise the PTOA, through these individuals, of the potential nuisance and the safety concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-5\">C. <em>Dowling Failed to Show a Probability of Prevailing on His Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1182-6\">Because Zimmerman met her initial burden of making a prima facie showing that Dowling\u2019s lawsuit arose from her exercise of her free speech and petition rights, and the causes of action he alleged fell within the ambit of section 425.16, the burden shifted to Dowling to establish a probability of prevailing on those claims. (\u00a7425.16, subd. (b)(1); <em>Church of Scientology, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.4th at p. 653.) We conclude he failed to meet this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-7\">As already discussed, Dowling\u2019s claims arose from Zimmerman\u2019s acts of representing the Whites in connection with Dowling\u2019s third unlawful detainer action, negotiating a stipulated settlement of that action on their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1421\">*1421</page-number>behalf, and writing and distributing to interested parties the November 15 letter, which pertained to the legal disputes between the Dowlings and the Whites, Dowling\u2019s harassment of the Whites, and the Whites\u2019 complaints about safety and nuisance problems at the townhouse complex where they lived.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-5\">We first conclude that the court properly found Dowling\u2019s complaint was pleaded without the requisite specificity. As already noted, Dowling\u2019s complaint alleged four causes of action against Zimmerman: defamation (fifth cause of action), misrepresentation (sixth cause of action), intentional infliction of emotional distress (tenth cause of action), and negligent infliction of emotional distress (eleventh cause of action). We preliminarily note that \u201c[t]he favored causes of action in SLAPP suits are <em>defamation, </em>various business torts such as interference with prospective economic advantage, nuisance and <em>intentional infliction of emotional </em>distress.\u201d (Wilcox, <em>supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th at p. 816, italics added.) Here, the complaint shows that Dowling\u2019s defamation cause of action was based only on the conclusory allegation that Zimmerman\u2019s unspecified \u201cwords and actions\u201d and unspecified \u201cfalse allegations\u201d had \u201clowered\u201d his reputation. As already discussed, in the letter Zimmerman did not accuse Dowling of forgery; she stated that the July 1996 unlawful detainer action filed by Dowling was dismissed based on evidence he had \u201crel[ied]\u201d on a-\u201cforged document.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The letter did not state that Dowling knew or should have known the lease agreement was forged at the time he relied on it. If allegedly defamatory statements are \u201cambiguous and susceptible of a harmless as well as a defamatory meaning, the plaintiff must state the defamatory meaning [the \u201cinnuendo\u201d] in which, according to his theory, they were used and understood in the light of the circumstances alleged in the inducement.\u201d (5 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Pleading, \u00a7 698, p. 158; see also <em>Washer </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(1943) 21 Cal.2d 822, 828 [136 P.2d 297, 155 A.L.R. 1338].) Here, Dowling failed to plead the requisite innuendo.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-6\">Dowling\u2019s misrepresentation cause of action was based on his allegations that Zimmerman knowingly made unspecified false \u201crepresentations,\u201d and concealed unspecific \u201cmaterial facts,\u201d during unspecified \u201cnegotiations.\u201d It is well established that, \u201c[i]n California, fraud must be pled specifically; general and conclusory allegations do not suffice. [Citations.] \u2018Thus \u201c \u2018the policy of liberal construction of the pleadings . . . will not ordinarily be invoked to sustain a pleading defective in any material respect.\u2019 \u201d [Citation.] fl[] This particularity requirement necessitates pleading facts which \u201cshow how, when, where, to whom, and by what means the representations were tendered.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Lazar v. Superior Court </em>(1996) 12 Cal.4th 631, 645 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1422\">*1422</page-number>[49 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 909 P.2d 981], italics omitted.) Dowling\u2019s conclusory allegations of misrepresentation are fatally defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-4\">Dowling\u2019s remaining causes of action for intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress were also both based on a conclusory allegation, that Zimmerman \u201cpublished a false letter\u201d (presumably the November 15 letter). With respect to the intentional tort, Dowling failed to properly plead the requisite ultimate fact of extreme and outrageous conduct. (See generally 5 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (9th ed. 1988) Torts, \u00a7 404, p. 484.) Regarding his claim sounding in negligence, which incorporates by reference all preceding factual allegations, Dowling failed to plead facts showing that Zimmerman owed him a duty of care not to communicate with Pollack, the PTOA property manager, on behalf of her clients regarding the suspected incidents of harassment occurring in the townhouse complex while the underlying unlawful detainer action was pending. We conclude Dowling\u2019s defectively pleaded complaint facially appears to be a SLAPP suit. <em>{Wilcox, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th at p. 816.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-5\">We also conclude the court properly found that, \u201cthe [November 15] letter would not have been written but for the pending litigation,\u201d and the letter was privileged under the litigation privilege codified in Civil Code section 47, subdivision (b).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Zimmerman wrote and published the letter in her capacity as pro bono counsel for the Whites, and the letter clearly pertained to the pending underlying unlawful detainer litigation. It arguably pertained also to the prior harassment injunction litigation to the extent the Whites had the right to apply for a renewal of the restraining order they had obtained against Dowling. To the extent Dowling\u2019s SLAPP complaint was also based on statements that Zimmerman made to Dowling\u2019s counsel, Kopp, while negotiating the stipulated settlement of the unlawful detainer action on behalf of the Whites, those statements were privileged under subdivision (b) of Civil Code section 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-6\">In sum, Dowling failed to meet his burden of establishing a probability of prevailing on his tort claims against Zimmerman. We thus conclude the court properly granted Zimmerman\u2019s special motion to strike Dowling\u2019s SLAPP complaint under the anti-SLAPP statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-7\">D. <em>Attorney Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1184-8\">Dowling also appeals from the portion of the judgment awarding to Zimmerman, under subdivision (c) of section 425.16, the sum of $9,300 (62 hours at the rate of $150 per hour) as reasonable attorney fees for associated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1423\">*1423</page-number>counsel Moneer\u2019s legal services. In her supporting attorney fees motion declaration, Zimmerman stated she paid attorney Moneer a \u201cnominal\u201d retainer fee of $1,300 to represent her in the instant case \u201cas special counsel of record for the sole purpose of handling the [a]nti-SLAPP motion per [section] 425.16,\u201d and Moneer\u2019s fee was contingent on the result of her motion under subdivision (c) of the anti-SLAPP statute. We must decide, as a matter of first impression, the issue of whether a SLAPP suit defendant, who appears in the action in propria persona and successfully moves for dismissal of the suit under section 425.16 with the assistance of specially appearing retained counsel, is entitled to an award of reasonable attorney fees under the mandatory attorney fees provisions of subdivision (c) of that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-5\">1. <em>Zimmerman\u2019s pro se status assisted by retained anti-SLAPP counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1185-7\">Dowling first contends the court abused its discretion by awarding attorney fees to Zimmerman because she elected to appear in this action in pro se. We reject this contention. Under subdivision (c) of section 425.16, a SLAPP defendant who prevails on a special motion to strike is entitled to a mandatory award of reasonable attorney fees. Subdivision (c) of that section provides in part: \u201cIn any action subject to subdivision (b), a prevailing defendant on a special motion to strike <em>shall </em>be entitled to recover his or her attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\u201d (Italics added.) That subdivision \u201cauthorizes the court to make an award of reasonable attorney fees to a prevailing defendant, which will adequately compensate the defendant for the expense of responding to a baseless lawsuit. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Dove Audio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rosenfeld, Meyer &amp; Susman </em>(1996) 47 Cal.App.4th 777, 785 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 830] <em>(Dove Audio, Inc.).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1185-8\">Dowling cites no authority, and we have found none, for the proposition that a SLAPP defendant who initially makes an appearance in the action in pro se and later retains counsel who successfully brings both a special motion to strike the complaint under section 425.16, and a motion for reasonable fees (and costs) under subdivision (c) of that section, is barred from recovering such fees. The case law authorities upon which Dowling relies are inapposite because none involved an award of fees under the anti-SLAPP statute.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1185-9\">Because there is no clear statutory or case law authority on point, the determination of the issue presented must be guided by interpretation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1424\">*1424</page-number>legislative intent underlying section 425.16 under the rules of statutory construction, which \u201crequire courts to construe a statute to promote its purpose, render it reasonable, and avoid absurd consequences.\u201d <em>(Robertson </em>v. <em>Rodriguez </em>(1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 347, 361 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 464], citing <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 477, 484-485 [208 Cal.Rptr. 724, 691 P.2d 272].) \u201cThe fundamental rule of statutory construction is that the court should ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Select Base Materials </em>v. <em>Board of Equal. </em>(1959) 51 Cal.2d 640, 645 [335 P.2d 672] <em>(Select Base </em>Materials).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-4\">As already discussed, section 425.16 was enacted to deter and prevent SLAPP suits. <em>(Church of Scientology, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.4th at p. 636.) The anti-SLAPP statute is California\u2019s response to the problems created by meritless lawsuits brought to harass those who have exercised their First Amendment constitutional rights of free speech and petition for the redress of grievances. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 644.) The legislative intent to afford the victims of SLAPP suits a swift and effective remedy is clear. \u201cCalifornia enacted section 425.16 to provide a procedural remedy to resolve such a suit <em>expeditiously.\u201d (Church of Scientology, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.4th at p. 645, italics added.) The Legislature expressly set forth the intent and purpose underlying the anti-SLAPP statute in subdivision (a) of section 425.16: \u201cThe Legislature finds and declares that there has been a disturbing increase in lawsuits brought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for the redress of grievances. The Legislature finds and declares that it is in the public interest to encourage continued participation in matters of public significance, and that this participation should not be chilled through abuse of the judicial process. <em>To this end, this section shall be construed broadly.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-5\">In deciding the issue presented, this court must therefore construe the anti-SLAPP statute \u201cbroadly\u201d in order to effectuate its purposes and give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1425\">*1425</page-number>effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent to provide a swift and effective remedy to SLAPP suit defendants. To prevail on a special motion to strike under section 425.16, a SLAPP defendant ordinarily must have competent legal representation, regardless of whether the defendant is an attorney or whether the defendant initially appears in the action in propria persona. The special motion to strike a SLAPP suit provided under section 425.16 is the remedial tool the Legislature gave to victims of such meritless suits. In our view, the purpose of the anti-SLAPP statute will be promoted by construing that statute broadly to permit a pro se SLAPP defendant, who has successfully brought a special motion to strike the offending SLAPP suit with the assistance of specially retained counsel, to recover mandatory reasonable attorney fees to compensate the retained counsel for the legal services provided. We note that in the instant case, Zimmerman provided evidence that without the mandatory attorney fees provision set forth in subdivision (c) of section 425.16, she would not have been able to afford Moneer\u2019s services as an anti-SLAPP specialist.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-5\">We hold that in order to effectuate the purpose of the anti-SLAPP statute and the Legislature\u2019s intent to deter SLAPP suits, a defendant who appears in a SLAPP action in propria persona and later retains specially appearing counsel who successfully brings on behalf of the defendant a special motion to strike the complaint under section 425.16, is entitled to recover an award of reasonable attorney fees under the mandatory provisions of subdivision (c) of that section in order to compensate the retained counsel for the legal services provided in connection with both the special motion to strike, and the recovery of attorney fees and costs under that subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-6\">2. <em>Amount of the attorney fees award</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1187-7\">Dowling contends the amount awarded to Zimmerman ($9,300) as reasonable attorney fees under subdivision (c) of section 425.16 was excessive. He further contends the amount of such an award to a prevailing SLAPP defendant should not exceed the amount of attorney fees the defendant actually incurred (here, the sum of $1,300). We reject these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-8\">The record in the instant case shows that the modified contingent fee agreement into which Zimmerman and Moneer entered provided that Zimmerman would pay him a \u201cnominal\u201d retainer in the amount of $1,300, he would collect his attorney fees from her under the anti-SLAPP statute if she prevailed on her special motion to strike Dowling\u2019s SLAPP complaint, but he would \u201cabsorb the loss of his billable time\u201d if the court denied the motion. In support of Zimmerman\u2019s motion for reasonable attorney fees, which he litigated on her behalf, Moneer submitted his own declaration and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1426\">*1426</page-number>other evidence showing he had spent 176.5 hours of billable tim\u00e9 on her behalf, at the rate of $350 per hour, on the special motion to strike and the attorney fees motion, and the total amount of Zimmerman\u2019s attorney fees request was $61,862.50. The court awarded Zimmerman, under subdivision (c) of section 425.16, the sum of only $9,300 (62 hours at the rate of $150 per hour) as reasonable attorney fees for Moneer\u2019s legal services (plus costs incurred in furtherance of the special motion to strike in the amount of $580). This modest amount is clearly not excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-4\">We conclude the court\u2019s attorney fees award did not constitute an abuse of discretion. Construing subdivision (c) of section 425.16 broadly, as we must (\u00a7 425.16, subd. (a)), we reject Dowling\u2019s contention that the court should have limited the award to the \u201cincurred\u201d amount of $1,300.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-5\">E. <em>Attorney Fees on Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1188-6\">In her respondent\u2019s brief on appeal, Zimmerman asks this court to award her reasonable attorney fees and costs on appeal. As already discussed, subdivision (c) of section 425.16 provides for an award of reasonable attorney fees to a SLAPP defendant who successfully brings a motion to strike, and we have concluded that the court\u2019s attorney fees award in this matter was proper despite Zimmerman\u2019s status as a pro se litigant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-7\">\u201c \u2018A statute authorizing an attorney fee award at the trial court level includes appellate attorney fees unless the statute specifically provides otherwise.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Dove Audio, Inc., supra, </em>47 Cal.App.4th at p. 785.) Section 425.16, subdivision (c) provides that a prevailing defendant is entitled to recover attorney fees and costs, and does not preclude recovery on appeal. <em>(Dove Audio, Inc., supra, </em>47 Cal.App.4th at p. 785.) Accordingly, Zimmerman is awarded reasonable attorney fees on this appeal, the amount of which is to be determined by the trial court upon remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-8\">II. <em>Petition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1188-9\">In his petition for writ of supersedeas, Dowling seeks a stay of Zimmerman\u2019s enforcement of the portion of the judgment awarding her reasonable attorney fees and costs under the anti-SLAPP statute pending disposition of his appeal in this matter. Dowling appealed from the judgment without filing an appeal bond or other undertaking. Zimmerman attempted to enforce the judgment by serving Dowling with a subpoena duces tecum and an order to appear at a judgment debtor\u2019s examination, and Dowling brought a motion to quash the subpoena and vacate the examination, contending that the perfecting of his appeal automatically stayed enforcement of the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1427\">*1427</page-number>under section 917.1, subdivision (d). The court denied Dowling\u2019s motion on the ground that the award of attorney fees in favor of Zimmerman under section 425.16 was a judgment directing \u201cpayment of money\u201d within the meaning of section 917.1, subdivision (a)(1), and thus the perfecting of Dowling\u2019s appeal did not automatically stay enforcement of the judgment. The court also found that an undertaking \u201cconsistent with the relevant statutes\u201d was required to effect a stay pending the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-5\">The issue we must decide is whether a prevailing SLAPP defendant\u2019s enforcement of a judgment awarding reasonable attorney fees and costs under subdivision (c) of section 425.16 is automatically stayed by the SLAPP plaintiff\u2019s perfecting of an appeal from that judgment. We conclude that enforcement of such judgment is not stayed absent the filing of an appropriate appeal bond or other undertaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-6\">A. <em>Canons of Statutory Interpretation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1189-7\">The question presented is governed by statutes. The applicable canons of statutory construction that guide our decision are well settled.  As already discussed, the fundamental rule of statutory construction is that the court should ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. <em>(Select Base Materials, supra, </em>51 Cal.2d at p. 645.) In determining that intent, we first examine the words of the statute itself. <em>(California Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>San Diego Community College Dist. </em>(1981) 28 Cal.3d 692, 698 [170 Cal.Rptr. 817, 621 P.2d 856].) Under the so-called \u201cplain meaning\u201d rule, courts seek to give the words employed by the Legislature their usual and ordinary meaning. <em>(Lungren </em>v. <em>Deukmejian </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 727, 735 [248 Cal.Rptr. 115, 755 P.2d 299].) If the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, there is no need for construction. <em>(Ibid.) </em>However, \u201cthe \u2018plain meaning\u2019 rule does not prohibit a court from determining whether the literal meaning of a statute comports with its purpose.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cIf ... the terms of the statute provide no definitive answer, then courts may resort to extrinsic sources, including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Coronado </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 145, 151 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 77, 906 P.2d 1232].) \u201c \u2018We must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the Legislature, with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute, and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The legislative purpose will not be sacrificed to a literal construction of any part of the statute. <em>(Select Base Materials, supra, </em>51 Cal.2d at p. 645.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-8\">B. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1189-9\">As a general rule (the automatic stay rule), the perfecting of an appeal automatically stays proceedings in the trial court both upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1428\">*1428</page-number>judgment or order appealed from, and upon the matters embraced therein or affected thereby, including enforcement of the judgment or order. (See generally Eisenberg et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Appeals and Writs (The Rutter Group 1999) 7:1 to 7:2, p. 7-1.) The automatic stay rule is codified in section 916, subdivision (a),<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> which provides in part: <em>\u201cExcept as provided in Sections 917.1 </em>to 917.9, inclusive, and in Section 116.810, <em>the perfecting of an appeal stays proceedings </em>in the trial court upon the judgment or order appealed from or upon the matters embraced therein or affected thereby, <em>including enforcement of the judgment or order </em>. . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-5\">The purpose of the automatic stay rule is \u201cto protect the appellate court\u2019s jurisdiction by preserving the status quo until the appeal is decided. The rule prevents the trial court from rendering an appeal futile by altering the appealed judgment or order by conducting other proceedings that may affect it. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Elsea </em>v. <em>Saberi </em>(1992) 4 Cal.App.4th 625, 629 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 742].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-6\">The automatic stay rule is subject to certain exceptions. Perhaps the most common of the specified exceptions to the statutory automatic stay is set forth in section 917.1,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> subdivision (a)(1) (hereafter also referred to as section 917.1(a)(1) or the money judgment exception), which provides: \u201c(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1429\">*1429</page-number>Unless an undertaking is given, the perfecting of an appeal shall not stay enforcement of the judgment or order in the trial court if the judgment or order is for any of the following: ft\u00a1] (1) <em>Money or the payment of money, </em>whether consisting of a special fund or not, and whether payable by the appellant or another party to the action.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-5\">If the money judgment exception applies, a bond or undertaking is required to obtain a stay of enforcement of a judgment or order pending disposition of the appeal. (\u00a7 917.1(a)(1); see Eisenberg et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Appeals and Writs, <em>supra, </em>7:120 to 7:121, p. 7-30.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-6\">The question in this case is whether the portion of the judgment awarding reasonable attorney fees and costs to Zimmerman under section 425.16, subdivision (c), is a judgment for \u201cmoney or the payment of money\u201d within the meaning of the money judgment exception codified in section 917.1(a)(1) such that a bond or undertaking was required to stay enforcement of the judgment pending the disposition of Dowling\u2019s appeal. To answer this question we must not only interpret section 917.1(a)(1) in light of the legislative intent underlying the anti-SLAPP statute with a view to promoting the general purpose of that statute (discussed, <em>post), </em>but also harmonize these sections with the provisions of section 1033.5, subdivisions (a)(10)(A), (B), (C) and (c)(5), and section 917.1, subdivision (d) (hereafter also referred to as section 917.1(d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-7\">When the Legislature amended section 917.1 in 1993, it amended subdivision (d)<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> of that section (see Stats. 1993, ch. 456, \u00a7 13, p. 2535), which now provides: \u201c(d) Costs awarded by the trial court under Chapter 6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1430\">*1430</page-number>(commencing with Section 1021)[<footnotemark>27</footnotemark>] of Title 14 shall be included in the amount of the judgment or order for the purpose of applying paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) and subdivision (b). However, <em>no undertaking shall be required pursuant to this section solely for costs awarded under Chapter 6 (icommencing with Section </em>1021) <em>of Title 14.\u201d </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-4\">\u201cThe 1993 amendment. . . added the second sentence of subdivision (d), specifying that no undertaking is required for a judgment consisting of only costs awarded under section <em>1021 et </em>seq.\u201d <em>(Gallardo v. Specialty Restaurants Corp., supra, </em>84 Cal.App.4th at p. 469, fn. 5.) Thus, no bond or undertaking is required to stay enforcement of a judgment or order that consists only of costs awarded under section 1021 et seq.; enforcement of such a \u201ccosts only\u201d judgment is automatically stayed pending disposition of a perfected appeal. (See Eisenberg et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Appeals and Writs, <em>supra, </em>H 7:132, p. 7-32, citing <em>Vadas v. Sosnowski </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 471, 475 [258 Cal.Rptr. 374] [which predated amended \u00a7 917.1(d)].) Expressing this legal principle in terms of incidental or \u201croutine\u201d costs, one leading commentator states that \u201c[a] judgment for incidental routine costs of suit alone (as distinguished from \u2018discretionary\u2019 costs awards or \u2018money judgments\u2019 consisting of damages and costs) is automatically stayed by appeal.\u201d (Eisenberg et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Appeals and Writs, H 7:91, <em>supra, </em>p. 7-24.1, citing \u00a7 917.1(d); <em>Vadas </em>v. <em>Sosnowski, supra, </em>210 Cal.App.3d at p. 475 &amp; <em>Bank of San Pedro v.

Attorney\u2019s fees allowable as costs pursuant to <em>subparagraph (A) or (C) of paragraph (10) </em>of subdivision (a) shall be fixed either upon a noticed motion or upon entry of a default judgment, unless otherwise provided by stipulation of the parties.

Code Civ. Proc. (2000 supp.) foil. \u00a7 1033.5, p. 71, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-8\">In light of the foregoing labyrinth of statutory authority, and applying the canons of statutory interpretation already discussed, we interpret section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1432\">*1432</page-number>917.1(d) as requiring an appeal bond or undertaking to stay enforcement of a judgment for reasonable attorney fees and costs awarded to a prevailing SLAPP defendant under subdivision (c) of section 425.16. In our view, such a judgment entered after the granting of a special motion to strike under the anti-SLAPP statute should be treated as a judgment for \u201cmoney or the payment of money\u201d within the meaning of the money judgment exception codified in section 917.1(a)(1) such that a bond or undertaking is required to stay enforcement of the judgment pending the disposition of a SLAPP plaintiff\u2019s appeal. Turning to the express language of section 917.1, the statute that governs stays of enforcement of judgments and orders pending appeal, we note that a judgment for reasonable attorney fees and costs under the anti-SLAPP statute is unquestionably a judgment for payment of money, and is thus consistent with the language of section 917.1(a)(1), which (as already discussed) codifies the money judgment exception to the automatic stay rule and provides that a judgment for money or payment of money is not automatically stayed on appeal unless an undertaking is given. The language of amended section 917.1(d) expressly specifies that no undertaking is required for a judgment consisting of only costs awarded under section 1021 et seq. A judgment for reasonable attorney fees and costs under section 425.16, subdivision (c) (such as the one at issue in the instant writ proceeding), however, is not a judgment \u201csolely for costs awarded under Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 1021) of Title 14\u201d within the meaning of the second sentence of subdivision (d) of section 917.1. An award of reasonable attorney fees and costs under the anti-SLAPP statute cannot be construed as an award of routine or incidental costs subject to the automatic stay rule under section 917.1(d). Section 425.16, subdivision (c) authorizes only the SLAPP <em>defendant </em>to recover reasonable attorney fees and costs after prevailing on a special motion to strike a complaint under the anti-SLAPP statute. A <em>plaintiff </em>who prevails by defeating the motion to strike is <em>not </em>entitled to recover fees and costs under the anti-SLAPP statute simply by prevailing on the motion. Under section 425.16, subdivision (c) the plaintiff may recover fees and costs only by showing that the defendant\u2019s special motion to strike was frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay within the meaning of section 128.5.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Thus, a statutory award of attorney fees and costs under subdivision (c) of section 425.16 is not routine because it is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1433\">*1433</page-number>reciprocal. As already discussed, only a judgment for <em>routine </em>costs (i.e., costs awarded under \u00a7 1021 et seq.) is stayed automatically by the perfecting of an appeal. (\u00a7 917.1(d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-5\">Subdivisions (a)(10)(B) and (c)(5) of section 1033.5 together provide that attorney fees, when authorized under \u201cany\u201d California statute that \u201crefers to the award of \u2018costs and attorney\u2019s fees\u2019 \u201d are recoverable under section 1032 as \u201can item and component of the costs . . . .\u201d Here, Zimmerman was awarded reasonable attorney fees and costs under subdivision (c) of section 425.16, the first sentence of which refers to \u201cattorney\u2019s fees and costs.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The foregoing subdivisions of section 1033.5, however, cannot be construed as controlling authority with respect to the issue presented here given the clear and compelling legislative intent underlying the anti-SLAPP statute and its purpose. As already explained, the Legislature expressly set forth the intent and purpose underlying the anti-SLAPP statute in section 425.16, subdivision (a),<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> which expressly states the legislative intent to \u201cbroadly\u201d protect the right of petition. <em>(Briggs, supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at p. 1121.) The courts have recognized that the common features of SLAPP suits are their lack of merit and chilling of defendants\u2019 valid exercise of free speech and the right to petition the government for a redress of grievances. <em>(Wilcox, supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th at p. 823.) By enacting the anti-SLAPP statute, the Legislature intended to provide SLAPP defendants an efficient tool to quickly and inexpensively unmask and defeat SLAPP suits. <em>(Ibid.) </em>At the trial court level, that tool is the special motion to strike a SLAPP complaint under the provisions of section 425.16, subdivision (b)(1). A determined SLAPP plaintiff intent on pursuing the litigation, however, may (as happened here) seek appellate review. We are persuaded the Legislature intended to deter SLAPP litigation not only at the trial court level, but also in the appellate courts in order to protect the proper exercise of First Amendment rights. Requiring a SLAPP plaintiff who appeals from an adverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1434\">*1434</page-number>judgment under the anti-SLAPP statute to give an undertaking to stay enforcement of the portion of the judgment awarding reasonable attorneys fees and costs to the prevailing defendant under section 425.16, subdivision (c), will promote meritorious appeals, and will deter continued SLAPP litigation at the appellate level.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-4\">In sum, construing section 917.1(a)(1) together with the relevant provisions of sections 917.1 (subd. (d)) and 1033.5 (subds. (a)(10)(A), (c)(2) &amp; (c)(5)), and considering the legislative intent underlying the anti-SLAPP statute with a view to promoting the general purpose of that statute, we hold that a SLAPP plaintiffs perfecting of an appeal from a judgment awarding attorney fees and costs to a prevailing SLAPP defendant under subdivision (c) of section 425.16 does not automatically stay enforcement of the judgment. To stay enforcement of such a judgment, the SLAPP plaintiff must give an appropriate appeal bond or undertaking under the money judgment exception to the automatic stay rule.
