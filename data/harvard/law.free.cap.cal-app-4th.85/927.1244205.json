The trial court granted defendants a summary judgment because it determined the covenant not to compete was \u201cwithin a broader employment contract including \u2018choice of law\u2019 and \u2018severability\u2019 provisions [and therefore] does not violate the public policy of the State of California.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">Plaintiff contends the fact that the covenant not to compete was severable from the other provisions of the confidentiality agreement does not make defendants\u2019 firing of him lawful. We agree. We hold an employer cannot lawfully make the signing of an employment agreement, which contains an unenforceable covenant not to compete, a condition of continued employment, even if such agreement contains choice of law or severability provisions which would enable the employer to enforce the other provisions of the employment agreement. We further hold that an employer\u2019s termination of an employee who refuses to sign such an agreement constitutes a wrongful termination in violation of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>Background of the Case</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">1. <em>Procedural Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s complaint, filed in March 1999, alleges defendants hired him pursuant to an oral contract of employment for an indefinite term. Thereafter, defendants presented plaintiff with an employee confidentiality agreement, and when he refused to sign it within a specified period of time, he was summarily dismissed from his employment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The complaint alleges the dismissal was in violation of fundamental public policy, and it cites Business and Professions Code section 16600.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Defendants filed a general denial to the complaint and alleged 30 affirmative defenses. Plaintiff moved for summary adjudication on the issue whether defendants had a defense to his cause of action for wrongful termination. The motion was denied. Thereafter defendants moved for summary judgment, which was granted. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">2. <em>Provisions of the Employee Confidentiality Agreement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">The employee confidentiality agreement contains provisions that address an employee\u2019s responsibilities, and defendants\u2019 rights, respecting the nondisclosure of defendants\u2019 trade secrets and the transfer to defendants of inventions and patents that the employee may make or obtain during his employment. Additionally, the confidentiality agreement contains the following provision restricting an employee\u2019s competition with defendants (referred to herein as the covenant not to compete): \u201cEmployee will not render services, directly or indirectly, for a period of one year after separation of employment with Playhut, Inc. to any person or entity in connection with any Competing Product. A \u2018Competing Product\u2019 shall mean any products, processes or services of any person or entity other than Playhut, Inc. in existence or under development, which are substantially the same, may be substituted for, or applied to substantially that same end use as the products, processes or services with which I work during the time of my employment with Playhut, Inc. or about which I work during the time of my employment with Playhut Inc. or about which I acquire Confidential Information through my work with Playhut, Inc. Employee agrees that, upon accepting employment with any organization in competition with the Company or its affiliates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>during a period of five year(s) following employment separation, Employee shall notify the Company in writing within thirty days of the name and address of such new employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The confidentiality agreement contains choice of law and severability provisions, to wit: \u201cIt is agreed that this agreement will be interpreted and construed according to the laws of the state where the Company is located. Should any portion of this agreement be judicially held to be invalid, unenforceable or void, then such holding shall not invalidate the remainder of this agreement or any other part thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Additionally, the confidentiality agreement states that the employee is agreeing to the terms of the agreement \u201c[i]n consideration of my employment, continued employment, promotion, increases in compensation and/or other benefits now or hereafter paid or made available by the Company,\u201d and the agreement contains a provision that makes it retroactive to the date plaintiff was hired: \u201cThe above agreement . . . covers work performed protected [sic] under this agreement since date of hire at Playhut, Inc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">Issue on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">If an employment agreement contains an illegal covenant not to compete but also contains choice of law or severability provisions which would enable an employer to enforce the provisions of the agreement that are not prohibited by section 16600, can the employer lawfully condition an employee\u2019s continued employment on his signing the agreement, or does a firing of an employee for his refusal to sign the employment agreement give rise to a tort cause of action for public policy wrongful discharge?</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">1. <em>Introduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b703-11\">Clearly, the very broad covenant not to compete that is contained in the subject confidentiality agreement in this case comes, at least in part and perhaps entirely, within the prohibitory provisions of section 16600 and is therefore to that extent void and unenforceable. However, whether defendants could enforce any part of this noncompetition clause if plaintiff had signed and returned the agreement in a timely manner, continued in his employment, and later left that employment, is not an issue in this appeal. The issue is whether defendants can make plaintiff\u2019s acceptance of the agreement a condition of his continued employment by firing him when he refused to sign it. We hold they cannot. California law would protect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>plaintiff if defendants sought to overreach by trying enforce the covenant not to compete, and California the law will also protect him from a termination of his employment brought on by his refusal to sign an agreement containing the illegal covenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">2. <em>Public Policy Wrongful Discharge Suits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Plaintiff alleged in his complaint that under his employment agreement with defendants, they could only discharge him for good cause. Defendants alleged in their answer that plaintiff was an at-will employee. Which of these assertions is correct is not a factor in this appeal because while an employer has the right to discharge an at-will employee for a good reason, for no reason, or even for an arbitrary or irrational reason, such an employee may not be terminated \u201cfor an unlawful reason or a purpose that contravenes fundamental public policy.\u201d <em>(Gantt </em>v. <em>Sentry Insurance </em>(1992) 1 Cal.4th 1083, 1094 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 874, 824 P.2d 680] <em>(Gantt), </em>overruled on another point in <em>Green v. Ralee Engineering Co. </em>(1998) 19 Cal.4th 66, 80, fn. 6 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 16, 960 P.2d 1046].)  Employees have a tort cause of action against employers who fire them \u201cfor performing an act that public policy would encourage, or for refusing to do something that public policy would condemn.\u201d <em>(Gantt, supra, </em>at p. 1090.) \u201cWhen such a termination occurs, the nature of the employee\u2019s relationship with the employer, whether at will or contractual, is essentially irrelevant. What is vindicated through the cause of action is not the terms or promises arising out of the particular employment relationship involved, but rather the public interest in not permitting employers to impose as a condition of employment a requirement that an employee act in a manner contrary to fundamental public policy.\u201d <em>(Foley v. Interactive Data Corp. </em>(1988) 47 Cal.3d 654, 667, fn. 7 [254 Cal.Rptr. 211, 765 P.2d 373].)</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">\u201cThe public policy must involve a subject which affects the public at large rather than a purely personal or proprietary interest of the plaintiff or employer. The policy must also be fundamental, substantial and well established at the time of discharge.\u201d <em>(Parada </em>v. <em>City of Colton </em>(1994) 24 Cal.App.4th 356, 363 [29 Cal.Rptr.2d 309], citing <em>Gantt.) </em>\u201c[C]ourts in wrongful discharge actions may not declare public policy without a basis in either constitutional or statutory provisions. A public policy exception [to the general at-will employment termination rules] carefully tethered to fundamental policies that are delineated in constitutional or statutory provisions strikes the proper balance among the interests of employers, employees and the public. The employer is bound, at a minimum, to know the fundamental public policies of the state and nation as expressed in their constitutions and statutes; so limited, the public policy exception presents no impediment to employers that operate within the bounds of law. Employees are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>protected against employer actions that contravene fundamental state policy. And society\u2019s interests are served through a more stable job market, in which its most important policies are safeguarded.\u201d <em>(Gantt, supra, </em>1 Cal.4th at p. 1095, italics omitted.) In addition to statutes and constitutional provisions, valid administrative regulations may also serve as a source of fundamental public policy that impacts on an employer\u2019s right to discharge employees when such regulations implement fundamental public policy found in their enabling statutes. <em>(Green v. Ralee Engineering Co., supra, </em>19 Cal.4th at pp. 71, 79-82.)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">In the instant case, there exists a clear legislative declaration of public policy against covenants not to compete. \u201c[Section 16600] represents a strong public policy of this state [citations].\u201d <em>(KGB, Inc. </em>v. <em>Giannoulas </em>(1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 844, 848 [164 Cal.Rptr. 571].) \u201cCalifornia courts have consistently declared [section 16600] an expression of public policy to ensure that every citizen shall retain the right to pursue any lawful employment and enterprise of their choice.\u201d <em>(Metro Traffic Control, Inc. </em>v. <em>Shadow Traffic Network </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 853, 859 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 573].) \u201cThe interests of the employee in his own mobility and betterment are deemed paramount to the competitive business interests of the employers, where neither the employee nor his new employer has committed any illegal act accompanying the employment change.\u201d <em>(Diodes, Inc. </em>v. <em>Franzen </em>(1968) 260 Cal.App.2d 244, 255 [67 Cal.Rptr. 19].) This public policy against covenants not to compete legitimately forms the basis of plaintiff\u2019s cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\"><em>Baker Pacific Corp. v. Sutiles </em>(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 1148 [269 Cal.Rptr. 709], a declaratory relief action brought by an employer, involved a situation analogous to the one presented in this case. In <em>Baker, </em>asbestos removal workers were required to sign a release form as a condition of employment, and the workers who refused to sign the release were denied employment. The <em>Baker </em>court determined the release form violated the public policy set forth in Civil Code section 1668. (220 Cal.App.3d at p. 1154.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court held that since the release violated public policy, it necessarily followed that requiring prospective workers to sign the release as a condition of employment was contrary to law. (220 Cal.App.3d at p. 1154.)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">In so holding, the <em>Baker </em>court rejected the employer\u2019s argument that since the release was invalid and could therefore have no force or effect, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>employer\u2019s actions in requiring the employees to sign it as a condition of employment could also have no force or effect and therefore could not be contrary to law. The court called this argument \u201ccircular and unintelligible.\u201d In the instant case, defendants make a similar argument. They assert that because the confidentiality agreement has choice of law and severability provisions, the agreement \u201ccould not be construed against [plaintiff] in a manner which violates the public policy of section 16600,\u201d and therefore there is no connection between section 16600\u2019s public policy and defendants\u2019 conduct. Thus, their argument goes, plaintiff can have no wrongful termination suit based on violation of California public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">Like the <em>Baker </em>court, we find such reasoning unavailing. It is clear that the severability clause exists for the benefit of Playhut, not Playhut\u2019s employees. It is there to help defendants enforce the provisions of the agreement that are valid. It serves no purpose on behalf of plaintiff. Moreover, as discussed below, it is not likely that Playhut\u2019s employees are sufficiently versed in California\u2019s law of contracts such that they would know (1) that the covenant not to compete is invalid and therefore not enforceable by Playhut and (2) that they could sign the agreement without fear they would be bound by the covenant not to compete. Thus, the severability and choice of law provisions do not provide support for the summary judgment granted to defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">3. <em>Defendants\u2019. Request for a Special Construction of the Covenant Not to Comp\u00e9te</em></p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">\u201c[Section 16600] invalidates provisions in employment contracts prohibiting an employee from working for a competitor after completion of his employment or imposing a penalty if he does so [citations], unless they are necessary to protect the employer\u2019s trade secrets [citation].\u201d <em>(Muggill v. Reuben H. Donnelley Corp. </em>(1965) 62 Cal.2d 239, 242 [42 Cal.Rptr. 107, 398 P.2d 147, 18 A.L.R.3d 1241].) Defendants assert that the summary judgment granted them by the trial court can be affirmed if only we will construe the covenant not to compete as a \u201cnarrow restraint\u201d \u201cagainst the disclosure of trade secrets and other confidential information.\u201d Defendants base their position on certain rules of appellate review: (1) if a judgment is \u201ccorrect on any theory of law applicable to the case, including but not limited to the theory adopted by the trial court\u201d then it will be affirmed if \u201cthere is no genuine issue of material fact\u201d <em>(Western Mutual Ins. Co. v. Yamamoto </em>(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1474, 1481 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 698]), and (2) the reviewing court independently interprets a written instrument if the trial court\u2019s interpretation of such instrument is not based on conflicting extrinsic evidence <em>(Rollins v. Stokes </em>(1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 701, 709 [176 Cal.Rptr. 835]).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>While it is true that a covenant not to compete will not be viewed as a violation of section 16600 if it is \u201cnecessary to protect the employer\u2019s trade secrets\u201d <em>(Muggill </em>v. <em>Reuben H. Donnelley Corp., supra, </em>62 Cal.2d at p. 242), and while it is true that employers have the right to protect proprietary and property rights which are subject to protection under the law of unfair competition <em>(Metro Traffic Control, Inc. </em>v. <em>Shadow Traffic Network, supra, </em>22 Cal.App.4th at p. 861), we do not perceive the intended purpose of the instant covenant not to compete to be the protection of Playhut\u2019s property, trade secrets, and other proprietary information since (1) it is the other provisions of the agreement that are meant to provide such protection, and (2) the covenant not to compete only places a one-year limitation on plaintiff\u2019s activities whereas these other provisions are not so limited. Moreover, the covenant not to compete simply does not lend itself to the construction defendants assert. Therefore, we would be acting outside the norm if we construed the provision as defendants wish. We would not be reforming the contract based on a mistake of the parties; rather we would be saving a statutorily proscribed and void provision. <em>(Kolani v. Gluska </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 402, 407-408 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 257].)</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Further, even if we could construe the covenant not to compete as a trade secret provision, it is not likely that the average employee of Playhut would so interpret it, given the language utilized in the provision and the presence of the above mentioned provisions, which are clearly meant to provide trade secret protection. Therefore, if we were to agree to the construction defendants ask for, we would undermine the protection given to employees in section 16600, since many, if not most, employees would likely interpret the provision as a covenant not to compete, and might act according to their interpretation rather than consult an attorney to find out if their interpretation is correct. <em>(Kolani v. Gluska, supra, </em>64 Cal.App.4th at p. 408.) We quote from <em>Baker Pacific Corp. v. Sutiles, supra, </em>220 Cal.App.3d at page 1155: \u201c[A]n employment relationship, where hiring is conditioned on acceptance of statutorily proscribed terms, is not acceptable to us. Moreover, it has potential for bringing serious mischief to the work place. We cannot expect workers generally to be cognizant of [their section 16600 rights]. We reject the concept that a worker, compelled by economic necessity to secure employment, can be thus coerced into signing sweeping agreements [to not compete with their employers upon leaving the employment] in the uninformed hope the agreement will not be enforced by the courts. We foresee situations where the uninformed . . . employee will forego legitimate [employment] rather than assume the risk of expensive, time-consuming litigation [by the former employer].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">The summary judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.
