The question is whether DOHSA preempts an employer\u2019s state law claim in a subrogation action to recover from a third party tortfeasor sums the employer was obligated to pay for an employee\u2019s injury. We hold that it does. We also hold that California courts have concurrent jurisdiction over DOHSA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-11\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b837-12\">Appellant and plaintiff in intervention Southern California Permanente Medical Group (Kaiser) employed Jackie Garofalo. In the course of her employment with Kaiser, Ms. Garofalo suffered injuries that aggravated her preexisting respiratory ailments. As a result, a workers\u2019 compensation proceeding rated Ms. Garofalo 100 percent disabled. A workers\u2019 compensation award required Kaiser to provide lifetime medical care for Ms. Garofalo.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-13\">In September 1992, Ms. Garofalo and her husband Frank Garofalo went on a cruise on the ship Sky Princess, operated by defendant and respondent Princess Cruises, Inc. (Princess). During the cruise, while the ship was on the high seas, a fire broke out in the ship\u2019s cinema. Ms. Garofalo claimed to have sustained injuries when she inhaled smoke from the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-14\">In September 1993, Ms. Garofalo and her husband filed a complaint in superior court against Princess, alleging state law claims for personal injuries, medical negligence, and loss of consortium, allegedly resulting from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>shipboard fire. On or about November 18, 1993, Kaiser intervened as a plaintiff under Labor Code sections 3852 and 3853. It sought from Princess the costs of additional medical care it had provided to Ms. Garofalo allegedly as a result of the aggravation of her injuries due to the fire. Kaiser\u2019s complaint alleged, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-4\">\u201c4. Intervenor refers to and incorporates herein by reference each and every charging allegation contained in plaintiff\u2019s Complaint for damages on file herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-5\">\u201c5. As a proximate result of said injuries to plaintiff and the carelessness and negligence or other conduct or misconduct of the defendants-in-intervention, and each of them, intervenor has been required to furnish, has furnished and will in the future be required to furnish compensation benefits under the provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Laws of the State of California to arid on behalf of plaintiff in an undetermined amount.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">In March-1994, approximately 18 months after the cruise, Ms. Garofalo died as a result of medical conditions allegedly aggravated by the shipboard fire. In December 1994, Frank and his daughter Karen Garofalo filed a second lawsuit in superior court against Princess, alleging state law claims for wrongful death, medical negligence, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. In that complaint, Frank and Karen contended that, \u201cas a direct and proximate result\u201d of Princess\u2019s negligence, Ms. Garofalo \u201cwas injured in her health, strength and activity ... all of which injuries subsequently caused death on March 28, 1994.\u201d Kaiser did not intervene in the wrongful death action. In April 1997, Frank dismissed the personal injury complaint with prejudice against all defendants. Kaiser remained the sole plaintiff in the personal injury action against Princess.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">Princess moved for summary judgment in the Garofalos\u2019 wrongful death action, claiming DOHSA, 46 United States Code appendix section 761, preempted the wrongful death claim, and that California courts lacked subject matter jurisdiction over DOHSA claims. In March 1996, the trial court granted the summary judgment motion on the grounds that the Garofalos had failed to oppose it. Thus, the only remaining litigation was Kaiser\u2019s subrogation claim in the first personal injury action, seeking costs of medical care provided to Ms. Garofalo.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">In March 1998, Princess moved for summary judgment against Kaiser. It argued, inter alia, that DOHSA preempted Kaiser\u2019s state court claim for negligence as a matter of law, and that Kaiser\u2019s negligence complaint against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number>Princess failed for lack of evidence of causation. Kaiser opposed the motion. It argued that Princess had not established that DOHSA preempted the suit, and that triable issues of fact existed regarding causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">On May 7, 1998, the trial court issued a minute order denying Princess\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The order stated: \u201cThe Court concludes that there exist triable issues of fact concerning whether any exposure to smoke by Ms. Garofalo aggravated her medical condition, and that defendant has not shown that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">Princess subsequently filed a petition for writ of mandate. This court issued an alternative writ of mandate and ordered the trial court to vacate its order denying summary judgment \u201cinsofar as the order is based on any finding that the action is not preempted by the federal Death on the High Seas Act (DOHSA) (46 U.S.C. Appen. \u00a7 761); or [H] . . . in the alternative HU Show Cause . . . why a peremptory writ of mandate should not issue directing you to enter an order based on the determination the action is preempted by DOHSA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">On July 21, 1998, the trial court determined that DOHSA preempted the present action and vacated the May 7, 1998 order. The trial court issued a new minute order, granting Princess\u2019 motion for summary judgment. That order concluded that under <em>Dooley v. Korean Air Lines Co. </em>(1998) 524 U.S. 116 [118 S.Ct. 1890, 141 L.Ed.2d 102], DOHSA preempted the action and that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The court entered judgment and Kaiser filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">Kaiser contends that DOHSA does not govern its claims, because (1) DOHSA should not be applied for the benefit of a wrongdoer; (2) DOHSA only preempts wrongful death actions, not the personal injury action in which Kaiser intervened; (3) Kaiser has an independent property right, not derived from Ms. Garofalo\u2019s wrongful death claim; and (4) DOHSA does not apply because Kaiser does not contend the shipboard fire caused Ms. Garofalo\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">Princess asserts that (1) DOHSA provides the exclusive remedy for wrongful death and survival actions caused by an injury occurring on the high seas; (2) Kaiser\u2019s claim is derivative of Ms. Garofalo\u2019s and because DOHSA preempts her claim, DOHSA also preempts Kaiser\u2019s claim; (3) Kaiser has asserted the shipboard fire was a cause of Ms. Garofalo\u2019s death, and there is no material issue of fact on this point; and (4) DOHSA applies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>regardless of whether the high seas injury was the sole cause or a contributing cause of Ms. Garofalo\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">1. <em>Standard of review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">The standards applicable to our review of a summary judgment motion are well settled. Summary judgment is properly granted if there is no triable issue of material fact and the issues raised by the pleadings may be decided as a matter of law. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (c); <em>Spray, Gould &amp; Bowers v. Associated Internat. Ins. Co. </em>(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 1260, 1266 [84 Cal.Rptr.2d 552].) \u201cA defendant. . . has met his or her burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if that party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be established, or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 437c, subd. (o)(2).)  Because our review of the grant or denial of summary judgment involves pure questions of law, we review the record independently. <em>('Wilkins </em>v. <em>National Broadcasting Co. </em>(1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 1066, 1074 [84 Cal.Rptr.2d 329].)</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">\u201cAs a summary judgment motion raises only questions of law regarding the construction and effect of supporting and opposing papers, this court independently applies the same three-step analysis required of the trial court. We identify issues framed by the pleadings; determine whether the moving party\u2019s showing established facts that negate the opponent\u2019s claim and justify a judgment in the moving party\u2019s favor; and if it does, we finally determine whether the opposition demonstrates the existence of a triable, material factual issue. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Tsemetzin v. Coast Federal Savings &amp; Loan Assn. </em>(1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 1334, 1342 [67 Cal.Rptr.2d 726].)</p>\n<p id=\"b840-9\">A challenge to the subject matter jurisdiction of a court may properly be brought on summary judgment. <em>(Greener v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1028, 1036 [25 Cal.Rptr.2d 539, 863 P.2d 784].) Likewise, interpretation of a statute, including its preemptive effect, is a question of law which may be considered on summary judgment. (Cf. <em>San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>v. <em>City of Carlsbad </em>(1998) 64 Cal.App.4th 785, 792 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 534].)</p>\n<p id=\"b840-10\">2. <em>An employer\u2019s subrogation rights under California workers\u2019 compensation laws.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b840-12\">When an employee is injured in the course of his or her employment, California\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation laws generally provide the employee\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>exclusive remedy against the employer. <em>(Employers Mutual Liability Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Tutor-Saliba Corp. </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 632, 637 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 851, 951 P.2d 420]; <em>Finney </em>v. <em>Manpower, Inc. </em>(1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 1066, 1069 [177 Cal.Rptr. 74].) However, the workers\u2019 compensation laws do not preclude the employee from suing a negligent third party proximately responsible for his or her industrial injuries. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3852; <em>Employers Mutual Liability Ins. Co </em>v. <em>Tutor-Saliba Corp., supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 637.)</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Labor Code section 3852<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> also provides that an employer who is obligated to pay a workers\u2019 compensation award for an industrial injury has the right to sue a third party responsible for the injury in order to recoup the amount paid to the employee. \u201cWhen an employee is injured by a third party\u2019s tortious act, an employer is indirectly injured to the extent the employer must pay out workers\u2019 compensation benefits.\u201d <em>(San Diego Unified Port Dist. v. Superior Court </em>(1988) 197 Cal.App.3d 843, 846 [243 Cal.Rptr. 163].) Therefore, \u201c[u]nder Labor Code section 3852, an employer who pays workers [\u2019] compensation benefits to an employee may sue a third party in order to recover a sum equivalent to the benefits which the employer must provide the employee, if the third party, and not the employer, is responsible for the employee\u2019s injury.\u201d <em>(County of San Diego </em>v. <em>Sanfax Corp. </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 862, 868 [140 Cal.Rptr. 638, 568 P.2d 363], fn. omitted.) To this end, the employer may intervene in the employee\u2019s suit, or obtain recovery through various other procedural means. <em>(San Diego Unified Port Dist. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>197 Cal.App.3d at p. 846.)</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">The employer may also seek recovery from a third party tortfeasor who subsequently injures the employee in a nonindustrial accident, if the employer thereby becomes obligated to pay additional compensation such as medical benefits. For example, in <em>Abdala </em>v. <em>Aziz </em>(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 369 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 130], employee Abdala sustained an industrial back injury. The workers\u2019 compensation carrier became obligated to provide medical and other benefits to Abdala. Weeks after the industrial injury, Abdala was injured in an automobile accident which aggravated her back injury. The carrier was obligated to pay the additional medical bills resulting from the automobile accident. The court reasoned that, \u201csection 3852 et seq. must be interpreted to allow employers subrogation rights whenever, and to whatever extent, an employee suffers a subsequent tortious injury <em>which also increases the employer\u2019s liability for compensation. </em>This is true whether or not that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>subsequent injury is industrial in nature.\u201d <em>(Abdala v. Aziz, supra, </em>3 Cal.App.4th at p. 375.)</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">The employer\u2019s right to recoup these costs from a third party merely codifies the principles of equitable subrogation. <em>{Employers Mutual Liability Ins. Co. v. Tutor-Saliba Corp., supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 637; <em>County of San Diego v. Sanfax Corp., supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at p. 876, fn. 7.) Accordingly, \u201c[w]here . . . the employer intervenes [in an employee\u2019s suit against a third party tortfeasor], its status is akin to that of a subrogee.\u201d <em>{Demkowski v. Lee </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1251, 1258 [284 Cal.Rptr. 919].) Under Labor Code section 3851, the employer\u2019s subrogation right survives the employee\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Workers\u2019 compensation subrogation provisions are procedural, not substantive. <em>{County of San Diego v. Sanfax Corp., supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at p. 872 [\u201cThese statutory provisions are \u2018primarily procedural.\u2019 \u201d]; <em>Breese v. Price </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 923, 929 [176 Cal.Rptr. 791, 633 P.2d 987].) Moreover, \u201c[t]he workers[\u2019] compensation statutes governing employer and employee actions against third parties do not define the substantive law which determines whether an employee or an employer will in fact recover. [Citation.] Instead, the substantive law which governs employer and employee actions is usually the general tort law.\u201d <em>{County of San Diego v. Sanfax Corp., supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at pp. 873-874.)</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">In bringing a subrogation action under Labor Code section 3852, the employer stands in the same shoes as its injured employee. Its action is purely derivative of the employee\u2019s action. The employer\u2019s \u201cright to recover workers\u2019 compensation benefits derives from and does not extend beyond the employee\u2019s tort remedy against the negligent third party.\u201d <em>{Demkowski </em>v. <em>Lee, supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d at p. 1258.) \u201cSubstantively, as well as procedurally, employer and employee actions are interchangeable: regardless of who brings an action, it is essentially the same lawsuit.\u201d <em>{County of San Diego </em>v. <em>Sanfax Corp., supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at p. 874.) As a subrogee, an employer\u2019s rights \u201cdo not differ from those which would be conferred by an assignment of the same claim.\u201d <em>{Finney v. Manpower, Inc., supra, </em>123 Cal.App.3d at p. 1070.) For that reason, an insurance carrier or employer \u201cmay not recover any damages in excess of those recoverable by the employee.\u201d <em>(San Diego Unified Port Dist. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>197 Cal.App.3d at p. 847; <em>Breese v. Price, supra, </em>29 Cal.3d at p. 928.) \u201cIndeed, it would be anomalous for an employer or insurer to recover damages greater, in nature or amount, than those afforded the injured employee.\u201d <em>{Breese v. Price, supra, </em>at p. 928.)</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">3. <em>The Death on the High Seas Act.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">In 1920, Congress passed DOES A, 46 United States Code appendix section 761 et seq., creating a wrongful death action for deaths occurring on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>the seas more than three miles from shore. <em>(Mobil Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Higginbotham </em>(1978) 436 U.S. 618, 620 [98 S.Ct. 2010, 2012, 56 L.Ed.2d 581].) Until passage of DOHSA, \u201c \u2018there was no remedy for death on the high seas caused by breach of one of the duties imposed by federal maritime law.\u2019 [Citation.] [H] It was in this atmosphere that Congress considered legislation designed to provide a uniform and effective wrongful death remedy for survivors of persons killed on the high seas.\u201d <em>(Offshore Logistics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tallentire </em>(1986) 477 U.S. 207, 214 [106 S.Ct. 2485, 2490, 91 L.Ed.2d 174].)</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Section 1 of DOHSA (46 U.S.C. appen. \u00a7 761(a)) provides in pertinent part: \u201c[w]henever the death of a person shall be caused by wrongful act, neglect, or default occurring on the high seas beyond a marine league from the shore of any State ... the personal representative of the decedent may maintain a suit for damages in the district courts of the United States, in admiralty, for the exclusive benefit of the decedent\u2019s wife, husband, parent, child, or dependent relative against the vessel, person, or corporation which would have been liable if death had not ensued.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">DOHSA limits recovery to \u201c \u2018a fair and just compensation for the pecuniary loss sustained by the persons for whose benefit the suit is sought.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Dooley </em>v. <em>Korean Air Lines Co., supra, </em>524 U.S. at p. 122 [118 S.Ct. at p. 1894].) Thus, DOHSA authorizes recovery for the DOHSA beneficiaries\u2019 pecuniary losses only; it does not authorize recovery for the decedent\u2019s own losses, nor does it allow damages for nonpecuniary losses. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">Appendix section 765 of 46 United States Code provides a limited \u201csurvival provision.\u201d \u201cIf a person die[s] as the result of such wrongful act, neglect, or default as is mentioned in section 761 of this title during the pendency in a court of admiralty of the United States of a suit to recover damages for personal injuries in respect of such act, neglect, or default, the personal representative of the decedent may be substituted as a party and the suit may proceed as a suit under this chapter for the recovery of the compensation provided in section 762 of this title.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">As the United States Supreme Court has explained, \u201cThe Death on the High Seas Act . . . announces Congress\u2019 considered judgment on such issues as the beneficiaries, the limitations period, contributory negligence, survival, and damages. [Citation.] The Act does not address every issue of wrongful-death law, . . . but when it does speak directly to a question, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1072\">*1072</page-number>courts are not free to \u2018supplement\u2019 Congress\u2019 answer so thoroughly that the Act becomes meaningless.\u201d <em>(Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham, supra, </em>436 U.S. at p. 625 [98 S.Ct. at p. 2014].)</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">The death itself need not actually occur on the high seas in order for DOHSA to apply. The key inquiry is where the death-producing event occurred. DOHSA\u2019s provisions have \u201cbeen held to refer to the site of an accident on the high seas, not to where death actually occurs or where the wrongful act causing the accident may have originated.\u201d <em>(Bergen v. F/V St. Patrick </em>(9th Cir. 1987) 816 F.2d 1345, 1348; <em>Motts </em>v. <em>M/V Green Wave </em>(5th Cir. 2000) 210 F.3d 565, 569-570; <em>Howard v. Crystal Cruises, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1994) 41 F.3d 527.) For example, in <em>Motts v. M/V Green Wave, </em>a seaman\u2019s hip and pelvis were crushed in an accident while the ship was on the high seas. The ship\u2019s personnel and management company failed to provide adequate medical care for him for over two weeks. The seaman eventually underwent surgery in Texas and died onshore approximately a month after the accident. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held that DOHSA applied, \u201ceven though all of [the ship management company\u2019s] actions and Motts\u2019s death occurred onshore.\u201d <em>(Motts </em>v. <em>M/V Green Wave, supra, </em>210 F.3d at p. 570.)</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">4. <em>DOHSA preempts state wrongful death and survival claims when death is caused by a wrongful act occurring on the high seas.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">Several United States Supreme Court decisions address the relationship between DOHSA, state wrongful death laws, and the general maritime law of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">We preface our discussion by quoting a cogent description of how wrongful death and survival actions differ. \u201cAlthough they are often lumped together without any distinction, [citation], they are, in fact, quite distinct. [Citation.] [H] A wrongful death cause of action belongs to the decedent\u2019s dependents (or closest kin in the case of the death of a minor). It allows the beneficiaries to recover for the harm that <em>they </em>personally suffered as a result of the death, and it is totally independent of any cause of action the decedent may have had for his or her own personal injuries. Damages are determined by what the beneficiaries would have \u2018received\u2019 from the decedent and can include recovery for pecuniary losses like lost monetary support, and for non-pecuniary losses like loss of society. [Citation.] A survival action, in contrast, belongs to the estate of the deceased (although it is usually brought by the deceased\u2019s relatives acting in a representative capacity) and allows recovery for the injury to the <em>deceased </em>from the action causing death. Under a survival action, the decedent\u2019s representative recovers for the decedent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1073\">*1073</page-number>pain and suffering, medical expenses, lost earnings (both past and future), and funeral expenses.\u201d <em>(Calhoun v. Yamaha Motor Corp., U.S.A. </em>(3d Cir. 1994) 40 F.3d 622, 637, affd. (1996) 516 U.S. 199 [116 S.Ct. 619, 133 L.Ed.2d 578].)</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">In <em>Mobil Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Higginbotham, supra, </em>436 U.S. 618, the court held that in an action for wrongful death on the high seas, the appropriate measure of damages is that established by DOHSA. There, passengers on a helicopter flight were killed in a crash over the high seas. The plaintiffs, decedents\u2019 widows, sought damages for loss of society under the general maritime law. The court found that, because DOHSA represented Congress\u2019s considered judgment on the issue of recovery of damages for wrongful death on the high seas, the plaintiffs were limited to pecuniary losses. Thus, the plaintiffs could not supplement their DOHSA recovery with claims brought pursuant to the general maritime law. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 623-625 [98 S.Ct. at p. 2015].)</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">In <em>Offshore Logistics, Inc. v. Tallentire, supra, All </em>U.S. 207, the court held that DOHSA preempted Louisiana\u2019s wrongful death statute. There, widows of two drilling platform workers killed in a helicopter crash over the high seas brought wrongful death claims under Louisiana\u2019s wrongful death statute, as well as under DOHSA and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. The plaintiffs relied upon DOHSA\u2019s section 7, which provides in relevant part, \u201cThe provisions of any State statute giving or regulating rights of action or remedies for death shall not be affected by this chapter.\u201d (46 U.S.C. appen. \u00a7 767.) They argued that section 7 therefore allowed them to maintain claims for their husbands\u2019 deaths under state laws. After tracing the legislative history of DOHSA, the Supreme Court held that the statutory language was not meant to preserve the applicability of state law wrongful death statutes and remedies outside territorial waters, but was merely a jurisdictional saving clause. The court found: \u201cOnce it is determined that \u00a7 7 acts as a jurisdictional saving clause, and not as a guarantee of the applicability of state substantive law to wrongful deaths on the high seas, the conclusion that the state statutes are pre-empted by DOHSA where it applies is inevitable. As we held in <em>Higginbotham, </em>Congress has \u2018struck the balance for us\u2019 in determining that survivors should be restricted to the recovery of their pecuniary losses . . . .\u201d <em>(Offshore Logistics, Inc. v. Tallentire, supra, All </em>U.S. at p. 232 [106 S.Ct. at p. 2499].) <em>Offshore Logistics </em>declined to consider \u201cwhether the DOHSA recovery for the beneficiaries\u2019 pecuniary loss may be \u2018supplemented\u2019 by a recovery for the decedent\u2019s pain and suffering before death under the survival provision of some conceivably applicable state statute that is intended to apply on the high seas.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 215, fn. 1 [106 S.Ct. at p. 2490].)</p>\n<p id=\"b846-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1074\">*1074</page-number>The court\u2019s most recent pronouncement on the subject, <em>Dooley v. Korean Air Lines Co., supra, </em>524 U.S. 116, likewise stressed DOHSA\u2019s preeminence. In <em>Dooley, </em>petitioners were the personal representatives of three passengers killed when the former Soviet Union shot down Korean Air Lines Flight KE007 after the plane strayed into Soviet airspace. The petitioners sought to recover for their decedents\u2019 predeath pain and suffering. They argued that although DOHSA did not permit such damages, general maritime law provided for a survival action allowing the decedents\u2019 estates to recover for predeath pain and suffering. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 120 [118 S.Ct. at p. 1893].) Petitioners contended that, because DOHSA was a wrongful death statute, it had no bearing on the availability of a survival action. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 123 [118 S.Ct. at pp. 1894-1895].) The airline, on the other hand, argued DOHSA provided the exclusive cause of action for deaths occurring on the high seas. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 119 [118 S.Ct. at pp. 1892-1893].) The Supreme Court granted certiorari to resolve a split in the circuit courts regarding the \u201cavailability of a general maritime survival action in cases of death on the high seas.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 121 [118 S.Ct. at p. 1893].)</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">The Supreme Court agreed with the airline that DOHSA provides the exclusive remedy for death on the high seas. \u201cDOHSA expresses Congress\u2019 judgment that there should be no such cause of action [for the decedent\u2019s pre-death pain and suffering] in cases of death on the high seas. By authorizing only certain surviving relatives to recover damages, and by limiting damages to the pecuniary losses sustained by those relatives, Congress provided the exclusive recovery for deaths that occur on the high seas. Petitioners concede that their proposed survival action would necessarily expand the class of beneficiaries in cases of death on the high seas by permitting decedents\u2019 estates (and their various beneficiaries) to recover compensation. They further concede that their cause of action would expand the recoverable damages for deaths on the high seas by permitting the recovery of nonpecuniary losses, such as pre-death pain and suffering. Because Congress has already decided these issues, it has precluded the judiciary from enlarging either the class of beneficiaries or the recoverable damages. . . . [f] The comprehensive scope of DOHSA is confirmed by its survival provision . . . which limits the recovery in such cases to the pecuniary losses suffered by surviving relatives. The Act thus expresses Congress\u2019 \u2018considered judgment,\u2019 [citation] on the availability and contours of a survival action in cases of death on the high seas. For this reason, it cannot be contended that DOHSA has no bearing on survival actions; rather, Congress has simply chosen to adopt a more limited survival provision. . . . [ft] In sum, Congress has spoken on the availability of a survival action, the losses to be recovered, and the beneficiaries, in cases of death on the high seas. Because Congress has chosen not to authorize a survival action for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1075\">*1075</page-number>decedent\u2019s pre-death pain and suffering, there can be no general maritime survival action for such damages.\u201d <em>(Dooley </em>v. <em>Korean Air Lines Co., supra, </em>524 U.S. at pp. 123-124 [118 S.Ct. at p. 1895].)</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">These cases make clear that (1) DOHSA preempts state wrongful death and survival claims when the incident leading to death occurs on the high seas; and (2) DOHSA limits recovery to pecuniary damages and prohibits litigants from supplementing their DOHSA claims with claims brought either under state law or the general maritime law. (E.g., <em>Zicherman v. Korean Air Lines Co. </em>(1996) 516 U.S. 217, 230 [116 S.Ct. 629, 636, 133 L.Ed.2d 596].)</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">5. <em>Application of DOHSA to Kaiser\u2019s claim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">Applying these principles to the case before us, we conclude that DOHSA preempts Kaiser\u2019s state law claim. Because Kaiser stands in Ms. Garofalo\u2019s shoes and can have no greater recovery than could Ms. Garofalo, we look to DOHSA\u2019s effect on Ms. Garofalo\u2019s claim. As Kaiser concedes, DOHSA provides the exclusive remedy for wrongful death and survival actions resulting from death on the high seas, and the Garofalo family has no remedy but DOHSA. Neither does Kaiser.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">Preliminarily, we note neither party disputes that the Sky Princess was on the high seas when the fire occurred. It is also clear that, if the fire was a cause of Ms. Garofalo\u2019s death, the fact she died in California approximately 18 months later does not affect DOHSA coverage. (E.g., <em>Motts v. M/V Green Wave, supra, </em>210 F.3d at pp. 569-570.)</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">As set forth above, Kaiser\u2019s rights against Princess are strictly derivative of Ms. Garofalo\u2019s. Kaiser can have no greater right to recovery than could Ms. Garofalo, its injured employee. The two actions are \u201cinterchangeable,\u201d and \u201cessentially the same lawsuit.\u201d <em>(County of San Diego v. Sanfax Corp., supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at p. 874.) Moreover, the California workers\u2019 compensation subrogation and intervention provisions were not meant to provide the substantive law governing a claim against a third party tortfeasor; they are procedural only. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 873-874.) Labor Code section 3852 does not guarantee that an employer has a right to recover under the substantive law governing the action. Thus, our analysis of Kaiser\u2019s claim must begin and end with an analysis of Ms. Garofalo\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">Assuming that injuries on board the Sky Princess caused Ms. Garofalo\u2019s death, DOHSA would have governed her claim. <em>Mobil Oil, Offshore Logistics </em>and <em>Dooley </em>stand for the proposition that DOHSA preempts state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1076\">*1076</page-number>wrongful death claims and survival actions and therefore governs the types of recovery available. DOHSA\u2019s survival provision, 46 United States Code appendix section 765, covers exactly the circumstance here: an employee is injured on the high seas, sues, and later dies of the injuries. Under these circumstances, the only action available is for pecuniary damages under DOHSA, 46 United States Code appendix section 761 et seq. Other state law claims are not cognizable. Accordingly, because DOHSA preempts state law wrongful death and survival actions if a decedent dies of high seas injuries, <em>(.Dooley v. Korean Air Lines Co., supra, </em>524 U.S. 116), the trial court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of Princess. (E.g., <em>Jacobs v. Northern King Shipping Co., Ltd. </em>(5th Cir. 1999) 180 F.3d 713, 719-720 [holding DOHSA preempted claim based upon state survival act].)</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">6. <em>Kaiser\u2019s claims have no merit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Kaiser makes several arguments in support of its position, but none are persuasive. First, Kaiser urges that because DOHSA was enacted \u201cfor the benefit of the wronged not the wrongdoer,\u201d it should not be invoked to the detriment of the decedent\u2019s beneficiaries. The law does not support this argument. As Princess points out, DOHSA has frequently been invoked to limit or reduce the recovery that might otherwise have been available to the decedent\u2019s family. (E.g., <em>Dooley v. Korean Air Lines Co., supra, </em>524 U.S. 116 [holding DOHSA precludes recovery for decedent\u2019s predeath pain and suffering].) Kaiser cites no authority supporting the novel proposition that DOHSA only applies when it favors the decedent\u2019s representative or estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">Second, Kaiser appears to argue that because it did not intervene in the Garofalo wrongful death claim, it can successfully sue on the personal injury claim filed by Ms. Garofalo before her death. <em>Dooley </em>made clear, however, that DOHSA preempts all state wrongful death claims and state \u201csurvival actions\u201d i.e., claims for personal injury occurring before a decedent\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">Next Kaiser suggests that \u201cDOHSA only preempts wrongful death and survival actions; it does not preempt actions which are not affected by common law rules of abatement.\u201d Kaiser cites no persuasive authority for this reading of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">Kaiser also posits that DOHSA should not preempt California law governing workers\u2019 compensation subrogation rights, in that DOHSA does not address subrogation rights. Kaiser points out that preemption should be disfavored unless the evidence of preemptive purpose appears in the text and structure of the statute, and DOHSA contains no express preemption clause. However, as explained above, an employer\u2019s subrogation rights depend upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1077\">*1077</page-number>the employee\u2019s rights against the tortfeasor. Because DOHSA preempts the employee\u2019s state law wrongful death claims and provides the only \u201csurvival\u201d remedy for injuries to the decedent occurring before death, DOHSA necessarily preempts Kaiser\u2019s state law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">In conjunction with its other arguments, Kaiser urges that DOHSA should not apply because Kaiser sued not for wrongful death, but for damages to its property rights. Kaiser attempts to recast its rights as separate from the employee\u2019s cause of action, arguing that it has \u201can independent right of action against Princess for property damage.\u201d Apparently Kaiser hopes, in this way, to avoid the fact that its action is derivative of Ms. Garofalo\u2019s. In support of its argument, Kaiser retreats to several early cases holding that Labor Code section 3852 created an independent property right. (E.g., <em>Morris v. Standard Oil Co. </em>(1926) 200 Cal. 210, 214 [252 P. 605];. <em>Limited Mutual etc. Ins. Co.'v. Billings </em>(1946) 74 Cal.App.2d 881 [169 P.2d 673].) To the extent these cases can be read to suggest an employer has a cause of action that is not derivative of the employee\u2019s cause of action, they are no longer good law. <em>(County of San Diego v. Sanfax Corp., supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at p. 876.)</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">Finally, Kaiser argues that neither it nor Princess has asserted that the shipboard fire caused Ms. Garofalo\u2019s death. Kaiser claims it \u201cdoes not allege that Ms. Garofalo\u2019s death was in any way caused by or resulted from any negligent act committed by respondent or by the fire that occurred on respondent\u2019s cruise ship.\u201d Therefore, Kaiser posits, DOHSA cannot apply, as DOHSA comes into play only when death is \u201ccaused by\u201d the high seas injury or omission. It claims, \u201cCertainly, where neither party to the lawsuit contends that Ms. Garofalo\u2019s death resulted in any way from defendant\u2019s conduct, the Death On the High Seas Act can have no application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">We find that Kaiser\u2019s conduct of the litigation demonstrates it repeatedly has asserted the shipboard fire was a contributing cause of Ms. Garofalo\u2019s death. While it is true that Princess has steadfastly maintained the shipboard fire did not injure Ms. Garofalo, much less cause her death, Kaiser has taken the opposite position. Kaiser did not dispute, in response to the separate statement filed by Princess, that Ms. Garofalo \u201cdied as a result of medical conditions which Kaiser asserts were aggravated by the shipboard fire.\u201d Kaiser argued below, and in this appeal, that Ms. Garofalo\u2019s asthma and chronic lung disease were \u201cdramatically worsened\u201d by breathing smoke from the shipboard fire; Ms. Garofalo was not terminally ill prior to the cruise; and her condition was stable. In discovery, Kaiser took the position that Princess was responsible for <em>all </em>medical expenses incurred by Ms. Garofalo from approximately the date she returned from the cruise, until the day she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1078\">*1078</page-number>died, nearly $1 million. These assertions are entirely inconsistent with Kaiser\u2019s claim that the shipboard fire did not cause Ms. Garofalo\u2019s death. If the fire did not play some role in Ms. Garofalo\u2019s death, then Kaiser could not have attempted to shift the responsibility for <em>all </em>her postcruise medical expenses to Princess. Kaiser cannot now raise a material issue of fact by claiming that the shipboard fire played no role in Ms. Garofalo\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">7. <em>DOHSA provides the exclusive remedy as to the high seas tortfeasor when a high seas injury is a contributing cause of death.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">We next consider whether DOHSA comes into play where the high seas injury is one cause, but not the sole cause, of death. We hold that, under such circumstances, DOHSA provides the exclusive measure of recovery for the decedent as against the high seas tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">Perhaps because of the catastrophic nature of most high seas deaths, there is a dearth of case law in which the decedent\u2019s death was caused by a high seas injury in combination with another cause. Princess points out that where concurrent acts of negligence were the cause of a high seas death, courts have applied DOHSA. <em>(Bergen </em>v. <em>F/V St. Patrick, supra, </em>816 F.2d at p. 1348 [finding it irrelevant to DOHSA coverage that \u201cdecisions contributing to the St. Patrick\u2019s unseaworthiness may have occurred onshore . . . .\u201d when accident causing death occurred on high seas]; <em>Motts v. M/V Green Wave, supra, </em>210 F.3d at p. 570 [DOHSA applied though ship management company\u2019s allegedly negligent failure to establish evacuation plan contributed to fatal injury; \u201cEven though the negligence occurred onshore, the fact that the accident occurred on the high seas implicates DOHSA.\u201d].) Princess also notes that, as discussed above, DOHSA applies even where the decedent\u2019s death occurs off the high seas, if the injury itself occurred on the high seas.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">In other words, DOHSA applies as long as the injury occurs on the high seas, even if some of the negligent actions leading to the accident occurred on land, and even where the decedent\u2019s death occurred on land. The operative question is where the accident occurred. Accordingly, here the fact that Ms. Garofalo\u2019s preexisting illness did not originate on the high seas does not affect DOHSA coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">Moreover, the language of DOHSA does not suggest that the statute applies with any less force when the high seas injury is not the sole cause of death. The statute provides DOHSA applies <em>\u201c[w]henever </em>the death of a person shall be <em>caused </em>by wrongful act, neglect, or default occurring on the high seas.\u201d (46 U.S.C. appen. \u00a7 761, italics added.) There is nothing in the plain language of the statute to suggest \u201ccaused\u201d means \u201csole cause.\u201d Kaiser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1079\">*1079</page-number>cites no authority, or persuasive argument, suggesting that DOHSA is inapplicable when the high seas injury is not the <em>sole </em>cause of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">We also take note of 46 United States Code appendix section 766, governing contributory negligence. That section provides: \u201cIn suits under this chapter the fact that the decedent has been guilty of contributory negligence shall not bar recovery, but the court shall take into consideration the degree of negligence attributable to the decedent and reduce the recovery accordingly.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>While not directly applicable here, this provision does suggest that even when the death is attributable to more than one cause\u2014the decedent\u2019s negligence and the high seas tortfeasor\u2019s negligence\u2014DOHSA provides recovery. By analogy, the same should be true here: though there were arguably causes of death other than Princess\u2019s alleged negligence, DOHSA nevertheless applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">For purposes of DOHSA coverage, we see no reason to differentiate between deaths caused solely by a high seas injury and deaths caused by a high seas injury in combination with other factors. We hold that when a high seas injury is a cause, but not the sole cause, of the decedent\u2019s death, DOHSA provides the exclusive remedy <em>as to the high seas tortfeasor.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">Accordingly, we hold that Kaiser\u2019s only cause of action is under DOHSA. Because DOHSA preempted Ms. Garofalo\u2019s\u2014and thus Kaiser\u2019s\u2014California causes of action, the trial court properly granted summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">8. <em>California courts have concurrent jurisdiction over DOHSA claims.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">Next we consider whether California courts may exercise jurisdiction over DOHSA claims. The trial court found, based upon <em>Chromy </em>v. <em>Lawrance </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1521 [285 Cal.Rptr. 400], that California courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over DOHSA claims. In their initial briefs to this court, neither party questioned this conclusion. We requested and have considered supplemental briefing on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-10\">After considering <em>Chromy, </em>we respectfully disagree with its holding that California courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over DOHSA claims. We recognize that ambiguity has often bedeviled the development of maritime wrongful death law, including the question of state court jurisdiction. (Cf. <em>Offshore Logistics, Inc. v. Tallentire, supra, All </em>U.S. at p. 212 [106 S.Ct. at pp. 2488-2489] [\u201cThe tortuous development of the law of wrongful death in the maritime context illustrates the truth of Justice Cardozo\u2019s observation that \u2018[d]eath is a composer of strife by the general law of the sea as it was for many centuries by the common law of the land.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d].) Nonetheless, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1080\">*1080</page-number>we believe that <em>Offshore Logistics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tallentire </em>makes it clear that state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over DOHSA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">\u201c \u2018[S]tate courts have inherent authority, and are thus presumptively competent, to adjudicate claims arising under the laws of the United States.\u2019 [Citations.] To give federal courts exclusive jurisdiction over a federal cause of action, Congress must, in an exercise of its powers under the Supremacy Clause, affirmatively divest state courts of their presumptively concurrent jurisdiction. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Yellow Freight System, Inc. v. Donnelly </em>(1990) 494 U.S. 820, 823 [110 S.Ct. 1566, 1568, 108 L.Ed.2d 834]; <em>Williams v. Horvath </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 834, 837 [129 Cal.Rptr. 453, 548 P.2d 1125] [\u201cit is now clear that absent an exclusive grant of jurisdiction to the federal courts in the congressional act, state courts of general jurisdiction have concurrent authority to adjudicate federally created causes of action\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Article III, section 2, clause 1 of the United States Constitution confers upon the federal courts jurisdiction over admiralty and maritime claims. Section 1333(1) of title 28 of the United States Code provides, \u201cThe district courts shall have original jurisdiction, exclusive of the courts of the States, of: HI] (1) Any civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction, <em>saving to suitors </em>in all cases all other remedies to which they are otherwise entitled.\u201d (Italics added.) This \u201csaving to suitors clause\u201d has long been interpreted to mean that state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over <em>in personam </em>maritime claims, i.e., claims against a person; \u201c[admiralty\u2019s jurisdiction is \u2018exclusive\u2019 only as to those maritime causes of action begun and carried on as proceedings <em>in rem, </em>that is, where a vessel or thing is itself treated as the offender and made the defendant by name or description in order to enforce a lien.\u201d <em>(Madruga v. Superior Court </em>(1954) 346 U.S. 556, 560-561 [74 S.Ct. 298, 301, 98 L.Ed. 290]; 1 Norris, Law of Maritime Personal Injuries (4th ed. 1990) \u00a7\u00a7 5:14-5:15, pp. 289-291.) Thus, California courts have concurrent jurisdiction over in personam maritime and admiralty claims. <em>(D\u2019Aquisto </em>v. <em>Campbell Industries </em>(1984) 162 Cal.App.3d 1208, 1212 [209 Cal.Rptr. 108]; <em>Baptiste </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 87, 94 [164 Cal.Rptr. 789].)</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Prior to <em>Offshore Logistics, Inc. v. Tallentire, supra, All </em>U.S. 207, courts disagreed about whether a litigant could bring a DOHSA claim in state court. (14A Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure (1998) \u00a7 3672, p. 337; <em>Wilson v. Transocean Airlines </em>(N.D.Cal. 1954) 121 F.Supp. 85, 94-98; Note, <em>Admiralty: Death on the High Seas by Wrongful Act </em>(1962) 47 Cornell L.Q. 632, 634-636.) At the heart of the debate was the meaning of section 7 of DOHSA, 46 United States Code appendix section 767. As noted <em>ante, </em>that section provides in relevant part that any state statute \u201cgiving or regulating rights of action or remedies for death shall not be affected by this chapter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1081\">*1081</page-number>In addressing whether DOHSA provides the exclusive remedy for wrongful deaths on the high seas, <em>Offshore Logistics, Inc. v. Tallentire </em>considered the legislative history and meaning of section 7. The respondents in <em>Offshore Logistics </em>argued that section 7 left intact state remedies for wrongful death, an interpretation that would have allowed respondents to supplement DOHSA recovery for pecuniary damages with nonpecuniary damages based upon state law. <em>(Offshore Logistics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tallentire, supra, All </em>U.S. at p. 220 [106 S.Ct. at p. 2493].) In order to address this issue, the Supreme Court examined the \u201cexceedingly confused and often ill informed\u201d congressional debates surrounding the passage of section 7 (477 U.S. p. 225 [106 S.Ct. at p. 2495]), in particular an amendment to the bill introduced by Representative Mann. The court stated that \u201cthe first sentence of \u00a7 7 was intended only to serve as a jurisdictional saving clause, ensuring that state courts enjoyed the right to entertain causes of action and provide wrongful death remedies both for accidents arising on territorial waters and, under DOHSA, for accidents occurring more than one marine league from shore.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 221 [106 S.Ct. at p. 2493].) The court reasoned: \u201ca natural reading of \u00a7 7 is that a state statute providing a wrongful death right of action traditionally unavailable at common law would not be \u2018affected\u2019 by DOHSA in the sense of being rendered an incompetent means of invoking state jurisdiction, but the state statute\u2019s substantive provisions would not, by virtue of the saving provision, \u2018extend as a conduct-governing enactment on the high seas\u2019 if in conflict with DOHSA\u2019s provisions. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 223 [106 S.Ct. at p. 2494].) The court explained that the maritime experts who originally drafted DOHSA intended to preserve concurrent jurisdiction over wrongful death claims arising on state territorial waters. As interpreted at the time DOHSA was enacted, the \u201csaving to suitors\u201d clause had been construed to preserve state court concurrent jurisdiction over common law remedies only. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 223-224 [106 S.Ct. at pp. 2494-2495].) The drafters of DOHSA therefore believed a DOHSA-specific saving clause was required because the \u201csaving to suitors\u201d clause in 28 United States Code section 1333(1) did not necessarily preserve jurisdiction over wrongful death claims, which were not traditional common law remedies. (477 U.S. at pp. 223-224 [106 S.Ct. at pp. 2494-2495].)</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">The court explained: \u201cIn sum, the language of \u00a7 7 and its legislative history, as well as the congressional purposes underlying DOHSA, mandate that \u00a7 7 be read not as an endorsement of the application of state wrongful death statutes to the high seas, but rather as a jurisdictional saving clause. Viewed in this light, \u00a7 7 serves not to destroy the uniformity of wrongful death remedies on the high seas but to facilitate the effective and just administration of those remedies. The recognition of concurrent state jurisdiction to hear DOHSA actions makes available to DOHSA beneficiaries a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1082\">*1082</page-number>convenient forum for the decision of their wrongful death claims. [Citation.] Because the resolution of DOHSA claims does not normally require the expertise that admiralty courts bring to bear, DOHSA actions are clearly within the competence of state courts to adjudicate. [Citations.] Also, the availability of concurrent jurisdiction prevents disunity in the provision of forums to survivors of those killed on the high seas; it ensures that if a seaman and a passenger are killed at sea in the same accident, the beneficiaries of both are able to choose the forum in which they prefer to proceed. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Offshore Logistics, Inc. v. Tallentire, supra, All </em>U.S. at pp. 231-232 [106 S.Ct. at p. 2499].)</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">Several years after <em>Offshore Logistics, Chromy </em>v. <em>Lawrance, supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d 1521, considered whether California courts may exercise concurrent jurisdiction over DOHSA actions. While acknowledging <em>Offshore Logistics\u2019s </em>holding, <em>Chromy </em>concluded that \u201cDOHSA actions may only be tried in state courts if the state\u2019s wrongful death statute applies to deaths on the high seas.\u201d <em>(Chromy v. Lawrance, supra, </em>at p. 1526.) <em>Chromy </em>concluded California\u2019s wrongful death statute had never been given extraterritorial effect. Accordingly, <em>Chromy </em>reasoned California courts lacked jurisdiction over DOHSA claims. In support of its conclusion, <em>Chromy </em>cited several <em>pre-Offshore Logistics </em>cases and language from a law review article.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">We respectfully disagree with Chromy\u2019s conclusion that California courts lack concurrent jurisdiction. We do not believe <em>Offshore Logistics, Inc. v. Tallentire </em>requires such a restrictive interpretation of the law. Initially, we note that the <em>Chromy </em>decision has been criticized as wrongly decided. (Robertson, <em>Displacement of State Law by Federal Maritime Law </em>(1995) 26 J. Mar. L. &amp; Com. 325, 351, fn. 131 [Arguing \u201c[t]he <em>Chromy </em>decision is plainly wrong in light of the definitive holding in <em>Offshore Logistics, Inc. v. Tallentire, All </em>U.S. 207, 232[, <em>supra,] </em>[106 S.Ct. 2485, 2499] that \u2018DOHSA actions are clearly within the competence of state courts to adjudicate.\u2019 \u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">Indeed, we conclude <em>Offshore Logistics </em>unequivocally held state courts have concurrent jurisdiction-over DOHSA actions. <em>Offshore Logistics </em>did not intend that the exercise of concurrent jurisdiction was to be premised upon a state-by-state analysis of whether a wrongful death statute had been given extraterritorial effect at the time DOHSA was enacted. Had the Supreme Court intended the exercise of concurrent jurisdiction to turn on such an inquiry, we would have expected the court to provide a fuller and clearer statement to that effect. Federal courts routinely cite <em>Offshore Logistics </em>for the proposition that state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over DOHSA actions, without any additional analysis of the extraterritorial reach of the state wrongful death statute. (E.g., <em>Baris v. Sulpicio Lines, Inc. </em>(5th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1083\">*1083</page-number>1991) 932 F.2d 1540, 1543, 1546; <em>Bosdorf </em>v. <em>Beach </em>(S.D.Fla. 1999) 79 F.Supp.2d 1337, 1345; <em>Pierpoint </em>v. <em>Bames </em>(D.Conn. 1995) 892 F.Supp. 60, 61; <em>DeBello v. Brown &amp; Root Inc. </em>(E.D.Tex. 1992) 809 F.Supp. 482, 485, fn. 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Moreover, the desire for uniformity provides the rationale for much DOHSA jurisprudence. <em>(Offshore Logistics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tallentire, supra, All </em>U.S. at p. 230 [106 S.Ct. at p. 2498] [finding it \u201cincongruous\u201d that \u201ca Congress seeking uniformity in maritime law would intend to allow widely divergent state law wrongful death statutes to be applied on the high seas\u201d]; <em>Wilson v. Transocean Airlines, supra, </em>121 F.Supp. at p. 90 [DOHSA was \u201cdrawn with the purpose to afford an exclusive, uniform federal right of action for death on the high seas\u201d]; cf. <em>Mobil Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Higginbotham, supra, </em>436 U.S. at p. 624 [98 S.Ct. at p. 2014] [recognizing value of uniformity in DOHSA jurisprudence].) For example, <em>Offshore Logistics </em>noted that recognizing concurrent jurisdiction would avoid \u201cdisunity in the provision of forums\u201d to DOHSA beneficiaries. <em>(Offshore Logistics, Inc. v. Tallentire, supra, All </em>U.S. at p. 232 [106 S.Ct. at p. 2499].) If the exercise of concurrent jurisdiction depended upon the extraterritorial reach of each state\u2019s wrongful death law, the exercise of concurrent jurisdiction would hardly be uniform. Such a rule would inject an unnecessarily confusing layer of analysis into what should be a clear-cut inquiry, insofar as a determination of the jurisdictional question would require a rather arcane interpretation of the intended reach of state statutes, apparently at the time DOHSA was enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">Additionally, premising concurrent jurisdiction on the intended reach of state wrongful death statues is incongruous. As <em>Offshore Logistics </em>explained, at the time DOHSA was enacted, it was unclear at best whether state wrongful death statutes could extend to deaths occurring on the high seas. In <em>The Harrisburg </em>(1886) 119 U.S. 199 [7 S.Ct. 140, 30 L.Ed. 358], the Supreme Court held that, in the absence of an applicable state or federal statute, federal maritime law provided no wrongful death cause of action to survivors of persons killed on the high seas. <em>(Offshore Logistics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tallentire, supra, All </em>U.S. at p. 212 [106 S.Ct. at p. 2489].) Prior to the enactment of DOHSA, in an attempt to soften the effect of this harsh rule, some state wrongful death statutes were held to apply on the high seas. As <em>Offshore Logistics </em>noted, such application of state law was \u201cquestionable\u201d and rested upon farfetched theories. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 213 [106 S.Ct. at p. 2489].) Moreover, \u201c \u2018[t]he general understanding was that the statutes of the coastal States, which provided remedies for deaths within territorial waters, did not apply beyond state boundaries.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid, </em>[quoting <em>Moragne v. States Marine Lines, Inc. </em>(1970) 398 U.S. 375, 393, fn. 10 [90 S.Ct. 1772, 1784, 26 L.Ed.2d 339]].) Thus, when DOHSA was enacted it was not clear that a state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1084\">*1084</page-number>statute <em>could </em>substantively apply to high seas deaths. <em>Offshore Logistics </em>explained, \u201cTo read \u00a7 7 as <em>intended to </em>preserve intact largely nonexistent or ineffective state law remedies for wrongful death on the high seas would, of course, be incongruous.\u201d <em>(Offshore Logistics, Inc. v. Tallentire, supra, All </em>U.S. at p. 230 [106 S.Ct. at p. 2498].) It seems equally incongruous to make the exercise of concurrent jurisdiction dependent upon the existence of those same \u201clargely nonexistent or ineffective\u201d remedies. To the extent <em>Chromy </em>holds the exercise of concurrent jurisdiction depends upon whether a state\u2019s wrongful death statute <em>currently </em>applies to high seas deaths, such an analysis is equally fruitless, because DOHSA clearly preempts the substantive provisions of state wrongful death statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Princess argues <em>Chromy </em>was rightly decided. In essence, Princess and <em>Chromy </em>interpret section 7\u2019s language (that DOHSA shall not affect \u201c[t]he provisions of any State statute giving or regulating rights of action or remedies for death\u201d) to mean \u201cgiving or regulating rights of action or remedies for death <em>on the high seas.\u201d Chromy </em>relied upon, inter alia, <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Reynolds </em>(1960) 187 Cal.App.2d 472 [10 Cal.Rptr. 73], a case decided long before <em>Offshore Logistics. Gordon </em>rejected the view that a California court could hear a DOHSA claim and found federal court jurisdiction over DOHSA claims was exclusive. <em>(Gordon </em>v. <em>Reynolds, supra, </em>187 Cal.App.2d at p. 477.) <em>Gordon </em>reasoned that section 7 did not operate to confer concurrent jurisdiction, because \u201cCode of Civil Procedure, section 377, does not give or regulate any right of action or remedy for the death here involved.\u201d <em>(Gordon, </em>at p. 478.) In other words, <em>Gordon </em>reasoned that section 7 was only meant to preserve state law remedies for high seas deaths that were already in existence, apparently at the time DOHSA was enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">The problem with this analysis is that, as discussed, <em>Offshore Logistics </em>did not adopt it. <em>Offshore Logistics </em>gives no indication that the Supreme Court adopted the \u201cnarrow\u201d view espoused by <em>Chromy. </em>Instead, the broad language used by <em>Offshore </em>Logistics,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as well as its lack of any discussion qualifying its broad pronouncement of concurrent jurisdiction, persuades us that <em>Offshore Logistics </em>did not intend to adopt Chromy\u2019s narrow interpretation of section 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>Accordingly, we are compelled to part company with <em>Chromy. </em>We hold that California courts may exercise concurrent jurisdiction over DOHSA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">The judgment is affirmed in part and reversed in part in accord with the opinions expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">Each side to bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">Klein, P. J., and Croskey, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b841-7\"> Labor Code section 3852 provides in part: \u201cAny employer who pays, or becomes obligated to pay compensation . . . may likewise make a claim or bring an action against the third person. In the latter event the employer may recover in the same suit, in addition to the total amount of compensation, damages for which he or she was liable including all salary, wage, pension, or other emolument paid to the employee or to his or her dependents.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b856-6\"> Moreover, the Supreme Court cited in support of its decision Note, <em>Admiralty: Death on the High Seas by Wrongful Act, supra, </em>47 Cornell L.Q. 632, 638. The author of that commentary explained that, at the time the article was written, the courts were split regarding whether states had concurrent jurisdiction over DOHSA claims. (47 Cornell L.Q. at pp. 634-635.) The commentator explained one source of confusion was the meaning of the saving to suitors clause, 28 United States Code section 1333, which the commentator considered as one source of state court jurisdiction over DOHSA claims. The commentator discussed the various views prevailing at the time regarding whether the saving to suitors clause allowed concurrent DOHSA jurisdiction. It explained that under a broad view, a court might find concurrent jurisdiction warranted by virtue of previous state litigation concerning any tort which occurred on the high seas. \u201cAt the other extreme is a construction of the \u2018saving clause\u2019 which requires a state court to have specifically exercised jurisdiction in a case involving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1085\">*1085</page-number>wrongful death of a non-seaman which occurred on the high seas.\u201d (47 Cornell L.Q. at p. 637.) The commentator argued for adoption of the \u201cbroad\u201d view, citing various policy considerations. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 636-639.) The Supreme Court cited the Note favorably <em>(Offshore Logistics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Tallentire, supra, All </em>U.S. at p. 232 [106 S.Ct. at p. 2499])| suggesting the court adopted the \u201cbroad\u201d view espoused therein.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
