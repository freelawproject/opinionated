J.</author>\n<p id=\"AsE\">Gil Garcetti, District Attorney of Los Angeles County, petitions for a writ of mandate to overturn the superior court\u2019s order sustaining a demurrer by Barry Meril Blake (Blake) to the People\u2019s commitment petition under the Sexually Violent Predators Act (SVP Act) (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6600 et seq.) and dismissing the commitment proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">A requisite to a commitment under the SVP Act is that a defendant have been convicted of sexually violent offenses against at least two victims. (\u00a7 6600, subd. (a).) Section 6600, subdivision (a) provides \u201ca conviction resulting in a finding that the person was a mentally disordered sex offender <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>. . . shall ... be deemed to be a sexually violent offense.\u201d The essential issue presented is whether a conviction of an attempted lewd or lascivious act upon a child under age 14 (hereafter lewd act), resulting in a finding that the defendant was a mentally disordered sex offender (MDSO), qualifies as a prior conviction for purposes of the SVP Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">We conclude that any conviction resulting in an MDSO finding qualifies as a prior conviction for purposes of the SVP Act. Therefore, the commitment petition is well pled. We reject the trial court\u2019s ruling the statute is ambiguous in this regard and we grant the relief requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">On May 2, 2000, the People filed a petition to commit Blake pursuant to the SVP Act. The petition alleged Blake was convicted on February 6, 1977, of a violation of Penal Code sections 664/288 (attempted lewd act), and on January 4, 1980, of a violation of Penal Code section 288 (lewd act).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">On May 9, 2000, Blake filed a demurrer asserting the petition should be dismissed for failing to allege two qualifying convictions as required by section 6600, subdivision (a), because the alleged conviction of an attempted lewd act is not a qualifying prior conviction under section 6600, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">On May 23, 2000, the trial court sustained Blake\u2019s demurrer with leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">On May 31, 2000, the People filed an amended petition, again alleging as the required two priors the convictions of a lewd act and attempted lewd act, with the latter conviction resulting in a finding that Blake was an MDSO.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-11\">The matter was heard on May 31, 2000. Blake\u2019s counsel entered an oral demurrer by reference to the written demurrer to the original petition. Following argument on the interpretation of the statute, the People stated: \u201cThe case falls or stands on the basis of the two alleged priors. There are no other priors.\u201d The trial court ruled the conviction of an attempted lewd act, accompanied by an MDSO finding, did not qualify as a prior conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>under section 6600 and ordered the petition dismissed, but stayed an order for Blake\u2019s release until June 6, 2000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">On June 5, 2000, the People filed a petition for writ of mandate. We promptly stayed Blake\u2019s release pending determination of the writ petition and issued an order to show cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">The People contend the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer because Blake\u2019s conviction of an attempted lewd act, accompanied by an MDSO finding, qualifies as a predicate offense for a commitment under the SVP Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">1. <em>The pertinent statute.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">The SVP Act \u201cis aimed at protecting society from, and providing treatment for, that \u2018small but extremely dangerous group of sexually violent predators\u2019 who have diagnosable mental disorders identified while they are incarcerated for designated violent sex crimes, and who are determined to be unsafe and, if released, to represent a danger to others through acts of sexual violence. (Stats. 1995, ch. 763, \u00a7 1.) Such persons may be committed to a state mental institution for a period after their term of imprisonment. To be eligible for such commitment, there must be determinations under the auspices of the Departments of Corrections and Mental Health, and a petition filed by the prosecutor. The defendant must have suffered convictions for defined sex crimes against at least two different persons, and can be committed only after a probable cause hearing and trial. (\u00a7\u00a7 6600, subd. (a), 6602, 6603.)\u201d <em>(Garcetti v. Superior Court </em>(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 685, 688 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 581].)</p>\n<p id=\"b889-11\">\u201c \u2018Sexually violent predator\u2019 \u201d is defined by the statute as \u201ca person who has been convicted of a sexually violent offense against two or more victims for which he or she received a determinate sentence and who has a diagnosed mental disorder that makes the person a danger to the health and safety of others in that it is likely that he or she will engage in sexually violent criminal behavior.\u201d (\u00a7 6600, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b889-12\">The original version of section 6600, effective January 1, 1996, made it a requisite to a commitment under the SVP Act that the defendant have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>convicted of sexually violent offenses against at least two persons, for which he or she received a <em>determinate </em>sentence. <em>(Garcetti v. Superior Court, supra, </em>76 Cal.App.4th at p. 691.) The statute was amended by urgency legislation, effective September 13, 1996. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 689.)</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">The second paragraph of section 6600, subdivision (a), was among the changes made by this amendment. <em>(Garcetti v. Superior Court, supra, </em>76 Cal.App.4th at p. 689.) Said paragraph provides: \u201cFor purposes of this subdivision, a prior finding of not guilty by reason of insanity for an offense described in subdivision (b), a conviction for an offense under a predecessor statute that includes all of the elements of an offense described in subdivision (b), a conviction prior to July 1, 1977, for an offense described in subdivision (b), <em>a conviction resulting in a finding that the person was a mentally disordered sex offender, </em>or a conviction in another jurisdiction for an offense that includes all the elements of an offense described in subdivision (b), <em>shall also be deemed to be a sexually violent offense even if the offender did not receive a determinate sentence for that prior </em>offense.\u201d (\u00a7 6600, subd. (a), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">The term \u201c \u2018[s]exually violent offense\u2019 \u201d is defined in section 6600, subdivision (b), as the \u201cfollowing acts when committed by force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the victim or another person, and that are committed on, before, or after the effective date of this article and result in a conviction or a finding of not guilty by reason of insanity, as provided in subdivision (a): a felony violation of paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of Section 261, paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 262, Section 264.1, subdivision (a) or (b) of Section 288, or subdivision (a) of Section 289 of the Penal Code, or sodomy or oral copulation in violation of Section 286 or 288a of the Penal Code.\u201d (\u00a7 6600, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">There is no dispute that Blake\u2019s alleged conviction of an attempted lewd act (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 664/288) is not an offense described in section 6600, subdivision (b), and therefore said conviction qualifies, if at all, by reason of the resulting MDSO finding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">2. <em>Trial court erred in finding the statute is ambiguous with respect to nature of prior offenses resulting in MDSO findings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">a. <em>Trial court\u2019s ruling.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b890-10\">The trial court found section 6600 is ambiguous due to the Legislature\u2019s insertion of a comma between the phrase \u201ca conviction resulting in a finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>that the person was a mentally disordered sex offender\u201d and the phrase describing a qualifying out-of-state prior, the latter phrase concluding with the language \u201cfor an offense that includes all the elements of an offense described in subdivision (b).\u201d (\u00a7 6600, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">The trial court noted the People\u2019s argument \u201cthat the placing of [the] comma after the word \u2018offender\u2019 indicates the Legislature\u2019s intent not to require a subdivision (b) [offense for the MDSO] prior. It seems clear to the court that in every other part of that paragraph subdivision (b) is explicitly set forth including the description of the out-of-state prior which has all the elements of the subdivision (b) offense. [^] And it seems to the court that [the] Legislature reasonably could have concluded, despite the comma following the word \u2018offender,\u2019 that [the] Legislature intended that the subdivision (b) qualifier also apply to the MDSO finding. If the Legislature did not so intend, then the court is faced with an ambiguity in the statute which given the restrictions on liberty interests requires the court to apply any reasonable doubt in favor of the person against whom the statute is sought to be applied[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">b. <em>Trial court\u2019s interpretation is at odds with ordinary rules of statutory construction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">\u201cIn ascertaining the Legislature\u2019s intent, we turn first to the language of the statute, giving the words their ordinary meaning. [Citations.] We must follow the statute\u2019s plain meaning, if such appears, unless doing so would lead to absurd results the Legislature could not have intended. [Citations.] If our examination of the statutory language leaves doubt about its meaning, we may consult other evidence of the Legislature\u2019s intent, such as the history and background of the measure. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(.People v. Birkett </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 226, 231-232 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 205, 980 P.2d 912].)</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">The second paragraph of section 6600, subdivision (a) contains five categories within which a finding or conviction will \u201cbe deemed to be a sexually violent offense even if the offender did not receive a determinate sentence for that prior offense\u201d (\u00a7 6600, subd. (a)): <em>first, </em>\u201ca prior finding of not guilty by reason of insanity <em>for an offense described in subdivision (b)\u201d (ibid., </em>italics added); <em>second, </em>\u201ca conviction for an offense under a predecessor statute <em>that includes all of the elements of an offense described in subdivision (b)\u201d (ibid., </em>italics added); <em>third, </em>\u201ca conviction prior to July 1, 1977, <em>for an offense described in subdivision (b)\u201d (ibid., </em>italics <em>added); fourth, </em>\u201ca conviction resulting in a finding that the person was a mentally disordered sex offender\u201d <em>(ibid.); </em>and <em>fifth, </em>\u201ca conviction in another jurisdiction <em>for an offense that includes all the elements of an offense described in subdivision (b)\u201d (ibid., </em>italics added).</p>\n<p id=\"b892-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>In four of the five categories, the Legislature made reference to the list of offenses set forth in section 6600, subdivision (b), so that for those four categories, the finding or conviction must be for an offense specified in subdivision (b) or for an offense that includes all the elements of an offense on that list. However, for the remaining category of convictions resulting in an MDSO finding, the Legislature did not so provide. Clearly, with respect to the MDSO category, the Legislature could have specified \u201cfor an offense described in subdivision (b)\u201d or \u201cfor an offense that includes all the elements of an offense described in subdivision (b),\u201d had it intended to do so. Pointedly, the Legislature did not so specify.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">c. <em>Trial court\u2019s interpretation is at odds with the \u201clast antecedent rule\u201d of statutory construction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">We now address that portion of the trial court\u2019s interpretation which was based on the statute\u2019s punctuation. The punctuation of a statute can be helpful in ascertaining its proper interpretation.  \u201cA longstanding rule of statutory construction\u2014the \u2018last antecedent rule\u2019\u2014provides that \u2018qualifying words, phrases and clauses are to be applied to the words or phrases immediately preceding and are not to be construed as extending to or including others more remote.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(White v. County of Sacramento </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 676, 680 [183 Cal.Rptr. 520, 646 P.2d 191] <em>{White).) </em>Evidence that \u201ca qualifying phrase is supposed to apply to all antecedents instead of only to the immediately preceding one may be found in the fact that it is separated from the antecedents by a comma.\u201d <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">In <em>White, </em>the statute in issue was Government Code section 3303, which \u201cdefine[d] \u2018punitive action\u2019 as \u2018any action which may lead to dismissal, demotion, suspension, reduction in salary, written reprimand, <em>or transfer for purposes of punishment.\u2019 \u201d {White, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at p. 679, italics added.) The question presented was whether the phrase \u201c \u2018for purposes of punishment\u2019 \u201d qualified each of the preceding terms or only the word \u201c \u2018transfer.\u2019 \u201d <em>{Id. </em>at pp. 679-680.)</p>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">The Supreme Court concluded the phrase \u201c \u2018for purposes of punishment\u2019 \u201d was intended to modify only the term \u201c \u2018transfer.\u2019 \u201d <em>(White, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at p. 680.) It reasoned \u201cthe phrase \u2018for purposes of punishment\u2019 is <em>not </em>set off from the preceding terms by a comma. Instead, the entire phrase, \u2018transfer for purposes of punishment,\u2019 is set off from the preceding terms by a comma followed by the word \u2018or.\u2019 Such use of the word \u2018or\u2019 in a statute indicates an intention to use it disjunctively so as to designate alternative or separate categories. [Citations.] Thus, application of the ordinary rules of statutory construction strongly suggests that the phrase \u2018for purposes of punishment\u2019 was intended to modify only the term \u2018transfer.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1121\">*1121</page-number>In the instant case, the question is whether the phrase \u201cfor an offense that includes all the elements of an offense described in subdivision (b)\u201d applies only to the words immediately preceding it, namely, \u201ca conviction in another jurisdiction,\u201d or whether said phrase also applies to the preceding provision, namely, \u201ca conviction resulting in a finding that the person was a mentally disordered sex offender.\u201d (\u00a7 6600, subd. (a).) The phrase \u201cfor an offense that includes all the elements of an offense described in subdivision (b)\u201d is not preceded by a comma. (\u00a7 6600, subd. (a).) Therefore, under the last antecedent rule as applied in <em>White, </em>it appears the phrase \u201cfor an offense that includes all the elements of an offense described in subdivision (b)\u201d applies only to the words \u201ca conviction in another jurisdiction\u201d and not to the words \u201ca conviction resulting in a finding that the person was a mentally disordered sex offender.\u201d (\u00a7 6600, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">(1) <em>Recognized exceptions to last antecedent rule not applicable.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">There are two exceptions to the last antecedent rule, but neither is applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">\u201cThe first exception provides that \u2018 \u201c[w]hen several words are followed by a clause which is applicable as much to the first and other words as to the last, the natural construction of the language demands that the clause be read as applicable to all.\u201d \u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(White, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at pp. 680-681.)  Here, the phrase \u201cfor an offense that includes all the elements of an offense described in subdivision (b)\u201d is not equally applicable to all the preceding terms. Out-of-state convictions are not \u201cdescribed in subdivision (b)\u201d\u2014subdivision (b) only describes California Penal Code offenses. Therefore, for out-of-state offenses, the statute uses the language \u201ca conviction in another jurisdiction for an offense that includes all the elements of an offense described in subdivision (b)),\u201d which amounts to an elements test. (\u00a7 6600, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">However, for an <em>in-state </em>\u201cconviction resulting in a finding that the person was a mentally disordered sex offender,\u201d instead of an elements test, the Legislature could have used the qualifying language \u201cfor an offense described in subdivision (b),\u201d as it repeatedly did elsewhere in subdivision (a). (\u00a7 6600, subd. (a).) It did not do so. We conclude the phrase \u201cfor an offense that includes all the elements of an offense described in subdivision (b)\u201d is not equally applicable to all the preceding terms. (\u00a7 6600, subd. (a).) Therefore, this exception to the last antecedent rule is unavailing to Blake.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number>The \u201csecond exception to the \u2018last antecedent rule\u2019 provides that \u2018[w]here the sense of the entire act requires that a qualifying word or phrase apply to several preceding wo[r]ds . . . , [its application] will not be restricted . . . .\u2019 [Citations.] This is, of course, but another way of stating the fundamental rule that a court is to construe a statute \u2018 \u201cso as to effectuate the purpose of the law\u201d.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(White, supra, </em>31 Cal.3d at p. 681.)  We perceive nothing in the intent of the Legislature requiring the phrase \u201ca conviction resulting in a finding that the person was a mentally disordered sex offender\u201d to be qualified by the phrase \u201cfor an offense that includes all the elements of an offense described in subdivision (b).\u201d (\u00a7 6600, subd. (a).) As explained below, the legislative history is to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">(2) <em>Legislative history supports application of last antecedent rule.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">As noted, the original version of section 6600, effective January 1, 1996, made it a requisite to a commitment under the SVP Act that the defendant have been convicted of sexually violent offenses against at least two persons, for which he or she received a determinate sentence. (Stats. 1995, ch. 762, \u00a7 3; Stats. 1995, ch. 763, \u00a7 3; <em>Garcetti v. Superior Court, supra, </em>76 Cal.App.4th at p. 691.) The statute was amended later that year to also apply to qualifying convictions for which an indeterminate term was imposed. <em>(Garcetti, supra, </em>at pp. 691-693.) It was at that juncture that persons designated as MDSO\u2019s were made subject to the SVP Act. (Stats. 1996, ch. 462, \u00a74.)</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">The legislative history reveals that when section 6600 was amended to expand the persons subject to the SVP Act to include persons who had been designated as MDSO\u2019s, there was no differentiation of the types of offenses committed by MDSO\u2019s. The statutory provision at issue here, involving convictions which thereafter resulted in an MDSO finding, was enacted by the 1996 amendment. (Stats. 1996, ch. 462, \u00a7 4, eff. Sept. 13, 1996.) The report of the Senate Rules Committee on Assembly Bill No. 3130 contains the following paragraph: \u201cThis bill would increase the definition of a \u2018sexually violent predator\u2019 to include persons who have a prior finding [of] not guilty by reason of insanity, who were convicted under [the] indeterminate sentencing law, or who have an out-of-state conviction, for one of the specified offenses, <em>or who were designated as Mentally Disordered Sex Offenders under that </em>program.\u201d (Sen. Rules Com., 3d reading analysis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1123\">*1123</page-number>Assem. Bill No. 3130 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) as amended July 15, 1996, italics added.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Thus, the legislative history indicates the phrase \u201ca conviction resulting in a finding that the person was a mentally disordered sex offender\u201d was not intended to be read in conjunction with the phrase \u201cfor an offense that includes all the elements of an offense described in subdivision (b).\u201d (\u00a7 6600, subd. (a).) (</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">3. <em>Blake\u2019s constitutional argument is unavailing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">Finally, Blake contends inclusion of all MDSO commitments as \u201csexually violent offenses\u201d within the ambit of the SVP Act would go beyond the \u201csmall but extremely dangerous group\u201d that the Legislature intended to capture under the SVP Act. In that regard, \u201cThe Legislature [found] and declare[d] that a small but extremely dangerous group of sexually violent predators . . . have diagnosable mental disorders [that] can be identified while they are incarcerated.\u201d (Stats. 1995, ch. 762, \u00a7 1; Stats. 1995, ch. 763, \u00a7 1; Historical and Statutory Notes, 73D West\u2019s Ann. Welf. &amp; Inst. Code (1998 ed.) foil. \u00a7 6600, pp. 249-250.) Blake further argues the United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Kansas\u2019s Sexually Violent Predator Act based in part on the fact it only involved the involuntary civil commitment \u201cof a limited subclass of dangerous persons.\u201d <em>(Kansas v. Hendricks </em>(1997) 521 U.S. 346, 357 [117 S.Ct. 2072, 2080, 138 L.Ed.2d 501].) Blake argues the inclusion of MDSO commitments, which may have resulted from misdemeanor nonviolent offenses such as possession of obscene matter (Pen. Code, \u00a7 311.2) or indecent exposure (Pen. Code, \u00a7 314), would go well beyond the range of \u201ca small but extremely dangerous group\u201d (Stats. 1995, ch. 762, \u00a7 1; Stats. 1995, ch. 763, \u00a7 1) or \u201ca limited subclass of dangerous persons.\u201d <em>(Kansas, supra, </em>521 U.S. at p. 357 [117 S.Ct. at p. 2080].) The argument is unavailing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">A person determined to be an MDSO, by definition, is one \u201cwho by reason of mental defect, disease, or disorder, is predisposed to the commission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1124\">*1124</page-number>sexual offenses to such a degree that he is dangerous to the health and safety of others.\u201d (Former \u00a7 6300; see fn. 2, <em>ante.) </em>Thus, the class of persons subject to commitment under the MDSO Act was somewhat broader than those subject to the SVP Act, which is aimed at sexually violent predators. (Former \u00a7 6300; \u00a7 6600.) Nonetheless, the Legislature chose to use any conviction resulting in an MDSO finding as a qualifying prior conviction under the SVP Act. (\u00a7 6600, subd. (a).) Admittedly, section 6600, subdivision (a), is not a model of drafting in that it deems any \u201cconviction resulting in a finding that the person was a mentally disordered sex offender\u201d as \u201ca sexually violent offense.\u201d However, as explained, mere status as an MDSO, standing alone, is insufficient to give rise to commitment under the SVP Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">In this regard, section 6600 states: \u201cConviction of one or more of the crimes enumerated in this section shall constitute evidence that may support a court or jury determination that a person is a sexually violent predator, <em>but shall not be the sole basis for the determination. . . . </em>Jurors shall be admonished that they may not find a person a sexually violent predator based on prior offenses absent relevant evidence of a currently diagnosed mental disorder that makes the person a danger to the health and safety of others in that it is likely that he or she will engage in sexually violent criminal behavior.\u201d (\u00a7 6600, subd. (a), italics added.) Further, with respect to the People\u2019s burden of proof, section 6604 provides: \u201cThe court or jury shall determine whether, <em>beyond a reasonable doubt, </em>the person is a sexually violent predator.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Thus, prior convictions resulting in MDSO findings may be used as predicate prior offenses under the SVP Act, but the predicate priors cannot themselves, standing alone, serve as the basis for commitment and treatment under the SVP Act. The predicate sexually violent offenses merely screen Blake from the general prison population. For commitment to occur, the People must not only allege and prove the prior offenses, but must also establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the person \u201chas a diagnosed mental disorder that makes the person a danger to the health and safety of others in that it is likely that he or she will engage in sexually violent criminal behavior.\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 6600, subd. (a), 6604.) Therefore, Blake\u2019s concern that persons will be committed under the SVP Act based on their convictions for nonviolent, noncontact, and nonpredatory offenses is unfounded.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1125\">*1125</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">The order to show cause is discharged.

Former section 6300 defined an MDSO as \u201cany person who by reason of mental defect, disease, or disorder, is predisposed to the commission of sexual offenses to such a degree that he is dangerous to the health and safety of others.\u201d (Stats. 1967, ch. 1667, \u00a7 37, p. 4116.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b889-13\"> The trial court\u2019s rationale is set forth in detail below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b890-11\"> For whatever reason, the Legislature did not include an <em>attempted </em>lewd act (Pen.

As to Blake, however, section 6600, subdivision (a) is not overbroad because as alleged in the commitment petition, his MDSO finding was based upon a conviction of attempted lewd act, a felony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b896-6\"> Pursuant to the latest amendment to section 6600, effective January 1, 2001, the statute will provide as follows; \u201c(a)(1) \u2018Sexually violent predator\u2019 means a person who has been convicted of a sexually violent offense against two or more victims and who has a diagnosed mental disorder that makes the person a danger to the health and safety of others in that it is likely that he or she will engage in sexually violent criminal behavior.
