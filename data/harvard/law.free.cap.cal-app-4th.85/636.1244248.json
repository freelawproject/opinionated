Ct. Alameda County, No. H-26122).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">The eight-page questionnaires had been completed before the oral questioning phase of jury selection commenced. Copies were distributed to the trial judge, prosecuting attorney, and defense counsel, who used them during jury selection. After trial, and at the conclusion of defendant\u2019s sentencing hearing, the court ordered these copies returned to the clerk of the court for sealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">We conclude the trial court erred in issuing the contempt order based on the refusal by petitioner to return the juror questionnaires. The First <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Amendment of the United States Constitution guaranteeing public access to judicial proceedings overwhelms any countervailing privacy interests of prospective jurors as to the content of questionnaires they complete. Where trial courts wish to protect their content from public observation, the constitutionally permitted procedure mandates that the judge advise members of the venire at the time the questionnaires are distributed that, upon completion, they will become public records accessible to anyone, and as an alternative to writing in sensitive personal data, jurors can answer those questions on the record in chambers with counsel present. Even in that event, trial judges should take care that the individual prospective juror is not given either explicit or implicit assurances that the transcript of in camera questioning will be protected from public disclosure in all instances.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Moreover, any expectation of privacy prospective jurors may have in the content of their questionnaires completed during jury selection does not extend to a criminal defendant and counsel. As we explain, because the <em>raison d\u2019etre </em>of juror questionnaires is to assist both sides and counsel in the selection of a fair and impartial jury, juror privacy is not advanced by \u201charvesting\u201d them from the confidential files of the Public Defender\u2019s office when their content was purposefully divulged to defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">As to the personal identifying information of trial jurors, the law provides limited privacy protection from the defendant, defense counsel, and the public by requiring the redaction of their personal juror identifying information (names, addresses, and telephone numbers) from the court\u2019s record, including questionnaires, unless good cause for access is shown on noticed motion. Members of the venire who were not sworn as trial jurors are entitled to have their names kept confidential only upon a finding of a compelling interest against disclosure. Because defense counsel agreed to redact personal juror identifying information from defense copies of questionnaires, we likewise conclude the trial court erred in requiring the questionnaires returned in order to protect the disclosure of this data.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">On March 30, 2000, following a 17-day jury trial, Eliel Elpidio Brown was convicted of second degree murder in the Alameda County Superior Court. Prior to the commencement of jury selection,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> each member of the venire was given an eight-page questionnaire to complete. In addition to the name of the prospective juror, the questionnaire requested detailed information concerning each prospective juror\u2019s educational background, work experience, prior jury experience, military experience, religious and political <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>affiliations, prior contacts with the law enforcement and the criminal justice system, affiliations with criminal law and victims\u2019 rights advocacy groups, information concerning the ownership and feelings about firearms, knowledge about the alleged event underlying the criminal complaint, and knowledge of the expected witnesses. Jurors were asked to disclose the names of family members, and information pertaining to each of them regarding their respective employment histories, contacts with law enforcement and the criminal justice system, affiliations with criminal law and victim rights advocacy groups, and their ownership of firearms. The questionnaire also asked what sources of news information the juror accessed, as well as what radio stations each typically listened to, and what television programs he or she watched most often.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">A cover sheet from the trial department accompanied each questionnaire, explaining why the jurors were being requested to fill out a questionnaire as well as instructions as to how it should be completed. Most important to our analysis, the. cover sheet explained: \u201cThe use of this questionnaire will shorten the process of jury selection and provide greater privacy for your answers. Your Answers Will Be Used Only in the Selection of This Jury and Not for Any Other Purpose. Any Follow-up Questions to Sensitive Areas Covered in the Questionnaire Will Be Conducted Outside the Presence of the Other Jurors, When Requested.\u201d (Original underscoring.) The last paragraph of the questionnaires assures the prospective jurors \u201c[t]he questionnaires and copies will be collected by the Court, and those submitted by jurors selected to serve in the trial will be maintained by the Court, under seal and in confidence, unless otherwise ordered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">The court sentenced the defendant on May 18, 2000. At the conclusion of the sentencing, the trial judge requested the deputy public defender who represented defendant at trial to return copies of the juror questionnaires still in counsel\u2019s possession, including those completed by \u201cexcess jurors.\u201d Defense counsel refused, explaining that the questionnaires had been highlighted and notes made on many of them, which were then used by counsel in making jury selection decisions. As such, counsel stated that the questionnaires were attorney work product that needed to be preserved for potential use by defendant\u2019s appellate counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">The court disagreed, noting that the law \u201cseems clear\u201d that the Legislature and courts wish to protect juror privacy. As an accommodation to defense counsel, the court expressed a willingness to place the defense copies of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>questionnaires under seal, which would then become part of the court\u2019s record on appeal. The court made a \u201cdirect order\u201d to defense counsel to produce the questionnaires, and the matter was continued to May 25 to enable counsel to perform some additional legal research and to check with his office\u2019s \u201cappellate people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">On May 25, 2000, defense counsel appeared as ordered. He was accompanied by two members of the Public Defender\u2019s office, including petitioner Diane A. Bellas, Public Defender of Alameda County. Defense counsel was sworn as a witness and testified that he was in possession of approximately 65 questionnaires completed by the jury panel, of whom perhaps two-thirds were questioned orally during jury selection. The only identifying information contained on the questionnaires was the juror\u2019s name. No addresses or telephone numbers were recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Counsel stated he was not told that all of the questionnaires would have to be returned at the conclusion of the trial. In fact, in none of the 10 or so cases in which defense counsel used juror questionnaires had counsel ever been asked to return them to the court at the conclusion of trial. Therefore, he highlighted certain information contained on the questionnaires and made comments and recorded his impressions on approximately one-half of them, and included juror \u201crankings\u201d on all of the questionnaires.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Petitioner was then sworn and testified about the procedures used by her office for the handling and storage of case files. She assured the court that the contents of the files are not disclosed to anyone, with the exception of appellate counsel, and even then, written client consent is required. Petitioner offered that her office would comply with an order that the questionnaires be maintained in confidence, and would require appellate counsel to obtain an order from the court before they would be released. She likewise agreed to comply with an order requiring that personal juror identifying information be redacted from the copies.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">In response to a question from the trial court asking petitioner to illustrate the difference between retaining the questionnaires under seal in the Public Defender\u2019s office files versus in the court files, petitioner explained there was a need to retain the integrity of the entire file for the potential use of appellate counsel including a possible inquiry into whether the defendant had been provided with effective assistance of counsel at trial, including jury selection.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She referred to the Public Defender files as \u201csacrosanct\u201d and expressed that she was \u201cloathe to begin separating out from our files portions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>that under the law we believe are a rightful part of our public defender case file.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">At the conclusion of testimony and argument, the court again ordered petitioner to return the questionnaires, offering to allow defense counsel to redact any portions of the questionnaires needed to protect attorney work product, and to place the returned copies under seal in the court\u2019s file. In doing so, the court noted that the order was being made solely out of concern for \u201cjuror\u2019s privacy and confidentiality.\u201d When counsel again refused, the court found <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to be in direct contempt under Code of Civil Procedure section 1219, and ordered her remanded into the custody of the sheriff, staying the remand order until June 1, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">A petition for writ of habeas corpus challenging the trial court\u2019s contempt finding and order was filed on May 31, 2000. We stayed enforcement of the contempt order and issued an order to show cause.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">Unquestionably, one of the most significant decisions of the last 20 years concerning juror privacy rights and public access to juror information is the United States Supreme Court opinion in <em>Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal. </em>(1984) 464 U.S. 501 [104 S.Ct. 819, 78 L.Ed.2d 629] (Press-Enterprise), in which the high court explicitly exalted the right of public access to criminal proceedings over the privacy right of jurors generally. The trial judge in a California murder trial had opened to the public \u201c \u2018general voir dire\u2019 \u201d but closed the proceedings for that portion of jury selection dealing with \u201c \u2018death qualifications\u2019 \u201d and other \u201c \u2018special areas.\u2019 \u201d The voir dire consumed six weeks, and all but three days were closed to the public. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 503 [104 S.Ct. at p. 820].)</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">After the jury was sworn in a criminal case, Press-Enterprise Co. sought the release of the transcript of the closed portion of jury selection. Both the prosecutor and defense counsel objected, pointing to the fact that the closed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>oral voir dire explored with the individual jurors \u201c \u2018some personal problems . . . which could be somewhat sensitive as far as publication of those particular individuals\u2019 situations are concerned.\u2019 \u201d (464 U.S. at p. 504 [104 S.Ct. at p. 821].) Defense counsel also added that the disclosure would violate the jurors\u2019 right of privacy inasmuch as they had answered questions under an \u201c \u2018implied promise of confidentiality.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">After tracing the origins of public trials, including jury selection, to before the Norman Conquest, the high court gleaned from this historic record a presumption in constitutional law that the jury selection process be as open to the public as any other portion of a criminal trial. It noted openness not only provides accountability and raises the confidence that standards of fairness are being observed, but that public observation of criminal trials also inures to the benefit of the accused who has assurance through public participation that a fair trial is in progress. <em>(Press-Enterprise, supra, </em>464 U.S. at p. 508 [104 S.Ct. at p. 823].) Finally, it articulated the standard against which courts were to test the decision to close any portion of jury selection: \u201cThe presumption of openness may be overcome only by an overriding interest based on findings that closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest. The interest is to be articulated along with findings specific enough that a reviewing court can determine whether the closure order was properly entered.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 510 [104 S.Ct. at p. 824].)</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">In applying this standard to the case before it, the United States Supreme Court noted that the alleged murder also involved the rape of the victim, and that it was therefore likely that portions of jury selection would \u201ctouch[] on deeply personal matters that person has legitimate reasons for keeping out of the public domain.\u201d <em>(Press-Enterprise, supra, </em>464 U.S. at p. 511 [104 S.Ct. at p. 825].) In such cases, the court could conduct portions of the oral jury selection on the record in chambers with counsel present. In that way, the \u201cconstitutional values sought to be protected by holding open proceedings may be satisfied later by making a transcript of the closed proceedings available within a reasonable time.\u201d Making a transcript available was also deemed subject to a further order sealing a portion of the transcript or withholding the name of the involved juror. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 512 [104 S.Ct. at p. 825].)</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">In <em>KNBC-TV, Inc. (KNBC-TV, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 1178 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 778, 980 P.2d 337] <em>(KNBC)), </em>the California Supreme Court applied <em>Press-Enterprise </em>and earlier United States Supreme Court precedent to the question of whether, like criminal trials, civil trials are constitutionally required to be open to the public. In that case, the trial court had excluded the public and the media from attendance at all proceedings held outside the presence of the jury. After a thorough review of the high <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>court\u2019s decisions interpreting the mandate of public access contained in the First Amendment in the context of public access to criminal judicial proceedings, the court in <em>KNBC </em>concluded that, civil proceedings also are \u201cpresumptively open\u201d and subject to the same limitations on closure. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1212, fn. 29, 1216-1217.)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">The precise subject of public access to juror questionnaires was at issue in <em>Lesher Communications, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 774 [274 Cal.Rptr. 154] <em>(Lesher). </em>In <em>Lesher, </em>the trial court denied the print media access to jury questionnaires completed by members of the venire in a murder case. Division Four of this district stayed the trial while considering the question of whether the questionnaires must be disclosed. In issuing a writ of mandate, the appellate court concluded that juror questionnaires are as fully accessible to the public as are other phases of trial, including oral voir dire. For this reason, members of the venire were entitled to an admonition that they had a right to request an in camera hearing, in the presence of counsel and on the record, on sensitive matters required to be disclosed during jury selection, including questions asked on juror questionnaires. Following the mandate of <em>Press-Enterprise, </em>the court also reiterated that the transcript of any in camera or chambers questioning might be ordered sealed from public access.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Because no such admonition had taken place, and jury selection had not yet been completed, the court ordered upon remand that the trial court proceed in one of two alternative ways that balanced the requirement of public access, and the legitimate privacy interests of jurors. Either the trial court could afford prospective jurors the opportunity to fill out a new questionnaire which protected the jurors\u2019 legitimate interest in privacy, or the court could dismiss the entire venire and withhold the questionnaires which had been completed by the panel \u201cin reliance on the understanding of confidentiality.\u201d <em>(Lesher, supra, </em>224 Cal.App.3d at p. 778, fn. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">However, as to the questionnaires themselves, the court endorsed the reasoning of a recently decided case affirming the right of access to juror questionnaires, <em>Copley Press, Inc. v. Superior Court</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Cal.App.) <em>(Copley I). </em>Quoting <em>Copley I, </em>the <em>Lesher </em>court cautioned that in filling out the questionnaires, no \u201c \u2018explicit or implicit promise of confidentiality should be attached to the information contained in the questionnaires; rather the veniremen shall be expressly informed the questionnaires are public records.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Lesher, supra, </em>224 Cal.App.3d at pp. 778-779.)</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Thereafter, the California Supreme Court ordered the opinion in <em>Copley I </em>vacated and the matter considered anew in light of the subsequent filing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>the opinion in <em>Lesher. </em>The Court of Appeal, pursuant to such direction, issued its opinion as modified in <em>Copley Press, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>228 Cal.App.3d 77 <em>(Copley II). </em>The modified opinion in <em>Copley II </em>recognized that <em>Press-Enterprise </em>allows for some limitation on public access to juror information disclosed during voir dire, but noted that the closure of proceedings was required to be \u201cas narrow[] as possible so that the salutary nature of openness can be preserved to the largest extent possible. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 86.) Following <em>Lesher, </em>the court in <em>Copley II </em>explained that, to accomplish the proper balancing of public access and juror privacy, the \u201cproper approach\u201d was for trial courts to advise members of the venire that they had a right to disclose sensitive information in camera rather than writing their answers on the questionnaires. If requested, the court could then conduct oral questioning of the individual juror in chambers with counsel and the defendant present, followed by an order sealing the transcript of that in camera hearing if \u201ca legitimate privacy interest warrants protection.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 87.)</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">In concluding that courts should otherwise provide public access to juror questionnaires for certain prospective jurors,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the <em>Copley II </em>court then reiterated its earlier warning that \u201c[n]o explicit or implicit promise of confidentiality should be attached to the information contained in the questionnaires; rather the venirepersons shall be expressly informed the questionnaires are public records.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">For our purposes, it is enough that these decisions make clear that the content of juror questionnaires are publicly accessible unless the reason for ordering them sealed outweighs the presumption of open access to records of judicial proceeding, the limitation on access is tailored as narrowly as possible, and the trial court\u2019s findings are articulated with enough specificity that a reviewing court can determine whether a confidentiality order was properly entered. Here, the trial court based its order, which sought to gather all prospective juror questionnaires and place them under seal in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>entirety on generalized concerns about juror privacy, without mating any finding of particularized and individual assessment of juror privacy needs. There was no weighing of the necessity for sealing against the exigencies of public access. Therefore, when tested against the showing required by Press-Enterprise, there was no content-based privacy rationale sufficient for the trial court in the case before us to order the removal of questionnaires from the Public Defender\u2019s files for the purposes of sealing them.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The controversy in this case is easier to resolve than that in <em>Press-Enterprise, Lesher, </em>or <em>Copley II, </em>for those cases involved questions of <em>public </em>access to information provided by potential jurors during the jury selection process in criminal cases. While a discussion of these authorities is imperative to our analysis, an important distinguishing feature here is that this case concerns continuing access to the content of juror questionnaires by <em>defendant and defense counsel, </em>and not simply access by the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Obviously, the very purpose for asking members of the venire to complete the questionnaire was to assist the parties and the court in picking a jury. For this simple reason, a fundamental understanding in completing the questionnaires was that the information disclosed necessarily would be made known to the parties and their respective counsel. The venire was told as much in the cover memorandum that accompanied the questionnaire: \u201cIn order to expedite jury selection, we have prepared this questionnaire to be completed before you are called into the courtroom. . . . [H] The use of this questionnaire will shorten the process of jury selection . . . .You will be given an opportunity to further explain and clarify your answers when being questioned by the lawyers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Submitting answers in writing allowed counsel and the court to review the jurors\u2019 answers in advance of oral questioning thereby avoiding the need to undertake the laborious task of asking every prospective juror each of the questions. Proceeding in this fashion in a murder trial undoubtedly saved both the members of the venire and\u201d the other trial participants an enormous amount of time and inconvenience in empanelling a jury. In completing the questionnaire, there could certainly be no expectation of juror privacy that would restrict defendant and defense counsel from having access to the questionnaires\u2019 contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">Furthermore, the refusal by defense counsel to return the questionnaires was not simply an exercise in arrogance. Counsel expressed good and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>sufficient reasons for retaining them. As clarified at the contempt hearing by trial counsel, their potential use by appellate counsel in framing issues for an eventual appeal, and his desire to have confirmation of tactical decisions made during the challenge phase of jury selection were sound justifications for retaining the questionnaires which inured to the interest of the defendant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Finally, wishing to assuage any lingering concern the court may have had for the possibility of inadvertent unauthorized disclosure, petitioner explained in detail the procedures established in her office to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the defense file in which the questionnaire copies would be reposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Therefore, apart from the question of public access, which itself barred the action taken below, defendant and defense counsel had a separate and independent right both to know the content of the questionnaires and to preserve them in their confidential files.  The only related, but different, question we must yet address is whether defense counsel nevertheless could be compelled to relinquish the questionnaires at the conclusion of trial because they contained information by which members of the jury or venire could be personally identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">California statutory law has long recognized the public\u2019s right of access to judicial records. Code of Civil Procedure<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> section 124, enacted in 1872, states that \u201cthe sittings of every court shall be public.\u201d However, legislative concern for protecting juror identifying information was sparked in 1991, when news reports recounted that a criminal defendant convicted of murder, and who had made threats against attorneys and law enforcement personnel involved in his case, was found to have in his jail cell documents containing the addresses of several of the trial jurors. It was believed that the information was obtained by a private investigator hired by the defendant. (See Background Information, Sen. Judiciary Com., Sen. Bill No. 1299 (1991-1992 Reg. Sess.) pp. 4-5; County of L. A. Legis. Rep. Clancy Leland, letter to Sen. Bill Lockyer, Chair, Sen. Judiciary Com., Feb. 4, 1992.)</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">This incident led to the 1992 amendment of section 206, and the enactment of a new statute, section 237. (Stats. 1992, ch. 971, \u00a7 3, pp. 4598-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>4599.) Former section 237 subdivision (a) provided that the names of \u201cqualified jurors drawn from the qualified juror list for the superior court\u201d were available to the public unless the trial court, upon request of the involved juror determined that the personal juror identifying information should be conditionally sealed based on a finding of a \u201ccompelling governmental interest.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (b).) \u201cCompelling governmental interest\u201d was defined in the statute as the need for \u201cprotecting jurors from physical harm or the threat of physical harm.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Former sections 206 and 237 allowed for a procedure by which a criminal defendant could petition the court for disclosure of personal juror identifying information \u201cfor the purpose of developing issues on appeal or any other lawful purpose.\u201d (Stats. 1992, ch. 971, \u00a7 2, pp. 4597-4598.) Criminal sanctions were also provided in the event of violations of section 237. (Stats. 1992, ch. 971, \u00a7 3, pp. 4598-4S99.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">The following year, section 237 was amended. The 1993 amendment, introduced as Assembly Bill No. 1915, was spawned by the author\u2019s concern that \u201c[cjitizens who are asked to serve as jurors should not be subject to possible harassment or physical harm when the media chooses to publish information by which the juror\u2019s identity may be determined.\u201d (Assem. Off. of Research, 3d reading analysis of Assem. Bill No. 1915 (1993-1994 Reg. Sess.) Apr. 28, 1993, p. 1.) Specifically, the amendment required trial judges to also advise jurors at the time of discharge of their right to seek the conditional sealing of juror identifying information. (Stats. 1993, ch. 632, \u00a7 2, p. 3722.) In the event access to personal juror identifying information was sought, the petitioner was required to personally serve all affected jurors with notice of the hearing at which the unsealing of their identifying information would be sought. <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Two years later, the issue of protecting juror identifying information again caught the attention of the Legislature when it concluded there was a need to provide greater protection for the identity of jurors while still providing access to this information to defendants and interested members of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>public. In pursuit of that objective, a new amendment was enacted in 1995, requiring the automatic sealing of the court\u2019s record of juror identifying information: \u201c[(a)](2) Upon the recording of a jury\u2019s verdict in a criminal jury proceeding, the court\u2019s record of personal juror identifying information, including names, addresses, and telephone numbers, shall be sealed until further order of the court as provided by this section.\u201d (Stats. 1995, ch. 964, \u00a7 3.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The preamble to the amendment (and to a modest conforming amendment to \u00a7 206) sang an unmistakable note of appreciation for those who answer the call to public duty by serving as trial jurors: \u201cSection 1. The Legislature finds and declares that jurors who have served on a criminal case to its conclusion have dutifully completed their civic duty. It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this act to balance the interests of providing access to records of juror identifying information for a particular, identifiable purpose against the interests in protecting the jurors\u2019 privacy, safety, and well-being, as well as the interest in maintaining public confidence and willingness to participate in the jury system.\u201d (Stats. 1995, ch. 964, \u00a7 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Any lingering ambiguity as to just whose personal identifying information was to be routinely protected from unnecessary disclosure, and the manner by which trial courts were to effect this protection was eliminated the following year with the introduction of Senate Bill No. 2123 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.). This latest amendment clarified that \u201cpersonal juror identifying information\u201d was limited to names, addresses, and telephone numbers of trial jurors as defined by section 194. (Stats. 1996, ch. 636, \u00a7 2.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The amendment also helped solve difficulties encountered by court clerks and court reporters as to how that information was to be protected, specifically equating the term \u201csealing\u201d with the removal, or redaction, of the juror identifying information from court records. (Stats. 1996, ch. 636, \u00a7 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">After Senate Bill No. 2123 was enacted, the portions of section 237 pertinent to this case were amended to read as follows: \u201c(2) Upon the recording of a jury\u2019s verdict in a criminal jury proceeding, the court\u2019s record of personal juror identifying information of trial jurors as defined in Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>194,[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>] consisting of names, addresses, and telephone numbers, shall be sealed until further order of the court as provided by this section. [5Q (3) For purposes of this section, \u2018sealed\u2019 or \u2018sealing\u2019 means extracting or otherwise removing the personal juror identifying information from the court record.\u201d (Stats. 1996, ch. 636, \u00a7 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Even this truncated history of section 237 clearly reveals that: 1) the harm the Legislature perceived from disclosure of personal juror identifying information was postverdict harassment and possible physical danger from those who obtained knowledge of the juror\u2019s name, address and telephone number; 2) the privacy interest to be protected was the right of the jurors to be left alone once their service was complete; 3) the class of jurors who needed protection was those who actually sat on the jury and participated in the verdict; and 4) the permissible means of protecting this limited right of confidentiality is to redact the personal juror identifying information from court records, including questionnaires.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>In <em>Zamudio, supra, </em>64 Cal.App.4th 24, defense counsel sought access to the questionnaires of trial jurors with their personal identifying information redacted to assist in determining whether one of the jurors who voted for imposition of the death penalty did so out of a belief that it was required if the jury found the defendant guilty of an intentional killing. The trial court refused the request, finding that the content of the questionnaires constituted confidential juror information, and that the defendant had failed to show good cause for their release pursuant to section 237. In reversing, the court noted that section 237 applied only to protect \u201cpersonal juror identifying information\u201d as defined in the statute, and that <em>\u201cabsent the request for the personal juror identifying information, section 237 does not apply.\u201d </em>(64 Cal.App.4th at p. 30, original italics.) Of even more cogency to the issue we face, the <em>Zamudio </em>court went on to observe: \u201cThe jury questionnaires were part of the voir dire of the individual jurors and, absent personal juror identification information, there is no legal reason to preclude petitioner\u2019s counsel from having access to them. In fact, <em>it would be error not to do so.\u201d (Ibid., </em>italics added; see also <em>People v. Granish </em>(1996) 41 Cal.App.4th 1117 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 45].)</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">We agree with <em>Zamudio. </em>The option of extracting involuntarily the Public Defender\u2019s copies of juror questionnaires so they may be sealed to protect a content-based privacy interest, or to protect the identity of jurors, was not available to the trial judge here. The First Amendment prohibits the indiscriminant sealing of these questionnaires. As to venire members who were not sworn as trial jurors, the law currently provides privacy protection from public disclosure of their names only upon a showing of a compelling interest. As to the questionnaires of trial jurors, the court was limited to ensuring that the personal juror identifying information (names, addresses, and telephone numbers, only) was redacted from the Public Defender\u2019s copies. The Public Defender agreed to do so, a promise the trial court surely respected based on the effusive praise expressed by the judge for the integrity of the Public Defender and her office during the contempt hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">As former trial judges and lawyers, we fully sympathize with the desire of the judge below to protect jurors\u2019 privacy interest, whether it be content-based or the desire for anonymity. The burgeoning use of juror questionnaires in some courts has complicated the problem. Their use is seen by some as a less intrusive means than oral voir dire of obtaining deeply personal information needed from prospective jurors in criminal trials involving highly emotional facts, or issues. As did the <em>Copley II </em>court, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>recognize the reticence of private citizens to serve on juries is exacerbated by the need to disclose, if not in questionnaires then during the oral questioning phase of jury selection, the most intimate details of their lives. Not infrequently public service compels jurors to recall their darkest moments, which they may have struggled for years to forget, and then be required to recount them in public. It may be cold comfort that at least the law allows these exquisitely personal revelations to be made in a judge\u2019s chambers where the audience is smaller, and there is less likelihood the transcript of the disclosures will find an interested public audience.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">The otherwise understandable desire to preserve juror privacy conflicts with the constitutional mandate requiring public access to most information about the private lives of potential jurors. This conflict is exacerbated by the apparently common practice of accompanying questionnaires with words of comforture promising, at least ambiguously, some form of confidentiality for the completed questionnaires. This was done in the case before us: \u201cThe use of this questionnaire will shorten the process of jury selection and provide greater privacy for your answers. Your Answers Will Be Used Only in the Selection of This Jury and Not for Any Other Purpose. Any Follow-up Questions to Sensitive Areas Covered in the Questionnaire Will Be Conducted Outside The Presence of the Other Jurors, When Requested. . . . [f] . . . [f] The questionnaires and copies will be collected by the Court, and those submitted by jurors selected to serve in the trial will be maintained by the Court, under seal and in confidence, unless otherwise ordered.\u201d As both <em>Lesher </em>and <em>Copley II </em>instruct, this is incorrect. No comprehensive offer of protection from public disclosure of information communicated on juror questionnaires is legally effectual where public access is mandated by the First Amendment. <em>(Press-Enterprise, supra, </em>464 U.S. at p. 509, fn. 8 [104 S.Ct. at p. 824].)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">For these important reasons, like both appellate panels in <em>Lesher </em>and <em>Copley II, </em>including the separate concurrence in the latter case, we again entreat trial judges to insist that venire panels be advised in unambiguous language at the time questionnaires are distributed that they will become public records accessible to anyone and, as an alternative to writing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>sensitive personal data, jurors can respond to questions asked on the questionnaire on the record in chambers with counsel present. In this way, trial courts can preserve the option of ordering the transcript of that portion of jury selection sealed upon a showing consistent with <em>Press-Enterprise.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">\n<em>TV.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The judgment of contempt is annulled.
