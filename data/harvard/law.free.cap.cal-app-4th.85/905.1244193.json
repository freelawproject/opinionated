Monge </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 826, 843, 844-845 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 853, 941 P.2d 1121] <em>(Monge).) </em>The principal issue which we consider in this appeal is whether such a retrial nonetheless may be barred on the ground of res judicata, collateral estoppel or law of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">The appellant, George Scott, appeals from the judgment entered following his convictions by jury of second degree burglary (Pen. Code, \u00a7 459),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> second degree robbery (\u00a7 211), and assault by means likely to produce great bodily injury (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1)), each with personal infliction of great bodily injury (\u00a7 12022.7, subd. (a)), and with findings that he suffered four prior felony convictions (\u00a7 667, subd. (d)), and three prior serious felony convictions (\u00a7 667, subd. (a)(1)). He was sentenced to prison for 43 years to life.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">As we explain, when a true finding as to a prior conviction allegation is reversed on appeal due to evidentiary insufficiency, <em>People v. Morton </em>(1953) 41 Cal.2d 536 [261 P.2d 523] <em>(Morton), People </em>v. <em>Rice </em>(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 647 [246 Cal.Rptr. 177] (Rice) and section 1262 compel the conclusion that the case must be remanded for a retrial of that allegation. Neither res judicata nor collateral estoppel precludes such a retrial. Similarly, the doctrine of the law of the case will be ineffective to prevent a true finding upon retrial, provided that the People, at such retrial, present <em>additional </em>evidence beyond that previously found to be insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>We are aware that a recent decision of another Court of Appeal (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Mitchell </em>(2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 132 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 401] (hereafter <em>Mitchell III)) </em>has held that fundamental fairness requires that the doctrines of res judicata and law of the case preclude a retrial when true findings as (o prior conviction allegations are reversed on appeal due to insufficiency of the evidence. However, that case arose in a very specific and unusual factual and procedural context and is entirely distinguishable from the more common circumstances presented by the facts of this case. Moreover, such distinction aside, we believe that <em>Mitchell III </em>was wrongly decided and we respectfully decline to follow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\"><em>Mitchell III </em>also failed to consider or discuss either <em>Morton, Rice, </em>section 1262 or the impact of such authorities on the issues raised. In addition, its \u201cres judicata and collateral estoppel\u201d analysis is not supported by relevant authority and its application of the doctrine of \u201claw of the case\u201d constitutes an unwarranted extension of the conclusion articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Monge </em>and, in our view, inappropriately relies upon principles applicable only in civil cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Thus, while we conclude that the People failed to present sufficient evidence to support a true finding that appellant\u2019s alleged prior 1981 conviction was for a \u201cserious felony,\u201d we nonetheless will remand the matter for a retrial at which the People may, if they can, present <em>additional </em>evidence to support their allegations. Contrary to the views expressed in <em>Mitchell III, </em>we see no basis for any requirement that such additional evidence be <em>newly discovered.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">Factual Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">Viewed in accordance with the usual rules on appeal <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ochoa </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1199, 1206 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 23, 864 P.2d 103]), the evidence, the sufficiency of which as to the substantive offenses is undisputed, established that, on July 17, 1998, appellant committed the charged offenses in Los Angeles County by entering a church restroom and, once inside, feloniously assaulting and robbing Cristina Sanchez. Appellant presented an alibi defense, which the jury rejected. Appellant raises no issue on appeal with respect to his convictions on the substantive offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-9\">Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">On appeal, appellant raises two contentions with respect to a prior felony conviction with which he was charged and as to which the trial court made true findings. Appellant contends \u201cthe true finding as to the strike allegation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>and the prior serious felony enhancement allegation for the 1981 conviction must be reversed as there was insufficient evidence that the conviction qualified as either a strike or a prior serious felony.\u201d In his supplemental brief, appellant contends \u201cretrial as to the truth of the strike allegation and the prior serious felony enhancement allegation for the 1981 conviction is barred by the doctrines of law of the case and res judicata and would violate appellant\u2019s state and federal constitutional rights to due process.\u201d We agree with appellant\u2019s first contention, but reject his second.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">1. <em>The Evidentiary Sufficiency Issue as to the 1981 Robbery Conviction</em></p>\n<p id=\"AqE\">a. <em>Factual Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The second amended information alleged, in pertinent part, that appellant committed assault by means likely to produce great bodily injury (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1); count 3), second degree robbery (\u00a7211; count 4), and second degree commercial burglary (\u00a7 459; count 5).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It also alleged that appellant had suffered four prior serious felony convictions, for purposes of the Three Strikes law and section 667, subdivision (a)(1). One of those prior convictions, and the one at issue here, was for a December 17, 1981 robbery conviction <em>(People v. Scott </em>(Super. Ct. L.A. County, 1981, No. A371596)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Appellant\u2019s trial on the prior conviction allegations was divided into two phases: a jury trial on pertinent nonidentity issues, followed by a court trial on the identity issue. During the jury trial phase, the sole items of evidence proffered by the People were exhibit Nos. 17 and 18. Exhibit No. 17 consisted of a \u201cprison packet,\u201d that is, certified copies of documents from the California Department of Corrections (CDC) which that agency had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>provided in compliance with section 969b.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This exhibit pertained to prior convictions other than the prior conviction at issue here, but was offered as relevant to the <em>identification </em>of appellant with respect to the 1981 robbery conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">People\u2019s exhibit No. 18 relates directly to the prior conviction at issue and consists of two documents. The first is a copy of a letter dated August 28, 1998, from the State of California, Youth and Adult Correctional Agency, Department of the Youth Authority, master files. It is addressed to the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office, and reflects that it pertains to a George Scott, superior court No. A371596.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The second document is a certified copy of a form which reflects that a George Scott was an 18-year-old Black male whose birth date was April 24, 1963. It also reflects that on December 17, 1981, Judge D. M. Rothman, in Los Angeles County Superior Court, \u201ccommitted]\u201d Scott in <em>People v. Scott, supra, </em>No. A371596 for the offense of \u201c211PC Robbery w/12022.5PC Use of a firearm.\u201d There were three other entries on the form which provide no information as to the substance of appellant\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">At trial, the People moved both of these exhibits into evidence and appellant, after some discussion, finally pressed an objection only to exhibit No. 18, which was overruled.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The exhibits were then received in evidence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>The jury found true the nonidentity allegations as to all four prior convictions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">At the March 25, 1999 court trial on the identity issue, the People submitted the matter based on People\u2019s exhibit Nos. 17 and 18, including the photograph of George Scott in exhibit No. 17. Appellant presented no defense evidence, but urged \u201cthe court to find that the package is inadequate particularly as I think it is number 18, the letter from C.Y.A. I think that that is clearly inadequate.\u201d The court rejected this argument and found true the identity allegation as to all four prior convictions. Appellant was thereafter sentenced to prison for 43 years to life.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">b. <em>The Evidence Presented by the People Was Not Sufficient to Prove That the 1981 Conviction Constituted a \u201cSerious Felony\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">A finding that appellant had suffered a prior felony conviction (\u00a7 667, subd. (d)), and a prior serious felony conviction (\u00a7 667, subd. (a)(1)), could only be sustained if the prior conviction at issue was for a \u201cserious felony.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In this case, that would mean: (1) \u201cany felony in which the defendant personally uses a firearm\u201d (\u00a7 1192.7, subd. (c)(8)); (2) robbery (\u00a7 1192.7, subd. (c)(19)); and/or (3) \u201cany felony in which the defendant personally used a dangerous or deadly weapon\u201d (\u00a7 1192.7, subd. (c)(24)).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">In <em>People v. Martinez </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 106 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 687, 990 P.2d 563] <em>(Martinez), </em>our Supreme Court concluded that items other than the \u201crecord of conviction,\u201d and certified prison records admissible under section 969b, are admissible to establish issues pertaining to a prior conviction, as long as such other evidence does not pertain to the <em>substance of </em>a prior conviction. For example, such other evidence is admissible to establish such matters as the <em>fact </em>of the prior conviction (i.e., that someone suffered it) and the <em>identity </em>of the defendant as the person who suffered it. <em>(Martinez, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at pp. 113-118.)</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>In <em>People </em>v. <em>Guerrero </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 343 [243 Cal.Rptr. 688, 748 P.2d 1150] <em>(Guerrero), </em>the Supreme Court previously had established evidentiary limitations on the \u201cpermissible scope of proof to establish the <em>substance </em>of a prior conviction, i.e., the nature and circumstances of the underlying conduct.\u201d <em>(Martinez, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 117.) <em>Guerrero </em>concluded that the trier of fact could \u201clook to the record of the conviction-but <em>no </em>further. . . .\u201d to establish the substance of the prior conviction. <em>(Guerrero, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 355, italics in original.) Thus, evidence other than the \u201crecord of conviction\u201d may not be utilized to prove that appellant\u2019s 1981 conviction met the definition of a \u201cserious felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">In this case, the People relied entirely upon exhibit No. 18 to prove this critical fact. However, we note that the prosecutor proffered People\u2019s exhibit No. 18 \u201cpursuant to Penal Code section 969(b).\u201d Appellant argues that exhibit No. 18 is <em>not </em>part of the \u201crecord of conviction\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>and the People do not dispute this claim. </em>(Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Rhoden </em>(1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 1242, 1255-1257 [265 Cal.Rptr. 355];<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> see <em>People </em>v. <em>Reed, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th at p. 223.) Therefore, since the trier of fact could \u201clook to the record of the conviction-but <em>no further,\u201d </em>the jury could not rely on People\u2019s exhibit No. 18 to prove the substance of the prior conviction at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">While not disputing the conclusion that exhibit No. 18 was not part of the \u201crecord of conviction,\u201d the People nonetheless argue that the exhibit was admissible under section 969b.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We reject that argument as contrary to <em>Guerrero </em>and as a misreading of section 969b. That section allows admission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>of certified prison records to prove the <em>fact </em>of a felony conviction, but not the <em>substance </em>of that conviction.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Thus, as there was no other evidence presented on the point, we must conclude that there was insufficient evidence to prove appellant suffered a prior serious felony conviction based on appellant\u2019s prior robbery conviction in <em>People v. Scott, supra, </em>No. A371596; we must therefore reverse the true finding as to that allegation. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 253, 261-262 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 334, 949 P.2d 31]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cortez </em>(1999) 73 Cal.App.4th 276, 279-284 [86 Cal.Rptr.2d 234].) However, the People contend that they are nonetheless entitled to the opportunity to retry this issue and produce additional evidence which is admissible to prove the <em>substance </em>of appellant\u2019s prior conviction. We now turn to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">2. <em>The People\u2019s Right to a Retrial of the Prior Conviction Allegation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">a. <em>The Principles of Double Jeopardy Do Not Bar a Retrial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">In <em>Monge, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th 826, our Supreme Court held that federal and state double jeopardy principles do not bar a retrial of a prior conviction allegation in a noncapital case after a true finding as to the allegation has been reversed on appeal due to insufficiency of the evidence. <em>(Monge, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at pp. 829, 845.) At the end of Monge's state double jeopardy discussion, the Supreme Court stated, \u201c [accordingly, we conclude that the double jeopardy provision of the state Constitution does not apply to the trial of the prior conviction allegation in this case. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Morton[, supra,] </em>41 Cal.2d 536 . . . <em>[permitting retrial of a prior conviction allegation under facts similar to those here, but without discussing double jeopardy].)'' (Id. </em>at p. 845, italics added.) This approving reference to <em>Morton </em>is significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">b. A <em>Retrial Is the Proper Procedure</em></p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">In <em>Morton, </em>a defendant was convicted of noncapital offenses and adjudged a habitual criminal under former section 644, subdivision (a). <em>(Morton, supra, </em>41 Cal.2d at p. 538.) The Supreme Court concluded there was insufficient evidence to support the prior conviction allegation based on that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>subdivision. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 539-541.) The court then turned to the issue of disposition and, based on conflicting appellate court precedent, identified separate approaches which had been adopted by various appellate courts.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In the fourth of these, the appellate courts, in essence, had ordered the prior conviction finding set aside and <em>remanded the case for a new trial on the prior conviction allegation. (Id. </em>at pp. 541-542.) The <em>Morton </em>court concluded that this was the correct approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\"><em>Morton </em>made it clear that a retrial of the question of whether the defendant had suffered a prior conviction for a particular offense was entirely proper. <em>\u201cThis procedure is the proper one. It carries out the policy of the statutes imposing \u2018more severe punishment, proportionate to their persistence in crime, of those who have proved immune to lesser punishment\u2019 [citation], and prevents defendants from escaping the penalties imposed by those statutes through technical defects in pleadings or proof. It affords the defendant a fair hearing on the charge, and if it cannot be proved he will not have to suffer the more severe punishment.\u201d (Morton, supra, </em>41 Cal.2d at pp. 544-545, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">As <em>Monge </em>noted, <em>Morton </em>did not discuss double jeopardy. Thus, <em>Monge </em>approvingly cited <em>Morton, </em>not because <em>Morton </em>contained a discussion of double jeopardy directly supportive of the issue raised in <em>Monge, </em>but because <em>Morton </em>(a unanimous decision authored by Justice Traynor) held that, once a true finding as to a prior conviction allegation was reversed on appeal due to insufficiency of the evidence, <em>the proper procedure was to remand the case for a retrial on the allegation. </em>(See <em>People </em>v. <em>Valladoli </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 590, 599 [54 Cal.Rptr.2d 695, 918 P.2d 999] <em>[Morton </em>\u201cinvolved whether the evidence was sufficient to prove a certain prior conviction and, if not, what the proper procedure would be on remand\u201d].)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Until our Supreme Court holds otherwise, we are compelled to follow <em>Morton. (Auto Equity Sales, Inc. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 455 [20 Cal.Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937].)</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Appellant, however, argues that a retrial is nonetheless barred under the principles of res judicata, collateral estoppel and law of the case.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> For that proposition he relies upon <em>Mitchell III, supra, </em>81 Cal.App.4th 132. That case recently concluded that \u201ceven in the wake of <em>Monge v. California </em>(1998) 524 U.S. 721 [118 S.Ct. 2246, 141 L.Ed.2d 615] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Mongel supra,] </em>16 Cal.4th 826 . . . , where the government has had a full and fair opportunity to present its case unhampered by evidentiary error or other impediment, fundamental fairness requires application of equitable principles of res judicata (direct estoppel) and law of the case to preclude the relitigation of [the defendant\u2019s] prior serious felony conviction allegations for purposes of both a five-year enhancement and a strike under the three strikes law. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 667, subd. (a)(1), 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1192.7, subd. (c)(19).)\u201d <em>(Mitchell III, supra, </em>81 Cal.App.4th at p. 136, fn. omitted.) As a result, the <em>Mitchell III </em>court, relying on its own earlier appellate decision which had held there was insufficient evidence to support such allegations, reversed the true findings which were entered following a previously ordered retrial of the allegations. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 136-138, 155, 157.) We are therefore required to consider the <em>impact </em>of <em>Mitchell III </em>on the People\u2019s claimed right to a retrial in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">c. <em>Neither Res Judicata Nor Collateral Estoppel Precludes a Retrial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">\u201cDouble jeopardy precludes reprosecution for an offense of which a defendant has been acquitted or to which jeopardy has otherwise attached. Res judicata gives conclusive effect to a final judgment on the merits in subsequent litigation of the same controversy. Collateral estoppel bars relitigation of an issue decided in a previous proceeding in a different cause of action if \u2018(1) the issue necessarily decided at the previous proceeding is identical to the one which is sought to be relitigated; and (2) the previous proceeding resulted in a final judgment on the merits; and (3) the party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted was a party or in privity with a party at the prior proceeding.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(?People v. Davis </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 463, 514-515, fn. 10 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 826, 896 P.2d 119].)</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number><em>Mitchell III </em>acknowledges that the principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel have been long established in civil law, but their application in criminal matters \u201cis of a more recent vintage. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Mitchell III, supra, </em>81 Cal.App.4th at pp. 143-144.) As <em>Mitchell III </em>also acknowledges, however, the application of these doctrines in criminal cases still demands adherence to the same basic principles, the foremost of which is that <em>a final judgment </em>is required to preclude relitigation of an issue or claim. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 143-147.)</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">As <em>Mitchell III </em>clearly recognized, this raises the question as to whether either of these doctrines can apply to preclude a retrial <em>in the same proceeding. {Mitchell III, supra, </em>81 Cal.App.4th at p. 147.) \u201cThe traditional application of such doctrines are to <em>\u2018successive prosecutions\u2019 </em>[citation] or rulings from <em>a former action. </em>[Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 147-148, italics added.) Nonetheless, <em>Mitchell III, </em>emphasizing the particular procedural context presented by that case, concluded that its own earlier determination that the People\u2019s evidence was insufficient to support a \u201ctrue finding\u201d as to the defendant\u2019s alleged prior conviction provided \u201cthe requisite showing of \u2018finality,\u2019 akin to an acquittal of an offense, for purposes of applying the equitable doctrines of res judicata . . . .\u201d <em>(Mitchell III, supra, </em>at p. 155.)</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">In <em>Mitchell III, </em>the defendant had been convicted of a felony and a prior serious felony allegation had been found to be true. His conviction and nine-year sentence, as well as the true finding as to the prior conviction allegation, were affirmed on appeal.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Later, the appellate court issued a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that the defendant\u2019s counsel had been ineffective for failing to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence presented to support the prior conviction allegation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The court, after a hearing, concluded that the evidence had been insufficient as a matter of law, reversed the true finding and remanded for further proceedings.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In sending it back for a retrial, the appellate court in <em>Mitchell II </em>ordered that a new trial be conducted in light of the then recent decisions (in <em>Monge, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th 826 and <em>Monge v. California, supra, </em>524 U.S. 721) which had held that there was no state or federal double jeopardy bar to a retrial on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>prior conviction allegation in a noncapital sentencing proceeding.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>(Mitchell III, supra, </em>81 Cal.App.4th at pp. 136-137.)</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">When the <em>matter again </em>returned to the trial court, defendant\u2019s counsel argued that a retrial, despite the holding in <em>Mitchell II, </em>was improper, not because of double jeopardy, but because of res judicata, collateral estoppel and law of the case (i.e., the court in <em>Mitchell II </em>had held that evidentiary insufficiency existed as a matter of law). While the trial court noted that this argument raised an \u201cinteresting issue,\u201d it rejected it and, after a bench trial, made a true finding as to the prior conviction allegation. <em>(Mitchell III, supra, </em>81 Cal.App.4th at pp. 137-138.) Defendant then filed an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">It was this factual and procedural context which was then presented to the <em>Mitchell III </em>court and led to the decision upon which appellant now relies in this matter. It also explains what the <em>Mitchell III </em>court had in mind when it said, \u201c[w]e believe <em>the procedural context of this case </em>provides the requisite showing of \u2018finality,\u2019 akin to an acquittal of an offense, for purposes of applying the equitable doctrines of res judicata and law of the case in the matter before us. [H] . . . [F]inality is a cornerstone of both the res judicata and law of the case doctrines. Because the issue of legally insufficient evidence to support the prior convictions allegations in <em>Mitchell II </em>was fully presented and was considered essential to our decision [that the defendant\u2019s] first appellate counsel was ineffective, when the People\u2019s petition for review of such decision was denied, it became <em>a final decision on such </em>merits.\u201d <em>{Mitchell III, supra, </em>81 Cal.App.4th at p. 155, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Whatever the merits of the reasoning and conclusion of <em>Mitchell III, </em>by which it concluded that there was sufficient finality to justify the application of res judicata and collateral estoppel to a subsequent proceeding <em>in the same case, </em>we do not have such facts here. We have no prior adjudication of evidentiary insufficiency; we are making that determination in <em>this </em>opinion (see pt. 1, <em>ante). </em>Thus, to the extent that <em>Mitchell III </em>relied upon its own particular factual and procedural context in reaching its conclusion as to the presence of the necessary \u201cfinality,\u201d it is entirely distinguishable and inapplicable to this case. This distinction aside, however, we believe that <em>Mitchell III </em>was wrongly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\"><em>Mitchell </em>III repeatedly acknowledged <em>that </em>\u201cfinality\u201d is a cornerstone of the res judicata and collateral estoppel doctrines. <em>{Mitchell III, supra, </em>81 Cal.App.4th at pp. 143-148, 155.) In our view, the necessary finality cannot exist in the context of successive hearings which take place in the <em>same </em>proceeding or action. This conclusion is supported by settled principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>\u201c \u2018 \u201c[A] <em>final judgment on the merits </em>bars the parties or those in privity with them from litigating the same cause of action <em>in a subsequent proceeding </em>and collaterally estops parties or those in privity with them from litigating in a subsequent proceeding on a different cause of action any issue actually litigated and determined in the <em>former </em>proceeding.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Howie </em>(1995) 41 Cal.App.4th 729, 736 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 505], italics added.) Thus, in order for res judicata or collateral estoppel to apply there must be a <em>final </em>judgment or determination of an issue; that is, a judgment or determination that is final in the sense that no further judicial act remains to be done to end the litigation. (7 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Judgment \u00a7 306, p. 856.) These principles apply in criminal proceedings as well as civil. (1 Witkin &amp; Epstein, Cal. Criminal Law (3d ed. 2000) Defenses, \u00a7 201, pp. 561-562.)</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">In the context of collateral estoppel, our Supreme Court has, on at least two occasions, questioned whether that doctrine can be applied in the <em>same proceeding. (People </em>v. <em>Memro </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 786, 821-822 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 219, 905 P.2d 1305]; <em>People v. Santamaria </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 903, 913 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 624, 884 P.2d 81].) Certainly, there is no basis on which to apply the doctrine where the People have prevailed on the issue involved and a retrial is ordered. <em>(People v. Santamaria, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at pp. 913-914.) The policies underlying collateral estoppel simply are not implicated in such circumstances. A retrial after the <em>reversal </em>of a conviction or \u201ctrue finding\u201d is not the sort of governmental action which needs to be restrained by the doctrine. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">When asserted in the same proceeding, the question of \u201cfinality\u201d is obviously a predicate inquiry. While the proceeding or action still continues, the required finality is necessarily absent. In our view, that was the case in <em>Mitchell III. </em>Nonetheless, that court found finality in its prior decision <em>(Mitchell II), </em>which had determined that the People\u2019s case (as to the existence of a prior conviction) had been evidentiarily insufficient as a matter of law. However, that \u201cfinal\u201d decision also remanded the matter for a retrial of the issue. Thus, the very appellate order to which <em>Mitchell III </em>now gives preclusive effect was clearly interlocutory in nature. A remand was ordered to provide the People with the opportunity to present <em>additional </em>evidence on the prior conviction allegation. Clearly, this was not a <em>final </em>order. As the Restatement Second of Judgments states: \u201cThe rules of res judicata are applicable only when a final judgment is rendered. However, for purposes of <em>issue preclusion </em>(as distinguished from merger and bar), \u2018final judgment\u2019 includes any prior adjudication of an issue <em>in another action </em>that is determined to be <em>sufficiently firm to be accorded conclusive effect.\u201c </em>(Rest.2d Judgments, \u00a7 13, italics added.) This section \u201cmakes the general commonsense point that such conclusive carry-over effect should not be accorded a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>judgment which is considered merely tentative in the very action in which it was rendered. On the contrary, the judgment must ordinarily be a firm and stable one, the \u2018last word\u2019 <em>of the rendering court\u2014&amp; </em>\u2018final\u2019 judgment.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 13, com. a, p. 132, italics added; see also, <em>Sandoval v. Superior Court </em>(1983) 140 Cal.App.3d 932, 936-940 [190 Cal.Rptr. 29].)</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\"><em>Mitchell </em>III justifies its refusal to apply these principles on the grounds of equity and fairness. \u201cAlthough traditionally the doctrines have required the issue or cause to have been determined in a former action, it is reasonable to allow application of the principles of such doctrines in the same case where there has already been one fair trial, as here, on the issue in controversy between the same parties.\u201d <em>(Mitchell III, supra, </em>81 Cal.App.4th at p. 156.) To do otherwise, <em>Mitchell III </em>argues, would be unfair to the defendant. The People have had a fair chance to prove their case and had the trial judge recognized the legal insufficiency of the evidence presented and entered a \u201cnot true\u201d finding the defendant could not be subjected to a retrial as the People are not authorized to appeal such a determination. (\u00a7 1238.) The <em>Mitchell III </em>court emphasized that the defendant should not be penalized because it was the appellate court, rather than the trial judge, which discovered the evidentiary insufficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">There are two problems with <em>Mitchell Ill\u2019s </em>analysis. First, no authority whatever is provided to support this departure from established principles. Second, <em>Mitchell III\u2019s </em>analysis ignores settled law. For example, it concluded that its earlier decision regarding evidentiary insufficiency (in <em>Mitchell II) </em>provided the requisite finality \u201cakin to an acquittal of an offense.\u201d This seems to be inconsistent with the observation of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Monge </em>v. <em>California </em>when it said, \u201c[sentencing decisions favorable to the defendant . . . cannot generally be analogized to an acquittal.\u201d <em>(Monge v. California, supra, </em>524 U.S. at p. 729 [118 S.Ct. at p. 2251].) In rejecting an analogy to a case <em>(Burks v. United States </em>(1978) 437 U.S. 1 [98 S.Ct. 2141, 57 L.Ed.2d 1]) in which a conviction for a <em>substantive </em>offense was reversed due to evidentiary insufficiency and where a retrial was properly precluded, the Supreme Court stated, \u201c[w]here a similar failure of proof occurs in a sentencing proceeding, however, the analogy is inapt. The pronouncement of sentence simply does not \u2018have the qualities of constitutional finality that attend an acquittal.\u2019 [Citations.].\u201d <em>(Monge v. California, supra, </em>524 U.S. at p. 729 [118 S.Ct. at p. 2251].)</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Even more to the point, as we have already explained, our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Morton </em>makes clear that the very retrial ordered by <em>Mitchell II </em>was <em>the </em>proper procedure following its reversal of the true finding on the defendant\u2019s prior conviction on the grounds of evidentiary insufficiency. <em>(Morton, supra, </em>41 Cal.2d at pp. 544-545.) In addition, section 1262 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>provides a general reversal rule applicable to criminal cases.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Absent a contrary direction from the appellate court, a general reversal of a criminal judgment is <em>deemed </em>to be an order for a new trial. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Hogue </em>(1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 1500, 1506 [279 Cal.Rptr. 647].) There is no principled basis on which <em>Mitchell III </em>could ignore such directives merely because the result appears to be \u201cunfair.\u201d At least, such a result cannot be justified on the grounds of res judicata or collateral estoppel. The required \u201cfinality\u201d is simply not present.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">In addition to the lack of finality, there are strong policy reasons to reject the reasoning and conclusion of <em>Mitchell III. </em>In <em>Rice, supra, </em>200 Cal.App.3d 647, the court explained that whether the defendant has suffered a prior conviction is a matter of the defendant\u2019s current \u201cstatus.\u201d The \u201cjury is <em>not </em>asked to determine whether the defendant was \u2018guilty\u2019 of the prior conviction or whether the prior conviction was validly obtained or is void.\u201d <em>{Rice, supra, </em>200 Cal.App.3d at p. 654.)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">In <em>Rice, </em>the defendant was found to have suffered two prior convictions even though, in a previous trial in a <em>different </em>case, one of those prior convictions had been found to be \u201cnot true.\u201d The defendant argued that under the principles of collateral estoppel, the People should not have been entitled to charge and prove such prior in connection with his present offense. In a case which presented a far more compelling equitable posture than is found in <em>Mitchell III, </em>the <em>Rice </em>court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument. \u201cFirst, the Legislature requires a prior conviction be specifically charged and admitted or found true in the action for the new offense before any additional penalty based on the prior may be imposed. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 667.6, subd. (d).) The Legislature has thus rejected the application of collateral estoppel by the prosecutor to [a] prior conviction and has, instead, required the prior to be specifically proven in the new action regardless of whether or not a previous jury found the prior \u2018true.\u2019 <em>Under these circumstances, it would seem anomalous to allow the defendant to raise the collateral estoppel doctrine when the prosecutor cannot, particularly when the Legislature has stated its intent to have the issue specifically pleaded and litigated anew in the trial of the new offense. </em>The Legislature has safeguarded the defendant\u2019s rights by allowing the defendant repeated opportunities to litigate the truth of the prior. [^] Second, it would be anomalous to apply the doctrine of collateral estoppel to prevent litigation of the truth of an allegation the defendant has a prior conviction when the related doctrine of former jeopardy does not apply. [Citation.] The doctrine of former jeopardy does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>not apply because the increased punishment is not due to the former crime but solely due to the new crime. Nor does the policy behind former jeopardy\u2014preventing the government from harassing a defendant by initiating repeated actions involving the same charges\u2014apply here. The enhancements are not government-initiated harassment of the defendant; the defendant\u2019s own conduct in committing a new offense triggers the charging of the enhancement.\u201d <em>(Rice, supra, </em>200 Cal.App.3d at pp. 654-655, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">As the Supreme Court commented in <em>Monge, </em>\u201c[I]n a trial of a prior conviction allegation, the <em>factual </em>determinations are generally divorced from the facts of the present offense, and the evidence does not overlap at all. Like a trial in which the defendant\u2019s age or gender is at issue, the prior conviction trial merely determines a question of the defendant\u2019s continuing status, irrespective of the present offense, and the prosecution may reallege and retry that status in as many successive cases as it is relevant [citations], even if a prior jury has rejected the allegation [citation]. If a jury rejects the allegation, it has not acquitted the defendant of his prior conviction status. [Citation.] \u2018A defendant cannot be \u201cacquitted\u201d of that status any more than he can be \u201cacquitted\u201d of being a certain age or sex or any other inherent fact.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Monge, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 839.) While these comments were made in the context of an analysis of the application of double jeopardy, they seem equally cogent in our consideration of the related doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Finally, <em>Mitchell III </em>also mentioned, almost in passing and mostly by way of historical background, that some cases have held that the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel could be applied to preclude a retrial (i.e., a second hearing or trial in the <em>same case). </em>We have examined each of those cases and none of them stand for such a proposition, nor do they otherwise provide any support for the conclusion reached in <em>Mitchell III</em></p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Santamaria, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th 903, a case in which a defendant sought to apply collateral estoppel to an issue presented in the retrial of a count <em>for a substantive offense, </em>the Supreme Court stated, \u201cwe <em>question </em>whether collateral estoppel applies to the <em>same </em>proceeding where the government <em>won </em>by securing a conviction of the substantive count. The policies behind the doctrine do not clearly support its application to a retrial of that count.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 913, first italics added.) In any event, <em>Santamaria </em>simply <em>assumed, </em>arguendo, that the doctrine could apply in the same proceeding, then went on to conclude on the merits that the elements of the doctrine had not been satisfied in that case. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 916-926.) It provides no authority whatever for the application of collateral estoppel in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>In <em>Lennane v. Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(1996) 51 Cal.App.4th 1180 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 602], a tax case, the court concluded that \u201c[t]he doctrine of res judicata <em>fail[ed] </em>because, . . . the first ruling was not in a <em>former </em>action . . .\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 1185, citations omitted, first italics added), but in the same action. However, the court did state that \u201ca prior <em>appealable </em>order becomes \u2018res judicata\u2019 <em>in the sense that it becomes binding </em>in the same case if not appealed. <em>(In re Matthew C. </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 386, 393 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 765, 862 P.2d 765].)\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1185-1186, italics added.) We have no such circumstance here as the reversal and retrial order made in <em>Mitchell II </em>clearly contemplated the very retrial which <em>Mitchell III </em>later held was improper. In any event, the <em>Lennane </em>court did not hold that the order at issue in that case was res judicata in the proper sense of that term, with the result that a claim at a later <em>retrial </em>was foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\"><em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Bailin </em>(7th Cir. 1992) 977 F.2d 270, involved a retrial following a <em>hung jury. </em>Our own Supreme Court later observed that <em>Bailin </em>\u201cmight be distinguishable because, <em>... it did not concern a retrial of a conviction reversed on appeal, </em>but rather retrial of counts the first jury could not agree upon, . . <em>(People v. Santamaria, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at p. 915, fn. 5, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">In <em>Santamaria v. Horsley </em>(9th Cir. 1998) 133 F.3d 1242 (which involved a federal review of the issues raised in <em>People v. Santamaria), </em>the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals did not, as claimed by the court in <em>Mitchell III, </em>\u201cfind\u201d collateral estoppel applicable, but stated, \u201cwe <em>assume without deciding </em>that the doctrine [of collateral estoppel] does apply to retrials.\u201d <em>(Santamaria v. Horsley, supra, </em>133 F.3d at p. 1244, italics added.) The Ninth Circuit went on to conclude, <em>on the merits, </em>that collateral estoppel did <em>not </em>apply in that case, specifically, that the collateral estoppel component of federal <em>double jeopardy </em>principles did not apply. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1244-1248.)</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">Finally, the case of <em>Schiro </em>v. <em>Farley </em>(1994) 510 U.S. 222 [114 S.Ct. 783, 127 L.Ed.2d 47], did <em>assume </em>that an acquittal as to a substantive offense could implicate the doctrine of collateral estoppel during a capital sentencing determination. <em>(Schiro </em>v. <em>Farley, supra, </em>510 U.S. at p. 232 [114 S.Ct. at pp. 790-791].) However, <em>Schiro </em>stated it would not \u201caddress\u201d the issue, since, on the merits, the doctrine did not apply. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Importantly, <em>Mitchell III </em>omits the fact that the defendant in <em>Schiro </em>sought application of <em>\u201cconstitutional </em>collateral estoppel\u201d principles based on \u201cthe Double Jeopardy Clause [which] incorporates the doctrine of collateral estoppel in criminal proceedings.\u201d <em>(Schiro v. Farley, supra, </em>510 U.S. at p. 232 [114 S.Ct. at p. 790], italics added.) As we have already pointed out, however, the United States Supreme Court, in <em>Monge </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>524 U.S. 721, has since held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>that federal double jeopardy principles do not apply in noncapital sentencing proceedings. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 724 [118 S.Ct. at p. 2248].)</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">For all of the foregoing reasons, we reject the reasoning and conclusion of <em>Mitchell III </em>and decline to follow it. We believe that there is no sound legal basis for applying either res judicata or collateral estoppel to preclude a retrial of the prior conviction allegation filed against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">d. <em>The Doctrine of \u201cLaw of the Case\u201d Will Not Preclude a Retrial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Appellant also contends that our determination that the evidence was not sufficient to prove the alleged prior serious felony conviction will become the law of the case upon remand and thereby prevent the trial court from reaching a contrary conclusion. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">The answer to this argument is clearly and easily settled by the express language of the Supreme Court in <em>Monge. </em>After concluding that neither state nor federal double' jeopardy principles would bar a retrial of a prior conviction allegation, the court went on to note that secondary issues might well be raised. \u201cFor example, the Court of Appeal\u2019s determination that the evidence was insufficient to prove defendant\u2019s prior conviction was of a serious felony is, at the very least, the law of this case. Thus, the prosecution would have to present additional evidence at a retrial of the prior conviction allegation in order to obtain a different result. What limitations might apply to this additional evidence (other than the limitations we identified in <em>People </em>v. <em>Reed, supra, </em>13 Cal.4th 217, and <em>Guerrero, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d 343) we do not decide, because the Court of Appeal did not address that issue.\u201d <em>(Monge, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 845.)</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">Although dicta, this language is dispositive of the issue before us. To the extent that the People attempt on remand to prove the prior conviction allegation using only the evidence presented at the first trial, then the law of the case will compel the same result (i.e., the evidence is insufficient). However, the doctrine cannot be used to <em>prevent </em>the retrial. It merely means that, in order to succeed, the People will have to produce <em>additional </em>evidence at such retrial. Although the <em>Mitchell III </em>court asserts that such additional evidence must be \u201cnewly discovered evidence which [the People] in due diligence, could not have presented at the first trial,\u201d it cites no authority for such a requirement. <em>Mitchell III </em>relies partially on <em>Monge </em>for that principle, but <em>Monge </em>expressly requires only that there be <em>\u201cadditional </em>evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">The other two cases cited by <em>Mitchell III, </em>in support of its conclusion that any additional evidence be \u201cnewly discovered,\u201d were two civil cases, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number><em>Bank of America v. Superior Court </em>(1991) 220 Cal.App.3d 613 [269 Cal.Rptr. 596] and <em>McCoy v. Hearst Corp. </em>(1991) 227 Cal.App.3d 1657 [278 Cal.Rptr. 596]. However, they each stand for the well-established and unremarkable proposition that when a <em>civil </em>case is reversed on the ground of insufficiency of the evidence, the case is properly terminated; it is not remanded for a new trial. This result is nothing more than an expression of the rationale which underlies Code of Civil Procedure section 639. That section requires an appellate court to order entry of a judgment notwithstanding the verdict when it determines, by its finding that the evidence was insufficient, that the trial court had erroneously failed to do so. <em>(Bank of America v. Superior Court, supra, </em>220 Cal.App.3d at p. 624.)</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Similarly, <em>McCoy, </em>which relied on <em>Bank of America, </em>stated \u201c[w]hen the plaintiff has had full and fair opportunity to present the case, and the evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to support plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, a judgment for defendant is required and no new trial is ordinarily allowed, saved for newly discovered evidence. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 629, 657; 8 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Attack on Judgment in Trial Court, \u00a7 18 et seq.)[<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>] When trial courts grant nonsuits or judgments notwithstanding the verdict based on insufficiency of the evidence and are affirmed on appeal, new trials do not follow as a matter of course. Certainly, where the plaintiff\u2019s evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to support a judgment for plaintiff, a reversal with directions to enter judgment for the defendant is proper.

They certainly provide no authority for <em>Mitchell III's </em>assertion that the law of the case doctrine would preclude a retrial in the absence of <em>newly discovered </em>additional evidence. Moreover, such a result would offend the principles articulated in <em>Morton </em>which we discussed earlier and which describe as <em>the proper procedure </em>the remand for retrial of a prior conviction allegation without imposing the burden of such an additional showing. It would also offend section 1262, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>which articulates a general reversal rule applicable in criminal cases but which is not burdened with an exception such as that found in Code of Civil Procedure section 629.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The judgment is affirmed, except that appellant\u2019s sentence is vacated, the true findings as to the allegations that appellant suffered a 1981 robbery conviction in case No. A371596 pursuant to (1) the Three Strikes law (\u00a7 667, subd.

Moore, supra, </em>8 Cal.App.4th at pp. 420-421.) In <em>Moore, </em>Division Four of this district agreed the admission was defective but rejected the section 1025 argument, noting <em>\u201cthere is a well-established, practice of ordering a retrial on the issue of an alleged prior conviction in cases where reversal is confined to the prior conviction and the conviction for the primary offense is affirmed.\u201d (Id. </em>at p. 421, italics added.) <em>Moore </em>later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>observed, \u201c[t]his practice is consistent with the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Morton . . </em>.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Moore, supra, </em>8 Cal.App.4th at p. 421), then quoted from <em>Morton.

As <em>Mitchell III </em>itself notes, however, <em>Burks </em>was a federal double jeopardy decision, and the United States Supreme Court in <em>Monge v.
