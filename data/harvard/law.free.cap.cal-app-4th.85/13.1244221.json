J.</author>\n<p id=\"AM\">Confronting here a scene of undeniable horror, it brings to mind the cogent observation of Mark Twain that \u201c[man] is the only creature that inflicts pain for sport, knowing it to <em>be </em>pain.\u201d (2 Twain [Samuel Langhome Clemens], Autobiography (1924) p. 7.) In this case we hold that a rooster or other bird falls within the statutory definition of \u201cevery dumb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>creature\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 599b) and thus qualifies as an \u201canimal\u201d for purposes of the animal cruelty statutes found at Penal Code section 597, subdivisions (a) and (b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We therefore affirm the judgments, including defendants\u2019 felony convictions under those animal cruelty statutes for crimes related to cockfighting.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">A jury found defendant Modesto Ruiz Baniqued guilty of three felony violations of the animal cruelty statutes: maliciously and intentionally maiming, torturing or wounding living animals, to wit, roosters (\u00a7 597, subd. (a), count 1); subjecting animals to needless suffering (\u00a7 597, subd. (b), count 2); and cruelly killing live animals, to wit, roosters (\u00a7 597, subd. (b), count 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Baniqued was also found guilty of four misdemeanors: permitting cocks to fight on premises under his charge or control (\u00a7 597b, count 4); owning, possessing, keeping or training birds, to wit, roosters, with the intent that the birds be used in an exhibition of fighting (\u00a7 597c, count 5); manufacturing, buying, selling, bartering, exchanging, or possessing gaffs, slashers, or other sharp instruments designed to be attached in place of the natural spur of a gamecock or other fighting bird (\u00a7 597i, count 6); and owning, possessing or keeping a cock with the intent that it be used or engaged in an exhibition of fighting (\u00a7 597j, count 7).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">Defendant Gonzalo Mari Bito was found guilty of a felony violation of subjecting animals to needless suffering. (\u00a7 597, subd. (b), count 2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">As to each defendant, the trial court suspended imposition of the sentence and granted four years\u2019 formal probation, subject to terms and conditions, and imposed various fines and fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">A. <em>Cockfights at Baniqued\u2019s Property</em></p>\n<p id=\"b42-11\">Defendants do not dispute the evidence which, when viewed in the light most favorable to the judgment, may be summarized as follows: About 9:55 p.m. on July 26, 1997, Sacramento County Sheriff\u2019s Department officers received information about cockfights in progress at defendant Baniqued\u2019s rural property. The caller stated the cockfights were run by a man named <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>Modesto, which is defendant Baniqued\u2019s first name. The dispatch call indicated that about 100 persons were attending the cockfights.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The cockfights were over by the time Officer Jody Tennis reached the scene about 10:25 p.m. Upon arrival, she went toward a large barn on the property. About five persons who had been standing near the barn entrance ran away as soon as one of the patrol cars approached. The officer identified herself and ordered them to stop, but they ignored her. Three or four of them went inside the barn and closed the door behind them.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Officer Tennis radioed for assistance; an officer responded about a minute later. The two officers searched the barn. When Officer Tennis opened the door, there was a stench that turned her stomach. It smelled like \u201csomething burnt had died or something that died burnt.\u201d Inside, the officer found numerous half-dead roosters who were bleeding and dying. They had suffered large, gaping wounds. She also found several dead roosters, and there was blood in many places.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">The inside of the barn was like a \u201ccatacomb or maze,\u201d with a number of rooms on the ground floor. The first room had a dirt floor and looked like it was used previously as a horse stall. Dead or dying birds were inside. After passing through a long, narrow passageway, the officer found several metal cages containing birds.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">Another room had a large pit in a dirt floor. Blood, feathers, and dead birds were in the pit area. There was blood in the center of the pit. Dying birds were on the ground. There were about 30 dead and dying birds, and about 25 live birds. The officer saw a bucket containing birds\u2019 feet and legs, and the amount of fresh blood near and on them suggested they had been there only a short time. There were a couple of sacks full of dead roosters. There was also a stench in the pit area.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">Also in the pit area were a large number of tom pieces of paper with writing on them, which appeared to be betting slips. The officer also found numerous curved, pointed and very sharp knives or gaffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">Another officer testified that he found gaffs in the barn. \u201cGaff\u2019 is a general term for a weapon attached to a rooster used in cockfighting. He did not know the difference between a gaff and a device known as a \u201ctwo-inch knife\u201d or \u201cFilipino slasher.\u201d The officer found dead birds in the kitchen area of the barn, in barrels, in various pens, and \u201call over the place.\u201d He saw about 50 dead or dying birds. There was a total of about 100 birds in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>barn. Some of the live birds were in transportation cases near the pit area. Two detached bird feet were found in a watering or feed dish.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">The officers continued searching the barn and ultimately located both defendants and other persons hiding in a room past the kitchen. Bito had blood on his clothing. Baniqued was \u201ccovered with blood.\u201d Two caged roosters were found inside a Blazer parked at the property. The officers also found a bum barrel that had a stomach-turning smell. There were feathers around the barrel and burnt bird carcasses inside it.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">In a statement he gave to an officer on the night of the incident, Baniqued denied any knowledge of cockfighting or dead birds on his property. However, a search revealed several betting slips inside one of Baniqued\u2019s pockets. Defendant Bito admitted that he arrived at 10:00 a.m. to attend the cockfights, that he had seen about 10 fights, and that he had won about $60 gambling on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">B. <em>Expert Testimony on Cockfighting</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Eric Sakach, an employee of the Humane Society of the United States, testified as an expert on cockfighting based on his training and experience. Gaffs or slashers are attached in various ways to the natural spurs on the legs of gamecocks. The purpose of gaffs or slashers is to inflict lethal wounds. Cockfights usually last only 5 to 10 minutes because the gaffs and slashers cause so much damage to the birds that one or both are mortally wounded fairly quickly.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">The most common types of cockfighting in North America involve long-heel or short-heel \u201cgaffs.\u201d \u201cGaffs\u201d are implements resembling curved ice picks or needles, which are attached to both legs of the bird. Another kind of cockfighting involves what is known as a \u201clong knife\u201d or \u201cFilipino slasher,\u201d which is a knife two and one-half to three and one-half inches long. These slashers are attached only to one leg of the rooster. \u201cShort knife\u201d or \u201cMexican slasher\u201d cockfighting uses a knife that is one to three inches long. Another variety uses a \u201cpostiza,\u201d which is shaped like a hollowed-out natural spur, but is very sharp and made of light steel or hawksbill turtle shell.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">Gaffs tend to cause puncture wounds. In contrast, slashers tend to lay the bird open, causing more visible injuries and more profuse bleeding. Sakach examined photographs of roosters found at the scene and opined that they showed \u201claid-open\u201d wounds consistent with those inflicted by cockfighting with slashers. He also identified implements found at the barn as Filipino slashers and a Mexican slasher. There were no gaffs or postizas found at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>In the weeks leading up to a cockfight, the birds are typically put through a rigorous training, exercise and conditioning program called a \u201ckeep.\u201d Roosters are sparred against each other using so-called sparring muffs. The muffs are made of leather or vinyl, resemble miniature boxing gloves, and fit over a rooster\u2019s natural spurs. The muffs can be weighted so that the birds increase their strength by sparring.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Sparring helps determine the birds\u2019 aggressiveness, and also gets the birds used to being handled and facing other birds. Sometimes, instead of having roosters fight with muffs, a \u201ccull cock\u201d or \u201cjunk\u201d bird is swung in front of the rooster being trained so that it learns to attack a bird coming at it above ground. Immediately before a fight, cockfighters often withhold water from the birds to reduce bleeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Normal barnyard roosters will fight each other, but generally not to the death because the younger bird will quit. Gamecocks are specially bred to be highly aggressive. Thus, gamecocks will fight much longer than other birds will, and that can lead them to acquire severe injuries. Because some gamecocks will try to quit and run, they are fought in a pit to prevent escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">Sakach testified that cockfighting causes the birds to experience and manifest stress, pain, and suffering. Many signs of pain are very obvious, such as when cuts and wounds are present, but signs of stress may be more subtle. The birds may ruffle their feathers, partly or completely close their eyes, refuse food, favor the injured part of the body, and exhibit lassitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">The July 26, 1997, cockfights involved here occurred late in the cockfighting season, in the hotter months when birds are going through a periodic molt and are less active. Fights at that point in the season typically involve birds that participants want to cull from their flocks, such as \u201cblinkers,\u201d i.e., birds that were blinded in one eye earlier in the fighting season. It is not uncommon to get rid of those birds in a blood-fest.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">A. <em>Roosters and Other Birds Are Protected by the Animal Cruelty Statutes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b45-12\">1. <em>The Ordinary Meaning of Section 599b Controls</em></p>\n<p id=\"b45-13\">When interpreting a statute, our fundamental concern is with legislative intent. <em>(Brown v. Kelly Broadcasting Co. </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 711, 724 [257 Cal.Rptr. 708, 771 P.2d 406].) To determine intent, we begin with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>words of the statute itself. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201c[W]e turn first to the.language of the statute, giving the words their ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>(People v. Birkett </em>(1999) 21 Cal.4th 226, 231 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 205, 980 P.2d 912].) When the language is clear, we need not resort to other indicia of legislative intent. <em>(Lungren v. Deukmejian </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 727, 735 [248 Cal.Rptr. 115, 755 P.2d 299].)</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Defendants appeal their respective felony convictions under section 597, subdivisions (a) and (b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Their main argument is that the word \u201canimal\u201d as used in the animal cruelty statutes does not apply to roosters injured or killed in cockfighting.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We reject defendants\u2019 argument. Applying the ordinary meaning of the applicable statutory definition, we conclude that the word \u201canimal,\u201d as it is used in section 597, subdivisions (a) and (b), unambiguously includes a rooster or other bird.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">A violation of subdivision (a) or (b) is punishable either as a. felony , or a misdemeanor. (\u00a7 597, subds. (a), (b).) Section 597 is found in title XIV of part I of the Penal Code, under the heading Malicious Mischief. Title XIV is comprised of sections 594 through 625c.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 599b thereof provides: \u201cIn this title the word \u2018animal\u2019 includes <em>every dumb creature </em>. . . .\u201d (Italics added.) Thus, something is an \u201canimal\u201d for purposes of section 597, subdivisions (a) and (b) if it falls within the category, \u201cevery dumb creature.\u201d We conclude that a rooster or other bird is encompassed by this broad definition of \u201canimal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">In relevant part, Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1993) at page 700 defines the word \u201cdumb\u201d as: \u201c1: destitute of the power of speech . . . 2 a: by nature incapable of speech like that of human beings &lt;~animals&gt; . . . [H] syn[onyms] Mute, Speechless, Inarticulate: Dumb and Mute are often interchangeable, but some differences may be noted. In reference to animals, Mute implies an inability to make sounds, Dumb an incapacity for speech . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">As germane here, the same source defines \u201ccreature\u201d as follows: \u201c1: something whether animate or inanimate regarded as created . . .2 a: one of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>the lower animals . . . ; <em>esp[ecially]: </em>a farm animal . . . b: a human being . . . (Webster\u2019s 3d New Intemat. Diet., <em>supra, </em>p. 532.) In pertinent part, \u201canimal\u201d is defined as: \u201c1: an organism of the kingdom Animalia . . . being distinguished from typical plants . . .2 a: one of the lower animals: a bmte or beast as distinguished from man: any creature except a human being . . . b: a mammal as distinguished from a bird, reptile or other nonmammal . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 85.)</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Thus, in its broadest sense, the phrase \u201cdumb creatures\u201d describes all animals except human beings. The use of the adjective \u201cevery.\u201d in the definition indicates that a broad meaning was intended. As relevant here, \u201cevery\u201d means: \u201c1 a: being each individual or part of a class or group whether definite or indefinite in number without exception . . . .\u201d (Webster\u2019s 3d New Intemat. Diet., <em>supra, </em>p. 788.) Accordingly, the plain language of the statute shows that the Legislature did not intend to restrict the phrase to mammals. The category \u201cevery dumb creature\u201d plainly includes roosters and other birds.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">Section 599b was enacted in 1905, but we are aware of no prior published California decision interpreting the phrase \u201cevery dumb creature.\u201d (\u00a7 599b.) However, the construction we recognize here is supported by persuasive decisions of courts in other states that have considered the meaning of the phrase.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Each such decision we have uncovered has construed the phrase broadly. <em>(Wilkerson </em>v. <em>State </em>(Fla. 1981) 401 So.2d 1110, 1112 [definition of \u201canimal\u201d as \u201c \u2018every living dumb creature\u2019 . . . excludes human beings from the commonly understood definition of animals\u201d and thus animal cruelty statute applies to raccoons]; <em>Waters </em>v. <em>People </em>(1896) 23 Colo. 33 [46 P. 112, 113-115] [definition \u201c \u2018every living dumb creature\u2019 \u201d applies to doves used as live targets for trap shooting; opinion also describes birds as \u201cdumb creatures\u201d (46 P. at p. 113) and \u201cdumb animals\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 114)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Kirchner </em>(1984) 19 Ohio Misc.2d 7 [483 N.E.2d 497, 499] [definition of \u201canimal\u201d as \u201c \u2018every living dumb creature\u2019 . . . would obviously include a snake . . .\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">We hold that the word \u201canimal,\u201d as used in section 597, subdivisions (a) and (b), and as expressly defined in section 599b, includes roosters and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>birds.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The fact that the roosters involved in a particular case are used or intended to be used in cockfighting is of no consequence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">2. <em>Jett v. Municipal Court Is Inapposite</em></p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Defendants\u2019 argument that the term \u201canimal\u201d refers only to mammals relies on <em>Jett v. Municipal Court </em>(1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 664 [223 Cal.Rptr. 111] <em>(Jett), </em>a decision of the Fourth Appellate District, Division One. Defendants\u2019 reliance on <em>Jett </em>is misplaced for various reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\"><em>Jett </em>involved a 50-year-old giant tortoise named Rocky, which was owned by the defendant and kept at a petting zoo at a shopping center. <em>(Jett, supra, </em>177 Cal.App.3d at p. 666.) The humane society found the tortoise was suffering from various physical ailments indicating a lack of care and attention, and therefore removed the tortoise from the defendant\u2019s custody. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">The municipal court convicted Jett of misdemeanor violations of section 597, subdivision (b), for subjecting an animal to needless suffering, and section 597f, for permitting an animal to be on a street or lot without proper care and attention. <em>(Jett, supra, </em>177 Cal.App.3d at pp. 666-667.) The court fined the defendant, ordered him to relinquish ownership of the tortoise to Mesa College subject to the humane society\u2019s statutory lien for care provided to the tortoise (\u00a7 597f, subd. (a)), and denied the defendant\u2019s request that the tortoise be returned to him. (177 Cal.App.3d at p. 667.)</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Defendant Jett then filed a petition for writ of mandate in superior court to compel the municipal court to vacate its order denying his motion for return of the tortoise and to enter an order granting such motion. <em>(Jett, supra, 177 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 667.) The defendant\u2019s writ petition was denied, and he then appealed. <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">The Court of Appeal concluded that the municipal court was without power to divest the defendant of ownership of the tortoise. <em>(Jett, supra, 177 </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Cal.App.3d at pp. 668, 671.) The court observed that the disposition of animals cruelly treated fell into two categories <em>(id. </em>at p. 668), but found that the situation before it fell into neither one <em>(id. </em>at p. 669).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The court first observed that statutory liens make animal owners liable for the costs of care provided to impounded animals. (177 Cal.App.3d at pp. 668-669.) In some cases, abandonment might permit the divestment of ownership, but only following the procedures for establishing the lien and its amount. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 669.) However, there was no abandonment of the tortoise in <em>Jett, </em>because the defendant petitioned for its return and the municipal court had expressly reserved the humane society\u2019s lien. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Hence, <em>Jett </em>considered the other alternative: whether the defendant could be divested of ownership under statutes pertaining to the forfeiture of \u201cfighting animals.\u201d <em>(Jett, supra, 177 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 669.) Section 599aa provides that an officer making an arrest under section 597.5 (fighting dog) <em>shall, </em>and that an officer making an arrest under section 597b (fighting \u201cbull, bear, cock, or other animal\u201d) or section 599a (search and arrest warrants pertaining to \u201cdumb animals and birds\u201d) \u201c <em>\u2018may . . </em>. take possession of all birds or animals ....\u2019\u201d (177 Cal.App.3d. at p. 669 [citing \u00a7 599aa].)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Section 599aa also mandates the forfeiture (and destruction or other disposition) of the seized \u201cbirds or animals\u201d upon a defendant\u2019s conviction under \u201cany Penal Code section prohibiting specific activities involving fighting birds or animals.\u201d <em>(Jett, supra, 177 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 669.) The <em>Jett </em>defendant was not convicted of any bird- or animal-fighting offense, however. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">Despite this, the People contended that the forfeiture of \u201cfighting animals\u201d provided for by section 599aa authorized the municipal court to award the tortoise to the college. <em>(Jett, supra, 177 </em>Cal.App.3d at pp. 669-670.) The Court of Appeal disagreed for the following reasons: \u201cThe argument fails. Rocky is not a fighting animal. He is a reptile . . . characterized as long-lived, slow-moving and herbivorous. . . . M] It is true for some purposes a tortoise is deemed an animal. Thus, a motion picture exhibiting the intentional killing of, or cruelty to, an animal, may be enjoined as a nuisance. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3505.) For these purposes, the word \u2018animal\u2019 means any amphibian, bird, mammal or reptile, but not a fish or insect. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3504.) \u2018Animal\u2019 in its broadest sense includes any organism of the animal kingdom, one of the three divisions into which,natural objects are divided, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>the others being mineral and plant. We conclude the word \u2018animal\u2019 <em>as used in these Penal Code sections </em>means a mammal as distinguished from a bird, reptile or other nonmammal. (See Webster\u2019s Third New Intemat. Diet., <em>op. cit. supra.) </em>[f] This slow-moving, grass-grazing giant tortoise is not a fighting animal.\u201d <em>(Jett, supra, </em>177 Cal.App.3d at p. 670, italics added, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">The immediately preceding quotation shows that the <em>Jett </em>court concluded merely that a tortoise does not qualify as a <em>fighting </em>animal for purposes of the statutes at issue there, i.e., sections 599aa and 597b. <em>(Jett, supra, 177 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 669.) <em>Jett </em>did not purport to, and did not, construe the meaning of \u201canimal\u201d for purposes of section 597, subdivisions (a) and (b), statutes that are not by their terms restricted to fighting animals.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">More importantly, however, the <em>Jett </em>decision failed to cite section 599b, which expressly and broadly defines \u201canimal,\u201d for purposes of title XIV of the Penal Code, to include \u201cevery dumb creature . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 599b.) Because <em>Jett </em>did not consider the significance of section 599b, <em>Jett </em>is not good authority for the proposition that only a mammal is an \u201canimal\u201d for purposes of section 597, subdivisions (a) and (b). <em>Jett </em>does not support the view that a tortoise or other nonmammal is not an \u201canimal\u201d as defined by section 599b.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Therefore, <em>Jett </em>is properly limited to the conclusion that a tortoise is not a \u201cfighting\u201d animal for purposes of sections 599aa and 597b. <em>(Jett, supra, 177 </em>Cal.App.3d at p. 670.) Our belief that <em>Jett </em>should be so limited is supported by its closing comment that \u201c[ajbsent statutory authority, a court may not divest an owner of a property interest in a <em>nonfighting </em>animal or bird\u201d <em>(id. </em>at pp. 670-671, italics added) to effectuate the state\u2019s interest in the protection of animals. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 670.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>3. <em>Other Supposed Indicia of Legislative Intent Support the View That a Rooster Is an \u201cAnimal\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Defendants contend that certain conduct (including inaction) by the Legislature indicates its intent that roosters are not \u201canimals\u201d for purposes of the animal cruelty statutes. Because we have already found that the language of section 599b is unambiguous, we need look no further to deduce the legislative intent. <em>(Lungren </em>v. <em>Deukmejian, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 735.)</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">However, in light of the importance of the issue presented, we shall examine defendants\u2019 assertions. We find that the legislative history on which defendants rely provides further, albeit unnecessary, confirmation of our conclusion that a rooster or other bird qualifies as an \u201canimal\u201d for purposes of section 597, subdivisions (a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">a. <em>1987 amendments to section 597</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">Defendants first contend that soon after the 1986 decision in <em>Jett, supra, </em>177 Cal.App.3d 664, the Legislature responded by adding subdivision (f) to section 597. In relevant part, subdivision (f) provides that when a person is convicted under section 597 of \u201can act of cruelty, as defined in Section 599b, all animals lawfully seized and impounded . . . shall be . . . forfeited ...\u201d (\u00a7 597, subd. (f)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">Based on this, defendants claim: \u201cIf the [L]egislature disagreed with the <em>Jett </em>decision as to the meaning of \u2018animal\u2019 within subsections [sic] (a) and (b) it certainly could have made its views clear. The absence of any change in that definition while the Legislature was specifically responding to <em>Jett </em>by adding subsection [sic] (f)\u201d assertedly showed that the Legislature agreed with <em>Jett </em>in that respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-11\">Defendants\u2019 argument fails because it starts from a false premise. As we have seen, <em>Jett, supra, 177 </em>Cal.App.3d 664, stands only for the proposition that a tortoise is not <em>a fighting </em>animal under sections 599aa and 597b. (177 Cal.App.3d at p. 670.) Since <em>Jett </em>did not decide what is an \u201canimal\u201d for purposes of section 597, subdivisions (a) and (b), the Legislature had no occasion impliedly to agree or disagree with <em>Jett </em>on that subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-12\">Also, because <em>Jett, supra, 177 </em>Cal.App.3d 664, failed to mention section 599b, we will not assume that the Legislature\u2019s <em>inaction </em>constituted an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>implied ratification of a narrow construction of the phrase \u201cevery dumb creature.\u201d (\u00a7 599b.) Finally, new subdivision (f) was added to section 597, the same statute containing the animal cruelty statutes at subdivisions (a) and (b) . Thus, if defendants\u2019 reasoning were correct, it would be just as valid to say that the Legislature intended that cruelty to tortoises\u2014which, like birds, are not mammals\u2014be punishable as a misdemeanor <em>or felony </em>under section 597, subdivisions (a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">By adding subdivision (f) to section 597, the Legislature intended to provide for the forfeiture of <em>nonfighting </em>animals which are cruelly treated, in that respect abrogating <em>Jett, supra, </em>177 Cal.App.3d 664. There is no indication that in doing so the Legislature also intended to exempt tortoises or other nonmammals from the broad definition of \u201canimal\u201d expressed at section 599b.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">b. <em>1984 amendments to section 597</em></p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">Defendants also point out that in 1984 the Legislature added subdivisions (c) , (d) and (e) to section 597. Subdivision (c) makes it a felony or misdemeanor to maliciously and intentionally maim, mutilate, or torture \u201cany mammal, bird, reptile, amphibian, or fish\u201d described in subdivision (d). Subdivision (d) states that subdivision (c) \u201capplies to any mammal, bird, reptile, amphibian, or fish which is a creature described as follows,\u201d i.e., endangered or threatened species, and \u201c[fjully protected\u201d birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and fish, as described in various provisions of the Fish and Game Code. (\u00a7 597, subd. (d)(l)-(5).) Subdivision (e) makes each act of maiming, mutilating, or torturing \u201ca separate specimen of a creature described in subdivision (d)\u201d a separate offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">Defendants assert that the addition of subdivisions (c), (d) and (e), \u201cin which the word animal is not used but a much broader set of creatures is described[] is strong support for the view that the <em>Jett </em>definition of \u2018animal\u2019 was not in conflict with the view of the [Ljegislature with respect to creatures not covered by subsections <em>\\sic\\ </em>(c), (d) and (e) of Section 597.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">However, that argument suffers from the same fallacy noted above, i.e., the erroneous view that <em>Jett, supra, </em>177 Cal.App.3d 664, decided what constitutes an \u201canimal\u201d for purposes of section 597, subdivisions (a) and (b). In addition, defendants are mistaken in suggesting that subdivision (d) describes \u201ca much broader set of creatures.\u201d In fact, the- group of creatures incorporated by reference to the Fish and Game Code is quite circumscribed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>(\u00a7 597, subd. (d)(l)-(5), citing Fish &amp; G. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 2050 et seq., 3511, 4700 et seq., 5050 et seq., 5515.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The plain language of section 597, subdivisions (c), (d) and (e), evinces a far-ranging intent to punish cruelty against \u201cevery dumb creature\u201d (\u00a7 599b), even when the creatures involved are certain wild mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, or fish.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Subdivision (e) also signifies an intent to punish more severely cruelty against endangered, threatened and protected species by making each cruel act against \u201ca separate specimen of a creature\u201d a separate offense. (\u00a7 597, subd. (e).) This does not mean the Legislature did not also intend to punish as a felony, under subdivisions (a) and (b), cruelty against roosters and other birds outside the scope of subdivision (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">In addition, section 597, subdivisions (d) and (e) use the term \u201ccreature\u201d in reference to mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish. This supports our conclusion that section 599b, defining an \u201canimal\u201d as including \u201cevery dumb creature,\u201d includes roosters and other birds, and not only mammals.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">Finally, we reject defendants\u2019 implication that the only birds (or other nonmammals) protected under section 597 are the endangered, threatened or protected species described in subdivision (d). (\u00a7 597, subd. (d)(l)-(2), (4)-(5).) If that were the case, then there would be no need for subdivision (d) also to describe certain mammals (\u00a7 597, subd. (d)(3)), since defendants readily admit\u2014and no one would dispute\u2014that a mammal qualifies as an \u201canimal\u201d under subdivisions (a) and (b). In other words, to accept such an argument would be to say that not even mammals are within the scope of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>subdivisions (a) and (b), an untenable interpretation. The argument also fails with respect to roosters and other birds.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">c. <em>1989 rejection of Senate Bill No. 1587</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Defendants also rely on the fact that the Legislature rejected Senate Bill No. 1587 (1989-1990 Reg. Sess.), introduced on March 10, 1989, which sought to make cockfightirig punishable as either a misdemeanor or a felony. Defendants claim \u201cthere would have been no reason to make cock fighting a felony if the killing, maiming or mutilation of roosters was covered by Penal Code Sections 597(a) or 597(b) [sz'c].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Preliminarily, we note that neither at the trial court nor on appeal did the defendants request judicial notice of Senate Bill No. 1587 and related legislative materials. As a result, those matters are not in the appellate record and defendants may have waived reliance thereon. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 459, subds. (a), (b).) Thus, there are sufficient reasons simply not to consider the argument here. However, we choose to address the argument on its merits. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 454, subd. (a)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">As evidence of legislative intent, unpassed bills are of little value <em>(Yoshisato v. Superior Court </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 978, 990-991, fn. 7 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 102, 831 P.2d 327]) and arguably irrelevant.  We are not persuaded that the failure of Senate Bill No. 1587 shows the Legislature intended to preclude a felony prosecution for cruelty to roosters.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">Senate Bill No. 1587 may have failed for any number of reasons unrelated to the legislative intent regarding whether a rooster is an \u201canimal\u201d for purposes of section 597, subdivisions (a) and (b). For all anyone knows, it failed because the .Legislature believed that cruelty to roosters used in or intended for cockfighting was already punishable as a felony under section 597, subdivisions (a) and (b). We decline to speculate on these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">Finally, Senate Bill No. 1587 sought to amend sections 597b, 597c, 597e, 597i, 597j and 599aa (Sen. Bill No. 1587 (1989-1990 Reg. Sess.) \u00a7\u00a7 1-5, 7), which are <em>not </em>the statutes at issue here. The pertinent statutes are section 599b and section 597, subdivisions (a) and (b). As will appear from part B of our Discussion, <em>post, </em>Senate Bill No. 1587 sought to address crimes distinct from those covered by section 597, subdivisions (a) and (b). Legislative action or inaction in elevating the punishment available under those other laws\u2014for various types of conduct which may not involve cruelty\u2014is not logically connected to section 597, subdivisions (a) and (b), which permit felony punishment for cruelty to roosters and other birds.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>B. <em>General v. Specific Statutes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Defendants\u2019 final argument is that the existence of supposedly \u201cspecific\u201d legislation dealing with cockfighting precludes defendants\u2019 prosecution under the more \u201cgeneral\u201d animal cruelty statutes\u2014section 597, subdivisions (a) and (b)\u2014for the criminal conduct involved here.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">First we observe that defendants may have waived this claim on appeal. Their opening brief suggested that \u201cthe specific legislation dealing with cockfighting should limit the application of the more general law contained in Penal Code Section 597(a) and (b) . . . .\u201d  However, defendants failed to cite any authority, present any legal analysis, or place the argument under a separate heading, arguably waiving the point. <em>(Atchley </em>v. <em>City of Fresno </em>(1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 635, 647 [199 Cal.Rptr. 72]; <em>Opdyk </em>v. <em>California Horse Racing Bd. </em>(1995) 34 Cal.App.4th 1826, 1830-1831, fn. 4 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 263]; <em>Troensegaard v. Silvercrest Industries, Inc. </em>(1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 218, 228 [220 Cal.Rptr. 712].)</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Defendants make the same argument in their reply brief, and at least cite some authority there.  Withholding a point until the reply brief deprives the respondent of an opportunity to answer it, however.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Hence, a point raised for the first time therein is deemed waived and will not be considered, unless good reason is shown for failure to present it before. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Speegle </em>(1997) 53 Cal.App.4th 1405, 1418, fn. 8 [62 Cal.Rptr.2d 384]; <em>Neighbours </em>v. <em>Buzz Oates Enterprises </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 325, 335, fn. 8 [265 Cal.Rptr. 788]; 9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (4th ed. 1997) Appeal, \u00a7 616, pp. 647-648.) No good cause is shown here. In any event, defendants\u2019 position is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">\u201cThe principle that a specific statute prevails over a general one applies only when the two sections cannot be reconciled.\u201d <em>(People v. Wheeler </em>(1992) 4 Cal.4th 284, 293 [14 Cal.Rptr.2d 418, 841 P.2d 938], citing, inter alia, Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1859.) \u201cIn the construction of a statute the intention of the Legislature . . . is to be pursued, if possible; and when a general and [a] particular provision are inconsistent, the latter is paramount to the former. So a particular intent will control a general one that is inconsistent with it.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1859.)</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">Thus, prosecution under the general statute is forbidden if the specific statute covers much of the same subject, so that violation of the specific will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>necessarily violate the general. <em>(People v. Sanchez </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 918, 922 [33 Cal.Rptr.2d 155].) The special statute supersedes the general only when each element of the general statute corresponds to an element on the face of the specific statute. <em>(Ibid.)</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">The principle that the specific prevails over the general does not apply here. The asserted \u201cgeneral\u201d statutes\u2014section 597, subdivisions (a) and (b)\u2014cover different subjects than the supposed \u201cspecific\u201d sections 597b, 597c, 597i and 597j. The general and the specific are not inconsistent, but are easily reconciled. Further, each element of the general does not correspond to an element of the specific. Thus, violation of the specific statutes would not necessarily violate the general.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">An examination of the statutes illustrates the point. Section 597b prohibits fighting any bull, bear, cock, or other animal, not including a dog, with a like kind of animal or creature; fighting any such animal, including a dog, with a different kind of animal or creature or a human being; worrying or injuring any such bull, bear, cock, dog or other animal, or causing any such bull, bear, cock, or other animal, not including a dog, to worry or injure each other; permitting the same to be done on any premises under defendant\u2019s charge or control; and aiding, abetting, or being present as a spectator at such fighting or worrying of such animal or creature.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Violating section 597b would not necessarily violate section 597, subdivision (a) or (b). Subdivision (a) proscribes maliciously and intentionally maiming, mutilating, torturing, or wounding a living animal, or maliciously and intentionally killing an animal.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Subdivision (b) forbids overdriving, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>overloading, driving when overloaded, overworking, torturing, tormenting, depriving of food, drink, or shelter, cruelly beating, mutilating, or cruelly killing any animal, or causing or procuring the same; and subjecting any animal to needless suffering, or inflicting unnecessary cruelty upon the animal, or in any manner abusing any animal.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">As relevant to cockfighting, a person might cause roosters to fight each other without necessarily inflicting the types of cruelty prohibited by section 597, subdivision (a) or (b). For example, roosters might be made to fight each other\u2014in violation of section 597b\u2014under conditions that might not violate the \u201cgeneral\u201d statutes, such as with protective sparring muffs; or without gaffs, slashers, or other implements; or without using cocks specially bred for aggressiveness; or for only an extremely short period of time; or under other such conditions.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Defendants\u2019 argument under the other supposed \u201cspecific\u201d statutes is even weaker. Section 597c makes it a crime to own, possess, keep, or train any bird or animal intended to be used in fighting, or to be present at such a fight.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Section 597j criminalizes owning, possessing, or keeping a cock with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>the intent that it be used in fighting.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Plainly, it is possible to violate sections 597c and 597j without violating section 597, subdivision (a) or (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">Finally, section 597i makes it illegal to make, buy, sell or possess gaffs, slashers, and similar implements used in cockfighting.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> A person certainly can violate section 597i without violating either subdivision (a) or (b) of section 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Hence, we reject defendants\u2019 claim that specific statutes punishing various crimes as misdemeanors preclude defendants\u2019 prosecutions and convictions for felonies under the animal cruelty statutes. .  When we interpret statutes, \u201c[w]e must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the Legislature, with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute, and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jenkins </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 234, 246 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 903, 893 P.2d 1224].)</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Sections 597b, 597c, 597i, and 597j each address conduct which is less egregious than the conduct proscribed by section 597, subdivisions (a) and (b). The legislative intent underlying this statutory scheme is to punish less despicable conduct less severely, and to punish more despicable conduct more severely. Thus, for example, a person may be convicted of a misdemeanor under section 597b for cockfighting and associated activities even absent cruelty to the rooster.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">If, however\u2014as here\u2014such activity in a particular case involves the malicious and intentional maiming, mutilating, torturing, or wounding of roosters, the subjection of roosters to needless suffering, the cruel killing of roosters, or some other violation of the animal cruelty statutes, then the person is properly convicted of either a misdemeanor <em>or a felony. </em>(\u00a7 597, subds. (a), (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">To adopt defendants\u2019 view of the statutory scheme would create an absurd situation that would allow a person to inflict the most heinous cruelty upon roosters with relative impunity, all under the guise that such conduct is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>subject to punishment only under the misdemeanor statutes relating to cockfighting and associated activities. We decline to embrace such an erroneous interpretation of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac\">Callahan, J., and Hull, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b42-12\">Solely for the sake of simplicity and in the context of this opinion, we refer to section 597, subdivisions (a) and (b) by the shorthand phase \u201canimal cruelty statutes.\u201d All statutory references are to the Penal Code except as otherwise specified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b46-8\">Baniqued does not challenge his four misdemeanor convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b46-9\">In brief, section 597, subdivision (a) makes it illegal to commit various types of cruelty against \u201ca living animal,\u201d or to \u201cmaliciously and intentionally\u201d kill \u201can animal.\u201d Subdivision (b) of section 597 prohibits cruelty against or the cruel killing of \u201cany animal,\u201d subjecting \u201cany animal\u201d to needless suffering or inflicting unnecessary cruelty upon the \u201canimal,\u201d or abusing \u201cany animal.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b46-10\">The statutes within title XIV which pertain to animals are found at sections 596 through 600.5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b46-11\">The \u201cboldface or lightface swung dash [~] stands for the preceding boldface entry word,\u201d while the \u201clightface angle brackets [&lt; &gt;] contain a verbal illustration.\u201d (Webster\u2019s 3d New Internat.

Further, violation of subdivision (b) was still only a misdemeanor. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The new subdivisions were intended in part to allow felony punishment for cruelty against wild \u201cspecies that are not the property of another.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Crim. Law and Public Saf., Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 1611 (1983-1984 Reg. Sess.) as amended June 12, 1984, p. 2.)
