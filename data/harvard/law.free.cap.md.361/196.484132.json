We granted the appellant\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari and, following oral argument on July 20, 2000, issued our decision reversing the judgment of the Circuit Court and remanding the case to that court to conduct judicial review. We now explain the reasons for that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">The seeds of this controversy were sown first when the PSC developed policy initiatives designed to restructure the electric industry in Maryland, <em>i.e., </em>develop a market capable of supporting competition for the sale of electricity in the BGE service area, and later when the Electric Customer Choice and Competition Act of 1999 was enacted by the General Assembly and signed into law by the Governor. <em>See </em>1999 Md. Laws. Chap. 3. Pursuant to, and in accordance with, the PSC\u2019s initiatives, BGE filed an application setting forth its restructuring plan. It was docketed in Commission Case 8794. The OPC also filed a petition to reduce the rates charged by BGE. That case, docketed as Case 8804, was consolidated with Case 8794.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The appellant is a Pennsylvania corporation which operates as a trade association for companies participating in both the wholesale and retail electric supply markets in Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Ohio and the District of Columbia. In that capacity, it filed a petition to intervene in the OPC\u2019s rate reduction action. That petition was granted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>When that occurred, because, as we have seen, that matter and the restructuring plan had been consolidated, the appellant was enabled to, and did, participate fully in the negotiations leading up to the settlement at issue. Obviously, its opposition, and that of two other parties, as to those provisions of the settlement addressing the stranded costs, the allocation of the rate reduction and the unbundling of rates, did not prevail and the appellant refused to sign the settlement agreement reached by BGE and several other parties, which was signed on June 29, 1999. Once the settlement had been reached, the appellant thereafter participated in the proceedings in the PSC, challenging those terms of the settlement that it earlier had opposed in negotiations. Its efforts in the PSC were no more successful than during negotiations. When the PSC approved the settlement, by Commission Order No. 75757, on November 10, 1999, the appellant filed its petition for judicial review.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>BGE moved for summary judgment on the issue of the appellant\u2019s standing to prosecute a judicial review proceeding. It argued in the motion and before the Circuit Court that the appellant was not \u201ca party or person in interest,\u201d pointing out that, as an association, operating only in a representative capacity, it had no interest in the proceedings separate and distinct from the interests of its members. Rejecting the appellant\u2019s rebuttal \u2014 it was a party before the Commission, participating fully in the proceedings, it meets the definition of party, and, in any event, the controlling statute clearly and unambiguously gives it standing<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u2014 the court agreed with BGE and thus granted the motion for summary judgment. In reaching its conclusion, it relied on the legislative history of the statute, rather than the clear import of the language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuZ\">\u201cWhat [the appellant\u2019s] argument ignores ... is that which came to the attention of the Court of Appeals, namely the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>active legislative efforts to amend the Public Service Commission law then underway. In fact, an effort to establish appeal rights for the Office of People\u2019s Counsel in the 1947 General Assembly had been defeated and that was one of the bases for the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bosley v. Dorsey, </em>191 Md. [229,] 239-40[, 60 A.2d 691, 696 (1948) ]. Rather than misread the current statutory standard for judicial review for the purpose of historical consistency, this Court is persuaded by the historical significance of the fact that the current codification of the law abandons the reference to an \u2018association\u2019 as having the right to obtain judicial review of PSC orders. That entitlement is limited now, with statutory exceptions, to \u2018a party or person in interest\u2019 and this term of art is undefined in the statutory scheme. Whether the Court analogizes to an \u2018aggrieved party in a contested case,\u2019 who is entitled to judicial review of a final decision under the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act or merely looks to the language of the PSC cases cited in <em>Bosley v. Dorsey, </em>191 Md. at 235-36[, 60 A.2d at 694], the inescapable result is that \u2018party or person in interest\u2019 is reasonably interpreted to be an entity having \u2018an interest adversely affected by the order.\u2019 \u201d <em>Public Service Commission v. Byron, </em>153 Md. 464, 471 [, 138 A. 404, 407] (1927).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The court accordingly dismissed the appellant\u2019s petition for judicial review, -with prejudice. As already mentioned, we granted the appellant\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari and reversed that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The canons of statutory construction are well settled. We recently reaffirmed those, relevant and dispositive of this case in <em>Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore v. Chase, </em>360 Md. 121, 128, 756 A.2d 987, 991 (2000). In that case, quoting <em>Chesapeake and Potomac Tel. Co. of Md. v. Dir. of Fin. for Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>343 Md. 567, 578, 683 A.2d 512, 517-18 (1996), we said, in that regard, that in pursuing the real goal of statutory interpretation, the discernment of the intent of the Legislature, we begin our inquiry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>with the words of the statute and, when they are clear and unambiguous, we end it there, as well. The point was made yet again that we neither add nor delete words to a clear and unambiguous statute to give it a meaning not reflected by the words the Legislature used or engage in forced or subtle interpretation in an attempt to extend or limit the statute\u2019s meaning. Moreover, whenever possible, the statute should be read so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered superfluous or nugatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">We also reviewed those canons applicable when the statute to be interpreted is a part of a statutory scheme. Quoting <em>GEICO v. Insurance Comm\u2019r, </em>332 Md. 124, 131-32, 630 A.2d 713, 717-18 (1993), we noted the necessity of reading statutes on the same subject together, harmonizing them to the extent possible, and that such statutes are to be read to avoid rendering either of them, or \u201cany portion, meaningless, surplusage, superfluous or nugatory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 132, 630 A.2d at 717. While we acknowledged the role that legislative history plays in the interpretation of statutes, even when the words the Legislature used are clear and unambiguous, <em>see Harris v. State, </em>331 Md. 137, 146, 626 A.2d 946, 950 (1993), indicating that, in the interest of completeness, we may, and sometimes will, review the legislative history of a clear statute, we explained, quoting <em>Coleman v. State, </em>281 Md. 538, 546, 380 A.2d 49, 54 (1977) (\u201ca court may not as a general rule surmise a legislative intention contrary to the plain language of a statute or insert exceptions not made by the legislature\u201d), that \u201cthe resort to legislative history is a confirmatory process; it is not undertaken to contradict the plain meaning of the statute.\u201d <em>Chase, </em>360 Md. at 131, 756 A.2d at 993.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The right to judicial review of an order or decision of the Public Service Commission is controlled by Maryland Code (1999) \u00a7 3-202(a) of the Public Utility Companies Article. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-6\">\u201c(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 Except for the staff of the Commission, a party or person in interest, including the People\u2019s Counsel, that is dissatisfied by a final decision or order of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Commission may seek judicial review of the decision or order as provided in this subtitle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">The statute is clear and unambiguous. By its plain language, to be eligible to seek judicial review of a Commission order or decision, the petitioner must be a \u201cparty or person in interest\u201d and be \u201cdissatisfied\u201d with the decision or order. We believe that the status test is fulfilled if the petitioner is either a party to the proceedings before the Commission or, if not a party, a \u201cperson in interest.\u201d The appellant qualifies, we believe, under either status.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">\u201cPerson\u201d is a defined term under the Public Utility Companies Article. Section l-101(s) of that Article defines that term to mean \u201can individual, receiver, trustee, guardian, personal representative, fiduciary, or representative of any kind and any partnership, firm, association, corporation, or other entity.\u201d Under this definition, as the parties agree, the appellant, an association, albeit a trade association, is a person.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">The appellant was, as we have seen and the parties to these proceedings also agree, a party before the PSC. Because it moved, and was allowed, to intervene, Maryland Code (1998) \u00a7 3-106 of the Public Utility Companies Article, governing intervention in Commission proceedings, is implicated. Because \u00a7 3-106 defines the meaning of \u201cparty,\u201d as used in \u00a7 3-202(a), it and \u00a7 3-202(a) must be read together. Section 3-106 provides that a person shall be permitted to intervene if the person makes timely application and the Commission concludes that the interests of that person are not being adequately represented and that the issue or issues the person seeks to raise are neither irrelevant nor immaterial. Thus, to become a party to a proceeding before the Commission, a party must have been determined, by the Commission, to have an interest in the proceeding that is not being adequately represented and that interest, in turn, has been determined not to be frivolous or of no consequence to the proceeding.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Once intervention has been granted, the person has all the rights of a party to the proceeding. In this case, having intervened, the appellant participated fully in the PSC proceedings at which the settlement agreement underlying the Commission order was approved by the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Section 3-106 also informs the meaning of the phrase, \u201cperson in interest.\u201d As we have seen, to intervene requires that there be an interest that the person seeking to intervene has that is not being adequately represented. It follows that, once intervention has been granted, the interest that the Commission has found the person to have had is not dissipated.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The requirement that there be dissatisfaction with the order or decision sought to be reviewed is fulfilled when the party or person in interest seeks judicial review, proffering reasons for the court to reverse the order or decision. In this case, the appellant has sought judicial review and, more to the point, it has advanced a rational basis for the overturning of the order,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>ie., </em>that the settlement agreement approved by the Commission does not comply with the mandate of the Electric Customer Choice and Competition Act.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In any event, there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>no serious dispute that the appellant is \u201cdissatisfied\u201d with the decision and order of the PSC.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The appellees view the issue quite differently. As they see it, and argue, rather than dissatisfaction, the applicable test for standing is \u201caggrievement.\u201d In support of this conclusion, the appellees rely on the \u201cmodifying phrase \u2018in interest,\u2019\u201d used in \u00a7 3-202(a), the legislative history of \u00a7 3-202(a), language in cases applying \u00a7 3-202(a),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and the fact that \u201cthis Court has consistently held, in analogous contexts, that an association is not aggrieved or entitled to judicial review unless the association itself has an interest at stake that is separate and distinct from the interests of its members.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">As to the phrase, \u201cin interest,\u201d citing <em>Bosley v. Dorsey, </em>191 Md. at 236, 60 A.2d at 694 (1948), <em>Public Service Comm\u2019n v. Byron, </em>153 Md. 464, 471, 138 A. 404, 406 (1927) and <em>Gregg v. Laird, </em>121 Md. 1, 32, 87 A. 1111, 1114 (1913), the appellees assert that this Court has interpreted it to mean \u201chaving an interest adversely affected by the order [of the Commission].\u201d To be sure, the Court made the statements attributed to it in those cases; however, context is critical. In <em>Bosley, </em>for example, the issue had nothing to do with the standing of an association to seek judicial review of an order as to which it was dissatisfied. The question before the Court was whether the People\u2019s Counsel had standing to seek judicial review, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>his own right, under the applicable provisions of the Public Service Commission Law then in effect, <em>see </em>note 5, <em>supra, </em>where Maryland Code (1939) Article 23, \u00a7\u00a7 359 and 425, the applicable provisions, are set out,, that is, \u201cwhether the People\u2019s Counsel is a \u2018person in interest\u2019 within the contemplation of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 233, 60 A.2d at 693. The Court, having noted that \u201c[ojrdinarily an attorney is not a party to a suit in which he merely acts in a professional capacity in representing a litigant,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 234, 60 A.2d at 693, citing <em>Pressman v. Elgin, </em>187 Md. 446, 50 A.2d 560 (1947), set out People\u2019s Counsel\u2019s contention, that his right to seek judicial review was as the agent of the persons affected by the Commission\u2019s order, not that he was injuriously affected by that order. <em>Id. </em>It was in this context that the Court addressed the meaning of a person in interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">After tracing the development of the Office of People\u2019s Counsel, the Court addressed who was authorized to seek judicial review under \u00a7\u00a7 359 and 425:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-5\">\u201cIn <em>Gregg v. [Laird] Public Service Commission, </em>121 Md. 1, 32, 87 A. 1111, 1114 [ (1913) ], the first test of the Public Service Commission Law, the Court of Appeals held that, while the statute did not use the word \u2018appeal\u2019 in connection with the right to challenge an order of the Commission, the rights of any parties aggrieved by any action of the Commission were fully safeguarded by the provision that any corporation subject to the statute and \u2018any person in interest being dissatisfied with any order\u2019 may commence a suit against the Commission. Appeals from an order of the Commission may be taken either by a regulated public utility or by any individuals or corporations having an interest adversely affected by the order. <em>Public Service Commission v. Byron, </em>153 Md. 464, 471, 138 A. 404 [, 407 (1927) ].[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>The Court held that People\u2019s Counsel was a \u201cperson in interest\u201d under Art. 28, \u00a7\u00a7 359 and 415. <em>Id, </em>In addition to pointing out the duties of People\u2019s Counsel were the same as those of the former Assistant Attorney, <em>id. </em>at 236, 60 A.2d at 694, it reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\">\u201cIt is conceded that at no time from 1912 to 1922 did the Assistant General Counsel have the privilege to appeal from orders of the Commission. But complainant earnestly contended that the statute gives him the right to appeal by implication. He argued that the People\u2019s Counsel is not a subordinate of the General Counsel, as was the Assistant General Counsel, but is an appointee of the Governor and an agent for the customers of the utilities with no allegiance to the Commission. We cannot, however, brush aside the fact that the Legislature, in transferring the functions of Assistant General Counsel to People\u2019s Counsel, laid down for the People\u2019s Counsel the same duties which were performed by the Assistant General Counsel. Under the State Reorganization Act, which took effect January 1, 1923, the office of Assistant General Counsel was abolished, and the Governor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>of Maryland was authorized to appoint the People\u2019s Counsel. The Act provided that all the rights, powers and duties which had been conferred upon the Assistant General Counsel \u2018shall be transferred to and thereafter be exercised and performed by said people\u2019s counsel, who shall be the lawful successor of said Assistant General Counsel.\u2019 Laws of 1922, ch. 29, art. 13.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-4\">\u201cWhile the Public Service Commission Law makes it the duty of the People\u2019s Counsel to appear before the Commission on behalf of the public or in defense of the public interests (Laws of 1912, ch. 563, Laws of 1924, ch. 534, Laws of 1927, ch. 201, Code 1939, art. 23, sec. 353), it does not authorize him to prosecute appeals from orders of the Commission. It is also significant that Section 353, after providing that the services of the experts employed by the Commission and also its records and other facilities shall be availed of by the People\u2019s Counsel in the performance of his public duties, further provides that nothing contained therein shall prevent \u2018any party or interest\u2019 in any proceeding before the Commission from appearing in person or from being represented by counsel. As the People\u2019s Counsel is himself an attorney required to appear before the Commission, this provision strongly indicates that the Legislature did not consider him as a \u2018party or interest.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 236-37, 60 A.2d at 694. The Court was also persuaded by the fact that it was the Commission\u2019s practice to \u201ccall upon People\u2019s Counsel to support its orders.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 239, 60 A.2d at 695. Moreover, it rejected the argument that a court is \u201cat liberty to surmise a legislative intent contrary to the letter of the statute, or to indulge in the license of inserting or omitting words with the object of making the statute express an intent which is not evidenced in the original form.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 237, 60 A.2d at 694. <em>See also, Public Service Comm\u2019n of Maryland v. Maryland People\u2019s Counsel, </em>309 Md. 1, 8-9, 522 A.2d 369, 372-73 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">In neither <em>Gregg </em>nor <em>Byron </em>was the issue this case presents addressed. In <em>Byron, </em>there were two issues, whether a municipality benefitted by the Commission order was a neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>sary party to an action challenging the subject order and whether the Circuit Court for Baltimore City was the proper venue. <em>See </em>153 Md. at 469, 138 A. at 406. Among the various questions raised in <em>Gregg </em>was whether the \u201caction of the Commission amount[ed] to the granting of an execution before judgment [was] entered against the appellant.\u201d 121 Md. at 32, 87 A. at 1114. It was in the course of responding to that argument that the statements concerning the interest of the challenger of the Commission\u2019s order were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">It is significant, we believe, that as enacted and when <em>Bosley </em>was decided, the law addressed the standing issue solely by reference to those entities to whom the Public Service Commission Law applied or as to whom it had an effect; it did not define, and, indeed, there was no statute which delineated, the rights to judicial review of a party to proceedings before the Commission. Only in Maryland Code (1951) Art. 78 \u00a7 16(d)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> was the term \u201cparty\u201d used. That section, as did its predecessor, prescribed in very general terms the entities who could resort to the courts to challenge Commission orders. Section 74(a), former \u00a7 415(a), however, set out the standard necessary to be met to have standing to maintain such a challenge. Significantly, that section referred only to \u201cperson in interest,\u201d after, again cataloguing the entities to which the law applies. Only with the re-codification of the Public Service Commission law, <em>see </em>1955 Md. Laws, Chap. 441, did the concept of \u201cparty\u201d become a part of the section of the law delineating the test for standing. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1955, 1995 Repl.Vol.) Art. 78, \u00a7 83. And the re-codification provided for intervention in the Commission proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The appellees argue that \u201cin interest,\u201d as used in \u00a7 3-202, and as enacted in \u00a7 83, modifies both \u201cparty\u201d and \u201cperson\u201d and, so,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>\u201cthe requirements set forth in <em>Gregg, Byron </em>and <em>Bosley, </em>that only \u2018regulated\u2019 entities and other persons or parties \u2018in interest,\u2019 <em>i.e., </em>adversely affected, may obtain judicial review of a Commission order continue to control. Only associations (and other entities) \u2018subject to regulation\u2019 by the Commission and persons or parties \u2018in interest\u2019 have standing to appeal Commission decisions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">They maintain, in other words, that the only substantive change effected by the 1955 re-codification of the Public Service Commission Law was the consolidation into one provision of the several that theretofore had addressed the issue.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Support for the argument was found in a Staff Report to the Commission on Administrative Organization of the State, recommending no change to the existing judicial review requirements,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the \u201cReport of the Commission to Revise and Recodify the Laws Concerning the Public Service Commission,\u201d which, like the Staff Report, contained no explicit recommendation to change the judicial review requirements<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and the absence of an explanatory note to \u00a7 83 indicating such an intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">We are not persuaded. The argument flies in the face of the plain and unambiguous language of the statute. More<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>over, the drastic change in focus of the judicial review provision leads to the opposite conclusion. Before 1955, to seek judicial review, one need not have been a party to the Commission proceeding, just subject to the law or affected by the decision to be challenged. With the re-codification not only one interested or adversely affected by the decision was able to challenge the decision, but so, too, were those who were parties to the proceeding out of which the ruling to be challenged emanated. Thus, the clear language of the statute itself \u201cleads, [and must have led the General Assembly,] to the conclusion that some change in meaning must have been intended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">The appellees rely finally on Maryland cases indicating that an association is aggrieved and entitled to judicial review only when it has an interest or stake in the case separate and distinct from the interests of the members whose interests it represents, <em>see Citizens Planning &amp; Housing Ass\u2019n v. County Executive of Baltimore County, </em>273 Md. 333, 345, 329 A.2d 681, 687-88 (1974); <em>Bryniarski v.

Kloman, </em>191 Md. 626, 630, 62 A.2d 538, 539 (1948), whether or not the association has participated as a party in the agency proceedings. <em>See Medical Waste Assoc. v.

Although not relied on by the appellees, this principle also is embodied in the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act, <em>see </em>Maryland Code (1984, 1999 Repl. Vol.) \u00a7 10-222(a) of the State Government Article, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-5\">\u201c(a) <em>Review of final decision. </em>(1) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, a party who is aggrieved by the final decision in a contested case is entitled to judicial review of the decision as provided in this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-6\"><em>Sugarloaf, </em>344 Md. at 288, 686 A.2d at 614 (holding \u201cthat the statutory requirement that a party be \u2018aggrieved\u2019 mirrors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>general common law standing principles applicable to judicial review of administrative decisions\u201d), <em>citing Medical Waste Assocs. v.

The appellees\u2019 argument is once again belied by the plain language of the statute governing entitlement to judicial review. Additionally, the Public Service Commission and its proceedings have been exempted from the requirements of the APA, including the provision governing judicial review. This exclusion is indicative of an intention on the part of the Legislature to continue the applicability of the unique provisions to which the Public Service Commission is subject, separate from those applicable to agencies to which the APA applies. <em>See </em>State Government Article \u00a7 10-203(3)(vi).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Had the Legislature intended that the standard for judicial review of Public Service Commission proceedings be the same as that prescribed for contested cases under the APA, it is inconceivable that it would have excluded the Public Service Commission from the APA, or at least not from the coverage of \u00a7 10-206.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Moreover, as the appellant points out, to interpret,, \u00a7 3-202(a) as the appellees do would render the word, \u201cdissatisfied,\u201d which has been a part of the scheme since its inception, \u201cmeaningless, surplusage, superfluous, or nugatory.\u201d <em>GEICO, </em>332 Md. at 132, 630 A.2d at 717.

It long has been the law of Maryland and well settled, that statutes are to be read to give meaning to every word used and to do otherwise contravenes this cardinal rule of statutory construction. <em>GEICO, </em>332 Md. at 132, 630 A.2d at 717. <em>See Chase, supra, </em>360 Md. at 128, 756 A.2d at 991; <em>Blitz v.

Thus, a basic goal of the proposed recodification was to eliminate such repetition and reorganize the statute into a coherent form. <em>See </em>REPORT at 4.

George\u2019s Creek, </em>272 Md. 143, 155, 321 A.2d 748, 754-55 (1974), we identified the significance of changes made to a statute in a recodification:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">[A] change in phraseology of a statute in a codification will not as a general rule modify the law, unless the change is so radical or material that the intention of the Legislature to modify the law appears unmistakable from the language of the Code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">The comment to former \u00a7 83 of Article 78 of the revised code specifically stated that the section was intended to integrate the existing provisions for judicial review into one easily understandable section. <em>See </em>REPORT at 69; <em>see also Allers v. Tittsworth, </em>269 Md. 677, 683, 309 A.2d 476, 480 (1973) (explaining that it is a well-settled practice of this Court to refer to the Revisor\u2019s Notes when searching for the legislative intent). Thus, other than to alter the result in <em>Bosley </em>by expressly declaring the People\u2019s Counsel to be a \u2018party in interest,\u2019 the changes made to the statute during the 1955 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>recodification were not intended to enlarge the class of persons in interest beyond the scope of the class as interpreted in <em>Bosley, i.e., </em>any \u2018regulated public utility or ... any individuals or corporations having an interest adversely affected by the order.\u2019 <em>Bosley, </em>191 Md. at 236, 60 A.2d at 694. Depending upon the context, the words \u201cinclude\u201d or \u201cincluding\u201d when used in a statute may have the meaning of \u201cand\u201d or \u201cin addition to.\u201d <em>See Housing Authority of Baltimore City v. Bennett, </em>359 Md. 356, 372, 754 A.2d 367, 375 (2000). In other words, the only entity that enjoys statutory standing as a representative of persons in interest is the Office of People\u2019s Counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">The majority\u2019s basic assertion is that the plain meaning of the statute allows MAPSA standing to obtain judicial review in this case. Majority opinion at 204-05. The majority asserts that the term \u201cdissatisfied\u201d means something less than \u201can interest adversely affected\u201d and thus the term \u201cin interest,\u201d as interpreted by the <em>Bosley </em>Court, would render \u201cdissatisfied\u201d meaningless. Majority opinion at 207-13, 214-15. Because one of the principal guidelines of statutory interpretation is that \u201c[i]f reasonably possible, a statute is to be read so no word phrase, clause or sentence is rendered surplusage or meaningless,\u201d <em>Mazor v. Dep\u2019t of Correction, </em>279 Md. 355, 360-61, 369 A.2d 82, 86-87 (1977), the majority reasons that the statute should be read to confer standing based on less than an interest adversely affected.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although this interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>of the statute is facially appealing, it fails to persuade me of its correctness for three reasons: (1) the majority\u2019s construction would also create surplusage; (2) the interpretation of the <em>Bosley </em>Court is more consistent with the plain language of the statute; and (3) the Legislature relied on the interpretation given to the language in <em>Bosley </em>when it recodified the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">First, under the majority\u2019s construction of the language, the phrase \u201cin interest\u201d would become surplusage. If one assumes the term \u201cdissatisfied\u201d is the key term in determining what is required for judicial review, then \u201cin interest\u201d adds nothing to the statute. Under this construction, all that would be required to seek judicial review is that a party or a person is dissatisfied with an order or decision of the Commission. This construction cannot be correct. If it were, literally anyone would be empowered to seek judicial review of a Public Service Commission order. Hypothetically, a citizen of a service area not covered by the pertinent PSC order in the present case could challenge that order because he or she is dissatisfied with the fact that citizens in the erstwhile BGE service area will be paying less for electricity. Such an absurd consequence could not have been the intention of the Legislature. <em>See Mazor, </em>279 Md. at 361, 369 A.2d at 87 (\u201c[Wjherever possible an interpretation should be given to statutory language which will not lead to absurd consequences.\u201d). I am not persuaded the Legislature intended to set the standing bar so low. If we must choose between two interpretations of a statute, each of which would create sur-plusage, we should choose the interpretation which the Legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>lature previously has accepted and which does not create an absurd result.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">Second, the majority\u2019s interpretation of the statute fails because the definition of \u201cin interest\u201d articulated by the <em>Bosley </em>Court is more consistent with the plain language of the statute. The phrase \u201cparty in interest\u201d is often referred to as a \u201creal party in interest.\u201d The definition of \u201creal party in interest\u201d has been the issue of much debate. In more recent years, the trend has been to define a real party in interest as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag1\">A person entitled under the substantive law to enforce the right sued upon and who generally, but not necessarily, benefits from the actions final outcome.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">BLACKS LAW DICTIONARY 1143 (7th ed.1999); <em>see also South Down Liquors, Inc. v. Hayes, </em>323 Md. 4, 7-8, 590 A.2d 161, 162-63 (1991). This, however, could not be the definition the General Assembly intended when it enacted the statute at issue here. This section of the statute is supposed to establish who may enforce rights.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, an interpretation which incorporates the modern definition of \u201cparty of interest\u201d would render the statute meaningless. The General Assembly must have intended \u201cparty or person in interest\u201d to mean something other than the modern definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">At the time the statute was originally written and recodi-fied, a \u201creal party in interest\u201d was generally defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-7\">In statutes requiring suits to be brought in the name of the \u201creal party in interest,\u201d this term means the person who is actually and substantially interested in the subject-matter, as distinguished from one who has only a nominal, formal, or technical interest in it or connection with it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">BLACKS LAW DICTIONARY 1278 (4th ed.1951). This definition would seem to fit more appropriately into the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>legislative intent of the statute. If a party or person in interest has a substantial stake in the proceedings, it is reasonable to assume that in nearly every instance when that party or person would be dissatisfied with an order, the order also would adversely affect its interests. Thus, the plain meaning of the statute comports more closely with interpretation provided by the <em>Bosley </em>court than with the interpretation the majority asserts today.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Third, ev\u00e9n if the interpretation of the statute in <em>Bosley </em>was not what the earlier Legislature intended, the Legislature since has relied on that interpretation in recodifying the statute. \u201cThe General Assembly is presumed to be aware of this Court\u2019s interpretation of its enactments and, if such interpretation is not legislatively overturned, to have acquiesced in that interpretation.\u201d <em>Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. v. USF &amp; G, </em>314 Md. 131, 143, 550 A.2d 69, 75 (1988)(intemal quotation marks omitted)(quoting <em>Harden v. Mass Transit Admin., </em>277 Md. 399, 406, 354 A.2d 817, 824 (1976)). If the Legislature had intended a trade association to be able to seek judicial review, it could have removed the phrase \u201cin interest\u201d or specifically provided for such an eventuality.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The General Assembly did make one substantive change to our interpretation in <em>Bosley </em>by specifically allowing the People\u2019s Counsel to seek judicial review. Nevertheless, neither this change, nor any of the changes made subsequently, have removed the term \u201cin interest\u201d from the statute. Thus, the interpretation given to that phrase in <em>Bosley </em>has been accepted by the Legislature, and we can conclude that it is the interpretation that the General Assembly intended at recodifi-cation. A reviewing court cannot simply look at the plain language of the statute in a vacuum and ignore comments to a statute and decision interpreting very similar language. The legislative history and the interpretation given to the nearly identical language in <em>Bosley </em>allows us to ascertain the real intention of the Legislature. <em>See Mazor, </em>279 Md. at 360, 369 A.2d at 86 (\u201cThe cardinal rule of construction of a statute is to ascertain and carry out the real intention of the legislature.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>The decision in <em>Bosley v. Dorsey </em>is controlling in the instant case. Therefore, a party, other than the People\u2019s Counsel, in order to seek judicial review from an order of the Commission, still must have an interest adversely affected by the order. MAPSA does not generate or distribute electricity in Maryland, nor does it propose to do so after deregulation. Only its constituent members may be affected adversely by the Commission order. MAPSA is a trade association with no legally cognizable direct or substantial interest in the implementation of the order. It does not have an interest adversely affected by the order that we should recognize. Consequently, MAP-SA has no standing to seek judicial review in the present case. Its petition for judicial review was dismissed properly by the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Judges RODOWSKY and RAKER authorize me to state that they join in this dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b248-9\">. Section l-101(s) of the PUC defines a person as \"an individual, receiver, trustee, guardian, personal representative, fiduciary, or representative of any kind and any partnership, firm, association, corporation or entity.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b248-10\">.

Although not called upon to decide the issue presented by the present case, our predecessors seem to have assumed (albeit in dicta) that the standing to seek judicial review conferred by the various iterations of the pertinent statute included a requirement that one\u2019s interest be adversely affected and that one be aggrieved. <em>See Bosley v.
