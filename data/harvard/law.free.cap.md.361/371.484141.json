Colandrea, appellant, appealed from a decision of the Circuit Court for Howard County in favor of the Wilde Lake Community Association, Inc. (hereafter referred to as Association). Appellant alleges that the trial court erred in its ruling on the applicability of one of the Association covenants, and on its ruling that the enforcement of that covenant by the Association\u2019s Architectural Committee (hereafter referred to as Committee) was appropriate. We granted certiorari on our own motion prior to consideration by the Court of Special Appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Colandrea presents three issues, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">I. Whether the Circuit Court erred in rejecting Colan-drea\u2019s Fair Housing Act counterclaim where it was demonstrated at trial that: (1) the Village steadfastly refused to make any reasonable accommodation for the group home; (2) the Village\u2019s enforcement of the restrictive covenant evinced certain Architectural Committee members\u2019 discriminatory intent and retaliation against Colandrea for providing housing to the disabled; and (3) the Village\u2019s selective enforcement of the restrictive covenant has a disparate impact on the disabled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-9\">II. Whether the Circuit Court erred in granting a permanent injunction which will result in the permanent closure of housing for the disabled without requiring the Village to demonstrate the four prerequisites for such relief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-10\">III. Whether the Circuit Court erred in holding that the Architectural Committee\u2019s decision to close the senior-as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>sisted facility was reasonable, made in good faith, and was not whimsical, capricious or high-handed, where the decision was not supported by any competent evidence and in any event was a mere pretext for improper motives harbored by at least some of the Committee members.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">We answer each issue in the negative. The trial court neither erred nor abused its discretion. We shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">The Village of Wilde Lake is one of the unincorporated, planned, largely residential communities encompassed under the larger unincorporated, planned community of Columbia in Howard County. The various communities, including The Village of Wilde Lake are managed, <em>i.e., </em>governed, by community associations. These associations utilize covenants in the nature of contractual obligations that run with the land, in order to regulate the uses of the properties under their purview.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The parties do not contest the existence of the restriction at issue, or that it is a covenant running with the land. The covenant at issue provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-8\">Section 11.02. <em>No profession or home industry </em>shall be conducted in or on any part of a Lot or in any improvement thereon on the Property without the specific written approval of the Architectural Committee. The Architectural Committee, in its discretion, upon consideration of the circumstances in each case, and particularly the effect on surrounding property, may permit a Lot or any improvement thereon to be used in whole or in part for the conduct of a profession or home industry. No such profession or home industry shall be permitted, however, unless it is considered, by the Architectural Committee, to be compatible with a high quality residential neighborhood. The following ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>tivities, without limitation, may be permitted by the Architectural Committee in its discretion: music, art and dancing classes; day nurseries and schools; medical and dental offices; fraternal or social club meeting place; seamstress services.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Colandrea owns two abutting properties, with existing dwellings, located at 10433 and 10461 Waterfowl Terrace in the Village of Wilde Lake. The Committee approved 10461 Waterfowl Terrace, but not 10433 Waterfowl Terrace, when considering Colandrea\u2019s applications to use the properties as senior-assisted living facilities.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The decision of the Committee was, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">With respect to 10461 Waterfowl Terrace [Log No. 4432(b)], the Committee has approved the application, but only upon the following conditions, as previously explained at the February 27,1996 meeting:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">With respect to 10433 Waterfowl Terrace [Log No. 4432(a)], the Committee disapproved the application at the February 27, 1996 meeting. Based upon the Committee\u2019s review and consideration of all the documents submitted in regard to the application, as well as the testimony at the Architectural Committee meetings on February 13 and February 27, 1996, it is the Committee\u2019s judgement that the incremental increase in the amount of traffic, congestion, noise, trash and waste, as well as parking problems attributable to an additional facility at that location, have had and would continue to have a detrimental impact on the residential character of the neighborhood, particularly in view of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>the unique configuration of the street and the surrounding properties. [Alterations in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">After the decision of the Committee, appellant continued to operate and expressed his intention to continue to operate, a senior-assisted living facility at 10433 Waterfowl Terrace in spite of the Committee\u2019s disapproval of his application. In response, the Association instituted the present proceedings in the circuit court seeking injunctive relief, asking the court to enjoin the operation of the business at 10433 Waterfowl Terrace. That court, after discussing the evidence presented to it, granted injunctive relief. It discussed the evidence, in part, as follows and then granted an injunction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-6\">Michael Deets [a member and Chair of the Architectural Committee] ... stated that numerous concerns were expressed by residents at the February 13 meeting, including issues pertaining to excessive trash, noise, traffic flow problems, parking problems, and concerns about whether Mr. Colandrea or his mother actually resided on the property.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">Mr. Deets testified that similar concerns were advanced at the February 27 meeting. One resident spoke about the possibility of medical waste and the lack of information concerning the storage of such waste; while another commented upon the issue of adult diapers and potential sewer problems. The Committee voted to approve the application for 10461 ... and voted disapproval of the application for 10433....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\">The Plaintiff [the Association] produced as a witness, James Meale, a member of the Architectural Committee .... He described the February 13 meeting as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AaR\">\u201cThere were a number of residents there.... There was some emotion certainly. I would say in general I found it to be reasoned. There were the general com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>plaints against trash, traffic, congestion, lights shining at people\u2019s homes from the property. That the general feeling was that this was a residential neighborhood and that two (2) homes were disruptive to that neighborhood. The general comments, as I recall them, were that one (1) home would be alright, two (2) homes were too many.\u201d Mr. Meale described the February 27 meeting, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9h\">\u201cThere were more people at that meeting, maybe twenty-five (25). There was more discussion, much of it along the same lines. I believe it was at this second meeting that the issue of medical waste and whether there was medical waste being discarded at the homes, was brought up. I remember there were several medical people there, who basically led that discussion. There was the same discussion of traffic congestion, emergency vehicles, feeling of lack of maintenance of the property during snow storms was brought up. The ambulance had to pull in across the street at one point.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">Mr. Meale stated that he believed observations of his neighbors was \u201caccurate.\u201d He found their information credible. He stated that he voted for approval of the 10461 application and against the 10433 application. He explained his vote as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-6\">\u201cI am ... have been involved with working with elderly my whole career____ I came in really believing that I would vote for two applications. I came to believe listening to a testimony and also looking at the history of the application process, the fact that Mr. Colandrea did not want to even apply for an in-home business and then when he was ordered to do so, delayed it.... I came to the conclusion that two (2) houses really did overtax the neighborhood. That in my view this was one (1) business with two (2) locations. It\u2019s advertised that way, it\u2019s still advertised that way and that the house at 10461, the one I supported, has a long driveway, which if properly used, could handle a good deal of the traffic or the visitors and the staff. That the house on the corner [10433 Waterfowl Terrace], the one I voted against, seemed to me to be on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>the corner of a moderately busy street, in a particularly congested area and that the obstructions on the street and to the neighbors and to the community were serious at that point and there wasn\u2019t much way to correct them because the driveway was small, one car length, relatively narrow and that two (2) houses were overtaxing the infrastructure of the area of this particular neighborhood.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-4\">This Court finds the testimony of Mr. Meale regarding the Committee\u2019s reasons for denying the application of 10433 particularly persuasive. This Court finds that the decision of the Architectural Committee to disapprove the facility at 10433 was based upon concerns by the residents relating to trash, noise, parking, traffic, sewage and health. These concerns were heightened by a realization that Colan-drea had been insensitive to his neighbors in the past and a further realization that it was unlikely that he would attempt to minimize any negative impact that would result in the future from a business operation being conducted in a residential neighborhood. In sum, the decision of the Committee was a reasonable, good faith exercise of discretion, based upon legitimate concerns regarding the impact of the facility upon the surrounding neighborhood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-5\">\n<em>INJUNCTIVE RELIEF</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-6\">... An injunction will lie to enforce a restrictive covenant with respect to the use of the land conveyed, provided proper ground therefor exists.... Furthermore, the restrictive covenants provide for enforcement by means of injunc-tive relief....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-7\">The Defendant [Colandrea] contends that the Plaintiffs [Association] are not entitled to injunctive relief because the Plaintiff is unable to satisfy four criteria: (1) success on the merits, (2) the injury suffered if the injunction is granted is less than the harm that would result from its refusal; (3) irreparable injury, and (4) public interest. <em>Maryland Commission on Human Relations v. Downey [Communica</em>tions], 110 Md.App. 493[, 678 A.2d 55 (1996)]; <em>NCAA v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number><em>Johns Hopkins University, </em>301 Md. 574[, 483 A.2d 1272 (1984)]. Defendant\u2019s emphasis on these two cases is misplaced. They set forth a four pronged test for the issuance of an interlocutory injunction as distinguished from relief by means of a permanent injunction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-5\">This Court finds that injunctive relief is necessary in the instant case in order to maintain the integrity of a restrictive covenant, which was enforced by the Plaintiffs in a reasonable and fair manner. [Some citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The trial court then addressed the remaining counts of Colandrea\u2019s counterclaim. In respect to Colandrea\u2019s Fair Housing Act claims, the trial court noted that: \u201cJudge Sybert ruled [in case No. 93-CA-21562 (see n. 3 <em>supra)] </em>that the FHA did not relieve Colandrea from complying with the requirements of the covenants____Thus, [Colandrea\u2019s] claim under the FHA, is restricted, as a matter of law, to events that occurred after he submitted an application for approval to the Committee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">As to appellant\u2019s fair housing argument before this Court, he contends that \u201c(2) the [Association\u2019s] enforcement of the restrictive covenant evinced certain Committee members\u2019 discriminatory intent and retaliation against Colandrea for providing housing to the disabled.\u201d The trial judge in the present litigation addressed those concerns in his written memorandum finding that there was no \u201ctargeting.\u201d In respect to the events occurring since the 1995 case, the trial court, addressing the FHA allegations, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-10\">There is no evidence to establish that the Plaintiffs \u201ctargeted\u201d senior assisted living facilities in general, or Colandrea\u2019s facilities in particular, nor does the evidence suggest that the Plaintiffs have excluded such facilities from their community. To the contrary, the Plaintiffs approved Colan-drea\u2019s application at 10461 and three additional facilities. Three out of four such applications submitted by persons other than Colandrea were approved. [Colandrea\u2019s] contention that the Plaintiffs have imposed arbitrary spacing requirements is simply not supported by the evidence. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>fact, correspondence between the Committee and others indicate a contrary intent. (Plaintiffs exhibits 22, 23 and 24).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-5\">In a FHA claim based upon an alleged failure to make a reasonable accommodation, [Colandrea] bears the burden of proving that the requested accommodation is (1) reasonable and (2) necessary (3) to afford handicapped persons equal opportunity to use and enjoy housing. <em>Bryant Woods Inn, Inc. v. Howard County, </em>124 F.3d 597 (4th Cir.1997)----[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-7\">... Phyllis Madachy, Administrator of Howard County Office of Aging, testified that there are presently sixty-three senior assisted housing facilities in Howard County, thirty-two of which are located in Columbia---- The current vacancy rate is approximately twenty-five percent. This Court finds that the approval of a facility at 10433 Waterfowl Terrace is not necessary to afford disabled persons equal opportunities in housing, in ... light of the presence of a facility operated by Colandrea nearby, and the existence of adequate assisted living facilities located in Columbia and Howard County.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">All of the trial court\u2019s findings discussed, <em>supra, </em>are supported by evidence in the record. It is clear that the trial court also addressed appellant\u2019s FHA claims relating to the applicability of the covenant and its application in the instant case, and determined that the Act\u2019s provisions had not been violated by the Association\u2019s conduct following the circuit court\u2019s decision in the 1995 litigation. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">The trial court then addressed Colandrea\u2019s claim that the denial of approval for 10433 Waterfowl Terrace violated the public policy of the State. The court discussed, at some length, the testimony of Gene Heisler, Assistant Director of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>Licensing and Certification Administration, of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Mr. Heisler, testifying on behalf of appellant, stated that it was the State\u2019s policy to promote affordable and accessible housing for the elderly and to encourage \u201caging in place,\u201d described as being able to stay in the home they have chosen as their health deteriorates. He also testified as to the public policy of the State, saying in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-5\">Q. Could you describe ... the policies of the State of Maryland, with respect to assisted living homes for elderly persons with disabilities?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-6\">A. Well, the policies ... envisions a system of regulation where individuals are given their choice of where that they want to live. Also, the policies are to promote the affordable and accessible housing for the elderly. Also, to encourage the concept of aging in place.... Their [sic] some of the policies that we advocate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-7\">A. My opinion is, that the relief sought by the association is contrary to the policies of the State, in that prospective residents would be denied a choice of going into that home, so in affect, you would diminish the choices that people have for assisted living facilities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">On re-cross-examination, Mr. Heisler testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-9\">Q. But, it\u2019s not the public policy of the State of Maryland, that some specific address on a specific street should be an assisted living facility or not or how big it should be, is it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-10\">A. No, that\u2019s not the idea. The idea is that people have choices as to where they want to live.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">The court initially noted that this issue had already been resolved against Colandrea in the 1995 litigation when Judge Sybert had found the covenant at issue to be \u201cfacially neutral.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A_D\">Moreover, the trial court, in the instant case, noting the large number of senior assisted-living facilities in the area and the high vacancy rate for such units, independently found that \u201cthe Plaintiffs\u2019 conduct as it relates to the Colandrea applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>tion was reasonable and did not violate public policy of the State of Maryland.\u201d Additionally, in its fashioning of injunc-tive relief, the trial court created a remedy that fully comported with the State\u2019s \u201caging in place\u201d preferences, one of the State\u2019s \u201cpublic policy\u201d concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">The trial court concluded by finding that there had been no interference with appellant\u2019s contractual relationships; that there had been no evidence presented showing any adverse impact upon Colandrea\u2019s \u201ccontractual relations or how he was damaged as a result.\u201d The court then enjoined appellant from \u201cadmitting any new residents or filling any vacancies, as they may occur, at the senior assisted-living facility ... at 10433 Waterfowl Terrace.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">RESOLUTION</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">We shall address, as necessary, the issues resolved by the trial court. We shall note the standard of review applicable in this case, then discuss the legal nature of restrictive covenants in general, and the one at issue in particular. First, we address appellant\u2019s FHA issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">I. Fair Housing Act</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">In prior Case No. 93-CA-21562, <em>The Columbia Association, Inc. v. Richard C. Colandrea (Colandrea I), </em>the Circuit Court for Howard County rendered a finding against the appellant in the case at bar. In relevant part, that trial court stated in 1995:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-9\">The Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint seeks an injunction ordering the Defendant to cease and desist operation of the Senior Assisted Housing facilities at 10461 and 10433 Waterfowl Terrace [the identical properties at issue in the case <em>sub </em>judice]....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-10\">Mr. Colandrea operates the Bryant Woods Inn, Inc. out of two residences in the Village of Wilde Lake.... The Plaintiffs argue that the operation of these facilities violates express terms of the restrictive covenants governing the properties, and contend that the activities therefore require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>prior approval from the Wilde Lake Architectural Review Committee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-4\">... Moreover, the Defendant has filed a Counter Claim which alleges that the actions of the Plaintiff violate the provisions of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3601, <em>et seq.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\">Having ruled that the Defendant\u2019s activities are subject to regulation under the covenants, the Court shall next consider the Defendant\u2019s Counter Claim alleging violations of the Fair Housing Act____ Nevertheless, the Court is of the opinion that the Wilde Lake covenant at issue is facially neutral. The covenant is applicable to the conduct of <em>any </em>business activity, industry, or profession, not merely group homes.... That goal is, on its face, non-discriminatory, and it seems as though the Architectural Review Committee approval process is a legitimate way of addressing that concern.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">Colandrea appealed that decision to the Court of Special Appeals. Before that court heard the appeal, Colandrea dismissed it. Accordingly, the prior decision that the covenant was neutral on its face, and that on its face it was nondiscriminatory and that the Committee\u2019s approval process is a legitimate way of addressing the issue of discrimination under the FHA, was a final decision on the merits on those issues there presented and as to the FHA issues resolvable at that time. Accordingly, to the extent we address FHA related issues, if we do, it is limited to the Association\u2019s actions occurring after the final judgment in the prior case.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">Additionally, Colandrea, while <em>Colandrea I </em>was pending, filed a Complaint with the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) against the same appellees in the present case, and others, asserting violations of the Fair Housing Act. HUD investigated the claim and ultimately found that \u201creasonable cause does not exist to believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred. Accordingly, the above-referenced complaint is hereby dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>In <em>Janes v. State, </em>350 Md. 284, 711 A.2d 1319 (1998), we stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-4\">Collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, began life and retains life as a common law doctrine. A common and well-established articulation of the doctrine is that \u201c[w]hen an issue of fact or law is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, and the determination is essential to the judgment, the determination is conclusive in a subsequent action between the parties, whether on the same or a different claim.\u201d <em>Murray International v. Graham, </em>315 Md. 543, 547, 555 A.2d 502, 504 (1989), quoting from Restatement (Second) of Judgments, \u00a7 27 (1982). The functions of this doctrine, and the allied doctrine of <em>res judicata, </em>are to avoid the expense and vexation of multiple lawsuits, conserve judicial resources, and foster reliance on judicial action by minimizing the possibilities of inconsistent decisions. <em>Graham, supra, </em>315 Md. at 547, 555 A.2d at 504, citing <em>Montana v.

He invokes the equitable doctrine of comparative hardship to avoid this result. That doctrine has been explained with forceful clarity by Chief Judge Hammond for the Court in <em>Dundalk Holding Co. v. Easter, </em>215 Md. 549, 555-57, 137 A.2d 667, [670-71,] <em>cert. denied, </em>358 U.S. 821, [79 S.Ct. 34, 3 L.Ed.2d 62,] rehearing denied, 358 U.S. 901[, 79 S.Ct. 219, 3 L.Ed.2d 151] (1958), which was recently reaffirmed in <em>Grant v. Katson, </em>261 Md. 112, 274 A.2d 88 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>(1971). It [the doctrine of comparative hardship] basically provides that a court may decline to issue an injunction where the hardship and inconvenience which would result from the injunction is greatly disproportionate to the harm to be remedied. Innocent mistake on the part of the party to be enjoined is a factor to be considered in applying the doctrine. Overlooking the fact that the doctor, though a mediate purchaser whose deed only made reference to the restrictive covenants in his predecessor\u2019s deed, should have been aware of the limits on the use of his property, we do not think he can invoke the doctrine by characterizing the potential harm that might result to his neighbors\u2019 homes as comparatively negligible. Their interest in preserving the residential integrity of their community is simply not outweighed by his desire to move to another fashionable and exclusively residential area. With the facts before us in this case, had the trial judge declined to issue the injunction because of comparative hardship, we would not have hesitated to overrule him for a clear abuse of discretion. As he only went so far as to find that there had been a change in the neighborhood capable of vitiating the restrictive covenants, we base our reversal on this fact. On remand we direct that the appellees be enjoined from using their property in Chevy Chase Village for the practice of medicine unless they actually reside on the premises.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 320-21, 275 A.2d at 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">In <em>Grubb v.

Appellant appealed from a decree granting an injunction that enforced the restrictive covenant and raised the doctrine of comparative hardship. He contended that the injunction should not have been granted because, if he was prevented from practicing medicine in his home, he would suffer great hardship compared to only negligible harm caused to appellees. The Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\">We conclude that the doctrine has no application to the case at bar.

After being so informed, Dr. Liu spent an additional $9,000 on his office apparently without regard for the possible legal validity of appellees\u2019 position.

Ashe, </em>269 Md. 74, 304 A.2d 788 (1973):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>[O] ne owning a tract of land ... may validly impose upon the part granted restrictions upon the use thereof for the benefit of the part retained, and upon the part retained for the benefit of the part granted, or upon both for the benefit of both; that, where the covenants ... are not expressly for or on behalf of the grantor, his heirs and assigns, they are personal and will not run with the land, but that, if in such a case it appears that it was the intention of the grantors that the restrictions were part of a uniform general scheme or plan of development and use which should affect the land granted and the land retained alike, they may be enforced in equity____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 88, 304 A.2d at 796-97, quoting <em>McKenrick v. Savings Bank of Baltimore, </em>174 Md. 118, 128, 197 A. 580, 584-85 (1938). In <em>Jones v. Northwest Real Estate Company, </em>149 Md. 271, 280-81,131 A. 446, 450 (1925), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">[W]e are here dealing with an original grantor, who still owns a considerable part of the land, and the assignees of an original purchaser, and, as the deed specifically states that the covenants are to bind \u201cthe grantees, their heirs and assigns,\u201d there would seem to be no question, under the authorities, of the grantor\u2019s right to enforce the covenants ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">The Court of Special Appeals, similarly, stated in <em>Markey v. Wolf, </em>92 Md.App. 137, 149, 607 A.2d 82, 88 (1992), that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoO\">It is, therefore, necessary to construe the meaning of the pertinent provisions of the covenants in order to determine: (1) what, if any, conditions exist affecting the declarant\u2019s reservation of plan approval; and (2) whether the facts contained in the respective affidavits of appellants are sufficient to foreclose summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">For a more complete review of the Maryland law with respect to covenants and uniform plans of development, <em>see Steuart Transportation, </em>269 Md. 74, 304 A.2d 788, and cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">In <em>Steuart Transportation, </em>269 Md. at 88-91, 304 A.2d at 797-98, we said, quoting in part from <em>McKenrick v. Savings </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number><em>Bank of Baltimore, </em>174 Md. 118, 126, 197 A. 580, 584 (1938), \u201cthat recordation of a deed subjecting land to restrictions afforded constructive notice ... sufficient to charge such persons with liability in respect to the restrictive covenants.\u201d Quoting from <em>Turner v. Brocato, </em>206 Md. 336, 346, 111 A.2d 855, 861 (1955), we commented in <em>Steuart Transportation </em>that \u201c[t]he decisions of this Court have long recognized that equity, under appropriate facts, will enforce what variously has been called reciprocal negative easements, implied equitable reciprocal servitudes or merely equities attached to land.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91, 304 A.2d at 798.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">In <em>Belleview Construction Company v. Rugby Hall Community Association, </em>321 Md. 152, 156-58, 582 A.2d 493, 495-96 (1990), we said in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-6\">The original and extended covenants are covenants running with the land.... They are, by their terms, enforceable by the developer, the association, or any lot owner. The covenants were clearly established as part of a general plan of development for this community____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-7\">In construing covenants, \u201cit is a cardinal principle ... that the court should be governed by the intention of the parties as it appears or is implied from the instrument itself----\u201d This principle is consistent with the general law of contracts....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-10\">The courts seem to have generally recognized that there is no public policy against a fair and reasonable construction, in the light of surrounding circumstances, of restrictions designed, in general, to accomplish the same beneficial purposes as zoning. [Alteration in original.] [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">Because the facial validity of the covenant at issue in the case at bar is not challenged, except on Fair Housing Act grounds that have already been addressed, we do not have to construe the reasonableness of the restriction at issue in this case. We have noted the general standard for construing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>such covenants in our cases, most recently in <em>Belleview, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">The powers given to, and the functions of, the Committee in the case <em>sub judice, </em>appear to be as intended by the original declarants. Moreover, they appear to be reasonable. In any event, the covenant is not challenged on its face, except as we have heretofore stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">III. Decision of Committee</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">In respect to whether the Committee actions were reasonable, we said in one of our relatively early cases, <em>Kirkley v. Seipelt, </em>212 Md. 127, 133, 128 A.2d 430, 434 (1957), in reference to covenants regulating the manner and design of structures, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-7\">[t]he language used in the covenants ... makes plain the desire to regulate the construction of the dwellings in such a manner as to create an attractive and desirable neighbor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>hood. We. think the parties had a right voluntarily to make this kind of contract between themselves; and the covenant does not create any interference with the fee of the property that would require it to be stricken down as against public policy. It does not prevent the owner from conveying the property or impose any unlawful restraint of trade, but affects only its method of use. We hold that any refusal to approve the external design or location ... would have to be based upon a reason that bears some relation to the other buddings or the general plan of development; and this refusal would have to be a reasonable determination made in good faith, and not high-handed, whimsical or captious in manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">The trial judge in the instant case relied in large part on the testimony of James Meale, a member of the Committee, which we have repeated, <em>supra, </em>in addressing the issue of whether the Committee\u2019s decision was reasonable.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court credited Mr. Meale\u2019s testimony as we have indicated previously. The trial court noted that Mr. Meale had believed the observations of his neighbors; that Mr. Meale found their information credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">The trial court found Mr. Meale\u2019s testimony, that we have heretofore set out, to be \u201cparticularly persuasive,\u201d finding that the decision of the Committee had been based on trash, noise, parking, traffic, sewage and health concerns. It determined that \u201c[i]n sum, the decision of the Committee was a reasonable, good faith exercise of discretion, based upon legitimate concerns regarding the impact of the facility upon the surrounding neighborhood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">We perceive no error in the trial court\u2019s findings as to reasonableness and its issuance of an injunction to enforce the restrictive covenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b408-11\">. We initially note that had appellant\u2019s brief contained a complete history of the litigation in respect to his efforts to maintain such facilities in the Village of Wilde Lake, we may not have granted certiorari in this case. We were led by appellant's brief to surmise that appellant\u2019s concerns in respect to the Fair Housing Act and the rights of the disabled had not previously been addressed. As we shall point out, that is not precisely the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b409-9\">. The properties are, of course, also subject to local and state government land use restrictions, such as zoning, environmental regulations, \u2018 etc. Generally, when property is subject to both zoning and other governmental regulations, and conditions created by real property covenants, that property must satisfy the most restrictive of the regulations or conditions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b410-7\">. In a previous case in the circuit court involving the same properties, No. 93-CA-21562, the circuit court in 1995 found that under the covenant, the senior-assisted living facilities required Committee approval. Because appellant had not previously sought that approval, the trial court remanded the case in order to give appellant an opportunity to apply. Had approval been granted for both properties, the present issue, at least as presented in this case, would not have arisen. When, however, the Committee failed to approve of the use of 10433 Waterfowl Terrace, the present litigation commenced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b411-9\">. This was important, we presume, because appellant was seeking approval of a \"home\u201d industry or business.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b415-12\">. This case, initiated by Colandrea via his corporation, Bryant Woods Inn, Inc., challenged on Federal Housing Act grounds Howard County\u2019s refusal to approve zoning for one of the subject properties of the instant case so as to accommodate an assisted living facility for up to fifteen residents. Colandrea\u2019s claims were rejected by the United States District Court for Maryland and the United States Court of Appeals (4th Cir.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b425-10\">. The HUD proceeding does not, in and of itself, foreclose a claimant from seeking further relief in federal or state courts. We include the mention of it in our opinion to stress the fact that appellant has had multiple opportunities to litigate the issue of his rights under the Fair Housing Act vis-a-vis the covenant in question, and has not prevailed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b427-9\">. Accordingly, the essential requirements necessary for the issuance of an interlocutory injunction are not relevant. The requirements for the issuance of a permanent injunction to enforce contract, i.e., rights under covenants, are based primarily on contract law except as modified by our cases. One of the elements that may be considered is the doctrine of comparative hardship. An innocent mistake on the part of the party in breach of the covenant can be considered in that analysis. <em>See Urban Site, </em>340 Md. 223, 665 A.2d 1062, <em>Chevy Chase Village v. Jaggers, </em>261 Md. 309, 320, 275 A.2d 167, 173 (1971). No issue of innocent mistake exists in (he case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b433-8\">. <em>See Markey, 92 </em>Md.App. 137, 607 A.2d 82, a case in which the Court of Special Appeals gave an extensive history of this Court\u2019s treatment of similar restrictive covenants in Maryland, saying in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-9\">A later case, apparently recognizing the reasonableness modification of the strict construction rule, is the often-cited case of <em>Turner v. Brocato, </em>206 Md. 336, 111 A.2d 855 (1955). In that case, the Court said: \"This rule of construction [that doubt must be resolved in favor of the alienability of land] bows always to the more fundamental rule that wherever possible effect will be given to an ascertained intention of the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 352, 111 A.2d 855....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-10\">... [T]he Court of Appeals ... recognized the \"modern\u201d or \"reasonable\u201d rule once again in its most recent case of <em>Belleview Construction Co. v. Rugby Hall Community Association, </em>321 Md. 152, 582 A.2d 493 (1990). The Court stated that it was a \"cardinal principle\u201d that the intentions of the parties appearing from, <em>or implied by, </em>the instrument controls when covenants are construed and that that language should be considered along with the objects of the parties and the other \"circumstances and conditions affecting the parties and the property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 157, 582 A.2d 493. The Court further said that: \"The rule of strict construction should not be employed ... to defeat a restrictive covenant that is clear on its face, <em>or is clear when considered in light of the surrounding circumstances.\u201d Id. </em>at 158, 582 A.2d 493 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 154-56, 607 A.2d at 90-92 (alterations in original) (some citations omitted) (footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b434-8\">. Apparently, the proceedings before the Committee were not recorded. If they were, we were not directed to the location of any such records in the Extract or their place in the record.
