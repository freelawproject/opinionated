Prior to the trial, petitioner, through her attorney, filed a Motion to Request Mental Examination, which the trial court denied without a hearing. A jury, sitting in the Circuit Court for St. Mary\u2019s County, convicted her of second degree murder and use of a handgun in the commission of a felony. She was sentenced to consecutive terms of imprisonment of twenty and ten years respectively. Petitioner appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed her convictions in an unreported decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She presents two questions, for which we have granted a writ of certiorari:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-9\">1. Did the trial Court err in denying, without a hearing, a motion for examination of the defendant for competency to stand trial where the motion included a proffer sufficient to overcome the presumption of competency?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-10\">2. Did the Court of Special Appeals err in finding a failure to preserve the issue and that the trial judge was correct in applying the \u201cHillmon Doctrine\u201d?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>We answer the first question in the affirmative. We therefore reverse the decision of the Court of Special Appeals and remand the case to that court with instructions to vacate the judgment of the Circuit Court for St. Mary\u2019s County and remand the case to that court for a new trial. Because we answer petitioner\u2019s first question in the affirmative and accordingly vacate the decision of the trial court, it is unnecessary for us to address petitioner\u2019s remaining question.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">I. Facts and Background</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The facts of the underlying case are as bizarre as they are tragic. The basic facts are as follows: (1) on July 28, 1996, Dr. Stephen Olowu was found dead in petitioner\u2019s home on St. George\u2019s Island; (2) the cause of death was determined to be \u201ca single, close-range, through-and-through gunshot wound [to the] chest\u201d; and (3) the gun used in the shooting belonged to petitioner and, according to some accounts, was found lying in the victim\u2019s hand. During the trial, the defense counsel argued that Dr. Olowu must have accidently shot himself while cleaning the gun, while the State contended that petitioner murdered Dr. Olowu and staged the crime scene to look like an accident. The following is a summary of witness testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">On the morning of July 28, 1996, Mr. Joseph Vernon Moore<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> drove to petitioner\u2019s house on Thomas Road on St. George\u2019s Island in Piney Point, Maryland to collect payment for cutting grass. Petitioner came out the rear door of her home and talked with Joseph Moore. After a brief conversation, Joseph Moore left the premises and returned approximately fifteen to twenty minutes later with his brother, Mr. Charles R. Moore. Upon their return, petitioner again exited the house through the rear door and proceeded to write them a check for $100 for cutting the grass on her property. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>Petitioner then entered the house to get a second check to compensate the brothers for future lawn care.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Within one to two minutes, petitioner exited the house again and asked Joseph Moore to come into the house. He testified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">And she come out of the back, come to the back door, and she said, Vernon, come here a minute. I said what\u2019s the matter. Well, just come here. Well, the woman was just acting like she was going out of her mind, to my opinion. Just so upset, you know. And I still didn\u2019t know, I thought the dog had bit her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Joseph Moore continued to describe Ms. Roberts demeanor in his testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-8\">All I saw her do was crying____ She acted terrible, just like she\u2019s, like, you know, like the world blowed up. Very, very upset.... She said \u2014 one word she said, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u201d about twelve times I guess. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">Joseph Moore further testified that he followed petitioner into the house where he saw a man lying on the floor. As he approached the victim\u2019s body, he noticed a gun and two \u201cpiles\u201d of \u201cpurple, bluish\u201d blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">The Moore brothers then went across the street to Ms. Sumali Hinckley and Mr. Joseph W. Suchinsky\u2019s house to call for help. When they arrived, they explained to both Ms. Hinckley and Mr. Suchinsky that there was an emergency at petitioner\u2019s house. Mr. Suchinsky testified that the time was approximately 1:00 to 1:30 p.m. He then dialed 911, reported the shooting, and the four of them proceeded to petitioner\u2019s house. Mr. Suchinsky testified that upon arriving at petitioner\u2019s house \u201cyou could see that [petitioner] was emotionally disturbed\u201d and that petitioner \u201cwas leaning over, holding onto the railing of the porch, and her knees seemed to be buckling.\u201d Ms. Hinckley testified that when she arrived at petitioner\u2019s house, petitioner was sweaty and nervous. When petitioner asked for a glass of water, Ms. Hinckley entered petitioner\u2019s house to get a glass of water and saw the bloodied victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>laying on the floor. Immediately thereafter, Mr. Suchinsky entered the house to get petitioner a chair and also saw the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Ms. Hinckley and Mr. Suchinsky testified that they recognized the dead man laying on the floor of petitioner\u2019s house. Both of them recalled seeing petitioner and the victim at petitioner\u2019s house emptying groceries out of a red jeep the previous afternoon at approximately 4:00 p.m. Ms. Hinckley also remembered seeing the victim again on Sunday, July 28, 1996, at approximately 10:30-11:00 a.m. on petitioner\u2019s property-</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Shortly thereafter, three separate emergency response personnel arrived.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> All three testified that when they entered the home they found the bloodied victim laying on the floor. Collectively, they noted that: (1) there was a large quantity of blood on the floor and on the victim; (2) the blood had soaked through both the rug the victim was laying on and his shirt; (3) that the blood was a dark red and purplish color and was no longer flowing from the victim; (4) the victim\u2019s body was cold to the touch, although it was quite warm in the house; and, (5) there was a gun and gun cleaning rod laying in the vicinity of the victim. The general consensus among the three gentlemen was that the victim was already dead when they arrived on the scene.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Testimony concerning crime scene analysis was provided by John M. Roeder, a crime lab technician with the St. Mary\u2019s County Sheriffs Department, and Joseph Kopera, a firearms, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>tool mark, ballistics expert with the Maryland State Police Crime Lab. Mr. Roeder, who arrived on the scene between 3:00 and 3:30 p.m., testified that \u201c[t]he weapon was laying in the hand. It looked like it had either \u2014 it could have either fallen into the hand or it could have been placed in the hand.\u201d Mr. Roeder also testified that he conducted a gunshot residue test<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> on the victim that was inconclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The trial court accepted Mr. Kopera as an expert in the field of ballistics, firearm identification, and gunpowder residue. He described the weapon found in the victim\u2019s hand as a .380 caliber Beretta semiautomatic pistol.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He testified that the gun had no defects and that the spent bullet and cartridge casing found at the scene had been fired from the gun. When discussing the gun\u2019s safety features, he testified that the gun had a hammer block, and that it would not fire without a magazine inserted. Additionally, it would not discharge if dropped. He concluded that the gun had been perpendicular to the victim when it was fired. Mr. Kopera also examined the shirt taken from the victim. He detected gun powder residue on the shirt, however, he concluded that because the shirt did not have a hole in it, that the shirt must have been open at the time of shooting. Based on this powder residue, Mr. Kopera determined that the gun was six to twelve inches from the shirt when fired but that the actual distance from the victim would have depended on how the shirt was being worn. His rationale was supported by testimony from Dr. Margarita A. Korell, Assistant Medical Examiner from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Baltimore City. She testified that stippling<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> on the victim\u2019s skin indicated that the weapon was fired from a close range. Although she was unable to deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>mine the time of death, she thought that the victim only-survived \u201ca minute or so\u201d after the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Ms. Shari Jones testified that she had been involved in a relationship with the victim, Dr. Owolu, since 1993, that they lived in Connecticut together, and that he was the father of her child. Ms. Jones further testified that she had received a call from petitioner on June 26, 1996, in which the stated purpose of the call was to confirm the existence of Shari Jones. In that conversation, petitioner stated that \u201cshe was [Dr. Olowu\u2019s] wife and that she wasn\u2019t going to, you know, just go away. That she had rights, that she was going to exercise these rights.\u201d Ms. Jones also testified that the victim told her a few days prior to his death that he wanted to go to Maryland to tell petitioner that their relationship was \u201cover\u201d and \u201cthat she would have to leave him alone.\u201d He left telling Ms. Jones that he would be back on Saturday. Ms. Jones further testified that she was not aware that July 28 was petitioner\u2019s birthday or that the victim was going to St. George\u2019s Island with petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">II. The Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Petitioner was subsequently arrested and brought to trial for the murder of Dr. Owolu. On February 25, 1999, prior to the first motions hearing, petitioner\u2019s attorney filed a Motion to Request Mental Examination with the Circuit Court for St. Mary\u2019s County. The motion provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-8\">1. Ms. Roberts has had a long history [of] Psychiatric problems. Although there has been no history of any violence on her part, Ms. Roberts had been evaluated and treated by a number of physicians and found not to be competent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-9\">2. Counsel has been in communication with her physicians and her former attorney who reside and practice within the Washington [D.C.] area. The information counsel has received from the aforementioned individuals raises a question as to the issue of competency. Although counsel has had, and continues to have, difficulty communicating with Ms. Roberts, it appears that her memory for recent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>and remote events seems somewhat mixed. Her judgment and insight appear unclear at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-5\">3. Both of Ms. Roberts\u2019 physicians believe that she should be placed in a psychiatric hospital where she can receive adequate treatment. However, since she has been housed at the St. Mary\u2019s County Detention Center, Ms. Roberts, through counsel!,] asks this Court to issue an order that she be evaluated by a suitable licensed or certified examiner at the expense of the [S]tate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">4. Counsel believes that this examination is very necessary and should be done as soon as possible since the trial in this case is scheduled to begin on March 30, 1999. If the Court believes that a hearing on the issue of competency is necessary or if any additional information is required, counsel would be more than happy to provide same.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">The very next day, the State filed an answer to this motion. Relevant to the case at bar, it argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\">2. That the preliminary threshold of mental incompetency has not been properly raised by the Defendant in that the Defendant has not entered a plea of not criminally responsible by reason of insanity; neither has the Defendant provided or released to the State any medical and/or psychological or psychiatric reports in support of her allegations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-10\">3. That the Defendant has filed a Motion for Mental Examination at the expense of the State rather than a plea of not criminally responsible by reason of insanity and does not comply with the requirements of Rule 4-242.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-11\">4. That the Defendant\u2019s motion in essence seeks to improperly shift upon the Court the onus of raising <em>sua sponte </em>the issue of mental competency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-12\">5. That at no time has the Defendant been adjudicated not criminally responsible by reason of insanity by the State of Maryland or by any other jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-13\">6. That pursuant to Rule 4-242 a plea of not criminally responsible by reason of insanity shall be in writing and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>entered at the time the Defendant initially pleads unless good cause is shown. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The trial court denied the motion on the very next day without a hearing.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A trial on the merits commenced on March 30, 1999. On April 6, 1999, the jury found petitioner guilty of second degree murder and use of a handgun in the commission of a felony. She was sentenced to consecutive terms of imprisonment of twenty and ten years. Petitioner appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed her conviction in an unreported decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">The issue before us is whether the trial court erred in denying, without a hearing, a motion for examination of the defendant for competency to stand trial where the motion included a proffer sufficient to overcome the presumption of competency. We hold, under the circumstances of this case, that the trial court erred in not holding a hearing providing an opportunity for petitioner to present evidence in respect to whether to refer her for a competency evaluation to be used in making a competency determination. Once an accused alleges incompetency to stand trial, a trial court is required to make a determination as to the accused\u2019s competency to stand trial <em>based on the evidence on the record. </em>While we do not say that a formal hearing on the merits is required in all circumstances, especially where the allegation of incompetency is a bald one unsupported by any alleged facts that, if true, would demonstrate such incompetency, we do hold that when a defendant makes an allegation of incompetency to stand trial and there is <em>no evidence in the record </em>as to the defendant\u2019s incompetency to stand trial, as opposed to a proffer, an accused must be afforded an opportunity to present evidence upon which a valid determination can be made. Although the trial court had no automatic obligation to grant petitioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>motion and order a mental examination upon her proffer, once petitioner\u2019s competency to stand trial was called into question, as it was by this motion, the trial court then had an affirmative duty to determine petitioner\u2019s competency based on <em>evidence in the record. </em>Under the facts of this case, the trial court had no basis for finding that examination was or was not necessary because, at the time the issue of petitioner\u2019s competency was raised, there was <em>no evidence in the record </em>upon which a determination could be made. Therefore, under the circumstances in the case <em>sub judice, </em>a hearing to permit the introduction of evidence, or some other method of receiving evidence, was required in order for the trial court to make a valid determination of competency as required by Maryland Code (1982, 2000 Repl.Vol.), section 12-103 of the Health-General Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">a. Competency v. Not Criminally Responsible</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Before starting our analysis of the issue at hand, we feel that it is imperative that we once again clarify the distinction between competency to stand trial and responsibility for a criminal act. In its answer to the trial court, the State argued that the preliminary threshold of mental incompetency was not properly raised by petitioner because she had not entered a plea of not criminally responsible by reason of insanity. This is an improper interpretation of the law of Maryland. As the Court of Special Appeals has said \u201c[t]he sole issue of competency to stand trial is not raised by a plea and its determination is a matter resting exclusively in the court.\u201d <em>Strawderman v. State, </em>4 Md.App. 689, 695, 244 A.2d 888, 891 (1968) (footnote omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>155 Md. 733 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Maryland Code (1982, 2000 RepLVol.), section 12-101(e) of the Health-General Article states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-8\">\u201cIncompetent to stand trial\u201d means not able:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-9\">(1) To understand the nature or object of the proceeding;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-10\">or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-11\">(2) To assist in one\u2019s defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Contrastingly, Maryland Code (1982, 2000 RepLVol.), section 12-108(a) of the Health-General Article provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-5\">A defendant is not criminally responsible for criminal conduct if, at the time of that conduct, the defendant, because of a mental disorder or mental retardation, lacks substantial capacity:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">(1) To appreciate the criminality of that conduct; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">(2) To conform that conduct to the requirements of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Comparing these two statutes, it is evident that although they encompass similar topic areas, the Legislature intended them to be distinct and unique. \u201cPrior to the enactment of chapter 709, Laws of Maryland, 1967 ... the Maryland courts had applied the same standard for both insanity at the time of commission of the crime and \u2018insanity\u2019 at the time of trial....\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Raithel v. State, </em>280 Md. 291, 297-98, 372 A.2d 1069, 1073 (1977). <em>See </em>Md. Code (1957, 1964 Repl.Vol.), Art. 59 \u00a7 7. The enactment of 1967 Maryland Laws, Chapter 709 codified a distinction between the two standards. <em>See </em>Md. Code (1957, 1964 Repl.Vol., 1967 Cum.Supp.), Art. 59 \u00a7 7; <em>Raithel, </em>280 Md. at 297, 372 A.2d at 1073. It is evident that whether an accused enters a plea of not criminally responsible has no bearing on the accused\u2019s competency to stand trial. As we indicated in <em>Jolley v. State, </em>282 Md. 353, 373, 384 A.2d 91, 102 (1978), a case in which we recognized that an accused could be competent to stand trial as well as not criminally responsible, \u201cthe test for competency to stand trial and the test for criminal responsibility at the time of the commission of the offense [are] separate and distinct.\u201d Therefore, the State\u2019s assertion that the preliminary threshold of mental incompetency was not properly raised by petitioner because she had not entered a plea of not criminally responsible by reason of insanity was simply wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>b. Determination of Competency</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">The Supreme Court of the United States has said that \u201c[i]t is well established that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment [to the United States Constitution] prohibits the criminal prosecution of a defendant who is not competent to stand trial.\u201d <em>Medina v. California, </em>505 U.S. 437, 439, 112 S.Ct. 2572, 2574, 120 L.Ed.2d 353 (1992); <em>see Drope v. Missouri, </em>420 U.S. 162, 171, 95 S.Ct. 896, 903, 43 L.Ed.2d 103 (1975) (\u201cIt has long been accepted that a person whose mental condition is such that he lacks the capacity to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him, to consult with counsel, and to assist in preparing his defense may not be subjected to a trial.\u201d); <em>Pate v. Robinson, </em>383 U.S. 375, 378, 86 S.Ct. 836, 838, 15 L.Ed.2d 815 (1966) (\u201c[T]he conviction of an accused person while he is legally incompetent violates due process....\u201d); <em>Trimble v. State, </em>321 Md. 248, 254, 582 A.2d 794, 797 (1990) (\u201cIf a state fails to observe procedures adequate to protect a defendant\u2019s right not to be tried or convicted while incompetent, it denies him due process.\u201d); <em>see also Ware v. State, </em>360 Md. 650, 759 A.2d 764 (2000). In accordance with this principle, Maryland Code (1982, 2000 Repl. Vol.), section 12-103 of the Health-General Article <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">\u00a7 12-103. Court determination of competency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">(a) <em>Hearing. </em>\u2014 If, before or during a trial, the defendant in a criminal case appears to the court to be incompetent to stand trial or <em>the defendant alleges incompetence </em>to stand trial, the court shall determine, <em>on evidence </em>presented <em>on the record, </em>whether the defendant is incompetent to stand trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\">(b) <em>Court action if defendant competent. </em>\u2014 If, after receiving evidence, the court finds that the defendant is competent to stand trial, the trial shall begin as soon as practicable or, if already begun, shall continue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>(c) <em>Reconsideration of competency. </em>\u2014 At any time during the trial and before verdict, the court may reconsider the question of whether the defendant is incompetent to stand trial.

As we have stated numerous times:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">We have said that \u201c[t]he cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the legislature.\u201d <em>Oaks v. Connors, </em>339 Md. 24, 35, 660 A.2d 423, 429 (1995). Legislative intent must be sought first in the actual language of the statute. <em>Marriott Employees Fed. Credit Union v. Motor Vehicle Admin., </em>346 Md. 437, 444-45, 697 A.2d 455, 458 (1997); <em>Stanford v. Maryland Police Training &amp; Correctional Comm\u2019n, </em>346 Md. 374, 380, 697 A.2d 424, 427 (1997) (quoting <em>Tidewater v. Mayor of Havre de Grace, </em>337 Md. 338, 344, 653 A.2d 468, 472 (1995)); <em>Coburn v. Coburn, </em>342 Md. 244, 256, 674 A.2d 951, 957 (1996); <em>Romm v.

Weiss, </em>217 Md. 133, 136, 141 A.2d 734, 736 (1958). Where the statutory language is plain and free from ambiguity, and expresses a definite and simple meaning, courts normally do not look beyond the words of the statute to determine legislative intent. <em>Marriott Employees, </em>346 Md. at 445, 697 A.2d at 458; <em>Kaczorowski v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 515, 525 A.2d 628, 633 (1987); <em>Hunt v.

Supp.), Article 59, section 7 contained language similar to that used in section 12-103\u2019s present form. 1970 Maryland Laws, Chapter 407 \u00a7 2 moved Article 59, section 7 to Article 59, section 23 without substantive change. 1982 Maryland Laws, Chapter 21 recodi-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>fied Article 59, section 23 to Maryland Code (1982), section 12-102 of the Health-General Article. 1984 Maryland Laws, Chapter 501 created a new 12-102 entitled \u201cRules and regulations\u201d and moved the \u201cCourt determination of competency\u201d statute to its current location at section 12-103, without substantive change. In <em>Sangster v. State, </em>312 Md. 560, 568-69, 541 A.2d 637, 641 (1988), we discussed the successive legislative history of relevant portions of Title 12 in substantial detail:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\">Present H-G \u00a7 12-103 is part of a revision of Title 12 of the Health General Article resulting from the work of The Governor\u2019s Task Force to Review the Defense of Insanity.

The Revisor\u2019s Note to Code (1982), H-G \u00a7 12-102 states that \u201c[this section is new language derived without substantive change from the first, eighth, and ninth sentences of former Article 59, \u00a7 23.]\u201d That note also advises that \u201c[i]n subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the former references to \u2018testimony\u2019 are deleted as unnecessary in light of the broad references to \u2018evidence\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-7\">Former Art. 59, \u00a7 23 in relevant part provided:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>Whenever prior to or during the trial, any person charged with the commission of any crime shall appear to the court, or be alleged to be incompetent to stand trial, by the defendant himself, the court shall determine upon testimony and evidence presented on the record whether such person is [incompetent]....

[Md.Code (1957, 1979 Repl.Vol.), Art. 59, \u00a7 23.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">The above-quoted language was enacted by Ch. 709 of the Acts of 1967 which substantially revised provisions of Art. 59 when it was entitled \u201cLunatics and Insane.\u201d [Alterations in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">It is evident through an analysis of the evolution of section 12-103, that the Legislature, in order to protect the accused\u2019s due process rights, intended to mandate precise actions to be taken by a trial court when an accused\u2019s competency to stand trial was questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">We now turn our attention to the precise wording of section 12-103. The plain meaning of this statutory provision is evident from its unambiguous wording. First and foremost, section 12-103 is entitled \u201cCourt determination of competency\u201d and subsection 12-103(a) is entitled \u201cHearing.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> From the titles alone it is strikingly obvious that the Legislature envisioned a need for a Court determination of competency and required that, in Maryland, such a determination general<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>ly can be accomplished through a hearing on the issue of competency.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The language of 12-103(a) mandates actions to be undertaken by a trial court, if an accused\u2019s competency is properly called into question. These actions can be broken down into three distinct and simple steps: (1) First, a determination of competency may be made at any time before or during a trial; (2) Second, such a determination must be made if the defendant in a criminal case appears to be incompetent to stand trial or the defendant alleges incompetence to stand trial; and (3) Finally, the court must make its determination on the evidence presented on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The first step specifies the time frame within which the question of an accused\u2019s competency must be made. Quite simply, the issue can' be presented at any time before or during a trial. Once an initial determination of competency has been made, a reconsideration of the accused\u2019s competency may be made and is controlled by the discretionary language of section 12-103(e). <em>See Stewart v. State, </em>65 Md.App. 372, 377, 500 A.2d 676, 678 (1985) (\u201cThe language [of 12-103(c) ] is clear that a reconsideration of competency is discretionary. There are no requirements for an <em>additional </em>hearing to make findings of fact and conclusions of law.\u201d) (emphasis added), <em>cert. denied, </em>305 Md. 599, 505 A.2d 856 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">The second step is more complicated. First, it provides guidance as to when a need for such a determination is triggered. We interpreted this provision in <em>Thanos v. State, </em>330 Md. 77, 85, 622 A.2d 727, 730 (1993) when we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">As the statute makes plain, a trial court\u2019s duty to determine the competency of the accused is triggered in one of three ways: (1) upon motion of the accused; (2) upon motion of the defense counsel; or (3) upon a <em>sua sponte </em>determination by the court that the defendant may not be competent to stand trial. <em>See Johnson v. State, </em>67 Md.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>347, 507 A.2d 1134 (1986).[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The second step also creates a mandate from the Legislature to the trial judge. If the court\u2019s duty to determine the competency of the accused to stand trial has been triggered, \u201cthe court <em>shall determine </em>... whether the defendant is incompetent to stand trial.\u201d Section 12-103(a) (emphasis added). We, as well as the Court of Special Appeals, have had many opportunities to consider the mandatory language of Section 12-103(a). <em>See Trimble, </em>321 Md. at 255, 582 A.2d at 797-98 (the mandatory nature of section 12-103(a) requires that, once a defendant\u2019s competency is in question, a trial court shall hear evidence regarding defendant\u2019s competency in order to determine whether defendant is competent to stand trial); <em>Morrow v. State, </em>293 Md. 247, 256, 443 A.2d 108, 113 (1982) (\u201cIn the instant case the trial court completely complied with the requirements of Article 59, \u00a7 23 and the mandates of due process. When Morrow alleged he was incompetent the court conducted a pretrial hearing on the matter, where expert testimony was heard.... \u201d); <em>Johnson v. State, </em>67 Md.App. 347, 358-59, 507 A.2d 1134, 1140 (stating that it is a mandatory duty of the trial court to determine the competency of an accused to stand trial when it is triggered), <em>cert. denied, </em>307 Md. 260, 513 A.2d 314, <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 993, 107 S.Ct. 594, 93 L.Ed.2d 595 (1986); <em>Stewart, </em>65 Md.App. at 376-77, 500 A.2d at 678 (the initial determination of competency when the issue is properly raised is mandatory in nature), <em>cert. denied, </em>305 Md. 599, 505 A.2d 856 (1986); <em>Hill v. State, </em>35 Md.App. 98, 102-03, 369 A.2d 98, 101 (1977) (It is \u201cplain that \u00a7 23 mandated special procedural action and necessary substantive determination by the trial court when an accused is \u2018alleged to be incompetent to stand trial.\u2019 \u201d). The mandatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>language of 12-103(a) indicates that the Legislature intended for every accused, whose competency was called into question, to have at least one guaranteed review of his or her competency status.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The third and final step requires that the determination of competency be done \u201con evidence presented on the record.\u201d As we have said, \u201cthe determination [of competency] is not one to be made lightly but upon testimony and evidence on the record.\u201d <em>Treece v. State, </em>313 Md. 665, 682, 547 A.2d 1054, 1063 (1988); <em>see Sangster, </em>312 Md. at 573, 541 A.2d at 643 (holding that a report ordered by the trial court is evidence on the record); <em>Jolley, </em>282 Md. at 365, 384 A.2d at 98 (\u201cIt was the duty of the trial court to \u2018determine upon testimony and evidence presented on the record\u2019 whether Jolley was competent to stand trial in the contemplation of Art. 59, \u00a7 23.\u201d). We view the Legislature\u2019s inclusion of such language as a clear indication that it intended the determination of competency to be essential in preserving an accused\u2019s due process rights and that such rights could only be preserved if the determination was made on evidence presented on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">This contention is further supported by a review of section 12-103(b). Section 12-103(b) dictates a court\u2019s action after a finding of competency. Subsection (b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\">If, <em>after receiving evidence, </em>the court finds that the defendant is competent to stand trial, the trial shall begin as soon as practicable or, if already begun, shall continue. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">The express wording of subsection (b) clearly states that a finding of competency under the competency determination mandated by subsection (a) can only exist \u201cafter receiving evidence.\u201d Thus, a determination of competency made without an opportunity for evidence to be presented would be invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">We and the Court of Special Appeals have further recognized that the competency determination is to be held to a standard of beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Treece, </em>313 Md. at 682-83, 547 A.2d at 1063 (\u201c[T]he determination that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>defendant is competent must be beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d); <em>Jolley, </em>282 Md. at 365, 384 A.2d at 98 (\u201cA determination that an accused is competent to stand trial must be found beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d); <em>Raithel, </em>280 Md. at 297, 372 A.2d at 1072 (\u201c[T]he issue of competency is to be determined by the court, which must find beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused is competent to stand trial.\u201d); <em>Langworthy v.

State, </em>35 Md.App. 98, 102, 369 A.2d 98, 100-01 (1977); <em>Colbert v. State, </em>18 Md.App. 632, 641, 308 A.2d 726, 731, <em>cert. denied, </em>269 Md. 756 (1973); <em>Rozzell v. State, </em>5 Md.App. 167, 175, 245 A.2d 917, 922 (1968), <em>cert. denied, </em>252 Md. 732 (1969); <em>Strawderman v.

It is clear from the language of section 12-103, in its entirety, as well as its legislative history, and our prior interpretation of the competency statute, that, once the issue of competency has been triggered, a trial court has an affirmative duty to determine an accused\u2019s competency on evidence presented on the record. Under circumstances, such as the facts of the case at bar, where there is <em>no evidence </em>on the record concerning petitioner\u2019s competency, a hearing to present evidence is appropriate to put evidence on the record from which a valid determination of competency can be made. As we said in <em>Jones v. State, 280 </em>Md. 282, 287, 372 A.2d 1064, 1067 (1977):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\">Although the statute[<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>] does not provide that a special or formal hearing be held to determine the competency of the accused to stand trial, it is unmistakably clear in its com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>mand that the determination be made upon testimony and evidence presented on the record. <em>Hill v. State, </em>35 Md.App. 98, 369 A.2d 98, 102 (1977); <em>Colbert v. State, </em>18 Md.App. 632, 640-41, 308 A.2d 726, <em>cert. denied, </em>269 Md. 756 (1973). The statute employs the word \u201cshall\u201d in regard to this requirement, and there is nothing in the context in which it is used to negate the mandatory intent which the word \u201cshall\u201d ordinarily imports. <em>See Blumenthal v. Clerk of Cir. Ct., </em>278 Md. 398, 408-09, 365 A.2d 279 (1976); <em>Bright v. Unsat. C. &amp; J. Fund Bd., </em>275 Md. 165, 169-70, 338 A.2d 248 (1975); <em>Maryland St. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Frank, </em>272 Md. 528, 533, 325 A.2d 718 (1974).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Additionally, in <em>Colbert, </em>18 Md.App. at 640-41, 308 A.2d at 731-32, <em>cert. denied, </em>269 Md. 756 (1973) the Court of Special Appeals stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-8\">The statute requires that the determination be made \u201cupon testimony and evidence presented on the record\u201d, but it does not require that such testimony and evidence be presented in a separate hearing, as appellant contends. We said in <em>Strawderman, </em>at page 695 [244 A.2d 888], \u201cOf course, in a jury trial, evidence with regard to it should be received out of the presence of the jury\u201d, but we did not say, nor do we now say, that a judge with no jury present is required to use any magic words to designate as a separate hearing the presentation to him of testimony and evidence for his determination of the competency of the accused to stand trial. It is sufficient if the testimony and evidence are on the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-9\">The clear difference in procedure is this: Although a defendant is presumed competent until the issue is raised, that presumption is overcome when it \u201cshall appear to the court or be alleged\u201d that he is incompetent to stand trial. The allegation may be made by the defendant himself, or by his counsel. When the original presumption is thus overcome there remains no presumption one way or the other. The issue raised must be determined by the court, which must find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is competent to stand trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>In the case <em>sub judice, </em>defense counsel triggered the requirement for a competency determination when he filed the Motion to Request Mental Examination. First, the motion was filed within the time limitations of section 12-103(a), in that it was filed before the trial. Second, the motion itself called petitioner\u2019s competency into question and overcame the presumption that petitioner was competent to stand trial.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Finally, the trial court\u2019s determination of competency was not made on evidence on the record, nor was any opportunity afforded for the presentation of such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">In the case at bar, the trial court had no evidence upon which a determination of competency could be made beyond a reasonable doubt, nor did it afford the parties an opportunity to present evidence. There is no indication that the trial court had <em>any </em>evidence on the record at the time the issue of petitioner\u2019s competency was raised, upon which a determination of competency could be made. The issue of competency was triggered and the trial court failed to make a determination of competency based on evidence on the record as required by section 12~103(a). While the trial court may not have had a duty to grant petitioner\u2019s motion to request a mental examination or to actually order a mental examination,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the motion triggered the need for the trial court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>afford an opportunity for the presentation of evidence upon which its subsequent decision would be based. The trial court\u2019s failure to render a competency determination based on evidence on the record constitutes reversible error. As we said in <em>Jones, </em>280 Md. at 289, 372 A.2d at 1068:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-5\">Failure to determine competency \u201cupon testimony and evidence presented on the record,\u201d as required by the statute, nullifies not only the determination itself, but also the trial and resulting conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">We hold that once the issue of competency is triggered, a trial court is required, under section 12-103, to make a determination <em>on evidence in the record, </em>whether the defendant is incompetent to stand trial. Although the statute does not require that a formal hearing on the merits of competency always be held, it does require that the determination be done based on evidence in the record. Thus, when a defendant appears to be incompetent to stand trial or the defendant alleges incompetence to stand trial, and there is <em>no evidence in the record </em>as to the defendant\u2019s competency to stand trial, there needs to be an opportunity to present evidence upon which a valid determination can be made. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>hearing for that purpose would ordinarily suffice. If an opportunity to be heard is afforded and no evidence is presented, the presumption of competency remains. Under the facts of this case, the trial court had no basis for finding that an examination was or was not necessary because, at the time the issue of petitioner\u2019s competency was raised, there was <em>no evidence in the record </em>upon which a determination could be made, nor was any opportunity afforded for the presentation of such evidence. Therefore, under the facts of the case <em>sub judice, </em>a hearing to introduce evidence would have been appropriate in order to enter evidence in the record upon which a determination of competency or the need for an evaluation could have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO VACATE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ST.

As is evident from both the wording of, and our prior interpretation of section 12-103(a), a defendant merely needs to appear incompetent or allege incompetence in order to trigger the need for a competency determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b399-6\">. In <em>Jones, </em>280 Md. 282, 372 A.2d 1064, we were interpreting Maryland Code (1957, 1972 Repl.Vol.) Article 59, section 23, which as we have discussed, <em>supra, </em>was a precursor to section 12-103.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b401-6\">. Petitioner\u2019s competency was questioned throughout the motion: \u201cMs. Roberts had been evaluated and treated by a number of physicians and found not to be compelcnt.... The information counsel has received ... raises a question as to the issue of competency.... If the Court believes that a hearing on the issue of competency is necessary or if any additional information is required, counsel would be more than happy to provide same.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b401-7\">. In Maryland, the law concerning the ordering of a mental examination is contained in Maryland Code (1984, 2000 Repl.Vol.), section 12-104 of the Health General Article, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-8\">\u00a7 12-104. Examination as to competence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-9\">(a) <em>Examination authorized. </em>\u2014 (1) For good cause and after giving the defendant an opportunity to be heard, the court may order the Department to examine the defendant to determine whether the defendant is incompetent to stand trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ac-dedup-0\">(2) The court shall set and may change the conditions under which the examination is to be made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3J\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>Unlike section 12-103, the language of section 12-104 is discretionary. The trial court may authorize a mental examination to determine competency, but it is not mandated by the Legislature to do so. As we said in <em>Sangster, </em>312 Md. at 571, 541 A.2d at 642, the Legislature, by deleting certain language from the original bill,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax6\">intended to eliminate any implication that the receipt of a report from the Department was a condition precedent or jurisdictional prerequisite for the circuit court to proceed to trial on the merits.... Thus today, under H-G \u00a7 12-103(a), if the defendant alleges incompetency, the court \"shall\u201d determine the issue, but under H-G \u00a7 12-104 the court \"may\u201d order an examination and report.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">This section expressly requires that a defendant must have an \"opportunity to be heard\u201d if a trial court exercises its discretion to direct a mental evaluation. The opportunity to be heard mentioned in section 12-104 is the hearing provided for in section 12-103. For a more complete discussion of sections 12-103 and 12-104, and their relationship wit h federal statutes, <em>see generally, Sangster, </em>312 Md. 560, 541 A.2d 637.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
