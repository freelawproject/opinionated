A motion for new trial was overruled, and notice of appeal given. Subsequent thereto and after the adjournment of court, relator applied to Judge Peck for a writ of habeas corpus, who set the application down for hearing as to whether or not he would grant the writ. Upon the hearing he refused to grant the writ. Upon such state of facts no appeal lies to this court. (Magee v. State, 44 Texas Crim. Rep., 384.)
