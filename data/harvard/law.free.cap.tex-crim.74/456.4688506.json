In the judgment pronouncing sentence the court fixed a definite term of five years as found by the jury. This will be reformed under the indeterminate sentence law so as to fix the punishment at not less than two nor more than five years. With this correction and reforming of judgment and sentence, this judgment will be affirmed.
