In this there was no error as our Criminal Procedure provides that the court may permit evidence to be introduced at any time prior to the completion of the argument if he deems it necessary to the due administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">The charge fairly submits the issues and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
