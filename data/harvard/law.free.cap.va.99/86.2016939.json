From this decree the case is before us on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"A-U\">Had the paper that appellants seek to enjoin and restrain the clerk of the County Court of Bath county from recording and indexing in his office been actually recorded and indexed therein, they could not maintain their suit in a court of equity to remove it as a cloud upon their title to the land in question without averring complete title to the land, and possession of it, and even where such a bill avers title and possession of the land in plaintiff, if, upon the hearing of the cause the evidence failed to show his possession the bill would be dismissed for the want of jurisdiction in a court of equity. This is well settled by the decisions of this court. <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>28 Gratt. 791; <em>Stearns </em>v. <em>Harman, </em>80 Va. 48; <em>Otey </em>v. <em>Stuart, </em>91 Va. 714; <em>Kane et als. </em>v. <em>Va. Coal &amp; Iron Co., </em>97 Va. 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">In this case the bill not only fails to set out what interest the appellants claim to have in the lands, but it contains no averment of the possession of the land in them. On the contrary, an exhibit, filed with the bill and made a part thereof, shows that the possession of the land is in the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">We are of opinion, therefore, that the case is controlled by the decisions of this court cited, and that the decree appealed from should he affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
