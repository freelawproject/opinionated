Statute oe <em>Limitations\u2014Action by Surety Against Co-Surety for </em>Contribution.\u2014The right of action of a surety who calls upon a co-surety for contribution is based upon the implied promise growing out of the equitable relations which the sureties bear to each other, and not upon the written contract by which they became sureties.

That equity springs up at the time of entering into that relation, and is fully consummated when the surety is compelled to pay the debt. <em>Wayland </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>4 Gratt. 267; 1 White <em>&amp; </em>Tudor\u2019s Lead.
