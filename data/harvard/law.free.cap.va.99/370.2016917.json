If they or their predecessors in office had failed or refused to provide a clerk\u2019s office at all, or had provided a clerk\u2019s office which was manifestly not intended to be a fire-proof clerk\u2019s office, we are of opinion that the duty enjoined by the Code might be enforced by mandamus. But such is not this case. A clerk\u2019s office has been provided, which, in the opinion of the board of supervisors, was intended by their predecessors in office who erected it to be, and was, in the judgment of the board, a compliance with the provisions of the Code requiring a fire-proof clerk\u2019s office to be erected.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">One of the marked characteristics of a proceeding by mandamus is that if the functionary whose conduct is complained of is by law to exercise any discretion, that discretion will not be controlled by a writ of mandamus; for that would be to transfer the discretion which the law commits to the functionary to the court which undertakes to award the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">High on Extra. Remedies, section 24, states the rules as follows: \u201cWherever such officers or bodies are vested with discretionary power as to the performance of any duty required at their hands, or where, in reaching a given result of official action, they are necessarily obliged to use some degree of judgment and discretion, while mandamus will lie to set them in. motion and to compel action upon the matters in controversy, it will in no manner interfere with the exercise of such discretion, nor control or dictate the judgment or decision which shall be reached. But if, upon the other hand, a clear and specific duty is positively required by law of any officer, and the duty is of a ministerial nature, involving no element of discretion, and mi exercise of official judgment, mandamus is the appropriate remedy.' * * *\u201d <em>Thurston </em>v. <em>Hudgins, </em>93 Va. 780; 4 Minor\u2019s Inst. (4th ed.), 398, 401; 2 Spelling on Extra. Rel., sec. 1384.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>It cannot be said that the erection of a fire-proof clerk\u2019s office is an act so clear and specific that no element of discretion is left in its performance. People may and do differ as to what constitutes a fire-proof building.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">This is shown by the record in this case. It would seem from the petition that the applicants for the writ of mandamus are of the opinion that, in order to have a fire-proof clerk\u2019s office, a new building must be erected, and that is the prayer of their petition. One of their witnesses, an architect, testifies that the present building is not, but can be made, fire-proof. The respondents and the learned circuit judge who tried this case are of opinion that the present building is fire-proof, within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">If this court was of the opinion that the clerk\u2019s office in question was not fire-proof, and awarded the writ commanding the board of supervisors to provide a fire-proof clerk\u2019s office, how are they to determine whether they should erect a new building or repair or remodel the old? If the court goes into details and directs them what to do, it usurps the discretion vested in them. If the court does not do this, how are they to know what will satisfy the requirement of the statute in the opinion of the court? The county authorities having exercised their discretion, and provided a clerk\u2019s office intended to be fire-proof, the Circuit Court did not err in refusing the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">The preservation of the records of the various courts of the Commonwealth- is of the highest importance, and the duty of providing fire-proof clerk\u2019s offices to prevent their destruction by fire should be faithfully performed. The boards upon whom this duty is imposed are responsible to the people who elected them, and if they do not properly exercise the discretion vested in them, the people have the remedy in their own hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">The judgment complained of must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
