On the 2d <em>May </em>following, the plaintiff obtained a rule to shew cause why an execution should not issue; and on the next day, the 3d <em>May, </em>tendered a deed from <em>Wolfersberger </em>and wife, dated 24th <em>Novem</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>ber, 1815, for the land stated in the award, to <em>Steigleman, </em>which he refused to accept. The Court below permitted Execution to issue, \u201c because the condition of the award in favour of the plaintiff, is substantially complied with.\u201d The proceedings being suspended by a former writ of error, <em>Steigleman </em>died, and his administrators were substituted upon a <em>scire </em>facias, on which judgment was obtained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-4\">The following errors were now assigned,\u2014.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-5\">1.

The arbitrators exceeded the powers vested in them by the submission, in making an award concerning land. They had nothing to do with that subject; they could only award what was due to the plaintiff. The act of assembly gives no power to make a conditional award; it contemplates only such a one as can be carried into effect by an execution. Here the condition imposed, of tendering a deed, shews, that the plaintiff had no right at the institution of his suit to recover; not having tendered the deed prior to that time. The arbitrators could not cure this inherent defect in the plaintiffs claim, by directing a tender after judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-13\">1. The award extended to the person of a stranger to the submission, <em>viz. </em>the wife of <em>Wolfersberger, </em>the plaintiff. It is a general rule, that the award must not extend to any one who is a stranger to the submission. <em>Kyd on </em>Awards, 103. Thus it has been held, that where the submission is between two, and it is ordered by the award, that one of them shall convey certain land to the other and his wife, this is void as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>to the wife, because she is a stranger to the submission. Ibid. cites <em>Samon\u2019s case. 5 Co. 77, b. 78. </em>1 <em>Rol. Arb. b. 7. </em>There is no difference in principle between awarding, that a deed should be made <em>to </em>a wife and <em>from </em>a wife. In <em>Bedam </em>v<em>. </em>Clerkson,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> an award to pay money to a stranger was held to be bad, unless it was for the benefit of one of the parties, and in 1 <em>Ld. Raym. </em>246, that unless an award appears on its face to be on matter submitted, it is bad.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b177-7\">3. This award is not mutual, certain, and final, because <em>Wolfersberger </em>cannot be compelled to procure the deed from his wife. The Court, if they had power, would not attach a man for not making his wife execute a deed ; it would be <em>duress </em>on the wife. But in the case of a compulsory arbitration, there is no power in the Court to issue an attachment to enforce performance. The award, therefore, being void in a material part so connected with the rest as to affect the justice of the case, it is void for the whole. <em>Kyd on Awards, </em>168. If the Court cannot enforce one part of the award, they consider the whole void. <em>Kunckle </em>v. <em>Kunckle.</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> Tetter </em>v. Rapesnyder.<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Durant.</em><footnotemark><em>(d</em>)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b177-9\">4. No title to the land appears in the plaintiff; on the contrary, it seems by the award, that the legal title was in <em>Frederick Boas. </em>The defendant was not bound to take an equitable title. A purchaser will not be compelled to take a doubtful or an equitable title. <em>Sugd. on Vend. </em>210.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b177-10\"><em>5. </em>The condition of the award was not complied with, and therefore the execution was erroneously issued. The proceedings under the arbitration act, being compulsory, ought to be more strictly guarded than those under voluntary references.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b177-11\">6. The rule of reference was of all matters in variance between the parties in the cause, agreeably to an act of assembly, entitled, \u201c An act supplementary to an act, entitled an act to regulate arbitrations.\u201d There is however no such act of assembly. The title of the arbitration act is, \u201c An act regulating arbitrations.\u201d In <em>Moulson </em>v. <em>Rees, </em>it is decided, that a mis-recital of the date of the law in the rule of reference does not vitiate the proceedings ; but there the title of the act was properly given. Again: The rule of reference is of \u201c all matters in variance <em>between the parties </em>in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>the above cause j\u201d but the arbitration act limits the right oi the party to refer to \u201c all matters in variance <em>in such suit or action </em>between the parties.\u201d Act of 20th <em>March, </em>1810, sect. 1. <em>Purd. Dig. </em>12. This is a material variance ; and submits matters to the arbitrators which the law does not warrant. The distinction between the two submissions is obvious, and is recognised by authority. 2 <em>Bl. Rep. </em>1118. 2 <em>T. R. </em>644, a case in 1776. 2 <em>Tid\u2019s Prac. </em>747.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b178-10\"><em>Elder </em>and <em>Hopkins, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b178-11\">1. The arbitrators have the same equitable powers as the Court and jury. Their power is, by the arbitration act, \u201c to try all matters justly and equitably between the parties,\u201d and to do this they are sworn. They have done complete justice ; they have ordered the defendant to pay the money due on the articles of agreement, but have taken care that the plaintiff shall not compel payment till he does right on his part, by making a conveyance of the land from himself and wife. The condition is for the protection and advantage of the defendant, and must be performed before he is liable. The 11th section of the arbitration act contemplates the ern forcement of awards, by \u00ab execution, or such other process as may be necessary.\u201d The power of giving judgment to be enforced on certain conditions, has been frequently exercised in this State by the Courts, as well as by referees. In the <em>Lessee of Mathers </em>v. <em>Akewright,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>judgment was given in ejectment, with stay of execution, until the title of the defendant to 100 acres of land should be secured according to articles of agreement. In <em>Shaller </em>v. <em>Brand,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>there was judgment by agreement, but no execution to issue till the title of the land for which the bond was given, should be perfected by the plaintiff. In <em>Moody\u2019s lessee </em>v. <em>Vandyke,</em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Chief Justice says, \u201c at all events the defendant would be secured by entering judgment on such conditions as the Court and jury might think equitable.\u201d In <em>Kunckle </em>v. <em>Kunckle,</em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>an award that money should be paid by the defendant to the plaintiff, and that the plaintiff should make a conveyance of land, was held good; the Court supposed, they might compel the plaintiff to convey by attachment; or they might suspend his execution for the money awarded to him until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>he made the conveyance. In <em>Bard </em>v. <em>Wilson,</em><footnotemark><em>(e)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>there was an award of referees, that <em>Bard </em>should pay a certain sum to <em>Wilson, </em>whereupon <em>Wilson </em>should perfect a title to the lands sold to <em>Bard. </em>On this award, judgment was entered in the Common Pleas for the sum awarded, with stay of execution until a deed should be produced and filed in Court, and till the Court should adjudge the same to convey a good title in fee to <em>Bard, </em>and it was held good, and Yeates J. cited -- v. <em>Michael </em>Simpson, from <em>Dauphin </em>county, removed to the Supreme Court, in which a report of referees, that a deed should be executed to be approved by the Court, on payment of the sum found due, was held valid. These cases were sanctioned by the Court before the compulsory arbitration law, and that act gives the arbitrators more power than they had before. The award is clearly certain, mutual and final. It is said the condition annexed by the arbitrators has not been complied with. That is a matter of fact decided by the Court below, and not properly examinable by this Court as a Court of Error. The evidence on which they decided, is not on the record. On the objection to the rule of arbitration, The Court relieved the counsel from replying.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b177-12\"> 1 <em>Dall. </em>364.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"AVb\"><em> 1 Dall. </em>293.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"b177-13\"> 1 <em>Dall. </em>129.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"(d)\">\n<p id=\"b177-14\"><em> </em>6 <em>Binn. </em>32.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-5\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b178-12\"><em> </em>2 <em>Binn. </em>93.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-6\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b178-13\"><em> </em>6 <em>Binn. </em>435.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-7\" label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"b178-14\"> 4 <em>Binn. 31.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-8\" label=\"(d)\">\n<p id=\"b178-15\"><em> </em>1 <em>Dall. </em>364.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-9\" label=\"(e)\">\n<p id=\"b179-6\"><em>a) 3 Yeates, </em>149.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-10\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b179-4\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b179-5\">Gibson J.</author>\n<p id=\"AtW\">Many of the exceptions taken here, are inapplicable to an award under the compulsory arbitration act, which is <em>sui generis, </em>and to be considered rather as a verdict and judgment, than as an award. Arbitrators, under that act, decide both the law and the fact, and substantially perform the functions of a Court and jury. We are, therefore, not to inquire, whether their award is mutual, final, or certain <em>; </em>whether it extends to a stranger to the submission, or whether it is erroneous on the merits ; but only whether the arbitrators have confined themselves to the matters in controversy in the cause, and have done what a Court and jury might rightfully do. In the case at bar, there was a general finding for the plaintiff; but with stay of execution till he should tender a conveyance, with special warranty, from himself and his wife, to the defendant, of all their interest in certain land, &amp;c. Now, it cannot be doubted, but that a verdict in this form would be good, and that the Court would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>see it carried into execution; not, as the defendants\u2019 counsel suppose, by compelling the plaintiff to procure his wife to join him in executing a deed, but by refusing to let him ^ave ^ fruit of his judgment till the condition was complied with. The counsel, however, infer that the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover at all, depended on the previous tender of the deed; and that the arbitrators erred in supposing they could cure this defect in the title, by rendering it obligatory on him to do, after judgment and before execution, what he ought to have done in the first instance. If this were so, the defendant undoubtedly suffered a wrong, in being rendered liable to the costs of a suit, commenced at a time when there was no cause of action. But, that the cause of action was incomplete at the commencement of the suit, is not an inevitable consequence of the plaintiff\u2019s being bound to tender a conveyance ; his liability, in that respect, may have arisen from a separate and independent covenant, which the arbitrators may have seen fit to have executed, along with the other parts of the contract, from equitable considerations; in which case, according to the principles of <em>Moody </em>v. <em>Vandyke, </em>4 <em>Binn. </em>43, a tender would not be necessary; but the Court might exercise an equitable controul over the execution, so as to do substantial justice. That arbitrators, under a voluntary reference, have a right to impose conditions on him in whose favour they award, is fully established by <em>Kunckle </em>v. <em>Kunckle, </em>1 <em>Dall. </em>364, and <em>Bard\u2019s Administrators v. </em>Wilson, 3 <em>Yeates, </em>149. Arbitrators under the act of the 20th <em>March, </em>1810, are differently constituted, being a tribunal created by the law, not by the act of the parties, and one to which either may recur; but they have all the powers incident to the Court in which the cause was pending when it was referred ; and it is well settled, that the interests of a defendant may be secured by a verdict imposing such equitable conditions as the jury may deem necessary. In <em>Mathers\u2019s lessee </em>v. <em>Akewright, </em>2 <em>Binn. </em>93, there was judgment in ejectment, with stay of execution till the title of the defendant to 100 acres of the land should be secured, ac* cording to the articles of agreement between the parties; and in <em>Moody\u2019s lessee </em>v. <em>Vandyke, </em>the same principle is distinctly intimated by the Chief Justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">It is objected, that the award extends beyond the submission, and that the rule of reference is, in form, not according <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>to the act of assembly; being of all matters in variance between the parties in the cause, and not of all matters in variance in the cause between the parties. The first is not supported in point of fact; and the second cannot be supported in point of law. Where the submission is by the agreement of the parties, who may, if they please, extend the powers of the arbitrators to matters not embraced by the suit, the distinction, though a very nice one, may have some shew of reason ; but in references under the act, the party entering the rule having no power to submit any thing unconnected with the cause, it can have none.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">The last exception is to the execution; which, it is said, the Court permitted to be issued before the condition attached to the award had been complied with. Whether the plaintiff had done all that was necessary to entitle him to execution, was a question of fact peculiarly proper for the decision of the Court below, and one which, whether decided rightly or not, cannot be agitated here. The Court were not bound to put the evidence, upon which they decided, on the record; nor are we to be supposed to have it before us. It is to be presumed, they exercised a sound discretion ; but even if they did not, the matter is not the subject of a writ error. The judgment and proceedings are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b181-7\"> <em>Note. </em>\u2014 The decision of this point in the case here reported, is, by mistake, referred to in <em>Shoemaker </em>v. <em>Meyer, </em>4 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>454, as having been made at <em>May </em>Term, 1818. The cause was argued at that time, and held under advisement ; but the opinion of the Court having been formed immediately after the close of the Term, gave a mistaken impression that the cause had been disposed of.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
