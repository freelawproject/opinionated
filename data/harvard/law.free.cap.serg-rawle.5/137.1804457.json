The present was an action on the case, brought to <em>February </em>Term, 1815, to which the defendants pleaded <em>non assumpsit </em>and payment, with leave, &amp;c., and there was a replication, and issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-14\">On the trial, the plaintiff, having proved, by the record, the foregoing facts, and also that the defendants advertised a sale of the property attached, and a meeting of the creditors, and had made sale, and paid the sheriff his fees on the attachment, offered a witness to prove, that on the day ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>vertised, the defendants received the proceeds of sale : that at the said meeting called by the defendants on the 16th <em>July, </em>1814, the defendants disputed the plaintiff\u2019s demand, and it was agreed to submit it to arbitrators, who were mutually chosen by the plaintiff and defendants ; that the arbitrators met, heard the parties, and awarded against <em>Francis School, </em>\u00a7 338 48cts : and they also offered to prove, that the defendants had paid other creditors, ten shillings in the pound of their respective debts. The defendants objected \u25a0to this evidence, and the Court overruled it on the ground, that the defendants had never been sworn or affirmed as trustees, and had not settled their accounts before the Court. To this opinion, the plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b146-9\"><em>Weidman, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AaY\">contended that the evidence ought to have been admitted. After selling the property and agreeing to an arbitration with the plaintiff, the defendants cannot be allowed to deny that they are trustees, or to take advantage of the circumstance of their not having been sworn or affirmed. They are bound to pay the creditors. The 8th section of the act of 4th December, 1807, 4 <em>Sm. Laws, </em>478, gives the trustees power to enter into an arbitration. Nor is it any objection that they have not settled their accounts. The creditor has his election to bring suit at common law, or proceed under the act of assembly.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AB7\"><em>Buchanan, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ala\">See 1 <em>Johns. 165.
