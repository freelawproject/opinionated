Jordan, </em>the lator, before an alderman, who gave judgment on the June, 1819, in favour of <em>Harrison Hall, </em>for 52 dollars and 50 cents. <em>John Cullen </em>became special bail for <em>Jordan, </em>and entered into a recognisance, the condition of which was, that <em>T. Jordan </em>should, within six months from the date of the judgment, pay the debt, or that within the said term, his body should be surrendered according to law. On the 13th <em>December, </em>1819, <em>Harrison Hall </em>issued a <em>scire facias </em>against <em>John Cullen, </em>upon this recognisance, returnable on the 20th <em>December. </em>On the 17th <em>December, John Cullen </em>gave him . \u00b0 note as a collateral security. On the 20th December, the alderman in <em>Harrison HalPs </em>absence, and contrary to wishes, entered judgment against <em>John Cullen. Harrison Hall, </em>on the same day requested the alderman to discontinue the suit on the <em>scire facias, </em>and an entry of discontinuance was made on the magistrate\u2019s docket. <em>John Cullen </em>having i , . . , . , \u00b0 taken out a bail piece, 1. <em>Jordan </em>was arrested by'his order in <em>New Tork, </em>and surrendered here on the 20th, and was 5 7 now detained on the bail-piece.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b407-22\">Swift, for the relator,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aci\">took several exceptions ; but in the course of the argument, abandoned all but two.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b407-24\">1.

The form of the recognisance was not lawful. The act of assembly of 20th <em>March, </em>1810, sect. 2, provides, that the bail \u2018\u2018 may surrender the principal to the gaol of the proper county, within ten days after the service of the <em>scire facias, </em>in discharge of the bail.\u201d But the time allowed for surrender by this recognisance, was within six months from .the judgment; and it has not been complied with by the bail. The surrender was not within six months. In <em>Speakman </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number><em>Pearce,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it is decided, that there can be no surrender after the expiration of six months from the judgment.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AJF3\"><em>Erwing, </em>for <em>Hal</em>l.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b408-10\">b) 1 <em>Yeates, 347.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AF6\">Per. Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AVRv\">This is an attempt by the principal to throw this debt upon his bail; a case not to be favoured. The counsel for the prisoner, having relinquished all his exceptions but two, the Court will decide upon them only.'</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">1. That the bail was fixed by the judgment on the <em>scire facias </em>and could not surrender afterwards. The fact is, that the plaintiff in the <em>scire facias </em>was not present when judgment was entered, nor did he wish the judgment to be entered, and on the day of its entry, he requested the aider-man to discontinue the suit, who made an entry of discontinuance on his docket; so that upon the whole there was no judgment. Under the circumstances of the case, the aider-man had a right to strike out the entry of the judgment, and enter a discontinuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">2. That the bait had only six months from judgment to surrender his principal. The answer is plain ; he has six months by the terms of the recognisance, but he has moreover ten days from the service of the <em>scire </em>facias, to make the surrender, by the express words of the law. Of this neither the plaintiff nor the alderman could deprive him; but in truth no person but his principal wishes to deprive him of it. The case cited from <em>Teates, </em>is not to the point. The decision was on another act of assembly, which did not allow the bail ten days froth the service of the <em>scire facias. </em>^Ve are of opinion, that the prisoner should be remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">Prisoner remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
