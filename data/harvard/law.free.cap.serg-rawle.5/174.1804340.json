The lease commenced the 10th <em>April, </em>1810, and was for one year. The notice to quit was given on the 22d <em>April, </em>1814. The statement, that notice was given \u201c at divers other days and times, as well before as after,\u201d is a mere general averment, and amounts to nothing. After the expiration of this lease, on the 10th <em>April, </em>1811, the defendant was, agreeably to the custom in <em>Pennsylvania, </em>tenant from year to year; and could not be dispossessed without a notice to quit, given three months previous to the end of a year. 2 <em>Bl.

The inquisition is defective in not finding under what title the defendant occupied from the 10th <em>April, </em>1811, to the 22d <em>April, </em>1814; but the finding of only 21 dollars and 33 cents damages is strong evidence, that the lease had continued from year to year.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b184-12\">2.

The jury have found damages <em>besides costs. </em>They had no right to find costs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYY\"><em>5.

The <em>venire facias </em>says, that the lease was made \u201c at a certain rent,\u201d without saying what rent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-8\"><em>7. </em>The inquest does not find that the term was ended.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-9\">Hopkins, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-10\">1. The first contract was a lease for one year from the <em>10th </em>April, 1810; therefore, at the end of one year-the defendant was tenant at sufferance. 2 <em>Bl.

Our act of assembly requires nothing more than notice to quit, and three months refusal to comply by the tenant, to justify the application to the justices.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-12\">2. The want of the month in the date of the inquisition is immaterial. The jury have found that notice to quit was given three months prior to the application to the justices.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"ADj\">This is a proceeding under the landlord and tenant act, instituted by <em>Samuel Fahnestock </em>and others <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>against <em>John Faustenauer. </em>The complainant made an appliestion to two justices, who issued a <em>venire </em>facias, by virtue of which a jury was summoned, and an inquest held. The gntjjng 0f the jury was very singular ; barely, \u201c that the facts stated in the within <em>venire </em>facias, are true.\u2019\u2019 What then arc the facts stated in the <em>venire facias ? </em>The <em>venire facias </em>contains a recital, that it had been proved before the justices, &amp;c. [His honour here read the recital in the <em>venire </em>facias.] Now what is the meaning of the inquisition ? Is it meant, that it was true, that due proof had been made before the justices of the other facts stated in the <em>venire ? </em>If that was the meaning, the finding is insufficient, because the jury themselves must find the truth. But it is said, on behalf of the complainants, that the meaning was, that the facts concerning the lease, &amp;c. were true <em>; </em>and that the finding was good, because it was rendered certain by reference to the <em>venire. </em>I have never known an inquisition of this kind, and it would be difficult to support, even if -the reference were made with greater precision than is done in this.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">But I do not think that this can be supported, for several reasons. There are many facts stated in the <em>venire facias, </em>and if the jury meant that <em>all </em>those facts were true, they should have said so expressly; because some may be ti-ue, and some not so. I think too, that it should have been expressly found, <em>et that the term was fully endedf </em>for so the act of assembly requires. In truth, I am at a loss to understand from this record, what was the real situation of the landlord and tenant. A lease was made on the 10th <em>April, </em>1810, for the term of one year then next ensuing, by virtue of which the tenant entered into the possession of the premises at the commencement of the lease, and held and detained the same at the time of issuing the <em>venire facias, </em>to the damage of the landlord, &amp;c. and for the unjust detention the jury assessed damages at 21 dollars 33 cents, besides costs. But, did the tenant hold the premises against the will of the landlord the whole time from the expiration of the first year to the taking of the inquest, or not ? If he did, 21 dollars S3 cents were very inadequate damages. But if the tenant had been permitted to remain from year to year, then a new year having commenced on the 10th <em>April, 1814, </em>the tenant\" would have had a right to hold for that year, and the notice to quit in thi'ee months, dated 22d <em>April, 1814, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>would have been illegal. It is remarkable, that the <em>venire facias </em>does not assert, that the tenant held the premises to the damage of his landlord, the whole time from the expiration of the first year, to the time of issuing the <em>venire; </em>the words are these : \u2014 \u201c by virtue of which said demise, the said <em>John </em>Faustenauer, on the day and year aforesaid, at the county aforesaid, entered into the possession of the premises aforesaid, <em>and still holds and detains the same to the great damage </em>,\u201d &amp;?c. Now when we are left at a loss., to know how matters really stood between these parties, and are to make it out by conjecture, or, at best, <em>by </em>inference, the inquisition cannot be good. It is a summary proceeding, and therefore every requisite of the act of assembly should be substantially complied' with. The necessary facts should, be clearly and positively found. It is the opinion of the Court, that they are not so found, and therefore, the proceedings should be quashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">Proceedings quashed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
