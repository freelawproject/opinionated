The cause was tried in the Court low, on the 8th <em>May, </em>1818. After the plaintiffs had proved their title to a moiety of the lands, the defendants called <em>Martin Kraeber, </em>who swore that he had seen an article of agreement in the hands of <em>Seely Hiding, </em>from <em>James Rose, </em>in his own right, and as attorney for <em>Robert H. Rose, </em>to <em>George Eichelberger, </em>brother-in-law of <em>Seely Ruling, </em>dated .the 12th <em>November, </em>1803. The plaintiffs thereupon admitted, that <em>Seely Ruling </em>had an agreement with the plaintiffs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>that if they recovered, they were to convey to him their moiety of the lands in question ; but stated, that no conveyance had been made.

To this order the defendants excepted, and the Court sealed a bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b251-12\"><em>Burnside, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AsT\">contended, that the non-suit entered by the Court below, was erroneous, for various reasons. In the first place, the law is well settled in <em>Girard </em>v. Gettig,<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> and <em>Irving </em>v. <em>Taggart,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that it is out of the power of the Court, to order a nonsuit, against the consent of the plaintiff, who may refuse to enter it, and insist on talcing a verdict. He cited to the same point, 2 <em>Bay. 132. 1 Wash. Rep. </em>219. Again, the act of assembly of the 27th <em>February, </em>1798, (3 <em>Sm. Laws, </em>303,) authorising a nonsuit to be entered, for the non-production of books and writings, does not extend to such a case as the present. That act, applies altogether to parties to the record. It is to them, notice is to be given, and on them, the rule of Court is to be made. Besides, the act requires u due notice\u201d to be given: which cannot be considered as complied with,' by an order made on the trial, to produce them \u201c forthwith,\u201d as was done here. It was decided in <em>M'Dermot </em>v. <em>The United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number><em>States Insurance Company,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that a Judge at <em>Nisi Prius </em>is not authorised to order a nonsuit, under this act: the order must be made by the Court in bank. The reasons given for this decision, are, that the Court may have time to'deliberate on the order for production of papers, and the party have time to bring the papers to Court. <em>It is there </em>said by Tilghman C. J., that \u201c an order during the trial, to produce them <em>instanter, </em>might be attended with very great hardship.\u201d The proper course for the defendants to pursue, would have been to issue a <em>subpoena duces tecum </em>for <em>Seely Huling.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b252-10\"><em>Hall </em>and Fisher, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b252-11\">It was proved to the satisfaction of the Court, that <em>Seely Huling </em>was a party. The Court below had a right to decide this fact, and they did decide it. The Court also, are the sole judges what time ought to be allowed for the production of papers : no particular time is necessary; and they must be governed by circumstances. Here <em>Seely Huling </em>was in Court, and refused to produce a paper proved to be in his possession. As he was in fact, a party in interest, he could not have been compelled to obey a <em>subpoena.</em></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"AVRV\"> 2 <em>Binn. </em>234.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"A8D\"> 1 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle, </em>360.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b252-14\"> <em>1 Serg. &amp; Rawle,357.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b252-12\">The opinion of the Court was delivered <em>by</em></p>\n<author id=\"b252-13\">Gibson J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ahg\">Every order to produce papers under the act of assembly, must be founded on a previous affidavit; which, as the law is highly penal, should set forth, with precision, every fact necessary to authorise the Court to proceed. The party is to have due notice of the motion; and, as he is to come prepared to contest the truth of the facts, he ought to have the same length of time previous to the hearing, as would be sufficient for preparation for the trial of an issue before a jury. The notice should describe the book or paper required with sufficient certainty; and the question on the motion, being only incidental, should be decided previously to the trial of the issue. The nonsuit, therefore, was wrong in every view. There was no averment in the affidavit, that the deed was material and pertinent to the issue; and if it were not, the Court could not require it to be produced. Before recourse is had to a measure so severe in its consequences, the fact should be positively sworn to: conjecture or suspicion is not sufficient. A par.ty is not tobe subjected to the risque of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>being sacrificed to the surmises of his antagonist, without the latter being bound to stand to the truth of what he asserts. There is no hardship in holding him to strict proof. If, in consequence of such strictness, he loses the benefit of the proceeding under the act altogether, the loss is not irretrievable; he still has his remedy at common law, by giving secondary evidence of the contents of the paper or document withheld : whereas, a mistake against the person held to answer, is fatal. Now <em>Martin Kraeber </em>swore, that the deed was \u201c respecting\u201d the land ; which may be true, and the deed nevertheless not material or pertinent.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">The affidavit is also defective, in not alleging, that the deed was in the possession of <em>the plaintiffs. </em>It was seen in the possession of <em>Seely Huling, </em>who- was an agent of the plaintiffs; but whether as an agent or as the owner of it, and, if the former, whether it remained in his possession at the time of the application, does not appear. If it were <em>Seely Muling,s </em>own, or not intrusted to his care by the plaintiffs, it would not be peculiarly in their <em>power; </em>and of course, its production could not be enforced under the act; but the party wishing to use itj would have to resort to the usual means of a <em>subpwna, </em>with a <em>duces </em>tecum. The notice was served, also, at a period altogether too late, being only three days previous to the granting of the rule ; and the rule itself was wrong, being made, not only during the trial, but, personally on <em>Seely Huling, </em>who was at most but an agent: it should have been on the plaintiffs in the cause. A Court has no right to designate a third person, not marked as such on the record, as the real party, and proceed against him: it is the plaintiff of record who is to be nonsuited, and the rule must be against him. It was unnecessary to treat <em>Seely Muling </em>as the party: if he were in fact so, the production of the paper might have been procured by a rule on the plaintiffs of record, which would have given the defendants all the benefit they were entitled to in any shape. If the paper came to his possession as an agent, it was to be considered in the power of the plaintiffs for all purposes beneficial to the defendants in a proceeding on the act: if it were his own, he would, even though substantially interested, be bound to produce it on a <em>subpwna.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">This proceeding being in the nature of a bill of discovery, the party to be affected, ought to have a fair opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>answer the matter charged. According to the mode which I have indicated, the application for the order, should be grounded on an affidavit describing, with reasonable certainty, ^ k00j\u00a1.s or papers alleged to be withheld, and containing a positive averment, that they are material to the issue, and exclusively in the power of the party against whom relief is sought: if they are equally in the power of bothj this mode cannot be resorted to. The order is to be made previously to the trial, and on such service of notice, as would be sufficient for preparation to try an issue of fact. In all these particulars, and in some others, the proceeding in this case was defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
