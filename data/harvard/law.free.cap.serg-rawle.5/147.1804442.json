The present <em>scire facias </em>was issued on the above mentioned recognisance against <em>John Kean, </em>as the recognisor, and <em>John Close, </em>as terretcnant of the lands and estate, &amp;c. taken by <em>Kean </em>at the appraised value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-9\">The defendants pleaded <em>nul tiel record, </em>and payment, with leave to give the special matter in evid^pce. <em>Replication non solverunt, </em>and <em>quod habetur tale recordum: </em>and issues.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-10\">On the plea of <em>nul tiel record, </em>the plaintiff produced the record of a recognisance entered into at the Orphan\u2019s Court, by <em>John Kean </em>and others, jointly and severally, \u201c unto the Hon. <em>John Joseph Henry, </em>Esquire, President of the said Court, and his successors in office,\u201d in the sum, and on the conditions above mentioned; which the Court below decided sufficient to support the issue on the part of the plaintiff, and the defendants excepted to their opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-11\">On the trial of the issue on the plea of payment in the Court below, the defendants\u2019 counsel, requested the Court to charge the jury on several points, which, with their answers, were as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-12\">1st. Whether a recognisance in the Orphan\u2019s Court by an heir taking land at the appraisment, under the 4th section of the intestate law of 1764, for the payment of the distributive shares to the rest of the heirs, create a lien upon the estate so taken at the appraisment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-13\">2d.

Whether the record of the deed from <em>Kean </em>to <em>Orth, </em>was notice to Close, that the distributive shares due from <em>Kean </em>to the others heirs of <em>John </em>Hamilton, deceased, were unpaid, and remained charged upon the estate so taken at the appraisment by <em>Kean P</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-5\">4ih.

That the recognisance in the Orphan\u2019s Court by an heir taking land at the appraisment, under the 4th section of the intestate law of 1764, for the payment of the distributive shares to the rest of the heirs, is a specific lien <em>upon the estate so taken at the appraisment.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-11\">2.

The opinion of the Court upon the second point, is decisive of this. But even admitting that the proceedings of the Orphan\u2019s Court, and such recognisances, were not notice, the record of the deed from <em>Kean </em>to Orth, referring to the decree of the Orphan\u2019s Court in 1801, creating the title of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number><em>John </em>Kean, was sufficient to put <em>Close </em>upon enquiry, and therefore good notice, and binding upon him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AOr\">4. The opinion of the Court upon the second point, deddes this.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AZ6\">5. Notwithstanding the discharge of <em>John Kean </em>on the 20th <em>July, </em>1812, in Philadelphia, under \u201c an act for the relief of insolvent debtors residing in the city and county of Philadelphia, and their creditors the plaintiff can legally and properly support this action against him, upon his recognisance entered into in 1801, in the Orphan\u2019s Court, to recover of the estate taken by the said <em>John Kean </em>in the possession of <em>John Close, </em>the plaintiff\u2019s distributive share of such estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-8\">6. With the judgment in this suit, the jury have nothing to do, nor is it the duty of the Court, to instruct the jury concerning it. It is the business of the jury to find a verdict ; and of the Court to render judgment thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-9\">The defendants, thereupon, excepted to the charge of the Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b158-10\"><em>Ellmaker </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-11\">1. The decision of the Court below, on the plea of <em>ml tiel record,, </em>was erroneous. The recognisance is taken in the name of <em>John Joseph </em>Henry, as President of the Orphan\u2019s Court, and his successors in office. There is no such person recognised by the constitution or laws, as President of the Orphan\u2019s Court, and there can be no successor in that office. The recognisance therefore, is in effect, a personal one to <em>John Joseph Henry; </em>and as he is dead, the suit , should have been brought in the name of his executors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b158-13\">2. The recognisance is not a lien on the land taken by the recognisor. The 4th section of the act of 1/64, (3 <em>Smith\u2019s Laws, </em>159. note,) does not make it so. It merely provides for the taking of the lands by one of the children, on paying to the others their shares, \u201c or giving good security for the payment thereof, in some reasonable time, as the said Orphan\u2019s Court shall limit and appoint.\u201d That the legislature did not intend it to be so, is apparent from the circumstance of their expressly directing in the same section, that the wife\u2019s share \u201c shall be and remain, charged upon the premises.\u201d The difference in expression, shews a difference of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>meaning. If it be a lien, it is so on all the land of the reeognisor: there is nothing to justify a discrimination. There is nothing in the nature of a recognisance, as such, that creates a lien. In <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Richardson,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it is decided, that a recognisance of bail is not a lien on their land, till judgment recovered thereon. There are acts of assembly, directing the party receiving satisfaction of a judgment or mortgage, to enter it on record : but there is no such direction as to a recognisance. The act of 28th March, 1803, (4 <em>Sm. Laws, </em>45,) expressly makes the recognisance of sheriffs and coroners, and their sureties, a lien on lands: but suits must be brought within five years from the date of such recognisances. It is not the custom to search the records of the Orphan\u2019s Court, for liens on land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-5\">3. If the recognisance is a lien, it cannot affect a purchaser ior a valuable consideration, without notice. A lien for the purchase money of land sold, does not extend to a purchaser, without notice. <em>Sugd. </em>364. 488. 1 <em>Brown\u2019s Ch. C. </em>302. 2 <em>Ves. </em>622. 6 <em>Binn. </em>118. The lien of such a recognisance, is only an equitable lien, and therefore not binding on a purchaser, without notice. <em>Sugd. </em>364. The recital in the deed from <em>Kean </em>to <em>Orth </em>in 1804, recorded in 1806, that the land was taken at an appraisment, was not notice to <em>Close, </em>who bought in 1808, that the lien still existed. Notice of title, isnotno\u201c tice of the non payment of purchase money.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-7\">4. This action could not be maintained against <em>Kean, </em>after he had been discharged from all debts and demands due, before the date of his certificate. It is against him personally. The <em>scire facias </em>calls on the defendants to shew cause, why the plaintiff should not recover <em>against Kean. </em>If he had not been discharged as an insolvent, the judgment in this suit, would have rendered him liable, personally.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-8\">5. The Court ought to have answered, whether the judgment would affect <em>Kean; </em>because if the jury had known that the whole debt would fall on the land in the hands of <em>Close, </em>they would have found for the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-9\">6. There ought to have been a declaration : or if the <em>scire facias </em>be a declaration, it should have been stated that <em>Close </em>was terre-tenant of the land taken by <em>Kean </em>bn the appraisment.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b160-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number><em>Buchanan </em>and <em>Elder, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-8\">1. The mode of taking the security, is left, by the act, to the Court, and the practice has accordingly varied. In some counties they took bonds, but in <em>Dauphin </em>county, the practice has been to take recognisances to the President of the Court, and his successors in office. The suit is well brought in the name of the President of the Court for the time being. It would have been dangerous to vest the right in the executors or administrators. The President of the Court of Common Pleas, is President of the Orphan\u2019s Court. The act of 24th February, 1806, sect. 23, enacts \u201c that the Judges of the Court of Common Pleas in the first district, or any two of them, <em>the President being one, </em>shall compose and hold the Orphan\u2019s Court, &amp;c.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-9\">2. The recognisance is a lien on the land taken at the appraisment. The law never intended that the right to land which had descended, should be taken from the heirs, without giving them the land as security. By the words of the act of 1764, the right of the heirs in the land is not divested, till payment or satisfaction. It provides in the 4th section, \u00a3t that the person or persons to whom, or whose use <em>payment or satisfaction </em>shall be so made for their respective parts or shares of the deceased\u2019s lands, in manner aforesaid, shall be forever barred of all right, title, or demand, of, in, to, or out of the intestate\u2019s lands and tenements aforesaid.\u201d In <em>Walton </em>v. <em>Willis,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Chief Justice M'Kean, said expressly, that \u201c the Orphan\u2019s Courts ought, instead of bonds, to take recognisances, by which the lands themselves would be bound for the payment of the distributive shares.\u201d The highest authority declared this to be the law in 1788, and the understanding has accordingly been so. The point is ruled the same way in another case, <em>Beattie </em>v. <em>Smith,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in 1804, before Yeates and Smith Justices; where the Court say, &lt;\u00a3 unquestionably, the recognisance in the Orphan\u2019s Court, is in the nature of a judgment. The interests of minors, as well as persons of full age, would be strangely affected if a doctrine should prevail, that while they were divested of their interests in the land, their distributive shares of the valuation should not be placed on a secure and permanent footing.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>3. The lien is on record, and is therefore a legal as well as an equitable one. Even if it were only an equitable lien, <em>Close </em>is bound by it, because Kean, from whom he bought, had notice ; and because the deed to <em>Kean </em>reciting the title, was on record two years before he purchased. \u2022 As to entering satisfaction, the practice is, to take releases from heirs who have received their shares, which are recorded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-7\">4. Though the insolvent law discharged <em>Kean </em>from the debt, yet it was necessary to make him a defendant, because he might have paid the money, and should have an opportunity to shew it. A bankrupt may be made a defendant, in order to obtain execution against his land on a judgment prior to the bankruptcy. <em>Ralston </em>v. Bell.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> <em>Kean </em>sold and conveyed to <em>Orth </em>before his insolvency: therefore his assignees had no interest in it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-9\"><em>3. </em>The question as to the judgment that would be entered, was irrelevant to the issue, and the Court were right in refusing to answer it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b161-10\">6. As to the declaration, there need be none on a <em>scire facias. </em>The writ answers all the purposes of a narr.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b159-13\"> 1 <em>Dall. </em>131.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b160-10\"> l <em>Dall. </em>265.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b160-11\">a) 3 <em>Sm.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7F\"><em>John Kean, </em>one of the plaintiffs in error, and defendants below, entered into a recognisance, dated 27th <em>October, </em>1801, whereby he became bound to <em>John Joseph Henry, </em>Esq., President of the Orphan\u2019s Court of <em>Dauphin </em>county, and his successors in office, in the sum of 11,160/., conditioned for the payment to the widow and children of <em>John Hamilton, </em>deceased, of their respective shares of the appraised value of certain lands and real estate, of the said <em>Hamilton, </em>which were taken by the said <em>Kean, </em>at the said appraised value. <em>Kean </em>sold these lands, &amp;c., to <em>Henry Orth, </em>by whom they were sold to <em>John Close, </em>the other defendant in this action ; after which,., the said <em>Kean </em>became insolvent, and was discharged by virtue of an act of assembly, passed the 13th <em>March, </em>1812. The <em>scire facias </em>was issued, for the use of <em>Hugh Hamilton, </em>one of the heirs of the said <em>John Hamilton, </em>deceased, on the recognisance before mentioned, against <em>John Kean, </em>the recognisor, and <em>John Close, </em>terre-tenant of the lands, &amp;c., taken by <em>Kean, </em>at the appraised value, as aforesaid. On the trial of the cause in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>the Court of Common Pleas of <em>Dauphin </em>county, several exceptions were taken to the opinion of the Court, which are now to be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">1. It was contended, that the suit ought to have been brought in the name of the executors of Judge <em>Henry. </em>The recognisance was to <em>John Joseph Henry, President of the Orphan\u2019s </em>Court, <em>and his successors in office: </em>that there is no President of the Orphan\u2019s Court, and there can be no successors in office : therefore the words, <em>President of the Orphan's </em>Court, <em>and his </em>successors, are unmeaning and nugatory ; and this recognisance was, <em>in fact </em>taken, to <em>John Joseph Henry, </em>in his <em>personal capacity. </em>This being the case, and he being dead, the suit should have been brought in the name of his executors. It was not denied that the recognisance is valid ; but alleged, that the suit is brought in the name of the wrong person. This was, substantially, the argument on behalf of the plaintiff in error. But 1 cannot assent to it, because, the recognisance is expressly taken to <em>John Joseph </em>Henry, President of the Orphan\u2019s Court, <em>and his successors in </em>office, and it is not true, that there is no President of the Orphan\u2019s Court. There is a President of the Court of Common Pleas ; and it is provided by \u201c the act to alter the judiciary system of the Commonwealth,\u201d sect. 23. that \u201c the Judges of the Court of Common Pleas, or any two of them, <em>the President being one, </em>shall compose and hold the Orphan\u2019s Court.\u201d It may with strict propriety be said then, that the President of the Court of Common Pleas, is President of the Orphan\u2019s Court. As to the objection, that the recognisance was taken to the President, <em>and his successors in office, </em>it is the duty of this Court to get over it, if possible, being the form used in <em>Dauphin </em>county for many years : much property belonging to widows and orphans, depends upon it. The act of 1764, under which it was taken, directs security to be given, <em>in such manner as the Orphan?s Court shall limit and appoint. </em>Tire matter being thus left to the discretion of the Court, different Courts have adopted different <em>forms; </em>and some have taken <em>bonds, </em>and some <em>recognisances. </em>Some take them in the name of the presiding Judge, and his successors; and others, of the Commonwealth. I consider a recognisance \u201c to the President, and his successors,\u201d the same, as \u201c to the President for the time heing.\u201d He may be regarded for this purpose, as in na<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>\"cure of a Corporation sole, which has perpetual existence. It is a name, which we may presume, will endure as long as our government; and\u2019 that is sufficient for the purpose of the recognisance. I am of opinion, therefore, that it is good.</p>\n<p id=\"ADi\">2. It is said, that the recognisance is no lien on the lands of <em>John </em>Hamilton, taken by <em>Kean </em>at the appraised value. For this, the case of <em>Campbell </em>v. Richardson, is relied on. 1 <em>Dall. </em>131. That was a recognisance of special bail, and the decision was, that it was not a lien, before judgment was obtained on the recognisance. Mr. President Shippen, who decided that case, relied principally on the understanding which had prevailed in Pennsylvania, for he admitted, that the law of <em>England </em>was different. If we adopt Mr. Ship-pen\u2019s principle, we shall say that the present recognisance, was a lien on the lands of the intestate Hamilton, from its date: for it is now 30 years since Chief Justice M\u2018Kean laid it down, in the case of <em>Walton </em>v. Willis, (1 <em>Dall. </em>265,) that a recognisance of this kind was a lien, and therefore ought always to be taken by the Orphan\u2019s Courts; and he censured those Courts, for sometimes taking <em>bonds, </em>which were no lien. From that time, it may be safely asserted, that these recognisances have been generally understood to be a lien. They were considered as in nature of a <em>judgment </em>in <em>Beatty </em>and <em>Wife </em>v. Smith, (4 Yeates, 102,) decided at <em>Nisi </em>Prius, by Yeates and Smith, Judges, in 1804; nor did the counsel on either side, in that case, entertain an idea, that they were not alien on the lands of the intestate. We have, here, then, an understanding and practice of 30 years, strengthened by Judicial authority. This surely is sufficient to support, what we must all wish to support, the security of widows and orphans. I am therefore of opinion, .that this recognisance was a lien on the lands of Hamilton, taken by <em>Kean </em>at the appraisment, <em>from its date.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">3. But it is contended on behalf of <em>Close, </em>the terre-tenant, that if the recognisance was a lien, it was only an <em>equitable </em>one, and ought not to affect him, who was a purchaser for valuable consideration, without notice. To this, there are two answers. In the first place, it was not an equitable, but a <em>legal </em>lien ; a record, of which all the world was bound to \u2018 take notice. And secondly, the very deed, under which the terre-tenant derives his title, gives notice of this recognisance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>not indeed expressly, but by such reference as affects him with notice. There is nothing therefore, in this objection.</p>\n<p id=\"Avl\">4. The 4th exception is, that this action does not lie against Kean, who was discharged under the insolvent law. It lies against him without doubt, for the purpose of coming at the lands which were bound by the recognisance. It was necessary to make him a party, for the sake of the terretenant; because, possibly he might have satisfied the plaintiff\u2019s demand, before he became insolvent. The Court, upon application, would take care to guard him against an execution, which might affect the protection acquired under the insolvent law : \u2014 how far that protection went, is not now in question. It is not the plaintiff\u2019s object to disturb <em>Kean, </em>but to get his money out of the lands in the hands of the terre-tenant. For this purpose, I think it was proper to make <em>Kean </em>a party to this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\"><em>5. </em>On the trial of this cause, the defendant\u2019s counsel asked the Court to instruct the jury whether, in case they found for the plaintiff, the judgment could be executed against <em>Kean. </em>This the Court refused to do, because the jury were to find, upon the issue joined, according to the evidence, without regard to the consequences. In this, it appears to me that the Court was right. The issues were, <em>nul tiel record., </em>and payment; which could not be affected by any instruction given to the jury on the question proposed by the defendant\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-12\">There was a sixth error assigned, which was very properly abandoned. It was this, \u2014 that no declaration was filed in this cause. A <em>scire facias </em>contains the substance of a declaration, and therefore in suits of this kind, declarations have not been usual.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-13\">I am of opinion, that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b164-14\">Gibson J. and Duncan J. concurred.</judges>\n<p id=\"b164-15\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
