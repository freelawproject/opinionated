He then offered evidence to prove, that the name of <em>William </em>Allison, subscribed thereto, was the real signature of <em>William Allison. </em>It appeared, that <em>William Allison </em>was, at the time of the trial, living in <em>Erie </em>county, and no <em>subpcena </em>had been taken out to procure his attendance,' nor any rule entered, to take his deposition. The defendant thereupon, objected to the evidence offered, but the Court admitted it, and the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b322-12\">Baldwin, for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ab1r\">contended, that the subscribing witness to a paper, must be produced, whether it be lost, \u00aer in existence.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b322-13\">Farelly, contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-J\">argued, that the attesting witness is not presumed to be acquainted with the contents of a paper, or able to fix its identity, when it is not before the jury. If he had witnessed several papers, he could not tell whether his name to the one in question, were genuine, or feigned, without seeing it.</p>\n<judges data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-14\">Tilghman C. J. sick and absent.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b322-15\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"ADV\">If the paper had been produced, there is no doubt but the subscribing witness must have been called; and the only question is, what difference does its loss make. It is said, the subscribing witness is, in contemplation of law, supposed to attest nothing but the execution of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>paper, without either having a knowledge of its contents, or being able to prove its identity ; and that of course, where the paper with his own signature is not produced, he can say nothing with certainty, on the subject. But even a reasonable supposition, that a witness can recollect or say nothing of the matter, to prove which he is, in the first instance, exclusively competent, is no ground to dispense with his attendance, and the party cannot go on with secondary proof of the fact, till the state of the witness\u2019s recollection has been ascertained by producing him to the jury. Here <em>William Allison </em>would doubtless have been able to say, whether he ever witnessed any paper between the parties; (and even that would have been an important fact,) and if he could have answered in the affirmative, he might possibly have spoken of incidents and circumstances in the transaction, that would have served to establish the identity of the paper 5 and being in the first instance, exclusively. competent to prove the execution, he was also exclusively competent to prove the identity, which is a necessary part of the proof of execution itself. The judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
