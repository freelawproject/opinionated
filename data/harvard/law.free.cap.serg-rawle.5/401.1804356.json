It was tried before Tilghman C. J. in <em>February </em>last, and a verdict was found for the plaintiff for 689 dollars 28 cents. And now, on a motion by the defendants for a new trial,\u00abthe Chief Justice reported the case as follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-8\"><em>William Smiley </em>made a conveyance of all his estate, real and personal, to the defendants in trust, in the first place, to pay the debts due to certain persons mentioned in the deed of conveyance, of whom <em>Liberty Browne </em>was one. The expressions in the deed were, \u201c in trust to pay the debts due from me to the following persons respectively, vizthen followed the names of the several persons, and the debts due to each of them. In most instances, the exact debt was mentioned, but not in all. Several of them were said to be <em>about so much. Liberty Browne\u2019s </em>was \u201c about 11,000 dollars.\u201d It appeared on the trial, that the debt <em>o\u00ed Liberty Browne </em>, . - , ... , the time ol the conveyance, consisted or money lent by him to <em>William Smiley, </em>and notes drawn for his (Smiley\u2019s,) commodation; and that the whole amount was something upwards of 13,000 dollars. The Chief Justice told the jury; that if they were satisfied the two notes drawn by <em>Liberty Browne </em>in favour of <em>William </em>Smiley, and held by <em>Zalegman </em>Phillips, for whose use this suit was brought (amounting to 14,000 dollars,) were justly and fairly due at the time of the conveyance, they would be justified in finding for the plaintiff, although <em>Liberty Browne </em>had already received a dividend from funds in the hands of the defendants, on something'upwards of 11,000 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b409-16\"><em>Liberty Browne </em>was offered as a witness for the plaintiff, <em>Zalegman </em>Phillips, having first been released by Mr. Phillips, and the latter having paid into Court a sum sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>cover all the costs of suit.

The word \u201c about\u201d means \u201c nearlyan amount not much exceeding 11,000 dollars : but cannot be extended to upwards of 13,000 dollars, as was contended for by the plaintiff. <em>Johns.

Here the terms of the assignment required a release : and other creditors may have released under the impression that <em>Liberty Browne's </em>debt was 11,000, as stated in the assignment: but to extend it to 2000 dollars more, would operate unjustly as to them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-10\">2. <em>Liberty Browne </em>ought not to have been admitted as a witness: he was the plaintiff on record, and was interested in the event.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b410-11\"><em>Phillips </em>and Kittera, contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-12\">1. The amount of <em>Liberty Browne's </em>debt was not exactly known at the time of the assignment: and it was intended to prefer'him for the whole of it. The words of the assignment first include the whole debts of the respective creditors, though they afterwards refer to their amount, under a <em>videlicet. </em>The word \u201c about,\u201d has no definite limit; and must be construed by the previous words and the circumstances of the transaction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-13\">2. That <em>Liberty Browne </em>was a competent witness cannot be questioned. The case of <em>Steele </em>v. <em>The Ph\u00e6nix Insurance Company </em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is directly in point.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"Anl_\"><em> </em>3 <em>Binn. </em>306.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"Aqh\"><em> 3 Binn. </em>306.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b410-14\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b410-15\">Tilghman C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AnmA\">It has been urged as a reason for a new trial, that the word about, did not authorise so great a latitude of construction; because other creditors of <em>William. </em>Smiley, might have been induced to execute a release to him, (the terms of the assignment requiring a release, before any creditor should be entitled to a dividend,) on the supposition that <em>Liberty Brown's </em>debt amounted to no more than 11,000 dollars. Rut upon full consideration, of the instrument of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>assignment, it is the opinion of the Court, that <em>Liberty Browne\u2019s </em>debt, upon the face of the writing, appeared to be not exactly limited to the sum of 11,000 dollars, but to be left open to future adjustment,. and that the dividend was to be drawn upon the sum really due, whether more or less than 11,000 dollars. We do not mean, that the amount was so indefinite, as to reach to 20, or 30,000 dollars, but that the sum now in contest, is not an unreasonable excess. It is to be remembered, that if other creditors executed releases, so likewise did <em>Liberty </em>Broxvne, and it never could have been his interest, to have his debt estimated at less than its real amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">There is another question for consideration. <em>Liberty Browne </em>was offered as a witness for the real plaintiff, <em>Zalegman </em>Phillips, having received a release from him, and was admitted by me, though objected to by the defendants. Before his admission, Mr. <em>Phillips </em>paid into Courts a sum sufficient to cover all the costs of suit. I cannot entertain a doubt on the competency of this witness. Until he received a release, he was interested, because he stood liable to <em>Zalegman Phillips </em>as indorser of the notes held by him. \u2022 But after the release, he had no interest. It was necessary to use his name, in order to let <em>Zalegman Phillips </em>in to the fund in the hands of the assignees; but <em>Liberty Browne </em>never had any claim to the money to be recovered in this suit, which was marked on the docket, for the use of <em>Zalegman </em>Phillips, when the original writ issued. We have no court of chaneery, and therefore are obliged to sustain actions (in the name of one person, for the use of another. But in such cases, the person for whose use the suit is brought, is considered as the plaintiff: an attachment for cost's may issue against him, nor is the person whose name is made use of, liable for the costs. This I consider as our practice, long settled, and well understood. The case of <em>Steele </em>v. <em>The Thmnix Insurance </em>Company, 3 <em>Binn. </em>306, was much stronger than this. The mere circumstance therefore, of <em>Liberty Browne\u2019s </em>name being used as plaintiff, was no objection to his testimony, and having no interest in any other respect, he was a competent witness. If is the opinion of the Court, that the motion for a new trial should not be granted, and that judgment should be entered for the plaintiff, upon the. verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Motion for a new tri\u00e1l refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
