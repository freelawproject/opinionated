He also proved^ that he had, under the articles of agreement, transmitted to the defendant, a deed, dated 23d <em>July, </em>1814, which the defendant returned, because it did not properly specify the three counties of <em>Northumberland, </em>Union, and <em>Columbia. </em>On the 11th October, 1815, the plaintiff tendered to the defendant, another deed, dated on that day, reciting the conveyances above mentioned, <em>and correcting the error in the former deed, </em>but the defendant refused to accept it. This deed conveyed to the defendant, his executors, administrators, and as'signs, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>exclusive right to use the steam still and water boiler,- in the three counties of <em>Northumberland, Union, </em>and <em>Columbia, </em>but did not convey the right to vend the same. The writ issued against the defendant in this case, on the 11th October, 1815, immediately after the tender and refusal of the last deed. It appeared, that the defendant had set up stills in January, 1814, on <em>Bernard's </em>plan, and used them up to the time of the trial, but was then about relinquishing them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-5\">The defendant, in support of his pleas, and under the notice of special matter, gave evidence to shew, that the plaintiff and Clark, had represented the plaintiff\u2019s invention as new and useful, whereas in fact it was neither. He produced an exemplification of letters patent, issued <em>July </em>8th 1803, to <em>Samuel Brown, Edward West, </em>and <em>Thomas West, </em>for an improvement in distillation, by the application of steam, in wooden and other <em>stills; </em>the specification of which, they contended, embraced the principles of <em>Bernard\u2019s </em>alleged invention, and that they were used in the summer of 1814, in erecting stills in <em>Columbia </em>county by a person who threatened the defendant to bring suit against those using the invention under <em>Bernard. </em>It was proved by a certificate from the office of the Secretary of State of the <em>United States, </em>that the issuing of letters patent to <em>Bernard, </em>was at first objected to by Dr. <em>Thornton, </em>on account of their interference with <em>Brown </em>&amp;? <em>Wests' </em>patent; and that an indorsement to that effect appeared on <em>Bernard's </em>papers at <em>Washington, </em>on which he applied for a patent. The defendant also called a number of witnesses, to prove that <em>Bernard's </em>specification was imperfect and impracticable: that stills had been set up under his instructions by a number of persons, and were found to be more expensive and less productive than the ordinary ones; dangerous in their operation, and yielding spirit of a bad taste; on account of which, they had been generally abandoned after trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-6\">In the course of the trial, bills of exceptions were taken by the defendant, to evidence offered by the plaintiff, on the following points.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-7\">1. The articles of agreement of the 18th <em>July, </em>1814, the admission of which in evidence, was objected to by the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>fendant, on the ground, that the plaintiff was no party to the agreement, and that no legal authority had been shewn from him to <em>Clark.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Acp\">^he deed from the plaintiff to the defendant, dated the 11th <em>October, </em>1815, which the defendant objected to, because the alienations therein recited, had not been recorded in the office of the Secretary of State of the <em>United States.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-6\">3. The exemplification of letters patent to <em>Phares </em>Bernard, of the 16th <em>January, </em>1811, for a water boiler and steam still, which was objected to as differing from the letters patent stated in the plaintiff\u2019s replication.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-7\">After the conclusion of the arguments of the counsel, as the Court below were about to charge the jury, the counsel for the defendant submitted eight propositions to the Court, on which they requested them to charge the jui-y. But the Court decided, that they would not charge the jury upon any point not made in the argument.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-8\">The Court then charged the jury among other things, \u00e1s follows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-9\">The action is on a contract, dated 8th July, 1814, and that contract is the great guide in the determination of the cause. The defendant\u2019s counsel say that this contract is not binding, because the defendant is not entitled to an action of covenant upon it, against the plaintiff. The action can be sustained against the defendant. The contract is signed and sealed by him. If <em>Hays </em>had not performed his part of the agreement, it is possible that there might be some difficulty in an action against him. The defendant, however, might resort to <em>Clark, </em>who has signed and sealed the agreement, and under certain circumstances, he might bring an action against <em>Hays. </em>I am clearly of opinion, the action upon the agreement can be sustained by the plaintiff against the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-10\">The defendant\u2019s counsel allege, that there was no consideration. A sufficient consideration is stated in the agreement. It is true, that a suppression of truth, or suggestion of falsehood, will annul any contract. There has been much evidence given upon this subject.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-11\">If you think the defendant was cheated, the action cannot be sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>Much has been said about the patent to <em>Samuel </em>Brown, <em>Tdxvard West, </em>and <em>Thomas West, </em>prior to <em>P hares </em>Bernard\u2019s. The jury will take this into consideration. It is a circumstance to shew that the defendant was cheated. A certificate has been produced from the office of the Secretary of State of the <em>United </em>States, of an indorsement upon <em>Phares Bernard\u2019s </em>patent, referring to <em>Broxvn Wests\u2019 </em>patent. It appears that Mr. <em>Bellas </em>carried on his distillery for a number of years, and no suit was brought against him for infringing <em>Broxvn Wests\u2019 </em>patent. It is true, he was notified of their claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-7\">If you think the defendant was deceived by the representations of Clark, the fraud will protect the defendant from the payment of any damages in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-8\">A man may, if he pleases, buy an imperfect right, and if he is not imposed upon, but buys with knowledge of the imperfection, he shall in law be held to the performance of his contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-9\">Much has been said, that the deed was not transmitted by the plaintiff to the defendant, in a reasonable time after the execution of the article. By the agreement, <em>Bellas </em>was to pay one hundred dollars at the execution of the agreement, which he did. He was to receive a deed as soon as practicable, upon which he was to pay 100 dollars more, and give his bond for the residue. A deed, dated 23d July, 1814, was transmitted to the defendant. The defendant\u2019s letter to Clark, only finds fault with this deed for its defect as to the tract of country. This deed is only for <em>Northumberland </em>county; and that county had previously been divided into <em>Northumberland, </em>Union, and <em>Columbia. </em>The other deed, tendered shortly before the beginning of this suit, mentions all three counties. If the deed was not transmitted by the plaintiff to the defendant in practicable time, the jury will say so; it is for them to say.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-10\">As to the objection, that the last deed does not convey the right of vending to others to be used ; I think this conveyance does substantially transfer the right contracted for in the agreement. In the agreement, nothing is said of the right of vending to others to be used. But it is for the transfer of the patent right for that district of country, and the deed embraces all contemplated in that agreement. The first deed was the same as the second, exc^gt. as to <em>Union </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>and <em>Columbia </em>counties; and the defendant.only complained of that defect in it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AS_e\"><em>There are two points </em>for the jury to consider.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ANY\">lst- ^as <em>^e^as </em>deceived by the plaintiff or his agent \u2014 if he was, there is an end to the action. If not,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-5\">2d. Were the two conveyances of the 23d July, 1814, and 11th October, 1815, a performance of the agreement?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-6\">The Court leave the fact of the times of the tendering the deed, and the issuing the writ in this case, to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-7\">It would not be proper for the Court in the absence of tho parties, to decide on the patent rights.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-8\">The defendant is not in this action, entitled to recover back the 100 dollars he paid at the time of the execution of the articles of agreement. He may proceed for that in his action in <em>Columbia </em>county.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b442-9\"><em>Scott </em>and Binney, for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-10\">1. The declaration is defective.' The averment is, that the deed was forwarded as soon as practicable after it was made, not that it was forwarded as soon as practicable after the agreement. At the time of the contract, but ten years of the patent were unexpired, and the deed was not made for fourteen months afterwards: so that this part of the time was lost by the defendant. The contract in respect to the time mentioned in the deed,, evidently had reference to the whole subject of making, executing, and forwarding. Here the performance as alleged, differs in terms as well as in substance from the contract. The acts to be done by the plaintiff formed a condition precedent, without the due performance of which, he cannot maintain his action. 2 <em>Doug. 679. </em>690. 1 <em>Salk. 171. 1 Saund. </em>228.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b442-12\">2. The articles of agreement ought not to have been admitted in evidence, until an authority was shewn from <em>Hays </em>to <em>Clark. </em>Such authority must be by deed. 1 <em>Bac. Ab.

But a further objection is, that if there were such an authority, it was not executed. The writing was not signed by Clark, as agent or attorney; nor was the name of the principal used. <em>Comb\u2019s case.</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>2 <em>Ld.

The articles were not evidence on the plea of <em>non est factum. </em>They were declared on as the deed of both parties, when they were not the plaintiff\u2019s deed. Neither did they support the issue on the replication to the first special plea, that <em>Clark </em>had authority from <em>Hays, </em>and <em>Hays </em>was party to, and bound by the articles.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-3\">3. The deed of the 11th October, 1815, did not convey to the defendant that full right to which he was entitled by the agreement. It was merely for the right to <em>use, </em>but not for the right to <em>vend </em>the invention in the three counties ; which was a material omission. The conveyance to the defendant and his <em>assigns, </em>is not sufficient. If he assigns, he divests himself of the right <em>\u00a1 </em>whereas he ought to have the privilege of vending to others, and retaining the use also to himself. <em>Godbolt, 17 Co. Lit. </em>150. The act of Congress, distinguishes between making, using, and vending, and imposes separate penalties on each. Suppose the grantor had chosen to restrict the right of vending, can he not do so ? Then his not granting it, is tantamount to a reservation or restriction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-4\">4. The exemplification of the patent to <em>Bernard, </em>of the 16th January, 1811, was irrevelant to the issue, and a surprise upon the defendant, and ought not to have been permitted to be read. The patent put in issue, was that dated 7th <em>November, </em>1810, for a steam still and water boiler. But this was dated at a different day and year, and was for a water boiler and steam still.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-5\">5. There was error in the Court\u2019s refusing to charge on eight points stated by the defendant\u2019s counsel, because they were not made in argument.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-6\">6. The charge is erroneous. Failure of consideration was an important item in the defence, yet the Court withdrew it from the consideration of the jury, and confined their attention to the question of fraud.</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-7\">The jury were told, the consideration on the face of the deed was sufficient; whereas they ought to have been instructed, that they were to take it into view upon the evidence. <em>Steinhauer </em>v. <em>Whitman.</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Bailey </em>v. Fairplay,<footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> it is held to be error, if the Judge state only <em>part of the law, </em>and is silent as to the rest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9C\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number><em>7. </em>The not tendering a proper deed for so long a time, was a waver by the plaintiff of the agreement; and the Court ought to have so instructed the jury. What was the construction of the words, \u201c as soon as practicable,\u201d ought to have been decided by the Court; whereas they gave no construction of them, but left their meaning to the jury. 1 <em>Bac.

The articles only require, that it should be forwarded as soon as practicable after it was made; and it was alleged and proved to have been tendered on the same day it was executed. Time is an immaterial circumstance in equity. <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Patterson.</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The delay was a loss to the plaintiff; but if this were a defect, it is cured by the verdict.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-10\">2. The articles of agreement were signed by the defendant, and were therefore at all events evidence, on the plea of <em>non est factum. </em>The defendant and plaintiff both treated <em>Clark </em>as an authorised agent, and were estopped to say, that <em>Clark </em>was not an agent. The plaintiff may wave the want of a written power from himself to <em>Clark. </em>Here the' party whose name is alleged to have been used without authority, does not take the exception. <em>Ewing </em>v. <em>Tees.</em><footnotemark><em>(b</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-11\">3.

Without examining these in detail, I shall consider the principles of law on which they depend ; and in doing so, I shall inquire whether the contract was originally binding on Bellas, and whether if it were, <em>Hays </em>could support this suit, under all the circumstances of the case, and particularly under the present form of the declaration. I will then consider one or two exceptions that belong to no particular class.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">To the original obligatory effect of the contract, it is objected, that it does not appear that <em>Clark </em>had authority; and even if he had, that he ought to have sealed the instrument, not in his own name, but as the attorney of <em>Hays; </em>without which the latter could not be bound, and consequently that neither is bound.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-13\">Every authority of this kind, must be by deed, that it may appear, whether the attorney had a valid commission, and whether it were duly pursued. <em>Co. Lit. </em>48. b. There wag no evidence of the existence of a letter of attorney to Clark, and what operation the want of it ought to have on the obligatory effect of the contract, was directly made a question for the opinion of the Court. On this ground then, it is plain, <em>Hays </em>was not bound by the contract; but I take it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>the articles were nevertheless admissible <em>evidence </em>on the issue of <em>non est factum.s </em>for being in any event the deed of <em>Bellas, </em>they went to support the issue on the part of the plaintiff, who, being bound to no particular order of proof, might, if he pleased, give the articles of agreement in evidence first, and offer the letter of attorney afterwards. The first bill of exceptions is, therefore, not sustained. Then as to the other ground; the article of agreement purports, on its face, to be made between <em>Hays, </em>the plaintiff, <em>by his agent Clark, </em>and the defendant; but it is signed and sealed by the two last only, and <em>not by Hays. </em>It is clear beyond dispute, this was not a good execution of the authority, if any existed. <em>Comb\u2019s case, </em>9 <em>Rep. 76. </em>b, is express, that the act must be done in the name of the principal, and sealing being an essential part of the execution of a deed, the seal of the person giving the authority must be affixed. In 3 <em>Vin. Ab. Authority, F. </em>pl. 4, there is a case exactly like the present. The king authorised a certain surveyor to make leases, who executed the power by deeds, beginning as in the case before us, as if the principal were a party, and concluding, \u201c in witness whereof the said surveyor hath put <em>his </em>sealand it was held, he ought to have put, not his own seal merely, but that of the king. But the counsel for the plaintiff, relies on evidence of acts of confirmation, by both parties treating these articles as obligatory on <em>Hays. </em>But can any confirmation short of putting his seal to it, make the writing the deed of <em>Hays, </em>so as to give <em>Bellas </em>a remedy at law on it as such ? \u2014 An, imperfect specialty contract may be so ratified by parol, as to give an action of <em>assumpsits </em>but here, mutuality of remedy on the same instrument is the essential matter. On both grounds then, I think <em>Hays </em>was not bound. It does not follow however, that in every case, neither will be bound if both are not: for covenant may be maintained on a deed poll. The true distinction appears to be taken in <em>Northcott </em>v. <em>Underhill, </em>1 <em>Ld. Raym. 388, </em>where it is laid down, that <em>relative covenants are void, whenever the matters to which they relate, and on which they depend, cannot by the deed take effect. </em>It was the case of a mortgage, with a covenant in the same instrument to pay the money, and the deed for want of enrolment being insufficient to pass an estate in the land, it was argued the covenant was therefore void; but as it was separate and independent, it was held, it might well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>stand by itself. But in <em>Fromentin </em>v. <em>Small, </em>2 <em>Ld. Raym. </em>1418, the case was very like the present. The plaintiff was the attorney of <em>James Fromentin, </em>and in his name, and as his attorney, demised a house to the defendant, who covenanted to pay the rent. In an action of covenant, in which non payment of the rent was assigned as a breach, there was a demurrer; and it was admitted by counsel, and denied -by nobody, that Jumes <em>Fromentin the principal, could not have maintained covenant on the lease, because he was no party to the </em>deed; and it was adjudged by the Court, the action would not lie even in the name of the attorney, who <em>was </em>a party, because the lease being void, <em>the covenant to pay the rent, was also void. </em>Where however, the covenants are independent, either party may sue without regard to the validity of the covenants on the part of the other. Now in the case under consideration, payment of the purchase money was entirely dependant on the conveyance of the right; insomuch, that the latter was expressly made a condition precedent. By the articles, <em>Hays </em>was bound to nothing, and <em>Bellas </em>ought not to be bound or discharged as <em>Hays </em>might choose to consider him. As then the articles of agreement created no responsibility, and were altogether inoperative, the direction of the Court was, in this particular, wrong, and the judgment must be reversed.'</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The point just disposed of being decisive against the plaintiff\u2019s right, it would be unnecessary to pursue -the inquiry further, were it not that an act of assembly renders it the duty of this Court, to pronounce an opinion- on every point decided by the -Court below: The defendant contends the contract was void on-the ground of want of consideration also, because he gave evidence to affect the\" validity of the patent right contracted for, and also to shew the invention was not valuable. Of this the J udge took no further notice, than as it might be evidence of <em>actualfraud, </em>on which, alone, he, as to this part of the cause, put the inquiry to the jury ; and this he did without deciding on the validity of the respective patents. I do not consider the evidence so important on the ground of want of consideration as <em>misconception by the parties, of the existence of a fact: </em>although I agree, that where the Consideration is an equivalent for the obligation which the other party incurs, failure of it is -a good ground for relief. But I choose to consider the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>on the ground of mistake, which is perhaps not very dif. ferent from want of consideration. At first view there appears to be some contradiction in the cases on the subject- several, mistake only, without suppression of the truth or suggestion of a falsehood, has been held insufficient to set aside the agreement, as in <em>Can </em>v. <em>Can, </em>1 <em>P. Wms. 723. </em>So in <em>Pullen v.Ready, 2 Atk. 587, </em>Lord Hardwicke says, \u201c there is nothing more mischievous than for this Court to decree a forfeiture after an agreement, in which, if there is any mistake, it is the mistake of <em>all </em>the parties to the articles, and <em>no one of them is more under an imposition than the </em>others.\u201d It will be found, however, this doctrine is applicable only to cases where the right or thing, which is the subject of the contract, is evidently of itself <em>doubtful, </em>which is a circumstance always sufficient to support an agreement, if no unfair advantage be taken in other respects. In such case, the assent of the parties to treat on the subject as it then stood being complete and full, they proceed on an evident supposition, that the fact which is the cause of the agreement is doubtful, and each is understood to take on himself the risk of its turning out in a way favourable to him. On this principle, every wager and every contract pf insurance depend; and without it there could be no such thing as a compromise of a doubtful right. Where a p\u00e1rticular fact is known to he doubtful, or supposed to be so, if the party to be benefited neglect to secure himself by a covenant, he will be without remedy, if it turn out contrary to his expectations, for he will be considered as having paid his money for the benefit of a chance. It would seem to me, that whether the invention which is the subject of the plaintiff\u2019s patent were valuable or not, was in its nature doubtful, and that the defendant took the risk of that matter on himself ; but the validity of the right, on the ground of originality of invention, is another matter of which I will sp\u00e9ak hereafter. The cases of this kind, to be found in the books mostly relate to agreements, the intention of which was to settle family disputes, which is a favourite object with courts of chancery; yet even there it is held, the parties must be acquainted with their rights as <em>far as they can bt ascertained, </em>or at least <em>with the nature and extent of the information that can be obtained respecting them, </em>which in the absence of fraud is going pretty far. <em>Pusey </em>v. <em>Disbouverie, 3 P, Wms. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>316. There is however another class of cases where an agreement entered into on an erroneous presumption by one of the parties of the existence of a fact, is held to be as to him of no force, for he gave his assent to the agreement, not absolutely, but on conditions which are not verified by the event: and it will be immaterial, whether all parties were equally ignorant or not; for if there was any concealment of a fact within the knowledge of the opposite party, that of itself constitutes fraud, which is a distinct ground of relief. Thus in <em>Cocking </em>v. <em>Pratt , </em>1 <em>Ves. </em>400, an intestate\u2019s widow and daughter entered into an agreement as to the personal estate: the daughter married and died: the husband brought a bill to be relieved against the agreement, on the ground of mistake on the part of his wife as to the value of her share. Sir <em>John </em>Strange, in the absence of the chancellor, observed, that whether there had been <em>suppressio </em>veri, was not clear on the evidence, but that there was <em>another </em>foundation to interpose, to wit, that it afterwards appeared the personal estate was greater than the daughter supposed, and that the husband would be permitted to come into chancery to <em>take advantage of her want of knowledge. </em>So in <em>Lansdown </em>v. Lansdown, Mosely, 364, where two brothers claiming an estate applied to a country schoolmaster, who, (as was to be expected,) ignorantly gave it in favour of the younger, because he had read in the clerks\u2019 remembrancer that lands cannot ascend, and thereupon the eldest having consented to divide the land, saying he would rather do so than go to law even if he had the right, and having created deeds of lease and release, these were decreed to be delivered up, although there was riothing like concealment, or exclusive knowledge of a fact or any thing else, imputable to any one. There are many other cases to the same purpose. <em>Turner </em>v. Turner, 2 <em>Ch. Rep. </em>11. <em>Bingham </em>v. Bingham, 1 <em>Ves. </em>126. <em>Gee </em>v. Spencer, 1 <em>Vern. </em>32, and <em>Luxford's case </em>there cited. If then the patent right of <em>Bernard </em>were invalid, there can be little doubt the defendant would not be bound by the contract; for it is out of all reason to suppose he purchased the right under any other notion than that of its being a valid one. Yet I confess I cannot see how, on the present state of the pleadings, he could take advantage of the defect; for, according to the decision of this Court in <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>Cooper, 3 Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>564, an equitable ground of relief must be put on the record, and instead of pleading ignorance and misconception of the fact, he has put his defence by the special pleas, on want of consideration coupled with actual fraud, which is a totally different ground. It cannot be said there was <em>no </em>consideration ; for the very sealing of a deed, is in equity as well as at law, evidence of consideration, and although equity will sometimes postpone the payment of a voluntary bond to other debts, yet as between the parties it will not relieve the obligor from the payment of his obligation even where there is no pretence of consideration, unless he can affect the obligee by direct evidence of-fraud. <em>Wright </em>v. Moore, 1 <em>Ch. </em>Ca. 157. The issue., then, was fraud or not, and did not embrace the ground of mere mistake. In putting the case, therefore, to, the jury on the point raised by the pleadings, the Court did very right. Still, however, the Judge erred in refusing to instruct the jury on the subject of the relative validity of the conflicting patent rights; for that w.as a consideration as necessary to settle the question of fraud, as that of ignorance and mistake. The reason given, that the patentees were not parties in Court is entitled to no weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">But taking these matters to be in favour of the plaintiff, the question would still occur,has he entitled himself to this suit by executing and tendering a conveyance of the right, according to the true intent and meaning of the articles ? Per- \u25a0 formance of his part of the agreement within a reasonable time is expressly made a condition precedent. It was the obvious meaning of the parties, that the final deed was to be executed and transmitted within a reasonable time from the <em>date of the articles. </em>\u201c The said <em>James </em>agrees to complete and perfect the said conveyance by deeds duly executed and acknowledged, <em>and as soon as practicable forward </em>to the said <em>Hugh.\u201d </em>I pay not the least regard to juxtaposition. As the time \"the patent had to run was hourly expiring, it was an important object to the defendant to obtain the conveyance as soon as possible : common sense therefore requires, that the words \u201c as soon as practicable\u201d should, notwithstanding their relative position in the sentence, be applied as well to the execution as to the transmission of the deed. That time should not unnecessarily elapse between these two periods only, could not be particularly important, but that both should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>, arrive as early as possible, was essential to the full enjoyment of the <em>property to be </em>acquired, the value of which was daily decreasing. The averment in the declaration, that the plaintiff executed a conveyance on a certain day, and transmitted it as soon as practicable after-wards, is consequently ill: it should be, that he both executed, and transmitted, as soon as practicable after the execution of the articles ; or, if there were special circumstances equivalent, in equity, to strict performance at the stipulated time, such, for instance, as acquiescence by the defendant, these ought to have been specially set out, to give the opposite party an opportunity to traverse or demur. This not having been done, the defect is not helped by the verdict: for by the express terms of the contract, the plaintiff could not, before performance on his own part, call on the defendant for any thing; and the omission of a part of the title is a defect that nothing can cure. The declaration was, doubtless, drawn in the present form to meet the truth of the case, which would, I am inclined to think, preclude the plaintiff from recovering, under any form of pleading. ' Generally speaking, time is not, in equity, of the essence of the contract: but would chancery under the circumstances of this case dispense with strict performance ? That would pretty much depend, as to one ground of defence, upon whether the plaintiff had practised any considerable delay. An interval of fifteen months, between the execution of the articles and the tender of the deed, would certainly require very particular circumstances to justify it. The case of <em>Gibson </em>v. Patterson, 1 <em>Atk. </em>12, in which Lord Hardwicke is made to treat time as altogether immaterial, is not supported by -later decisions; and it is now fully established that considerable delay, without sufficient reason to account for it, will be considered satisfactory evidence of abandonment. But there are other instances, independent of abandonment, where time is essential: for if after the period at which the plaintiff ought to have performed his part, circumstances occur which materially alter the value of the property, or diminish the benefit of the contract, equity will not interpose. In the case before us, every hour decreased the value of the property, and rendered the consummation of the agreement an object of less interest to the defendant. Could the plaintiff on the ground of a compensation, tender a deed on the last day of the patented term, and maintain a suit ?. The pre~ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>sent case differs from that only in degree. I have no doubt equity would hold jurisdiction of this contract, for the purpose of executing it specifically, although it relates to a personal <em>chattel; </em>and this as well on account of the inadequate nature of the satisfaction to be obtained at law, as that of the agreement itself being incomplete, and intended to be perfected by a subsequent agreement: but in giving a plaintiff, in an action at law, all the benefit arising from equitable considerations that he could obtain in chancery, we must take care that we do not outrun the precedents in the chancery books. On the case disclosed by the evidence, therefore, I am of opinion the plaintiff would not be entitled to recover. As to the correctness of the opinion of the Court on the question, whether the deed tendered contained a power to vend, it is unnecessary to decide. That was a question that did not necessarily arise; for the plaintiff having averred, though defectively, performance of all necessary covenants on his part, without such averment being traversed by the other side, that matter, as well as the intervening of a reasonable time between the tender and the commencement of the suit, (if time were necessary to enable the defendant to perform the covenants on his part, which I am far from being disposed to grant,) was admitted by the pleadings. I have no doubt, however, that a special grant of the right of vending, over and above that of making and using, was unnecessary. It is true, the act of Congress directs, that the grant by the letters patent shall include the right of \u201c making, constructing, using, and <em>vending to others to he used;\u201d </em>and hence it is inferred, the right of vending is separate from that of making and using. But the exclusive right of fabricating and using necessarily comprises the <em>whole beneficial interest; </em>and the right of parting with it or any part of it is incident to the right of property. The latter was specially secured by the act of Congress <em>ex majori cautela, to </em>obviate all difficulty on the subject. Here the contract contemplated the <em>exclusive </em>right within a certain district, so as to give the defendant the <em>-whole </em>interest: he could therefore dispose of it at his pleasure. Who could call him to account? The case would be different, if he were, by the articles, to be admitted only to a <em>participation </em>in the right; for he could in that case, without a special authority, transfer only his own individual right of making and using, and could not while he retained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>'.t, introduce another person under it; and the right to assign at all being personal, might, by an express stipulation, even be restrained. Whether a condition not to assign would, in a conveyance of the whole right, though for a district, be void, on the ground of public policy, it is unnecessary to decide, because the deed tendered contains no such restraint; but admitting it might, as contended, be done, still the want of an express power to convey, is very different from an express restraint.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">Two miscellaneous, exceptions of'minor importance remain : An exemplification of a patent to Bernard, dated 16th January, 1811, was offered and admitted after it was objected to*. The defendant had pleaded specially, that the patent right which the plaintiff contracted to convey to him was invalid. To this the plaintiff replied, that <em>Bernard </em>had obtained letters patent, <em>dated </em>17th <em>November, </em>1810, for a new and useful improvement, being \u201ca steam stilL and water boiler,\u201d and that the right by sundry conveyances was vested in him, and that this was what he contracted to convey. <em>Bernard </em>had in fact obtained two patents, differing not only in date, but also in the name or style of the improvement patented; one being called a steam still and water boiler, and the other a water boiler and steam still. This difference, though trivial, nevertheless served, along with that between the dates, to shew that the patent offered was not the one the validity of which was put in issue. On this state of the pleadings, which seems to have not been adverted to by the Court, I cannot see what the evidence had to do with the question. As it was in every shape irrelevant, it tended to confuse the jury, and was improperly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">After the conclusion of the arguments of counsel the de-&gt; fendant submitted eight points, on which he prayed the Court to instruct the jury, but this the Court refused, because those points had not been made in the argument. A party proposing a question to the Court may, if he thinks proper, wave the benefit of argument; but it is fair, not only towards the opposite counsel but the Court, that the former have an opportunity of being heard before a decision takes place. This as a matter of practice, every Court has power to direct by an appropriate rule ; but, without a rule, I very much doubt their right to refuse to decide. They may call on the opposite party to speak to the question proposed; \u25a0 but they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>bound to instruct the jury, if the questions are not entirely irrelevant to the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"AUg\">The judgment must be reversed ; but as the declaration is defective, and it besides appears that the plaintiff cannot in any event recover, the Court will not award a <em>venire facias de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
