The summons issued the 17th September, 1817, and the declaration states the cause of action as having accrued on the 25th <em>September, </em>1817. <em>Miller </em>v.

The law fixes the day in July, to which the writ was returnable, and the clerk ought to have made it returnable on that day, because the <em>prcecipe </em>was for a writ to the <em>July </em>Term.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">As to the error assigned by the plaintiff in error, we think it fatal. It appears on the record, that the action was commenced before the justice, before the cause of action accrued. We have decided this point before. The judgment must therefore be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">The defendant\u2019s counsel then moved for a <em>venire de </em>novo, which the Court refused, because no error was shewn in any thing which took place during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
