and the Court having rejected it, sealed a bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-10\">The deposition of <em>John Foster </em>was, that on Friday, the 13th <em>May, </em>1814, he found concealed amongst briers near to a fence, on Mrs. <em>Wilson\u2019s </em>farm, the two sleeves, collar, and part of the tail of a linen shirt, each piece of which was more or less bloody, especially the lower part of the shirt;\u2014 that the said shirt was very much mutilated and cut, apparently with a knife, as if,done for the purpose of preventing the same from being recognised or known ; \u2014 that the blood on the tail of said shirt, appeared as if it had been sprinkled on it, or had gushed against itthat parts of the shirt were not there; \u2014 and that it had lain out on the ground ever since, during the whole of the rainy weather ; \u2014 and that several other persons saw said pieces of the shirt, before the blood was washed out by the rain.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b200-11\"><em>Ellmaker </em>and <em>Irvine, </em>for the plaintiff in error, contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-12\">1. That the declaration was defective, neither the time nor place of uttering the words charged, being laid with certainty. Two places, and two times are mentioned. The words, then and there, refer to the murder of <em>Isaac Wills.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b200-13\">2. The evidence offered, went in some measure to contradict that given by the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses. It likewise went in mitigation of damages, as it shewed that the words spoken, were not uttered maliciously; and that the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses were mistaken as to them. The words offered to be proved, were spoken before suit brought, and about the same time as those proved by the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses. 9 <em>Johns. </em>45. 53.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b201-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number><em>Fisher </em>and <em>Hopkins, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ApN\">1. The declaration mentions both time and place: <em>viz. </em>the 5th <em>July, </em>1814, at Cumberland, to wit, at the county of <em>Dauphin. </em>Even had there been an omission of them, as they are not material in this case, advantage could be taken of it only on demurrer: the defect is cured by verdict. <em>Stat. </em>4 <em>Anne, </em>c. 16. 18 <em>Eliz. </em>c. 14. 16, and 17th <em>Car. 2. </em>c. 8. 4 Yeates, 423. 426.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b201-8\">2. The plaintiff having proved the words laid in the declaration, the defendant offered to prove, that he had spoken differently, at a different time j which was making evidence for himself. Evidence may be given in mitigation of damages, of what has been told the party by other persons ; but not of what was said by the defendant himself.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b201-9\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b201-10\">Gibson J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6_\">The declaration charges, that the defendant below, on the 5th <em>July, 1814, </em>at the county of <em>Cumberland, </em>to wit, in the county of <em>Dauphin, </em>m a certain discourse which he then and there had, of, and concerning the plaintiff, and of, and concerning the murder of a certain <em>Isaac Wills, </em>who <em>before that time, </em>was killed and murdered, he, the said defendant, <em>then atid </em>there, uttered the words for which the suit was brought; and it is assigned for error, that neither the time nor place is laid with sufficient certainty. This is a principal objection. There is but one time certain stated ; and the words, \u201c then and there,\u201d refer to it with convenient certainty, which is all that is requisite. It would be a strained construction, to say the speaking of the words should, by reference, be taken to have been at the <em>time of the </em>murder, which is indefinite, and was itself stated, relatively, as having happened before the <em>colloquium </em>in which the actionable words were uttered. We will not read a declaration so as to make it nonsense, when the arrangement and natural import of the words render it intelligible. This also applies to the alleged want of certainty in laying the <em>place. </em>The proper county is stated in the margin, and if it were necessary, we would intend the words \u201c <em>then and there f </em>referred to the margin. But although the words are stated to have been uttered in <em>Cumberland </em>county, it is laid with a <em>scilicit, \u201c\u25a0 </em>to wit, at the county of <em>Dauphin, \u201d </em>and we will intend that <em>Cumberland </em>county is a place within the county of <em>Dauphin. </em>It was un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>necessary to introduce another county into the declaration, to enable the plaintiff to give evidence of words spoken there,; but as the words are at the same time expressly laid as having been spoken in the proper county, it is well enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">At the trial, the defendant offered to prove he had been in the habit of repeating the story in a manner, different in some essential respects, from the expressions charged in the declaration, first having proved, that the circumstances, related by him on those occasions, were true. It is impossible to doubt the propriety of the rejection of this evidence. It neither met, nor extenuated the charge. If he accused the plaintiff falsely, it could be of no moment that on other occasions he adhered to the truth. Nothing the defendant said at a different time, can be evidence in his own favour. The case of <em>Coleman </em>v. Southwick, is easily distinguished from the present. There it was held, a defendant might, in mitigation of damages, shew he believed, at the time of publishing, that the libellous matter was true ; that he <em>made enquiries </em>to ascertain the fact; and obtained information that led him into error. It is evident this could be admitted only on the ground of the fact of enquiry having been made, and not on account of any thing the defendant had said ; for his questions would be evidence only ta explain the answers, when taken in connection with them. There is a material difference between a party\u2019s declaraions andhisacts. Here, we have nothing to distinguish the evidence from the naked declarations of a party offered in his own favour. There was nothing in them tending to impeach the accuracy of those who proved the words as laid ; for it does not necessarily follow, that a person who is in the habit of telling a story one way, may not sometimes repeat it in another. Nor is the circumstance of having at other times related the story truly, together with the circumstances on which the suspicions of the defendant rested, any evidence of want of malice, but the contrary; for it tends to shew the defendant knew the accusation, and the facts alleged in support of it, to be without foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
