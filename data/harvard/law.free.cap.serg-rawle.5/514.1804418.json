The defendant objected to the bond\u2019s being given in evidence, on the ground thut the plaintiffs were not stated in the agreement to enter the action, to be the assignees of <em>Samitel </em>York, but of <em>George Farquhar. </em>But the objection was overruled by the Court, and the bond admitted in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-23\">The defendant had given a notice to the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to produce on trial the general assignment of <em>George Farquhar </em>to the plaintiffs, with the schedule annexed, and also all the books, papers, and accounts of the said <em>George Farquhar, </em>and a statement of the monies and other properties- received by them under the s/iid assignment. On the trial, he offered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>to read in evidence, the said assignment of <em>George Farquhar </em>to the plaintiffs, in order to shew that the defendant was one of the preferred creditors.

The action was in the name of <em>Thomas Latimer </em>and <em>Joshua Lippincott, </em>assignees of <em>George </em>Farquhar, but the declaration set forth an assignment from <em>Samuel York </em>to the plaintiffs. There is, therefore, a variance in a material point.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b523-6\"><em>Tod, </em>contra, was stopped by the Court.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b523-7\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b523-8\">Duncan J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYuu\">The <em>narr. </em>and bond correspond. If apy advantage could have been taken of the variance between the docket entry of the action, and the <em>narr., </em>it should have been on demurrer. The evidence was certainly good on the issue joined. As to the special matter offered by the defendant, it was not admissible, because notice was not given. It was not properly a discount, because it was necessary to connect special matter with it, in order to render it evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">Judgment for the plaintiffs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
