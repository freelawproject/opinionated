An appearance was entered on the docket, opposite the defendants* names, in the following manner: \u00ab <em>S.

Upon this list, there was the following entry made by the president of the Court: \u201c 28th <em>May, </em>1812, Mr. <em>J. M.

Although the acknowledgment is made in behalf of the \u201c defendant,\u201d in the singular number, which in strictness, is applicable only to one ; yet if the attorney who confessed the judgment had appeared for both, there might perhaps be a difference: but here it is plain, Mr. <em>Riddle </em>considered himself throughout as the attorney of only <em>John Kimmel, </em>and as the execution is against both defendants, while the judgment is against but one, it must be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">Execution set aside.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
