The defendant also gave in evidence, that in the year 1807, <em>Robert Haslet </em>had purchased the land which he was to convey to <em>John Brotherton, </em>of <em>Thomas </em>and <em>James Wallace, </em>for the sum of <em>16651. 5s. 7d. </em>of which, 300/. were payable the 1st <em>April, </em>1809, and the residue by instalments of 100/, annually, for which he passed his bonds, secured by a mortgage of the premises. The defendant also gave evidence, that he had paid several sums of money to <em>Robert Haslet, </em>and also paid several of the bonds given by <em>Robert Haslet </em>to <em>Wallace; </em>and that he had conveyed to <em>Robert </em>Haslet, the tract of land which he had agreed to convey, on the 1st <em>April, </em>1809. The defendant then offered to give in evidence, a judgment entered on the 17th <em>July, </em>1810, on one of the bonds given by <em>Robert Haslet </em>to <em>Wallace </em>as aforesaid, and an execution issued on the said judgment, and levied on the land, which <em>Robert Haslet </em>had agreed to con-vey to the defendant. To this evidence, the plaintiff objected, and the Court of Common Pleas rejected it, and sealed a bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-7\">The defendant also offered evidence, to shew, that <em>Robert Haslet\u2019s </em>wife had declared, she never would execute a deed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>for the land which her husband had agreed to convey to the defendant.

And though the land had not been sold, but only levied on, this amounts to a damnification to the amount of the execution. In <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Williamson,</em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it is decided by this Court, that a debt, of which the defendant is equitable owner may be set-off: and the' Chief Justice says, that e\u00ab the cause is much stronger in this Court, than in the English courts of common law : because here an equitable defence is pleadable.\u201d Our defalcation act is more extensive in its language, than the British statutes of set-off. 3 <em>Yeates, </em>9 : and in <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Thompson,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it was held, that a sum in the nature of stipulated damages for breach of agreement, may be set-off.

The defendant had no such defence. He could make no claim on <em>Robert Haslet, </em>until he paid the money. There is no remedy for the purchaser while he is in possession, and has not been evicted at law. 1 <em>Johns. Ch. Rep. </em>218. One who sues for damages against a person bound to remove incumbrances, can only recover nominal damages, unless he has paid the incumbrances. <em>Princet </em>v. <em>Truman. </em>If this set-off had been allowed, and then <em>Robert Haslet </em>had been sued by <em>Wallace, </em>he could not have taken advantage of it as a defence. The judgment was not a lien on the land sold by <em>Robert Haslet </em>to <em>John Truxal: </em>it was not entered till after the sale. Besides, it is doubtful whether any thing can be set-off against an assignee, which does not arise out of the original transaction. <em>Add.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"ArXZ\">The defendant contends, that in equity, the plaintiff ought not to recover on this bond, while he negleets to make him a good title for the land which has been levied on by <em>Wallace, </em>through his default: and that the judgment and execution were good evidence to shew the m-jury he has sustained. But there are great difficulties in the way of this defence. The bond on which this suit is brought, is unconnected with the agreement between the plaintiff and defendant. The defendant has involved himself in this trouble by becoming security for <em>John Truxal, </em>who purchased of the plaintiff. It is not a question, whether the defendant shall be compelled to pay for the land which he purchased of the defendant, while the plaintiff refuses to make him a title. That would have been a strong defence. But the defendant wishes to <em>set-off, </em>against the bond in which he became security for <em>yohn Truxal, </em>certain damages which he supposes he has sustained in another transaction. Now even if such damages could be matter of set-off, it does not appear that the judgment and execution are available evidence, because the defendant has paid nothing on account of the judgment; nor has the land been sold by virtue of the execution, nor can it lawfully be sold, because it was not the property of the plaintiff, at the time of issuing the execution, or at the time of rendering the judgment, having been sold by the plaintiff to the defendant, before the judgment. The judgment therefore, was no lien upon the land. Suppose now, that the defendant should be allowed the benefit of a set-off in this suit, to the amount of <em>Wallace\u2019s </em>judgment against the plaintiff, and afterwards <em>Wallace, </em>finding that the land was not bound, should issue an execution against the personal property of the plaintiff, or against his body; could the plaintiff in such case, plead, that he had paid the judgment by a discount allowed to the defendant in this suit ? Certainly not. Then he would have to pay <em>Wallace\u2019s </em>debt twice; which shews the impropriety of suffering the defendant to give in evidence, a judgment and execution by which he has not sustained any damages. I am therefore of opinion, that the evidence was properly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">There is another bill of exceptions in this cause. The defendant offered to prove, that <em>Robert Haslet\u2019s </em>wife, had declared she never would, execute a deed for the land which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>her husband had agreed to convey to the defendant. This evidence was rejected by the Court, and rightly. Her declaration was immaterial. It does not appear by the agreement, that her husband had covenanted that she should join in the deed. And as for damage, there was not the least reason to suppose, that any damage had been sustained by her declaration. She might change her mind afterwards, and sign the deed; or, she might die before her husband, and then her right of dower would be extinct. Her declaration, then, could in no point of view avail the defendant as a defence against the bond on which this suit was brought. I am therefore of opinion, that there is no error in this record, and the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
