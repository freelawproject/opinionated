When the note fell due it was not paid, but renewed. The defendant, however, did not indorse the renewed note, but gave a written engagement by which he guaranteed the payment. <em>Orth </em>was known to be in embarrassed circumstances, and when the second note fell due, he proposed to renew it again. <em>Hassinger </em>then told Solms, (the plaintiff below,) that he had sworn not to guarantee another note, but requested him to do it, and promised to indemnify him. Accordingly the plaintiff guaranteed the third note. Just before the third note fell due, the defendant told the plaintiff that he was going out of town, to avoid importunity on the subject, and cautioned him to see that the note was either paid by Orth, or protested; and expressly declared, that if renewed again, he would have nothing to do with it. Notwithstanding this caution, the plaintiff consented that the note should be withdrawn from the bank in which it had been placed, upon payment of 215 dollars in part, and a new note given for the balance, with <em>John Cook </em>as indorser, and the plaintiff again warranted the note. When the defendant returned to the city and was informed of what had been done, he said to Eberth, \u201c never mind, I will pay it.\u201d Being told of the additional indorser, he said; \u201che is as good as the bank; I will warrant the payment.\u201d This note was not paid by Orth, upon which it was protested, and was afterwards paid by the plaintiff, who brought this suit, and declared on a general <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>for money paid for the use of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-6\">The Court below charged the jury, that <em>Solms </em>was bound to obey his instructions as the agent of <em>Hassinger, </em>and if the matter had stopt there, they thought that in strict law, the plaintiff could not recover. But the question was, whether <em>Hassinger </em>did not by his subsequent declarations and conduct, approve and sanction the act of <em>Solms, </em>as his agent in taking part, and renewing the note for the residue. This was a fact for the jury, on the whole evidence, to decjde.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-7\">As to the consideration to support the <em>assumpsit, </em>was not <em>Hassinger </em>benefited by the renewal of the note ? If the note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>had been protested, he would have been liable, and bound to pay the whole amount of the prior note. By the renewal he certainly saved $215. So far he was benefited; and whether the prior note, would have been paid, if not renewed, depended on a contingency. <em>Orth\u2019s </em>ability, at that time, to pay, was at least very doubtful. He had declared,\u2019 that he was unable to take up the note ; then as <em>Solms </em>was responsible to Eberth, and <em>Hassinger </em>to Solms, to get what he could, and to increase the security for the balance by getting another indorser, seemed to be the suggestion of prudence and for the benefit of <em>Hassinger, </em>and if he afterwards approved the conduct of <em>Solnps </em>in renewing the note, and assumed to pay, the consideration is sufficient to sustain the action, as an implied authority, and request to do the act may reasonably be inferred. <em>Hassinger </em>had strong inducements to be satisfied with the arrangement. He was liable for the whole sum originally; and by this renewal for part, he secured $215, and had an additional indorser, whom he then believed to be good as security for the balance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-5\">As to the form of action it was contended, that the declaration should have stated a special assumpsit, and that the plaintiff could not recover in a general <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>for money paid. It seems a sufficient answer, that upon the evidence, if you credit it, Solms, at the request of <em>Has-singer, </em>became bound to pay <em>Eberth, </em>if <em>Orth </em>did not take up the note ; and <em>Hassinger </em>was to re-pay <em>Solms. </em>Then as <em>Solms </em>paid <em>Eberth, </em>upon the failure of <em>Orth, </em>at the request of <em>Has-singer, Hassinger </em>is liable, in this form- of action, to <em>Solms </em>for the money so paid at his request.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b14-6\">The jury found a verdict in favour of <em>Solms </em>for 680 dollars 28 cents, on which judgment was entered.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AR\"><em>J.

It is possible the renewing of <em>Orth\u2019s </em>note was .an injury to the defendant, as <em>'Orth, </em>if it had not been renewed, being then a bank director, might have found means to pay it. But even if it were a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>benefit, still a voluntary benefit done to another does not raise an implied promise on his part, to recompense the par<em>ty. </em>A voluntary curtesy is no consideration for an <em>assumpsit.

He was, therefore, discharged from all the responsibility to which he was before liable, and if he made any new promise it was without consideration, and a <em>nudum pactum. </em>The Court below placed the case on the ground, that <em>Solms </em>was the agent of <em>Bassinger. </em>But there is nothing like agency in the transaction. It was an assumption of a fact by the Court, and it - is error for the Court to decide a fact. An agent is one who is appointed to do something for his <em>principal; </em>but \u2019here <em>Solms </em>was to do nothing, but let things take their own. course. He cannot, by unwarrantably interfering, create an obligation upon <em>Bassinger, </em>contrary to his express comjnands.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b15-6\"><em>Phillips, </em>in answer,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AO5Y\">observed, that the circumstances plainly shewed, that <em>Solms </em>was the agent of <em>Bassinger, </em>and in that capacity came into the business. The latter had sworn, that he would not guarantee a note ; and procured the former to do it on an engagement to indemnify him. Whether <em>Solms </em>was an agent was submitted to the jury; and they have by their verdict, decided that he was. -It is at least doubtful, whether <em>Bassinger </em>was not benefited by payment of part of the note, and a renewal of it for the residue with a new indorser. It is obvious, that he thought he was ; and from his declarations, the jury were warranted in inferring an authority on his part to do what was done. At any rate, they were a ratification of <em>Solms\u2019s </em>act; and that ratification being made in consideration of an act that may have been beneficial to <em>Massinger, </em>and which he thought was so, is equal to a pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>vious command, agreeably to the maxim, <em>omnis ratihabitie retrotrahitur et mandato equiparatur. </em>Where a benefit re-suits, a promise after the benefit done is binding. 1 <em>Com. on Cont. </em>23.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b16-4\">Tilghman C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7M\">The Judge of the District Court, in which this cause was tried, left it to the jury to decide, whether the defendant had ratified the act of the plaintiff in guaranteeing the last note, on payment of $215, and obtaining a new indorser; and gave them his opinion, that in case they should think the plaintiff\u2019s proceedings had been ratified, he might recover in this action. We are not now considering a special verdict. No facts are found, and the only question is, whether the Judge erred in law, in his charge to the jury. In order to determine the correctness of the opinion, that the plaintiff was entitled to a recovery, in case his acts were ratified by the defendant, we must suppose that his acts were ratified.</p>\n<p id=\"A-c\">Then applying the maxim, \u201cthat the ratification of any act is, in law, equivalent to a command or request to do that act,\u201d and the case will stand thus: \u2014 The defendant being responsible for the payment of the note which fell due soon after he left town, the plaintiff at his request had that note withdrawn from bank, and made himself responsible for the last note, which he afterwards paid, not voluntarily,/but because he was bound to pay it. Can this be considered as money paid for the use of the defendant ? I think it may. It is not unlike the case of a surety, who, having paid the debt, may recover against his principal, in a general action of <em>indebitatus as</em>sumpsit, on an <em>implied promise. </em>No man, by a voluntary payment, can make himself the creditor of another and recover against him. But where he pays a debt, for which he has become responsible, at the request of another, the law implies an assumption. But, it is objected, that the defendant having warned the plaintiff, that he would have nothing to do with any note which should be given after he left town, he thereby became discharged from all responsibility for the last note, and any promise made afterwards was <em>nudum pactum. </em>Therefore, it is said, the Judge was wrong in submitting to the jury the fact of the defendant\u2019s having ratified the act of the plaintiff. It is very true, that a promise made without consideration, is void. But can it be said, that there. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Was no consideration for an engagement by the defendant to ratify the act of the plaintiff? If the note for which the defendant was responsible, had not been withdrawn from bank, he might perhaps have lost the whole by <em>Orth's </em>insolvency. Whereas, by withdrawing it, he secured payment of part and obtained the chance of benefit from a new indorser. Perhaps, indeed, if the note had not been withdrawn, the whole might have been paid by <em>Orth. </em>It is a doubtful matter; but when the defendant approved the conduct of the plaintiff, it may be presumed, that he was conscious of having received a benefit. It would be hard in such case to presume, that he received no benefit, and if he received any benefit, it is not <em>nudum pactum. </em>Concerning the merits of this case, I never had any doubt. A man, who, in the defendant\u2019s situation, made a promise of payment, certainly ought to pay. But I had doubts concerning the form of action. Upon reflection, however, I am satisfied. Where one man, at the request of another, becomes responsible to a third person for the payment of money, he may, upon making payment, recover against the person who requested him, as for money paid <em>for fiis use; </em>and that too, although the person making the request be not benefitted by the payment. In <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Hunt</em>bach., 1 <em>Burr. </em>373. the defendant, <em>Huntbach, </em>requested the plaintiff to pay a sum of money to some labourers who were working in the garden of <em>another person. </em>And it was held, \u2022that the plaintiff might recover, as for money paid <em>for the use of the defendant. </em>The case befor'e us has been perplexed by considering it as a promise made by the defendant to Eberth, to pay the last note. It will be simplified, by considering it in the view in which it was submitted by the Judge to the jury; that is to say, by considering what was said by the defendant to Eberth, as evidence of his assent to the act of the plaintiff, in withdrawing one note and becoming responsible for the other. And of this it was powerful evidence, for why should the defendant say, that he would pay the note unless he approved of the plaintiff\u2019s conduct? Upon the whole, I perceive no error in the Judge\u2019s charge, and am, therefore, of opinion, that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b17-5\">Gibson J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7q\">The material facts are simply these: <em>Hassinger, </em>the defendant below, being the holder of <em>Henry Orth's </em>note, paid it away to <em>Joseph </em>Eberth, for carpenter\u2019s work, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>who passed it to his brother <em>Conrad Eberth, </em>and received the amount in cash. When it became due, it was renewed by a note drawn by the firm of <em>Orth </em>and <em>Kean, </em>at sixty days, and guaranteed, though not indorsed by <em>Hassinger. </em>When this second note became due, it was renewed and guaranteed as before, for sixty days longer. When the third became due, application was again made to <em>Hassinger, </em>but wishing to disengage himself, he refused to continue his responsibility, alleging he had bound himself by an oath not to guarantee another note. However, being pressed, he consented to indemnify the plaintiff <em>Solms, </em>if he would guarantee the note proposed. <em>Solms </em>agreed to do so; and on this footing matters were arranged. Just before this fourth note became due, <em>Hassinger </em>told <em>Solms </em>he was going out of town to avoid importunity on the subject, and desired him, if it were not paid, to let it be protested, but on no account to have it renewed, and if it were renewed, it would be at the risk of <em>Eberth </em>and <em>Solms, </em>for he, (Hassinger) would have nothing more to do with it. Notwithstanding this, the note was withdrawn from bank, where it had been deposited for collection, and 215 dollars being paid, a new note with an additional indorser was given, <em>Solms </em>again warranting the payment. <em>Hassinger </em>returned to town, and in conversation with <em>Conrad Eberth, </em>being informed of what had been done, said \u201c never mind, I will pay it.\u201d Being told of the additional indorser, he said \u201c he is as good as the bank, I will warrant the payment.\u201d <em>Solms </em>was ultimately compelled to pay the note.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-9\">On this statement of facts, .1 do not see how it is possible for the plaintiff to recover. The Judge who tried the cause, left it to the jury to consider <em>Solms </em>as the agent of <em>Hassinger, </em>and entitled to recover for a loss sustained in the course of his agency; and that though the loss arose from an act done contrary to the express instructions of his principal, yet as the act was in fact beneficial to the principal, who after-wards ratified it, there was a good consideration for an <em>assumpsit, </em>and the jury might <em>presume </em>the act to have been done at the instance and request of the principal. From this opinion, I entirely dissent. There is nothing in the evidence to shew that <em>Solms </em>warranted the note as the agent of <em>Has-singer. </em>Whether the facts given in evidence were true, was for the consideration of the jury; but whether the evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>if true, shewed that the parties stood in the relation of principal and agent, was a question of law. There is nothing in the evidence, from which an agency can be inferred. <em>Solms </em>did not contract as an agent, for he rendered himself personally liable; he did not pretend, nor was it understood he had any authority to bind Massinger, who was not to be looked to by Eberth, in any event. <em>Solms </em>at first entered into an engagement at the request of Massinger, and under a promise of indemnity, it is true, but that is a very different thing from doing the business as the agent of the latter. Thus stood matters at the first transaction, between <em>Massinger </em>and <em>Solms. </em>Nor can the previous existence of the relation of principal and agent be inferred from <em>Massinger </em>having after-wards instructed <em>Solms </em>not to permit the note to be renewed. This was in fact not an instruction to an agent, but a declaration that he would not, in the event of a renewal, continue his engagement of indemnity. But if <em>Solms </em>had been an agent in the first instance, he was so only <em>pro hac vice, </em>and it does not follow, that he was an agent when he last guaranteed the note. It cannot be pretended he acted by authority; for all previous authority, if any existed, had been withdrawn <em>\u00a1 </em>and there certainly was no general authority. Where there is a general authority, or perhaps a limited one to do one act, or transact one piece of business, and the agent transcends his powers, the principal may ratify the act as between him and the person with whom the agent contracted; for such ratification amounts to a new agreement by the principal, which if he please, he may well make without the intervention of an agent. But as between the principal and agent, the matter stands on different ground. The agent in such case, has no claim either to indemnity or compensation, and even an express promise to that effect, would be <em>nudum pactum. </em>Here there was no moral obligation resting on <em>Massinger, </em>to indemnify <em>Solms. </em>It is said, that procuring payment of a part of the former note, and a new indorser, was a substantial benefit; but <em>Massinger </em>was the best judge of that; and it might have been otherwise, for <em>Orth </em>and <em>Kean </em>might perhaps have raised the money, rather than suffer their note to be protested. But be that as it may, every man has a right to manage his own affairs in his own way, and no one has a right to interfere and make him responsible for a supposed benefit imposed against his wishes. Then there being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>no moral obligation, .even an express promise from <em>Hassinger </em>to <em>Solms, </em>would have been <em>nudum pactum. </em>There was, how* ever, no express promise. The renewing of the note with <em>So \u00bfms\u2019s </em>guarantee, was a transaction, to which <em>Hassinger\u2019s </em>former promise of indemnity did not extend; and his promise to <em>Conrad </em>Eberth, cannot be considered as enuring to the benefit of <em>Solms. </em>It never was so intended. To <em>Eberth, </em>the defendant promised to pay the note; but a promise to indemnify <em>Solms, </em>wouid have been collateral to payment. There might have been, and in fact was, good reason to distinguish between the <em>Eberths </em>and <em>Solms; </em>the loss in the end might have rested on the former, and <em>Hassinger </em>was bound in conscience to keep them clear, as he passed to them, in. payment of a fair debt, the original note, which was received as matter of favour to him. But with regard to <em>Solms, </em>who acted in direct opposition to his wishes, and therefore took the whole responsibility on his own shoulders, the case was quite different; he renewed his guarantee not only without the request of the defendant, but against his express declarations that he did not wish him to do so, and that if he did, it would be at his peril. There was therefore no express promise to <em>Solms; </em>there was a promise to <em>Eberth, </em>and if the question were between him and the defendant, the consideration might possibly be deemed sufficient. A moral obligation is a good consideration for an express promise, although it is not sufficient to raise an <em>assumpsit </em>by implication of law; but, as between the <em>plaintiff </em>and defendant, there was neither express promise, nor moral obligation. There is nothing in the transaction, to raise a promise from the relation in which 'the parties stood ; principal and agent is out of the question; engagement to <em>Solms, </em>there was none; and his having acted in direct opposition to the request of <em>Hassinger, </em>absolves the latter from all obligation, moral or honorary. But the substantial objection is, the Judge left to the jury, to presume from the promise to <em>Eberth, </em>and against clear evidence to the contrary, that <em>Solms </em>acted in pursuance of the instructions, and at the request of <em>Hassinger. </em>This was left to the jury, as a <em>legal </em>presumption; for no one will pretend an admission of the actual <em>fact </em>in any wise followed, from the conversation with <em>Eberth. </em>But if \"the matter were left as a presumption of fact, the charge was still wrong; for though a jury may draw any conclusion, that in their judg-, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>ment the evidence will warrant, yet they are not at liberty to presume the existence of a fact, without any evidence, or contrary to what their judgment informs them, is the truth of the case ; and to instruct them they may do so, is, I apprehend, error. But no legal presumption arose. If, in this case, an authority and precedent request can be implied, it may be so in every instance, where, in the estimation of the jury, the act is beneficial 5 and this would render the necessity of a precedent request merely nominal, which is a substantial part of the plaintiff\u2019s case, that must be <em>proved. Hayes </em>v. Warren, 2 <em>Stra. </em>933. What is there here to distinguish the case ? Barely the promise to pay <em>Eberth. </em>Now granting the renewal of the note was in fact beneficial, yet the plaintiff could not support an action directly, on even a promise to <em>indemnify </em>him, if made not to himself, but to <em>Eberth; </em>it will follow pretty clear, he can derive no benefit in a <em>collateral </em>way, from any promise to <em>Eberth. </em>That he could not sustain an action, is settled. No one can maintain <em>assumpsit, </em>on an agreement to which he is not a party. <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>Jor</em>dan, <em>Cro. Eliz. </em>369. The rule however, has been softened, ivhere the consideration is a provision for a child, but in no other case. <em>Dutton </em>v. Poole, 1 <em>Vent. </em>318. <em>Rookwood\u2019s case, Cro. Eliz. </em>163. <em>Bourne </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>1 <em>Vent. </em>6; as where the defendant\u2019s father, who was also father to the plaintiff\u2019s wife, was about to cut down 1000/. worth of timber, as a portion for her; whereupon defendant promised his father, that <em>he </em>would pay the 1000/., if his father would not fell the timber. Held on motion, this was a sort of debt due the daughter, and a provision, and that she could maintain an <em>assumpsit, </em>though a mere stranger could not. A stronger case was cited, where a physician was promised money for himself, and also for his daughter, if he would perform a certain cure; it was held, the <em>near relationship </em>gave the daughter the benefit of the consideration performed by her father, and that she might maintain <em>assumpsit. </em>Upon the same ground, the promise must be made to the <em>plaintiff himself, </em>for general declarations are not sufficient, 1 <em>Roll. Abr. </em>6; as where in a discourse between the father of A. and B., touching a marriage between the daughter of B. and A.; B. said, he would give 100/. to whoever would marry his daughter with his consent; A. did marry her with his consent, and brought <em>assumpsit; </em>held, these declarations did not amount to a promise to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>plaintiff himself, and therefore gave no right of action. This was before the statute of frauds, which, in <em>England, </em>renders such a promise void, on another ground. I mention these cases, to shew that a stranger to the consideration, or to the promise, can derive no benefit from it. <em>Soims, </em>was a stranger not only to the promise to Eberth, but also to the consideration, which was a personal obligation to <em>Eberth; </em>and if he could not maintain a suit, directly founded on it, I am at a loss to know, how he can make it indirectly the foundation of an action. There is no special <em>assumpsit </em>laid in the declaration, and this suit is not pretended to be founded on any express promise to either <em>Eberth </em>or Soims, but on an implied promise, in consideration of an act done at the request of the defendant; and a promise to a third person not importing any acknowledgment of a request, is left to the jury as raising a legal presumption, or as evidence sufficient to justify them in implying an actual request, and this too, in direct contradiction to the acknowledged truth of the fact. This is to give indirectly and by a fiction, an action to a person, not a party to the promise, and in this instance, a stranger to the consideration; and to this I object, as error. The Judge who tried the cause seems to have been strongly impressed with the natural equity of the plaintiff\u2019s demand; in a court of error, however, that cannot enter into the consideration of a Judge, without extreme danger of the established principles of law being thereby warped; and therefore, if I even concurred in the existence of any claim on the defendant\u2019s honour or conscience, I should refuse it any operation, in discussing the abstract principles of law. I am of opinion, the judgment ought to be reversed.</p>\n<author id=\"b22-4\">Duncan J.</author>\n<p id=\"AnE\">The charge of the Court is objected to, on four different grounds:</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">1st.

To the form of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>The statement of the evidence furnishes abundant matter to shew, that <em>Hassinger </em>was under an equitable obligation to pay. <em>Hassinger </em>was originally liable. The note, as passed to Eberth, was his act; he promised to be responsible when he passed it to <em>Eberth </em>When it fell due, it was renewed. It was then known that Orth, if not insolvent, was in very doubtful circumstances. The renewed note was not indorsed by <em>Hassinger; </em>but he guaranteed the payment. Upon the third note falling due, <em>Orth </em>called to have his guarantee renewed ; but <em>Hassinger, </em>instead of renewing it himself, applied to Solms, declaring to him, that he had sworn not to give a fourth guarantee, but requested the plaintiff to guarantee it, and he would indemnify him. This <em>Solms, </em>on his request, did. When this was about coming due, <em>Hassinger </em>fearing the importunity of <em>Orth, </em>went out of town to avoid it; instructed <em>Solms </em>not to have it renewed, but let it be protested; that if renewed, he would have nothing to do with it. When it fell due, it was withdrawn from the bank, 215 dollars being paid, and anew note from <em>Orth </em>to Eberth, with <em>John Cook </em>indorser, and Solms\u2019s guarantee. Hassinger, when he returned to the city, and was informed of what had been done, said he would pay the note which had been renewed. <em>Solms </em>has paid the note; <em>Orth </em>and <em>Cook </em>having become insolvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">This would be considered as between <em>Solms </em>and <em>Hassinger, </em>as the original debt of <em>Hassinger; </em>and there then would be more than an equitable consideration for the subsequent promise. But if the consideration was barely equitable; and I think there can be no doubt, but that <em>Hassinger, </em>having introduced <em>Solms </em>into the business, if <em>Hassinger </em>was satisfied that <em>Solms </em>had done.the best he could for his interest; that the debt had been diminished 215 dollars; another name had been added for his security, as good as the bank, \u2022 as <em>Hassinger </em>expressed himself; that this promise, was only to do, what an honest man ought to; the ties of conscience on an upright man, are a sufficient consideration; and though no court of law or equity could have enforced the payment, yet this affords a sufficient consideration, if not to raise an implied <em>assumpsit, </em>to support an express promise. <em>Cowp. </em>290. 5 <em>Binn. </em>33. 3 <em>Hen. &amp; Munf. </em>184.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-8\">However this doctrine may have been shaken, by subsesequent decisions in <em>England, </em>I consider it as adopted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Pennsylvania, to the extent of such consideration supporting an express promise. Hassinger, previous to the subsequent promise, had received a benefit; the consideration was originally beneficial to him, and this surely was a sufficient consideration. <em>Hassinger </em>in all fairness, on his return, if he intended not to be further bound, should have said so ; 'instead of which, he renews his original guarantee ; <em>takes the </em>note, <em>finally on himself; </em>throws <em>Solms </em>off his guard, by assuming <em>responsibility; </em>placing <em>Solms </em>precisely in the state he stood on his first guarantee'. This renovation of the original promise, may be aptly compared to the case of a negotiable promissory note, where no demand has been made on the drawer. Though the indorser' is discharged, and though the law be, that if he afterwards promise, it is <em>nudum pactum ; </em>yet if, with full knowledge that <em>no demand had been made on the </em>promisor, he undertakes to pay, such promise is binding. <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Liswell, </em>12 <em>Mass. </em>52. Here the promise could not be founded either in mistake of the law, or the fact. He must know how far he intended to be bound by his original promise ; how far he was absolved from that promise, by the renewal of the note against his instructions; and with full knowledge of the whole, he waives the instructions j dispenses with the order he had given <em>Solms; </em>ratifies the act of his agent; renovates the original promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">But it is said, the subsequent promise was made, not to Solms, but to <em>Eberth. Eberth </em>was not a mere stranger, but the party ultimately to be benefited by Hassinger, through the medium of <em>Solms\u2019s </em>guarantee. It was not a mere speech in discourse with a stranger; but a solemn renewal of his guarantee, made in the name of a party in interest. This promise, thus made to Eberth, being for the benefit of <em>Solms, </em>he may maintain an action on it. For the law seems well settled now, whatever contradiction may be in the more ancient cases, that if one person makes a promise to another, for the benefit of a third, that third may maintain an action on it. But the declaration of <em>Hassinger </em>to Eberth, may bff considered as a confession of his liability to <em>Solms ; </em>a declaration of a fact. The fact of the original agency cannot be <em>doubted; </em>that <em>Solms </em>came into the guarantee, as the agent of Hassinger, and for the purpose of getting Hassinger\u2019s name off the paper; and it was a fact submitted to the jury to say, whether the subsequent declarations of <em>Hassinger. </em>did not sane<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>tion the act of <em>Solms </em>in taking part, and procuring a renewal of the note for the residue, with an indorser, supposed to be sufficient for the balance. Now the jury might infer, from the conversation between <em>Hassinger </em>and Eberth, that <em>Has-singer </em>did adopt Solms\u2019s act; and there could be no other reason for his declaration to Eberth, that he would see that note paid. If he did adopt, and the jury have found he did, his subsequent assent would be equivalent to an original authority; and the acts of the principal are to be construed liberally, in favour of the adoption of the acts of the agent, and may be made out, not by express terms of ratification, but circumstances proving an assent, approbation, and acting as if adopted ; as here by declaring he would pay the renewed note.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\">As to the form of action, this was not a collateral promise, but an undertaking. Do you stand in my shoes, as to this guarantee, and if you are obliged to pay the debt, I will pay you. It is the money paid at his request. You are to be the ostensible man, I am to be kept out of view ; but if you are called on to pay the. note, I will afford the means, and repay you, what you are thus obliged to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">If <em>Hassinger </em>had paid the note for <em>Orth, Hassinger </em>could have supported this general count against <em>Orth. Solms </em>has been obliged to pay it for <em>Hassinger; </em>it is then, money paid at the request of Hassinger, and for his use. There was a moral obligation on <em>Hassinger </em>to pay the note renewed ; and with full knowledge he assumes to pay it. This promise would extend to the benefit of <em>Solms. </em>If <em>Solms </em>had intruded himself into the transaction, and had of his own accord paid the debt of <em>Hassinger, </em>made <em>Hassinger </em>his debtor against his will, he could not support this action. But as at the request of Hassinger, he made himself liable to pay a debt for which <em>Hassinger </em>was bound, and as he was called on and did pay, the previous request by <em>Hassinger </em>to <em>Solms </em>to stand in his place, and his subsequent promise to pay the note; this previous request on which <em>Solms </em>thus agreed to stand in his place, would run through the whole transaction; and all things done by <em>Solms </em>which he bound himself to perform, as here to pay the note, all things necessarily incident to the situation in which <em>Solms </em>was placed at the request of <em>Hassinger, </em>would, in contemplation of law, be considered as done at his <em>request, </em>and consequently that the pavment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>was at the request of <em>Hassinger. </em>To <em>Eberth </em>holding the note, <em>Hassinger </em>says, I will pay the note guaranteed by <em>Solms.. </em>This being for the benefit of <em>Solms </em>would exactly stand as a promise made to him, it being for his <em>benefit. </em>He does not pay. <em>Solms </em>in consequence of the previous request of <em>Hassinger </em>is bound to pay. Hence, it seems a natural construction, that the money paid to <em>Eberth </em>was at the request of <em>Hassinger. </em>The whole must be considered as one transaction; and from the time <em>Solms </em>became a party to it, there was a privity of law between <em>Eberth </em>and Solms, and between <em>Solms </em>and Hassinger, when <em>Hassinger </em>promised to pay the note. It is for these reasons I am of opinion, connecting the whole transaction, uniting its several parts, that <em>Solms </em>did all that he did at the request of <em>Hassinger; </em>that the renewed guarantee, by the adoption of Hassinger, was, as if he had requested it to have been done ; that when it was done, he promised to pay the note to the holder; that Solms, having been bound at his request to pay that <em>very </em>note, and having paid it, it will be considered as if paid at his <em>request.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">Where an agent pays money for which he had rendered himself liable for the principal, within the scope of his authority, an action for money paid and laid out, will lie against the principal.. But the rule I consider as a <em>general </em>one, that where one at the request of another has rendered himself liable to pay the debt of that other, and has paid it, this action will lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">Where one gives bond for another, at his instance and pays it, this action will lie, unless he has taken a security of a higher nature for his indemnity; and it is on this principle, all the doctrine of contribution rests. If the party is sued, he may have an action on the promise of indemnity, before he has <em>paid the </em>money, for he is damnified by the suit; but if he has paid the money, he may <em>recover </em>it in this form of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">Where one guaranteed the payment of goods to be furnished, for which he was obliged to pay, he recovered in an action for money lent and advanced, and money paid to the use of the defendants', without objection to the form of declaration. <em>Warrington </em>v. <em>Furbor, </em>8 East, 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">The contract on which his cause of action arose being then no longer executory, the objection founded on the stipulation being matter of special contract, does not apply. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>It cannot form any objection to the form of declaration ; and I think that it is a general practice, where one man has guaranteed the debt of another and paid that debt, to declare as for money paid, &amp;c. On the whole view of this case, it appears to me to be a loan of the name of <em>Solms </em>for the accommodation of Hassinger, and having on that loan paid the money, he is entitled to recover in this form of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
