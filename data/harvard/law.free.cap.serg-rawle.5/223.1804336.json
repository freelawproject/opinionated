The sale was made on the 25th August, 1813, on an <em>alias venditioni ex-</em>ponas, returnable to the <em>August </em>Term. The deed was knowledged on the 26th November, the Term following, and tendered to Probst, who refused to accept it. The estate was formerly owned by one <em>Henry Hendricks, </em>and was sold as his property by the sheriff to <em>E. R. Evans, </em>and the deed acknowledged and delivered to <em>E. R. Evans, </em>on the 30th \u00b0 ,, , <em>November, </em>1810. The defendants contended, that <em>Evans s </em>title was defective ; that he was trustee for <em>Hendricks: </em>and to prove it, gave in evidence the following receipt given <em>by Evans, </em>on the 1st <em>February, </em>1811. \u201c I received of <em>Jo hn </em>Zimmerman, five hundred and seventy-five dollars, and cents, for 95 acres, 138 perches of <em>FI. Hendricks's </em>land.\u2019\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>Signed, <em>E. R. </em>Evans. And they offered to prove the declarations of <em>E. R. Evans, </em>soon after his purchase, that he had bought in the land for Hendricks, who was his client, and for whom he acted, and who had satisfied him for his services ; that this receipt was for money paid him on <em>Hendricks'1 s </em>account, to repay the money <em>Evans </em>had paid the sheriff, and that <em>Hendricks </em>was to have the land, on paying him'the whole money. This evidence was objected to by the plaintiff, and overruled by the Court. The defendant excepted to their opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b232-8\"><em>Lachells, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b232-9\"><em>Probst </em>purchased at sheriff\u2019s sale, the land in dispute, as the property of <em>E.

The contract is, to buy the title such as it is, whether good or bad: but a purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale, is a purchaser for a valuable consideration, and cannot be affected by a secret trust, of which he has no notice. It is held in <em>Heister\u2019s lessee </em>v. <em>Fortner,</em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that the purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale is, like other purchasers, protected by the want of notice. <em>Lazarus\u2019s lessee v. </em>Bryson,<footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> <em>Sugd. on Vend. </em>416. 476.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b232-14\">\u0430) 1 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle, </em>458.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"ANt\"> 2 <em>Binn. </em>40.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"AUL\"> 6 <em>Binn, 54.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b232-12\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b232-13\">Duncan J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkX\">If this was an ejectment between <em>Evans, or </em>his heirs, and <em>Hendricks; </em>this evidence, connected as it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>with the receipt, would have established the trust, and on the payment of the money, <em>Hendricks </em>would hold the land. But if <em>Evans </em>had sold to one who had no notice of the trust, the sale could not be disturbed. A purchaser without notice of a trust, never can be affected by it. This doctrine is fully considered, in <em>Lazarus's Lessee </em>v. Bryson, 2 Binn., and is a plain principle of natural justice, and an established rule in equity. If <em>Probst </em>had received the deed from the sheriff, and paid <em>the </em>purchase money, he could have recovered the land from <em>Hendricks: </em>for here was a public sale, <em>Hendricks </em>living on the land, and never giving notice. It would have been the duty of <em>Hendricks </em>to have called on the administrators of <em>Evans </em>and paid the balance. The lands never would have been returned to the sheriff by them ; and if they had, he should have given notice at the time of sale. But here, he lies by, from February, 1811, to <em>November, </em>1813, and it is not until after the acknowledgment of the deed, that he gives notice. No man would purchase at sheriff\u2019s sale, if such secret trust could defeat his purchase. The purchaser knew that <em>Hendricks </em>was in possession: but the public records informed him, that his interest had been sold to Evans, and the sale confirmed by the Court, and the deed acknowledged in Court, delivered to him. A sale by the sheriff, has been compared to a conveyance with special warranty,' in which case it has been decided, that if there is a manifest defect of title, the purchase money, although bond has been given for it, cannot be recovered. But there is not the least resemblance. The sale by sheriff excludes all warranty. The purchaser takes ail risque. He buys on his own knowledge and judgment. <em>Caveat emptor, </em>applies in all its force to him. If this were not the law, an execution, which is the end of the law, would only be the commencement of a new controversy ; the creditor kept at bay during a series of suits, before he could reap the fruits of his judgment and execution. A party may sell his claim to lands, whatever they may <em>be; </em>and if there is no covenant other than an express stipulation, that he sells only his own interest, unless he has been guilty of some misrepresentation as to the intent, or some fraudulent concealment, he may recover <em>the </em>purchase money. Lands at sheriff\u2019s sale, are frequently sold greatly below their value, because the usual understanding is, that the purchaser takes his chance of the1 title. An inadequacy of price, is no reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>to set aside a Sale on the application of the defendant in the execution; the defect of title is no reason to set it aside on the application of the purchaser. I speak of sales fairly made ; for fraud will affect these, as it will all other sales. Here was no fraud in the sale. Here was no application by the purchaser, to set it aside, the first Court, nor the second Court. The party buys, and gives himself no further trouble <em>; </em>the sheriff makes out, executes, and acknowledges the deed, and tenders it to him, and when, after many months, he is called on for payment, he suggests a defect of <em>title; </em>w-hile if he had accepted the deed, this title never could dis- - turb him. <em>Probst </em>was liable to pay on the sale. He could not be affected by subsequent notice of a secret trust. The same protection was afforded to him, as if he then had paid his money, and taken the deed. In this case, <em>Evans </em>held the legal title <em>; </em>and the legal title discharged of the trust was transferred to <em>Probst. </em>But he had likewise a beneficial interest to cover the balance of the money he had paid on <em>Hendricks\u2019s </em>account.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">The Court properly overruled the evidence, and the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
