Dex-amyl is a combination drug containing Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine sulfate), an appetite suppressant, and amobarbital, a barbituate designed to reduce the possible adverse side effects of Dexedrine. On August 24, 1976, the Acting Commissioner of Food and Drugs published an order denying SKF a hearing and refusing to approve the pending new drug applications (NDAs) for Dexamyl. 41 Fed.Reg. 35741 (1976). SKF petitions this court to reverse the Acting Commissioner\u2019s summary judgment order and to remand to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for an evidentiary hearing pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(c).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at \u00a7 355(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1110\">*1110</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-4\">A. <em>The Statutory and Regulatory Framework</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1172-5\">The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) prohibits the marketing in interstate commerce of any \u201cnew drug\u201d unless an NDA for the drug has been approved.' <em>See </em>'21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(a). In 1962 the Act was amended to define \u201cnew drug\u201d to mean any drug not generally recognized as safe and effective for its intended use. <em>See </em>76 Stat. 781, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(p). The Amendments provided that an NDA would not be approved if it were found, \u201cafter due notice to the applicant . . . and giving him an opportunity for a hearing,\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(d), that there was a lack of \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d that the drug was effective for its intended use. <em>Id. </em>Substantial evidence was defined to mean:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aa2-dedup-0\">evidence consisting of adequate and well-controlled investigations, including clinical investigations, by experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug involved, on the basis of which it could fairly and responsibly be concluded by such experts that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling or proposed labeling thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"abp-dedup-0\"><em>Id. </em>The Amendments exempted certain drugs from the requirement of providing substantial evidence as to their effectiveness. A \u201cgrandfather\u201d clause provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aovl\">In the case of any drug which, on the first day immediately preceding the enactment date, (A) was commercially used or sold in the United States, (B) was not a new drug as defined by section 201(p) of the basic Act as then in force, and (C) was not covered by an effective application under section 505 of that Act [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355], the amendments to section 201(p) [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(p)] made by this Act shall not apply to such drug when intended solely for use under conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in labeling with respect to such drug on that day.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1172-11\">Section 107(c)(4), 76 Stat. 789 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-12\">FDA has promulgated regulations implementing this statutory scheme. <em>See </em>21 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1111\">*1111</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 371(a). It has required that for a fixed combination prescription drug such as Dexamyl substantial evidence must be presented both that the drug is effective for its intended use and that each constituent component contributes to the claimed effects. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.50(a) (1977). In addition, FDA has specified criteria for the \u201cadequate and well-controlled investigations\u201d acceptable as substantial evidence of effectiveness.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although the Act appears to contemplate a hearing if FDA does not approve an NDA, see 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 355(c), 355(d), <em>supra </em>note 2, FDA has developed summary judgment procedures in cases where an applicant has failed to submit substantial evidence of drug efficacy sufficient to meet regulatory standards.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1112\">*1112</page-number>Supreme Court has in principle approved such procedures, stating that, \u201c[w]e cannot impute to Congress the design of requiring, nor does due process demand, a hearing when it appears conclusively from the applicant\u2019s \u2018pleadings\u2019 that the application cannot succeed.\u201d <em>Weinberger v. Hynson, </em>Wes-<em>cott &amp; Dunning, Inc., </em>412 U.S. 609, 621, 93 S.Ct. 2469, 2479, 37 L.Ed.2d 207 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-4\">B. <em>Proceedings Before FDA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1174-5\">When SKF decided to market Dexamyl tablets in 1949, it advised FDA of its position that the drug was not a \u201cnew drug\u201d under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Appendix B at lb-2b.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> FDA agreed and informed SKF of its conclusion that Dexamyl was not a new drug.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 5b. Thus no NDA was ever filed for Dexa-myl.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1174-10\">When the 1962 Amendments changed the statutory definition of a \u201cnew drug\u201d to designate one not generally recognized by experts as safe and effective for its intended use and in addition required substantial evidence of efficacy, FDA was faced with the massive task of reevaluating almost all marketed drugs.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> For assistance in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1113\">*1113</page-number>task, FDA retained the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council (NAS-NRC) to create expert panels to review the efficacy of drugs by class. One such expert panel studied certain amphetamine combination products. On August 18, 1970, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs announced his concurrence with the panel\u2019s finding that these products were only \u201cpossibly effective\u201d for their claimed anorectic effects.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> 35 Fed.Reg. 12678 (1970). The Commissioner invited those who held NDAs for these products and \u201cpersons marketing any of these drugs without approval\u201d to \u201csubmit in a supplemental or original new-drug application data to provide substantial evidence of effectiveness . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12679.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-5\">On August 6,1971, SKF submitted NDAs for Dexamyl, together with a letter stating its position that Dexamyl was covered by the \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d of the 1962 Amendments and was thus not subject to the efficacy requirement. Joint Appendix (J.A.) at 3-6. FDA informed SKF by letter on January 15,1973, that these NDAs were not approvable because \u201c[t]he studies submitted fail to demonstrate the contribution of the sedative-tranquilizer constituent to the total effect of the drug.\u201d J.A. at 15. Under FDA regulations, SKF was given 30 days to make a \u201cwritten request to file the application over protest.\u201d 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 130.-5(d) (1973).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Within the 30-day period, on February 12, 1973, SKF requested that its Dexamyl NDAs be filed over protest, again noting its position that Dexamyl was grandfathered under the 1962 Amendments. J.A. at 17-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b1175-12\">On the same day, February 12,1973, FDA published in the Federal Register an \u201cOpportunity for Hearing on Proposal to Withdraw Approval of New Drug Applications,\u201d in which FDA stated that information concerning the efficacy of combination anorectic drugs that had been submitted in response to its August 8, 1970 notice was \u201cfound not to provide substantial evidence that the drugs are effective as fixed combinations for their claimed uses.\u201d 38 Fed. Reg. 4279 (1973). FDA proposed to withdraw approval of the listed NDAs and stated that \u201c[a]ll identical, related, or similar products, not the subject of an approved new drug application, are covered by the new drug application(s) reviewed.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>An NDA holder \u201cor any other interested person\u201d could request an evidentiary hearing on the issues involved. <em>Id. </em>at 4280.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-4\">SKF responded to the February 12, 1973 notice although the notice had not mentioned Dexamyl by name. J.A. at 21-26. SKF stated, first, that Dexamyl was not covered by the NDAs reviewed in the notice.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> SKF went on to argue, however, that, assuming that Dexamyl was so covered, SKF had presented sufficient evidence in its previous submissions to require a full evidentiary hearing. On March 30, 1973, FDA approved the continued marketing of Dexamyl pending a ruling on SKF\u2019s request for a hearing. 38 Fed.Reg. 8290 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-5\">On July 11, 1973, SKF submitted to FDA the results of five, new, double-blind, clinical trials testing the efficacy of Dexamyl (multi-investigator clinical trials). J.A. at 27-31. Two weeks later, on July 27, 1973, FDA informed SKF by letter that the record regarding Dexamyl was closed as of that date, and that no further data would be accepted from SKF. J.A. at 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-6\">Three years later, on August 24, 1976, FDA published an order denying a hearing and refusing to approve the pending NDAs for Dexamyl. 41 Fed.Reg. 35741 (1976). The Acting Commissioner of Food and Drugs stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1176-16\">that (1) there is a lack of substantial evidence that Dexamyl products have the effects they are represented to have under the conditions of use recommended, suggested or prescribed in their labeling and (2) there is a lack of substantial evidence that each component of the combination products contributes to the total effects claimed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1176-17\">Smith, Kline and French has failed to offer any data or legal reason to demonstrate the existence of a genuine and substantial issue of fact requiring a hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1176-18\"><em>Id. </em>at 35754. The Acting Commissioner based his holding on the fact that none of the evidence submitted by SKF met the regulatory standards for adequate and well-controlled clinical studies. The Acting Commissioner also concluded that Dexamyl was covered by the NDAs of the drugs named in the February 12,1973 order,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>that therefore Dexamyl was not grandfathered under the 1962 Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-4\">The order of August 24 provided that it was to become effective on September 3, but on August 26 SKF filed with FDA a petition for reconsideration and for an administrative stay pending judicial review. J.A. at 104-19. FDA denied the request for reconsideration, but granted the stay. <em>Id. </em>at 121. On October 15, 1976, SKF filed in this court a petition for the review of FDA\u2019s August 24 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-5\">Prior to August 24, SKF had received no criticism from FDA of SKF\u2019s multi-investi-gator clinical trials. After reviewing FDA\u2019s August 24 order, SKF asked Herbert Solomon, Ph.D., Professor of Statistics at Stanford University, and William M. War-dell, M.D., Ph.D., Associate Professor of Pharmacology and Toxicology at the University of Rochester Medical Center, to review these studies. These two experts prepared affidavits averring that the studies were adequate and well-controlled clinical investigations under applicable scientific and regulatory standards. Stating that the restricted time frame surrounding the issuance of the August 24 order \u201cmade it impossible for SK&amp;F to present an evaluation of FDA\u2019s factual contentions regarding the Dexamyl studies in its August 26 request,\u201d SKF appended the Solomon and Wardell affidavits to a supplemental request for reconsideration on November 24, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-10\">FDA denied this request on December 8, 1976. SKF subsequently moved this court to remand the case to FDA with directions that it reconsider its order of August 24 in light of SKF\u2019s supplemental request for reconsideration and the attached affidavits. On January 19, 1977, this court denied SKF\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-11\">II. DEXAMYL AND THE GRANDFATHER CLAUSE OF THE 1962 AMENDMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-12\">SKF contends that the grandfather clause of the 1962 Amendments exempts Dexamyl from the requirement of demonstrating its effectiveness. We need not linger long over this question, however, since it is evident that the effectiveness standards do apply to Dexamyl.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1177-13\">To be exempted by the grandfather clause, a drug must meet at least three conditions. As of October 9, 1962, it must have been (1) commercially used or sold in the United States; (2) not a new drug as then defined by the Act; and (3) not covered by an effective NDA.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In his August 24 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>order the Commissioner found that Dexa-myl was \u201ccovered\u201d by the effective NDAs of the amphetamine combination products listed in the February 12, 1973 order. These NDAs were effective on October 9, 1962. 41 Fed.Reg. at 35753 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-4\">SKF does not contest these facts, but urges instead that since the NDAs for the drugs listed in the February 12 order were filed subsequent to the marketing of Dexa-myl, Dexamyl should not be considered \u201ccovered\u201d for purposes of the grandfather clause. Although the Supreme Court has held in <em>USV Pharmaceutical Corp. v. Wein-berger, </em>412 U.S. 655, 93 S.Ct. 2498, 37 L.Ed.2d 244 (1973), that when a pioneer product is the subject of an approved NDA, subsequently marketed \u201cme-too\u201d drugs<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> are covered by the NDA for purposes of the grandfather clause, SKF interprets this decision as resting primarily \u201con the perceived inequity that would otherwise result, putting the \u2018me-too\u2019 drug in a more favorable regulatory posture than the pioneer.\u201d Brief for petitioner at 58. If Dexamyl were to be considered covered by the NDAs of subsequently marketed \u201cme-too\u201d drugs, SKF urges, similar inequities would occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-5\">Unlike SKF, we do not read <em>USV Pharmaceutical </em>to rest on such equitable considerations. Instead we understand it to mandate a policy of uniform and comprehensive application of the 1962 Amendments so as to avoid \u201ca competitive contest in the marketing of ineffective pre-1962 drugs.\u201d <em>USV Pharmaceutical Corp. </em>v. <em>Weinberger, </em>412 U.S. at 665, 93 S.Ct. at 2505. SKF would have us engage in an interpretation of the grandfather clause that \u201cis discriminatory and needlessly so,\u201d and that \u201cwould create a hiatus in the regulatory scheme for which there appears to be no cogent reason.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 664, 93 S.Ct. at 2505. The grandfather clause itself makes no distinction between pioneer and \u201cme-too\u201d drugs, but exempts only that generic class of drugs which, on October 9, 1962, were not covered by an effective NDA. Dexamyl is not such a drug, and it is consequently not exempt from the 1962 Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-9\">III. THE APPROPRIATENESS OF SUMMARY JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b1178-10\">A. <em>General Considerations</em></p>\n<p id=\"ACqM\">In <em>Weinberger v. Hynson, Wescott &amp; Dunning, </em>412 U.S. 609, 93 S.Ct. 2469, 37 L.Ed.2d 207 (1973), the Supreme Court upheld FDA\u2019s summary judgment procedures. The Court stressed the massive regulatory task facing FDA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1178-11\">If FDA were required automatically to hold a hearing for each product whose efficacy was questioned by the NAS-NRC study, even though many hearings would be an exercise in futility, we have no doubt that it could not fulfill its statutory mandate to remove from the market all those drugs which do not meet the effectiveness requirements of the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"aai-dedup-0\"><em>Id. </em>at 621, 93 S.Ct. at 2479. After examining FDA regulations specifying standards for the \u201cwell-controlled investigations\u201d required by the Act,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the Court concluded that they provided \u201cdrug manufacturers . full and precise notice of the evidence they must present to sustain their NDA\u2019s . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 622, 93 S.Ct. at 2479. Given such specific regulations, FDA was not required to \u201cprovide a formal hearing where it is apparent at the threshold that the applicant has not tendered <em>any </em>evidence which <em>on its face </em>meets the statutory standards as particularized by the regulations.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 620, 93 S.Ct. at 2478. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>This reasoning, of course, only applied \u201cto those regulations that are precise.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 621 n. 17, 93 S.Ct. at 2479. The Court noted that \u201c[s]ome of the regulations, however, are not precise, as they call for the exercise of discretion or subjective judgment in determining whether a study is adequate and well controlled.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1179-5\">For example, [\u00a7 314.111(a)(5)(ii)(a)(2)(i)] requires that the plan or protocol for the study include a method of selection of the subjects that provide [sic] <em>\u201cadequate </em>assurance that they are suitable for the purposes of the study.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The qualitative standards \u201cadequate\u201d and \u201csuitable\u201d do not lend themselves to clear-cut definition, and it may not be possible to tell from the face of a study whether the standards have been met. Thus, it might not be proper to deny a hearing on the ground that the study did not comply with this regulation.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1179-14\"><em>Id. </em>We have noted elsewhere, however, that the FDA regulations defining \u201cwell-controlled investigations\u201d cannot be categorically classified as precise or imprecise with any degree of certainty.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Indeed their precision will \u201cvary with the context in which [they are] invoked. ... [A] regulatory provision which seems vague in the abstract may nevertheless be conclusively at odds with a peculiarly deficient item of evidence.\u201d <em>Cooper Laboratories, Inc. v. FDA, </em>163 U.S.App.D.C. 212, 220, 501 F.2d 772, 780 (1974). This flexibility is necessary because the regulations for the most part express general norms of scientific re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>search rather than exact rules of procedure.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The task of a court of appeals reviewing an FDA grant of summary judgment thus becomes, at least in those cases which do not involve the violation of a manifestly \u201cprecise\u201d regulation, the determination of whether the applicant\u2019s submission on its face is so conclusively deficient in light of these norms that no issue of fact remains whether \u201cexperts qualified by scientific training and experience\u201d could \u201cfairly and responsibly\u201d conclude, on the basis of the submission, that \u201cthe drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling or proposed labeling thereof.\u201d <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1180-4\">The difficulties besetting this enterprise are formidable. The issues entail complicated questions of scientific methodology, an area in which courts have little institutional competence. These questions must be confronted, moreover, in the absence of an evidentiary record. FDA\u2019s interpretation of its summary judgment regulations<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> does not require it to provide an applicant the opportunity to respond to the agency\u2019s determination that the applicant\u2019s submission is conclusively inadequate in light of regulations defining \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <em>See </em>39 Fed.Reg. 9750, 9751 (1974). The record will thus normally contain only FDA\u2019s unchallenged characterizations of an applicant\u2019s submissions. Although courts will ordinarily exercise considerable deference to an \u201cagency\u2019s technical expertise and experience,\u201d particularly with respect to questions involving \u201c \u2018engineering and scientific\u2019 considerations,\u201d <em>FPC v. Florida Power &amp; Light Co., </em>404 U.S. 453, 463, 92 S.Ct. 637, 30 L.Ed.2d 600 (1972), it is not clear how far that deference should extend when an agency has deliberately prevented the creation of a record by which its determinations can be probed for their underlying \u201cbasis in fact.\u201d <em>Id. See USV Pharmaceutical Corp. v. HEW, </em>151 U.S. App.D.C. 184, 191, 466 F.2d 455, 462 (1972). Our function in reviewing agency action is normally only \u201cto assure that the agency has given reasoned consideration to all the material facts and issues,\u201d <em>Greater Boston Television Corp. v. FCC, </em>143 U.S.App.D.C. 383, 394, 444 F.2d 841, 851 (1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>403 U.S. 923, 91 S.Ct. 2233, 29 L.Ed.2d 701 (1971), but when a record is barren concerning an issue presented in a petition for review \u2014 in this case the issue of whether an applicant\u2019s studies are methodologically adequate in light of the pertinent regulations \u2014 we are asked to perform even this limited function on the basis of faith alone.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1180-11\">The instant case amply illustrates these difficulties. SKF strenuously urges that FDA\u2019s criticisms of its multi-investigator clinical trials are based upon \u201cimprecise\u201d regulations and are scientifically fallacious. Since FDA refused to consider these contentions, however, the record before us consists chiefly of SKF\u2019s NDA, together with its multi-investigator clinical trials, and FDA\u2019s August 24, 1976 order.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> We are thus confronted on one side by the argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>ments of lawyers, and on the other by the untested conclusions of FDA. To decide the scientific merit of these disputes, on the basis of the record now before us, would certainly be to risk the dangerous unreliability likely to occur when \u201ctechnically illiterate judges\u201d attempt substantively to review mathematical and scientific questions. <em>Ethyl Corp. v. EPA, </em>176 U.S.App.D.C. 373, 439, 541 F.2d 1, 67, <em>cert. denied, </em>426 U.S. 941, 96 S.Ct. 2663, 49 L.Ed.2d 394 (1976) (Bazelon, C. J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-4\">That risk may, in the end, prove inescapable, but it can perhaps be minimized if it is kept firmly in mind that we need not resolve the <em>scientific </em>question of the methodological adequacy of SKF\u2019s multi-investigator clinical trials, but the <em>legal </em>question of whether they are on their face conclusively inadequate in light of the pertinent regulations. The manner in which we resolve this latter question involves policy considerations: we must take account of both fairness to the petitioner and the public interest in effective drug regulation. Since FDA has precluded SKF from establishing on the record the factual predicates for its arguments that FDA\u2019s criticism of the multi-investigator clinical trials are scientifically inaccurate, rudimentary fairness requires that we at least give the factual claims underlying SKF\u2019s arguments the benefit of the doubt. <em>See </em>Gellhorn &amp; Robinson, <em>Summary Judgment in Administrative Adjudication, </em>84 Harv.L.Rev. 612 (1971). The Supreme Court has made clear, however, that, because these circumstances do not involve the Seventh Amendment right to a trial by jury, we need not engage in the sharp limitations on summary judgment required by Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>Weinberger v. Hynson, Westcott &amp; Dunning, </em>412 U.S. 609, 622, 93 S.Ct. 2469, 37 L.Ed.2d 207 (1973). If we were to follow our usual practice under Rule 56 of accepting as true petitioner\u2019s version of the facts, <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>426 U.S. 341, 347, 96 S.Ct. 2074, 48 L.Ed.2d 684 (1976), petitioner might be entitled, despite the present abortive state of the record, to a full adjudicatory hearing, even though such a hearing might well be \u201can exercise in futility.\u201d <em>Weinberger v. Hynson, West-cott &amp; Dunning, </em>412 U.S. 609, 621, 93 S.Ct. 2469, 37 L.Ed.2d 207 (1973). Full adjudicatory hearings represent a serious drain on FDA\u2019s limited resources, see Ames &amp; McCracken, <em>Framing Regulatory Standards to Avoid Formal Adjudication: The FDA As a Case Study, </em>64 Calif.L.Rev. 14, 19-20 (1976), and their profusion might well compromise FDA\u2019s ability to \u201cfulfill its statutory mandate to remove from the market all those drugs which do not meet the effectiveness requirements of the Act.\u201d <em>Wein-berger v. Hynson, Wescott &amp; Dunning, </em>412 U.S. 609, 621, 93 S.Ct. 2469, 2479, 37 L.Ed.2d 207 (1973). The Supreme Court has stressed the role of FDA\u2019s summary judgment procedures as a shield to protect the public interest against this eventuality.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>As we said in <em>Cooper Laboratories, Inc. </em>v. <em>FDA, </em>\u201cthe court must vindicate the general public\u2019s right to an efficient administration of the congressional mandate.\" 501 F.2d 772, 780, 163 U.S.App.D.C. 212, 220 (1974). Therefore we will, if possible, avoid ordering an adjudicatory hearing until we are assured, with some basis in a record, that a genuine issue of fact exists there to be resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1181-7\">B. <em>The Multi-Investigator Clinical Trials</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1181-8\">SKF rests its claim to a hearing chiefly on its multi-investigator clinical trials.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>SKF argues that these trials establish both that Dexamyl is effective as an anorectic and that each of its components contributes to the effects claimed; <em>i. e., </em>that the Dexedrine in Dexamyl performs its weight-loss function undiminished by the presence of amobarbital, and that the amobarbital makes its own contribution by reducing adverse side effects experienced by patients who take Dexedrine alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-4\">The trials tested Dexamyl tablets against Dexedrine. The studies were double-blind; neither investigators nor patients knew which of the two drugs had been prescribed to any particular patient. There were five investigators, scattered throughout the country; each was a physician who treated patients in his private medical practice for obesity. All followed the same protocol, under which 30 patients were selected for each study, 15 of whom were assigned randomly to one drug, and 15 to the other. The trials lasted eight weeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-6\">In its August 24, 1976 order, FDA noted numerous deficiencies which, it claimed, rendered the trials conclusively inadequate in light of the pertinent regulations. Before this court, however, FDA has chosen to press only six of these deficiencies.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1121\">*1121</page-number>Should even a single one of these six deficiencies prove valid, we must sustain FDA\u2019s summary judgment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-5\">1. <em>Suitability of Patient Population</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1183-6\">The subjects of the trials were selected from among patients between the ages of 18 and 60 who were at least 20 percent overweight, and who scored four or more on a prescribed Anxiety Manifestation Index. No patients were included if, among other things, they suffered from a number of specified diseases or had a history of drug abuse. The protocol also required that patients selected for a trial not have received any anorectic or tranquilizing medication for at least two weeks prior to their participation in the study, and tranquilizers, sedatives and other anorectic agents or measures for weight control were prohibited during the trial. Patients were placed on a 1200 calorie diet.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-7\">Section 505(d) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(d), provides that for a study to constitute substantial evidence, experts must be able fairly and responsibly to conclude from it that the drug will have the effect it purports to have \u201cunder the conditions of use prescribed, recommended or suggested\u201d in its labeling. FDA regulations provide that there must be a method of selection of subjects which provides adequate assurance that they are suitable for purposes of the study.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <em>See </em>21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314-lll(a)(5)(ii)(a)(2)(i), <em>supra note </em>3. Dexa-myl\u2019s present labeling indicates use with obese patients, but the subjects of the trials were anxious, obese patients. Since anxiety was one of the side effects of Dexedrine that amobarbital was designed to remedy, FDA argues that it is impossible to generalize the results obtained in the subpopulation of patients studied by the trials. Its point appears to be that the trials do not demonstrate whether Dexedrine produces in non-anxious obese patients side-effects that can be remedied by amobarbital.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> If no such side effects are produced, the prescription of amobarbital would be superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-13\">FDA\u2019s contention is well grounded in its regulations. The trials provide no \u201cassurance\u201d that Dexedrine, in the amounts contained in Dexamyl, produces in non-anxious obese patients side effects capable of being remedied by amobarbital. This conclusion is not fatal to SKF, however, since it implies only that Dexamyl\u2019s labeling be altered to recommend Dexamyl for use with anxious, obese patients. SKF implies that it would accept such an alteration, reply brief for petitioner, at 10 n.7, and we must therefore examine the other deficiencies alleged by FDA to determine whether the trials are conclusively inadequate despite such an alteration in labeling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-14\">2. <em>Methods of Observation and Recording</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1183-15\">The trials were conducted by physicians whose private medical practices included obese patients, and each physician-investigator was aware that the trials were testing the side-effect potential of the two drugs involved. The physicians were ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number>pected to use their normal but trained powers of observation, supplemented by specific inquiry where they deemed it appropriate. They completed forms recording extensive data for all patients. Particular attention was paid to adverse effects, which were detailed as to dates (onset and termination), severity, and relationship to the drug prescribed. The supervising physicians recorded whatever action they took as the result of such an adverse effect, including any reduction of dosage or outright discontinuance of the drug involved. J.A. at 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-4\">FDA regulations require a well-controlled study to explain its \u201cmethods of observation and recording of results, including the variables measured, quantitation, assessment of any subjects response, and steps taken to minimize bias on the part of the subject and observer.\u201d 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.111(a)(5) (ii)(a)(3), <em>supra </em>note 3. FDA contends that the trials are conclusively inadequate in light of this regulation since they nowhere describe what procedure (observation, general questions or specific inquiries) was actually used by each investigator to elicit adverse reaction data, whether specific inquiry was resorted to under the same circumstances or whether each of the investigators asked their subjects the same questions. FDA argues that the absence of this information is particularly serious because the method of obtaining adverse reaction data may seriously affect the incidence of reported side effects, and because, without this information, it is impossible for an impartial observer to know whether a reported response is an adverse reaction to the drug under study or merely the persistence of a pre-existing condition.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1184-5\">Both parties have framed their arguments as though the regulation in question were precise and merely formal in its requirements. SKF strenuously urges, for example, that it has provided an explanation of its methods of observation and recording of results in that the protocol of the trials called for data to be observed by physicians in the course and manner of their regular private practices and to be recorded on standardized patient report forms. FDA, on the other hand, urges with equal vehemence that \u201c[n]o explanation [was] provided as to whether the investigators evaluated subjects solely on the basis of their own observations, or on the basis of questions asked the subjects, or both.\u201d 41 Fed.Reg. at 35745.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-8\">It is evident, however, that this framing of the question leads nowhere, since it fails to suggest criteria by which it might be determined whether the information provided by the trials\u2019 protocol constitutes an \u201cexplanation\u201d for purposes of the regulation. The question must therefore be reformulated so as to capture the basic purpose underlying FDA\u2019s summary judgment regulations. We must ask, that is, whether the trials are so conclusively deficient in light of the norm of scientific research expressed by the regulation that no question of fact remains whether qualified experts could fairly and responsibly conclude from the trials whether Dexamyl was effective for its intended uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-9\">SKF argues that such a question of fact exists. The trials were conducted in a double-blind fashion. Since neither investigators nor subjects knew which patients were receiving Dexamyl and which Dexedrine, SKF concludes that the possible irregularities in observation noted by FDA would not bias the trials\u2019 results.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-10\">Whether the level of \u201cexplanation\u201d offered by SKF was sufficient under the regulation thus involves a complex question of scientific methodology. We, of course, have neither the knowledge nor the competence to ourselves resolve this question. Giving petitioner\u2019s version of the facts the benefit of the doubt, however, we must agree that the question is presently unsettled. But we will not so abandon the public interest in the expeditious enforcement of the drug laws as to assume, in the absence of a more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1123\">*1123</page-number>developed record, that SKF\u2019s contentions have truly raised a genuine issue of fact requiring an adjudicatory hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-5\">3. <em>Comparability of Test and Control Groups</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1185-6\">The trials compared a \u201ctest\u201d group of patients who received Dexamyl against a \u201ccontrol\u201d group who received Dexedrine. FDA regulations require that a well-controlled study must include \u201c[a] method of selection of the subjects that (iii) Assures comparability in test and control groups of pertinent variables . . .\u201d 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.111(a)(5)(ii)(a)(2), <em>supra </em>note 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-8\">FDA argues that the trials are conclusively inadequate in light of this regulation because they fail to demonstrate the comparability of test and control subjects regarding the incidence and degree of anxiety. SKF vigorously contests this characterization of the trials, contending that they did indeed include a method of selection assuring comparability. The subjects were assigned to test and control groups on a random basis, and a statistical analysis of the Anxiety Manifestation Index for both groups indicated a random distribution of anxiety. FDA discounts this analysis, however, stating that the regulations require a check on the results of randomization at the conclusion as well as at the beginning of a study. In this FDA appears to be improperly elaborating on its own regulations, which require only that a study provide a <em>\u201cmethod of selection </em>of the subjects\u201d that would ensure comparability.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> FDA\u2019s apparent requirement that a study provide a check on the comparability of test and control groups at the conclusion of the study is thus not included in \u201cthe statutory standards as particularized by the regulations,\u201d <em>Weinberger v. Hynson, Wescott &amp; Dunning, </em>412 U.S. 609, 620, 93 S.Ct. 2469, 2478, 37 L.Ed.2d 207 (1973), and cannot be used as a basis for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-12\">FDA argues that the trials also failed to assure comparability between test and control groups with respect to the past use of amphetamines. This is important, FDA stresses, because \u201camphetamines as a class can produce both tolerance and dependence,\u201d and because \u201ca subject\u2019s prior history of amphetamine use may affect . the incidence of various side effects.\u201d 41 Fed.Reg. at 35746. SKF contends, however, that these factors are irrelevant because no subject was included in the trials who had used amphetamines during the two weeks immediately prior to the commencement of the studies and because this two week \u201cwashout\u201d period was sufficient to eliminate any interference that might be caused by a subject\u2019s prior history of amphetamine use.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-13\">The issue of whether the two week washout period is sufficient to assure comparability in the selection of test and control groups appears to raise a question of fact. Whether this appearance is genuine, however, depends upon the state of opinion in the scientific community, a circumstance concerning which we are at present entirely ignorant. We are therefore unable to conclude from the record before us whether \u201ca real, not formal, controversy exists.\u201d <em>Bruce Construction Corp. v. United States, </em>242 F.2d 873, 875 (5th Cir. 1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-14\">4. <em>Statistical Pooling</em></p>\n<p id=\"AyH\">The trials analyzed data compiled by each of the five individual investigators. This data was then pooled or aggregated for further statistical analysis. FDA concluded that this pooling failed to provide the necessary assurance of comparability between test and control groups with respect to pertinent variables:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1185-15\">In several respects, SKF failed to demonstrate that the data from the five investigators could be combined for statistical analysis because it was not shown that each block of patients, in any single <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1124\">*1124</page-number>study or in all five studies, was similar with respect to either the presence or the degree of anxiety (\u00a7 314.111(a)(5)(ii)(a) (2)(iii)). Because each investigator may have used widely varying criteria to measure anxiety, and because the effect of different degrees of anxiety on side effects is unknown, it is impermissible to pool the results of these investigators. A further obstacle to pooling is the investigators\u2019 failure to show that each block of subjects was comparable with respect to (1) prior history of amphetamine use, (2) the manner in which each investigator elicited adverse reaction data and/or (3) the method used to record adverse reactions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1186-4\">41 Fed.Reg. at 35746.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-5\">SKF argues that FDA\u2019s conclusion overlooks the fact that all five investigators used the same experimental protocol, including the two week washout period for prior amphetamine use, the random assignment of subjects to test and control groups, and the double-blind administration of the trials. Thus, for example, if the washout period were effective in assuring comparability between test and control groups for a single investigator, it would also be so with respect to the aggregated data.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Since we have already concluded that the effectiveness of the washout period is an open question, we must also consider this aspect of the issue of pooling as unsettled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-6\">FDA\u2019s conclusion, however, may rest on the additional point that the protocol of the trials was not sufficiently detailed to sustain pooling of the data under 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.111(a)(5)(ii)(a)(3). <em>See </em>note 3 <em>supra. </em>The fact that different investigators used different techniques for soliciting or recording the data, for example, may present a bar to the statistical pooling of their results. But this is an intricate scientific question concerning which we cannot exercise independent judgment, and FDA has offered neither evidence nor explanation. Extending the benefit of the doubt to petitioner\u2019s general claim that the protocol was in fact sufficiently detailed to permit pooling, we must conclude that the question of whether a genuine issue of fact here exists remains open.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-9\">5. <em>Improper Control</em></p>\n<p id=\"AU8\">The trials compared Dexamyl to Dexedrine. FDA regulations state that a well-controlled study must provide \u201ca comparison of the results of treatment or diagnosis with a control in such a fashion as to permit quantitative evaluation. ... An effective regime of therapy may be used for comparison . . . .\u201d 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.-lll(a)(5)(ii)(a)(4)(iii), <em>supra </em>note 3. FDA concluded that the trials were conclusively inadequate in light of this regulation \u201csince the active control used, dextroampheta-mine, does not permit a quantitative evaluation of the effects of Dexamyl.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1186-11\">Because the anorectic effect of dex-troamphetamine is only marginal to begin with, (i. e., its advantage over placebo is small), and because its anorectic effect is highly variable, its effectiveness is not demonstrable in every study. Therefore, before a finding of anorectic equivalence of dextroamphetamine and Dexamyl in a particular study can be considered as evidence of the effectiveness of Dexamyl, it must be demonstrated that dextroamphetamine was in fact effective under the precise conditions of the study, e. g., by including a placebo control in the study. This series failed to include a placebo control or otherwise show that dextroamphetamine was in fact effective under those circumstances. Accordingly, a finding of \u201cno difference\u201d between Dexamyl and dextroampheta-mine in a particular study can mean either that both were effective or that neither was effective in that study.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1186-13\">41 Fed.Reg. at 35750.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-14\">SKF vigorously contests this characterization of Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine), pointing to FDA\u2019s own conclusion in the Federal Register that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1125\">*1125</page-number>On the basis of the currently available evidence, the Commissioner concludes that oral dosage forms of amphetamine and/or dextroamphetamine are effective in the management of exogenous obesity as a short term (a few weeks) adjunct in a regimen of weight reduction based on caloric restriction for patients in whom obesity is refractory to other measures.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1187-5\">38 Fed.Reg. 4249 (1973). Surely, SKF argues, if FDA recognizes Dexedrine as effective, the trials were not on their face deficient to use the drug as an active control.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-6\">We agree with SKF in this matter. FDA\u2019s endorsement of Dexedrine as effective for the short term management of exogenous obesity provides at least prima facie support for SKF\u2019s view of the appropriateness of Dexedrine as an active control. Since, in contrast to other issues we have heretofore considered, SKF\u2019s position is supported by evidence, we conclude that there is a genuine issue of fact whether Dexedrine, although effective, is so unpredictable as to foreclose the possibility of quantitative evaluation. Such issues are not to be decided at summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-7\">6. <em>Analyst Bias</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1187-8\">FDA requires that a well-controlled investigation explain \u201cthe methods used to minimize bias on the part of the observers and the analysts of the data.\u201d 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.lll(a)(5)(ii)(a)(4), <em>supra </em>note 3. FDA concluded that the trials were conclusively deficient in light of this regulation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1187-9\">The authors and SKF . . . failed to state what steps, if any, were taken to minimize bias on the part of the analysts of the data (\u00a7 314.111(a)(5)(ii)(a)(4)). Steps must be taken to preclude the possibility of analyst bias (either conscious or unconscious), since it may cause them to make subjective decisions that vitally affect the results of the study, e. g., whether or not to include all patients in the analysis or only those who completed the entire 8 weeks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1187-11\">41 Fed.Reg. at 35751.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-12\">In its August 24 order, FDA appeared to overstep the bounds of its regulation. Although the latter requires only that there be <em>\u201can explanation given </em>of the methods used to minimize bias on the part of the . analysts of the data,\u201d the order implies both that a well-controlled investigation must include such methods and that such methods be adequate. In its brief FDA is more circumspect, arguing only that SKF provided \u201c[n]o such explanation.\u201d Brief for respondent at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-13\">SKF rejects this argument, noting that the steps taken in the trials to minimize analyst bias are stated in the protocol and final report. These include a multiple covariance quantitative analysis, a Chi-Square analysis of qualitative results, a report of the details and results of these analyses, and an analysis both of all subjects and of only those subjects who completed the entire eight week program.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-14\">Since it is impossible to determine, in the abstract, whether the information provided in the trials\u2019 protocol constitutes a sufficient \u201cexplanation\" for purposes of the regulation, we must ask, once again, whether the trials are so conclusively deficient with respect to the norm of scientific research expressed by the regulation that no issue of fact remains whether qualified experts could fairly and responsibly conclude from the trials whether Dexamyl was effective for its intended uses. We have no way of answering this question in the absence of a more developed record. Giving the benefit of the doubt to petitioner,<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> we conclude that the question remains open.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-15\">IV. THE QUESTION OF REMEDY</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-16\">If Dexamyl\u2019s labeling were altered to recommend its use for anxious, obese patients, FDA\u2019s summary judgment order cannot be sustained. It remains an open question, however, whether the trials are conclusively deficient in light of FDA regu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1126\">*1126</page-number>lations requiring comparability of test and control groups, an explanation of the methods used to observe and record results, and an explanation of the methods used to minimize analyst bias. These issues cannot be resolved in the absence of an evidentiary record.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-4\">SKF has proffered evidence on these issues in the form of the Solomon and Warded affidavits. We are satisfied that these affidavits are material and that FDA\u2019s rather abrupt procedures below provide reasonable grounds for SKF\u2019s failure to adduce them before the agency.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> In such circumstances the Act specifically provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1188-5\">the court may order such additional evidence to be taken before the [Commissioner] and to be adduced upon the hearing in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as to the court may seem proper. The [Commissioner] may modify his findings as to the facts by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and he shall file with the court such modified findings which, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive, and his recommendation, if any, for the setting aside of the original order.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AyIq\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(h). The statute thus gives this court broad authority to fashion a remedy capable of balancing fairness to the petitioner against the public\u2019s right to an expeditious enforcement of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-11\">Since we cannot sustain FDA\u2019s summary judgment order and since, at the same time, we have no assurance that there is presently a genuine issue of fact to be aired at an adjudicatory hearing, this record should be remanded to FDA for a proceeding to determine whether such a genuine issue of fact exists. The extent of this proceeding should be as limited as its circumscribed purpose. Were this proceeding to become too lengthy or elaborate, it would create precisely the drain on FDA\u2019s resources FDA\u2019s summary judgment regulations were designed to prevent. An appropriate adaptation of the procedures set forth in Part 15 of 21 C.F.R. might well prove sufficient,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> if it is understood that FDA itself must submit on the record and for the comments of petitioner evidence for FDA\u2019s conclusions. Confident, however, that \u201ccourt and agency [are] \u2018collaborative instrumentalities of justice,\u2019 \u201d <em>S.S.W. Inc. v.

EPA, </em>150 U.S.App.D.C. 348, 360-61, 465 F.2d 528, 540-41 (1972). We require only that the proceeding on remand provide as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1127\">*1127</page-number>surance that FDA has given reasoned consideration to all material facts and issues.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1189-4\">One final question deserves attention. SKF submitted NDAs for Dexamyl in two forms: tablets and Spansule (sustained release) capsules. A Spansule capsule contains precisely two or precisely three times the amounts of the two active ingredients that are included in a single tablet. Tablets are prescribed for use two or three times daily, but patients take only one Spansule capsule each morning. <em>See </em>41 Fed.Reg. at 35742. The multi-investigator clinical trials were conducted using Dexamyl tablets. SKF has submitted extensive data purporting to demonstrate that there is an equivalent \u201cbioavailability\u201d of Dexamyl\u2019s active ingredients for both tablets and Spansules. It therefore claims that the results of the trials should be applied to the NDA for Dexamyl Spansules.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-5\">FDA did not comment on these bioavaila-bility data in its August 24 order. We therefore have no way of knowing whether they constitute the adequate and well-controlled investigations required by statute. In the proceeding on remand, however, FDA should pass on this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-6\">The record is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1171-10\">.

Furthermore, Dexa-myl products are not \u201crelated\u201d or \u201csimilar\u201d to any of the named drugs. The named combinations containing dextroamphetamine sulfate do not contain any amobarbital.

Smith, Kline and French contends that its Dexamyl products are not identical, similar or related to the drugs named in the February 12, 1973 DESI notice and, therefore, any action taken with respect to those products does not affect Dexamyl. This argument is based on the observation that the combinations named in that notice which contained dextroamphetamine do not contain amobar-bital, and the one combination that contained amobarbital does not contain dextroampheta-mine. Although this may establish that Dex-amyl is not identical to the drugs named in the February 12, 1973 notice, it in no way establishes that SKF\u2019s products are not similar or related to the named combinations. To the contrary, the regulations under 310.6(b) (21 CFR 310.6(b)) specifically provide that a drug is identical, similar or related to another drug if it is \u201crelated in chemical structure.\u201d Smith, Kline and French admits that dex-troamphetamine is related chemically to phenmetrazine and amphetamine, two anorectic agents named in the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1176-20\">In addition, the same regulation further provides that a drug is identical, similar or related to another drug if it is related in \u201cknown pharmacological properties.\u201d It is undisputed that the principal component of Dexamyl, dextroamphetamine, is a sympa-thomimetic drug; it is also undisputed that Dexamyl is promoted as an anorectic. Therefore, it is clear that Dexamyl is identical, similar and/or related to the sympathom-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>imetic anorectic drugs named in the February 12, 1973 notice and covered by it. Finally, \u00a7 310.6(b) specifically provides that \u201c[a] combination drug product containing an identical, related, or similar drug is also subject to the conclusions contained in the notice.\u201d Since nearly all of the drugs named in the notice contain dextroamphetamine, (e. g., Appetrol (NDA No. 12-127), containing dex-troamphetamine and meprobamate; Bipheta-mine-T NDA No. 11-538), containing dex-troamphetamine, dl-amphetamine and meth-aqualone; and Dexerpine tablets (NDA No. 10-207), containing dextroamphetamine and reserpine alkaloid), and since one of the named drugs contains amobarbital (Delfeta-sed Stedytabs (NDA 12 \u2014 415) containing, inter alia, methamphetamine HC1 and amobar-bital), Dexamyl is clearly subject to the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1177-7\">41 Fed.Reg. at 35752-53 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1177-8\">. The fact that FDA informed SKF Dexamyl was \u201cnot a new drug\u201d in 1949 and again in 1953 is not determinative, since the 1962 Amendments altered the definition of what constituted a \u201cnew drug.\u201d See <em>USV Pharmaceutical Corp. v.

Reg. 35741, 35753 (1976). SKF contends, however, that these labeling changes all \u201cnarrowed the anorectic use for which Dexamyl was recommended, or expanded the warnings applicable to the product,\u201d brief for petitioner at 58, and thus did not operate to destroy Dexamyl\u2019s grandfathered status. FDA contests this characterization of Dexamyl\u2019s labeling changes. Brief for respondents at 48. At least one Circuit has squarely held that a drug\u2019s grandfather status is lost even where \u201cthe effect of the change in the labeling was merely to reduce the use of the drug under conditions prescribed or recommended in the labeling.\u201d <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>v. <em>Allen Drug Corp., </em>357 F.2d 713, 718 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>385 U.S. 899, 87 S.Ct. 203, 17 L.Ed.2d 131 (1966). <em>Cf.

In responding to comments on FDA\u2019s proposed summary judgment procedures, the Commissioner interpreted this analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1179-10\">Several comments pointed out that the Supreme Court stated in the <em>Hynson </em>decision that summary judgment could properly be imposed only if there was noncompliance with the \u201cprecise\u201d elements of [\u00a7 314.-111(a)(5)], and that those aspects of the regulation requiring judgment could not properly support the denial of a hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1179-11\">The Commissioner agrees with this comment and has no intention of denying a hearing solely because of failure to comply with the judgmental elements of [\u00a7 314.111(a)(5)]. Indeed, in no instance to date has a hearing been denied on such a basis. The regulations have been modified to make this clear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1179-12\">At the same time the Commissioner notes that a total failure of a study even to attempt to comply with one of the \u201cjudgmental\u201d elements of [\u00a7 314.111(a)(5)] may be sufficient to deny a hearing. For example, the Corn-missioner will not deny a hearing because of his judgment that the study does not provide \u201cadequate assurance\u201d that the subjects are suitable for the purpose of the study, but may well exercise summary judgment if the plan or protocol for the study fails to include a method of selection of the subjects that would provide any assurance whatever that they are suitable for the study. Any such decision will depend entirely upon whether it is conclusively apparent, on the face of the data or information submitted, that the requirements of the statute and regulations have not been met.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1179-16\">39 Fed.Reg. 9750, 9757 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b1179-17\">.

The language in the <em>Hynson </em>decision, together with the discussion in this preamble, provides ample guidance on this matter. Any person designing a controlled clinical investigation to prove effectiveness has not only the provisions of [\u00a7\u00a7 300.50 and 314.111(a)(5)] to give him specific advice, but also has the opportunity to request a conference with Food and Drug Administration officials to discuss proposed protocols, and may submit proposed protocols for a written opinion.

Hynson, Wescott &amp; Dunning, </em>412 U.S. 609, 621, 93 S.Ct. 2469, 37 L.Ed.2d 207 (1973). In April 1977, FDA employed one ALJ. <em>See </em>Comptroller General, Report to the Congress: Administrative Law Process, Better Management Is Needed, Appendix I (FPCD-78-25, 15 May 1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b1181-10\">. SKF submitted numerous studies to FDA, all of which FDA found to be conclusively inade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>quate in light of its regulations. In its brief SKF makes a half-hearted attempt to defend the Feinblatt/Ferguson study. See brief for petitioner at 51-53; reply brief for petitioner at 3 n.3. FDA, however, rejected this study because it failed to meet the \u201cprecise\u201d requirement of 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.11 l(a)(5)(ii)(a)(5) (1977), <em>supra </em>note 3, that it include a \u201csummary of the methods of analysis and an evaluation of data derived from the study, including any appropriate statistical methods.\u201d 41 Fed.Reg. at 35743 (1976). <em>See </em>note 21 <em>supra. </em>Since SKF does not dispute this characterization of the study, brief for petitioner at 52, we conclude that summary judgment was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-8\">FDA, however, has not chosen to renew its earlier claim that summary judgment could be avoided only if an NDA were accompanied by at least two well-controlled scientific studies. 41 Fed.Reg. at 35743 (1976). On March 13, 1974, the Commissioner stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1182-9\">The Commissioner is considering whether the regulations should be changed to require, in all instances, at least two studies by independent investigators meeting the requirements of [\u00a7 314.111(a)(5)] and, where applicable, [\u00a7 300.50], before a drug may be regarded as proved effective. Pending any such requirement, the submission of a single study showing effectiveness and meeting the requirements of [\u00a7 314.111(a)(5)] and, where applicable, [\u00a7 300.50] will be sufficient to preclude immediate summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1182-10\">39 Fed.Reg. at 9755. No change of regulations occurred between March 13, 1974, and August 24, 1976. Therefore if the multi-investigator clinical trials are adequate and well-controlled, summary judgment would be inappropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b1182-11\">. FDA has apparently retracted several of its initial criticisms. We think that it was wise to do so. FDA had argued, for example, that the Anxiety Manifestation Index used by the trials had \u201cnot been validated.\u201d 41 Fed.Reg. at 35745 (1976). But 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.-lll(a)(5)(ii)(a)(3) (1977) requires only that a study <em>explain </em>its \u201cmethods of observation and recording of results, including the variables measured, quantitation, [and] assessment of any subjects response . . . .\u201d <em>See </em>note 3 <em>supra. </em>There is no requirement in the regulations that measurement indexes be <em>validated. </em>In a similar fashion FDA had found the trials deficient because of \u201cthe absence of evidence that such investigator had experience or training in applying psychological measuring scales.\u201d 41 Fed.Reg. at 35745. But FDA regulations nowhere imply that a study that fails to offer such evidence would, on its face, be conclusively inadequate. One deficiency FDA had initially found in the trials, however, illustrates the quandary of this court. In its August 24, 1976 order FDA had attacked the trials because \u201cthe failure of SKF to include an appropriate statistical analysis, namely an analysis of the power of the statistical tests used, renders scientific evaluation impossible. (\u00a7 314.-11 l(a)(5)(ii)(a)(5)).\u201d 41 Fed.Reg. at 35750. In their initial brief SKF argued, first, that the cited regulation requires only \u201c[a] summary of the methods of analysis and an evaluation of data derived from the study, including any appropriate statistical methods,\u201d and not an analysis of the power of the statistical tests used. In any event, SKF noted, such an analysis plainly appeared in their NDA. SKF refers us to Table 2-a of their submission, J.A. at 48, in which it is stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-16\">\n<img class=\"footnote\" height=\"250\"

The stated purpose of the trials was \u201c[t]o compare, under double-blind conditions, the anorectic effects and side effect potential of \u2018Dexamyl\u2019 and \u2018Dexedrine\u2019 in overweight patients.\u201d J.A. at 74.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b1183-16\">. FDA\u2019s point could also be that the side effects produced by Dexedrine in anxious obese patients are so different from those produced by the drug in non-anxious obese patients, that even if amobarbital were demonstrated to be effective with respect to the former, its effectiveness with respect to the latter could not be estimated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b1184-6\">. FDA also argues that the trials offered no explanation of the methods of observation and recording of results with respect to the weighing of patients. This omission, FDA contends, could have serious consequences, since a patient\u2019s weight could be affected by the time of day, menstrual cycles, or the presence or absence of clothes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b1185-9\">. FDA\u2019s reading of 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.-lll(a)(5)(ii)(a)(2)(iii) would essentially reinterpret the regulation to require that test and control groups be comparable and thus would render superfluous and meaningless the words \u201cA method of selection of the subjects. .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b1186-7\">. Similarly, SKF argues that the random assignment of subjects to test and control groups by individual investigators assured the comparability of the aggregate groups with respect to anxiety, as the trials purport to demonstrate by statistical analysis.. <em>See </em>J.A. at 57.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b1187-17\">.

We note specifically the failure to notify SKF in advance of the contents of the summary judgment order and the constricted time frame surrounding the issuance of the order. <em>See </em>pp. -, - of 190 U.S.App.D.C., p. 1115 of 587 F.2d <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b1188-9\">. By phrases such as \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d and \u201cto be adduced upon the hearing,\u201d it is evident that the statute contemplates a petition from an adverse decision at a hearing. This, of course, is not such a case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b1188-10\">. Part 15 of 21 C.F.R. sets forth the procedures for a public hearing before the Commissioner. Although primarily designed for \u201cconsidering new regulations or broad policy or requirements which affect many interested persons,\u201d 40 Fed.Reg. 40711 (1975), the procedures are also an expeditious and efficient means of creating an evidentiary record. The Commissioner or his designee presides at the hearing, 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 15.30(a) (1977), and the parties \u201cmay submit data, information, or views on the matter that is the subject of the hearing in writing. . . . \u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 15.25. The hearing is transcribed, <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 15.30(b); every party is given an allotted time for their presentation. Although the presiding officer \u201cmay question any person during or at the conclusion of his presentation,\u201d no other cross-examination is permitted. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 15.30(e). Section 15.30(f) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1188-14\">The hearing shall be informal in nature, and the rules of evidence shall not apply. No motions or objections relating to the admissibility of data, information, and views shall be made or considered, but other participants may comment upon or rebut all such data, information, and views. No participant may interrupt the presentation of another participant at any hearing for any reason.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b1189-10\">. Judge McGowan, in dissenting from this remedy, argues that such a proceeding must necessarily either shrink to merely pro forma status or else swell to the point that it becomes as serious a drain on FDA resources as a full-blown adjudicatory hearing. He thus concludes that it constitutes the longer \u201croute to final termination of the matter.\u201d Dissenting op. at 1128. We respectfully disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-11\">If SKF should demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of fact requiring an adjudicatory hearing, the evidence adduced on remand will not be lost for purposes of that hearing. If, on the other hand, using the limited procedures we have authorized, FDA is able to demonstrate the absence of any genuine controversy, so much will have been gained. We assume, moreover, that FDA will in future cases provide us with a sufficient record, even when ordering summary judgment, to avoid the necessity of such remands. See, e. <em>g., Masti-Kure Products, Inc. v. Califano, </em>587 F.2d 1099, 1103 (D.C.Cir.1978). Over the long haul, therefore, time will be saved. Finally, we believe that a circumscribed procedure on remand is well-suited for the limited purpose of establishing the existence of a genuine question of fact. FDA will not need a full adjudicatory hearing \u201cto penetrate the allegations of fact in the pleadings and look at any evidential source to determine whether there is an issue of fact to be tried.\u201d <em>Kirk v. Home Indemnity Co., </em>431 F.2d 554, 559 (7th Cir. 1970). Nor will a merely pro forma affidavit suffice to establish the existence of such an issue if, for example, FDA evidence establishes peradventure that the affidavit is legally irrelevant or manifestly infirm.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b1189-8\">McGOWAN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"adp-dedup-1\">concurring and dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-9\">Judge Bazelon\u2019s opinion is a careful analysis of an area fraught with both substan-five and procedural complexities, and I find myself in agreement with a very large part of it.

It is the remedy discussed and provided in Part IV that gives me difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-13\">The relief afforded by the majority is to leave the grant of summary judgment undisturbed but to remand the record for further proceedings from which it is hoped there will emerge an adequate basis for this court to decide whether that grant shall stand or fall. Part IV in terms assumes that those proceedings will necessitate the production of evidence by both sides, but it expressly abjures any prescription as to just how that will be done. It appears to envisage something that approaches the familiar evidentiary hearing for adjudicatory purposes, but does not go that far, as it could not, of course, without compromising the majority\u2019s avowed goal of retaining the benefits of the streamlined summary judgment procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-14\">Since the expedition ordinarily assumed to be characteristic of summary judgment disposition is the majority\u2019s objective, I wonder whether it will in fact be realized. I suspect the parties will have substantial difficulties in accommodating their views on the precise nature of the hearing to be held on remand; and I can foresee this court once more required to wrestle with conflicting contentions on this score. More substantively, I am apprehensive that, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1128\">*1128</page-number>view of the nature of the problem identified in Part III, anything short of the statutory hearing identified by the Supreme Court in <em>Hynson </em>as the alternative to summary judgment will be inadequate to accomplish a satisfactory resolution of these problems, either by the agency in the first instance or by this court upon further review. <em>Wein-berger v. Hynson, Wescott &amp; Dunning, </em>412 U.S. 609, 621, 93 S.Ct. 2469, 37 L.Ed.2d 207 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-4\">On the one hand, if the applicant\u2019s burden on remand \u2014 having been charged by FDA with failing to meet one of the agency\u2019s \u201cimprecise\u201d testing requirements \u2014 is simply to put in the record some factual or logical \u201csupport for [its] view\u201d that the requirement is indeed met, Maj.Op. at-of 190 U. S. App. D.C., at 1125 of 587 F.2d, it is hard to imagine that an applicant, whose submissions to FDA do not appear to us at this stage to be conclusively insufficient on their face, could not almost automatically comply on remand. Hence, the result of remand and review in this court almost inevitably would be to require a statutory hearing anyway, with only further delay on the road to the merits. On the other hand, if the applicant\u2019s burden of production is more stringent \u2014 and thus is inconsistent with any recognizable notion of \u201csummary judgment\u201d \u2014 it is difficult to see how the more or less informal remand proceeding contemplated will place FDA or' us in a better position than we now are in to resolve the \u201ccomplicated questions in scientific methodology\u201d referred to by the majority. Maj.Op. at - of 190 U.S.App. D.C., 1118 of 587 F.2d. In either case, considerations of expedition cannot be overlooked, especially in a proceeding which has been going on as long as this one has; and it may well be \u2014 indeed, it seems probable to me \u2014 that, in light of the problems raised by the majority opinion, abandonment at this point of summary judgment is the shorter\u2014 rather than the longer \u2014 route to final termination of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-8\">The Supreme Court labored mightily in <em>Hynson </em>to include the weapon of summary judgment in the FDA\u2019s procedural arsenal. But, in doing so, it was at pains to recognize that there are \u201cimprecise\u201d as well as \u201cprecise\u201d regulations, and that summary judgment may not lend itself comfortably to the former. 412 U.S. at 621 n.17, 93 S.Ct. 2479. This is the situation here, as the majority appears to recognize, and as is perhaps most eloquently testified to by the three years it took for FDA to conclude that summary judgment was justified, and by the lengthy period of time consumed in a judicial review which has had to conclude that FDA\u2019s justification for so doing is not so apparent as to dispense with a further agency hearing of \u201csome kind.\u201d <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 557-58, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974); and <em>see </em>Friendly, \u201cSome Kind of Hearing,\u201d 123 U.Pa.L.Rev. 1267 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-10\">In my view, accordingly, summary judgment should not be sustained where, as here, the applicant is charged merely with a failure to meet an \u201cimprecise\u201d testing requirement established by FDA, but where its failure to conform to the scientific norm underlying that requirement is not conclusively apparent on the face of the application. Under these circumstances, FDA should be required to utilize the statutory hearing procedure for determining whether the application is sufficient, and, if so, whether it should be approved.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
