States Marine Lines, Inc., </em>398 U.S. 375, 90 S.Ct. 1772, 26 L.Ed.2d 339 (1970), that certain disputed items of damages could be recovered under the <em>Moragne </em>remedy, and that fraudulent concealment of a cause of action could toll the two-year limitations provision of DOHSA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While this case was pending on appeal, the Supreme Court decided <em>Mobil Oil Corp. v. Higginbotham, </em>436 U.S. 618, 98 S.Ct. 2010, 56 L.Ed.2d 581 (1978) holding that DOHSA provided the exclusive remedy for wrongful death occurring on the high seas, as defined in section 761 of the Act. Accordingly, we must vacate and remand the cause for reconsideration in the light of <em>Mobil Oil Corp., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1093-18\">The only statute of limitations issue before us is whether the district court erred in holding that fraudulent concealment of a cause of action, if proved, will toll the two-year limitation provision of DOHSA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (46 U.S.C. \u00a7 763.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> All of these actions were filed more than two years after the deaths. Defendant contends that the limitation provision not only bars the action, but also extinguishes the remedy. The defendant\u2019s contention is supported by <em>In re Agwi Nav. Co., </em>89 F.2d 11 (2d Cir. 1937) and <em>Storey v. Garrett Corp., </em>43 F.R.D. 301 (C.D.Cal.1967), citing <em>Agwi, supra. </em>We overrule <em>Storey, </em>and we decline to follow <em>Agwi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1094-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>The <em>Agwi </em>court relied upon some dictum in <em>The Harrisburg, </em>119 U.S. 199, 7 S.Ct. 140, 30 L.Ed. 358 (1886), which was overruled in <em>Moragne v. States Marine Lines, Inc., supra, </em>398 U.S. 375, 90 S.Ct. 1772, 26 L.Ed.2d 339 and on other authorities which were inappo-site. In <em>The Harrisburg, </em>the Court held that death by maritime tort could not be redressed under the general maritime law because no wrongful death action would lie under either English or American common law. Upon that premise, <em>The Harrisburg </em>Court also observed, by way of dictum, that \u201c[t]he liability and the remedy are created by the same statutes, and the limitations of the remedy are, therefore to be treated as limitations of the right.\u201d (119 U.S. at 214, 7 S.Ct. at 147.) In overruling <em>The Harrisburg, </em>the <em>Moragne </em>Court pointed out that the premise of <em>The Harrisburg </em>was wrong. The dictum based upon the erroneous premise was also extinguished by <em>Moragne. </em>Before <em>Moragne </em>delivered the coup de grace to <em>The Harrisburg, </em>however, the Supreme Court had earlier discarded the dictum in <em>Glus v. Brooklyn Eastern District Terminal, </em>359 U.S. 231, 79 S.Ct. 760, 3 L.Ed.2d 770 (1959), the reasoning of which we believe fully supports the district court\u2019s ruling on this limitations point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-4\"><em>Glus </em>was an action under the Federal Employers Liability Act (45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 51-60) to recover damages for an industrial disease that the petitioner allegedly contracted while working for the respondent. That Act contains a limitations provision stating that no action can be maintained unless it is commenced within three years from the day the cause of action accrued. The Second Circuit held that respondent\u2019s alleged fraudulent conduct could not be used to toll limitations because the limitations period was built into the statute that created the right. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the estoppel doctrine applied to toll the limitations period of the Federal Employers Liability Act. The Court expressly refused to make an exception to the doctrine of estoppel in cases in which the statute creating the action also contained a limitations provision. The Court observed: \u201cTo be sure, language in some decisions of this Court can be taken as supporting such an exception.11 [n. 11, <em>inter alia </em>cites <em>The </em>Harrisburg] But that language is dicta and is neither binding nor persuasive.\u201d (359 U.S. at 234, 79 S.Ct. at 763.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-7\">Order vacated and cause remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views herein expressed. The parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1093-13\">. The district court\u2019s memorandum opinion and order is reported. <em>(Renner v.
