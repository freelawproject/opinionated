The Board asks us to enforce its order. The Board\u2019s Supplemental Order is reported at 234 NLRB No. 177 (1978). It was entered following a remand by this court, on February 7, 1976. The Board\u2019s original order, dealing with Levitz\u2019s objections to a representation election, is reported <em>sub nom. Retail Store Employees\u2019 Union Local 424, </em>204 NLRB 1046, 1053 (1973). We find no merit in Levitz\u2019s attacks upon the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-21\">The Union\u2019s waiver of initiation fees was sent to all employees, whether union supporters or not, was good until thirty days after a contract would be made between Levitz and the Union, and was in no way conditional upon support of or a vote for the Union. It thus was not improper under <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Savair Mfg. Co., </em>414 U.S. 270, 94 S.Ct. 495, 38 L.Ed.2d 495 (1973). <em>NLRB v. L. D. McFarland Co., </em>572 F.2d 256, 258-9 (9th Cir., 1978); <em>NLRB v. Aaron Bros. Corp., </em>563 F.2d 409, 412-3 (9th Cir., 1977). In these respects, it differs from <em>NLRB v. Aladdin Hotel Corp., </em>584 F.2d 891 (9th Cir., 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-22\">This is not a case, like <em>NLRB v. Gorbea, Perez &amp; Morrell, S. en C., </em>328 F.2d 679 (1st Cir., 1964), in which the union\u2019s offer was held to be illusory because the union never charged anyone an initiation fee. Here, the union does charge such a fee to all who do not fall within the terms of its offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-23\">We find no merit in Levitz\u2019s claim that, by reason of delay, a bargaining order would deprive it of due process of law. <em>NLRB v. Gissell Packing Co., </em>395 U.S. 575, 610-11, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969); <em>NLRB v. Katz, </em>369 U.S. 736, 748, n.16, 82 S.Ct. 1107, 8 L.Ed.2d 230 (1962); <em>NLRB v. Pacific Southwest Airlines, </em>550 F.2d 1148, 1153 (9th Cir., 1977); <em>NLRB v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of San Mateo, </em>472 F.2d 140,141 (9th Cir., 1972). We will not, by denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>enforcement, \u201cput a premium upon continued litigation by the employer,\u201d <em>NLRB v. L. B. Foster Co., </em>418 F.2d 1, 4 (9th Cir., 1969), and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-4\">The order of the Board will be enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
