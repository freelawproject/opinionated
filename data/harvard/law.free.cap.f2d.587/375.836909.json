We hold that the court erred, and reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">The basis for error is found in the following questions submitted to the jury and the jury\u2019s answers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-5\">1. What amount of money would fairly, fully, and adequately compensate Mark Huston for his injuries?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">$56,000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-7\">NEGLIGENCE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-8\">2. Was defendant Thomas Shows, Inc. negligent in the manner in which it conducted its operation at the time and place in question?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-9\">Answer \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d yes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-10\">If your answer to question 2 was \u201cYes\u201d answer question 3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-11\">3. Was such negligence a direct cause of the injuries sustained by plaintiff Mark Huston?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-12\">Answer \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d yes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-13\">AGENCY</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-14\">4. Under the instructions given to you by the Court and the facts in this case as you find them, were the activities of Sanders giving rise to the altercation related to his duties as an employee?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-15\">Answer \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d yes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-16\">5. Did said altercation occur within work-related limits of time and place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-17\">Answer \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d yes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-18\">6. Under either of the above theories, did the conduct of the plaintiff amount to negligence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-19\">Answer \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d yes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-20\">If your answer to question 6 was \u201cYes\u201d answer question 7.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-21\">7. Was such negligence a direct cause of his injuries?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-22\">Answer \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d yes</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-23\">8. Taking all of the fault which contributed to the injuries as equal to 100%, what percentage of fault is attributed to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-24\">Plaintiff Mark Huston 40%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-25\">Defendant Thomas Shows, Inc. 60%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-26\">100%</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-27\">9. It is the jury\u2019s intention by virtue of the foregoing to return a verdict for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-28\">.....the defendant Thomas Shows, Inc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-29\">x the plaintiff Mark Huston and that he will be awarded $22,400.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-31\">The trial court found the answers to questions 1 through 8 to be inconsistent with the answer to question 9 and determined that this inconsistency was the result of an arithmetical error. The court, on the basis of Fed.R.Civ.P. 49(b), entered judgment for the plaintiff for 60% of the total damages in the amount of $33,600, thus entering judgment in accord with the answers to questions 1 through 8, and notwithstanding the answer to question 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-32\">Appellant-defendant Thomas Shows, Inc. appeals, claiming that the trial court erred in submission of question 9 inasmuch as it was inappropriate for inclusion with the \u201cspecial verdict\u201d questions 1 through 8 and that the resultant verdict was inconsistent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-33\">Before the jury began deliberation, the following discussion took place in the courtroom with reference to question 9:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-34\">MR. O\u2019BRIEN: I have never seen it before in this Court or any other Court, and I am looking at it for the first time, and I am wondering when you have a special verdict and then the statute says you instruct on comparative negligence and the effect of the verdict, that\u2019s fine\u2014 and that the Court has done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-35\">But this next question it seems to me could make for a perverse verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-36\">What if the jury says, \u201cOur intentions were different than the answers we have given you\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-37\">THE COURT: Then we\u2019ll give a new trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-38\">That\u2019s the whole object of it, is not to have justice by guess work. This is one way to know that the jury understood the instructions and understood what they were doing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-39\">MR. O\u2019BRIEN: But isn\u2019t the point of a special verdict to be that the jury answers the factual questions and the Court enters judgment and the Court\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-40\">THE COURT: That is the way Oscar Knudsen used to do it when he was chief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>justice, but the legislature went back about five years ago and said the judge must instruct as to what the effect is, and all I am asking to do is to see if they did it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">Now the fellow who has argued most about this before in all my career is a guy named Munger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">MR. O\u2019BRIEN: Is he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-7\">MR. MUNGER: (Nods head affirmatively).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-8\">THE COURT: And he\u2019s argued with me just horribly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-9\">MR. MUNGER: I didn\u2019t say a word today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-10\">THE COURT: You haven\u2019t said anything today.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-11\">But you and Munger aren\u2019t the only two fellows that ever objected to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-12\">MR. O\u2019BRIEN: Well Judge, I have been in front of you many times and I have never seen it, honestly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-13\">THE COURT: Well, no, but don\u2019t you think it\u2019s nice? If you didn\u2019t have something new once in a while\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-14\">MR. O\u2019BRIEN: Well, what I am worried about is I can see a possible perverse verdict and retrials coming up. I think, for the record at least at this stage, Your Honor, it would be my obligation to object to question 9 as not being in conformance with the purpose of a special verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-15\">THE COURT: I will overrule your objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-16\">I tell you another thing I do with this now that makes it so nice\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-17\">MR. O\u2019BRIEN: Because I get a new trial anyway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-18\">THE COURT: \u2014but at the end of this case all I have to do is look at those percentages and look at the first question while they are still sitting here, and I can see if we\u2019ve got a perverse verdict, and then I can visit with you fellows and see if it can be straightened out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-19\">MR. O\u2019BRIEN: I just think I have an obligation to make the objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-20\">When the jury returned with the inconsistent verdict on February 2,1978, the trial judge was not present. On February 10, 1978, the trial judge, in a memorandum opinion and order, stated that although the verdict form used by the jury was entitled a \u201cSpecial Verdict,\u201d it was, in effect, a \u201cGeneral Verdict Accompanied by Answers to Interrogatories.\u201d Thus, the trial judge reasoned, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 49(b), that it was appropriate to enter a judgment consistent with the answers to the \u201cspecial interrogatories,\u201d questions 1 through 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-22\">The record reflects the intention of the trial court and counsel to be that of submitting a special verdict to the jury. More importantly, the trial court assured counsel a new trial would be granted if the answer to question 9 \u2014 \u201cthe housekeeping question\u201d \u2014 was inconsistent with the answers to the special verdict questions, questions 1 through 8. Under these circumstances, we conclude it was improper for the trial court to deny appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial. We reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b438-30\">. Thomas Shows also alleges that the trial court erred by submitting question 4 concerning scope of employment inasmuch as there was no evidence upon which a jury could con-elude that Sanders\u2019 activities were related to his duties as an employee. We find that there was evidence sufficient to allow submission of question 4 to the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
