Tanner, United States District Judge for the Western District of Washington, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b503-23\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b503-24\">The question presented on appeal is whether the District Court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs-appellees, and in holding that the insurance policy issued by appellant, Continental Casualty Company was unambiguous, and extended on its face individual liability coverage to G. T. \u201cTommy\u201d Townsend. For reasons hereafter discussed, this court affirms the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-25\">The crux of this case is the interpretation of the declaration/face sheet of the insurance policy in question. That sheet reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Named, Insured &amp; Address: (number &amp; street, town, county, and state).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-4\">K. L. Engebretson &amp; T. Townsend</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"azl-dedup-0\">DBA: Engebretson-Grupe Co.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-5\">P. 0. Box 818</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGg\">Mesa, Arizona 85201</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-6\">Named Insured is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-7\">(X) Individual ( ) Corporation (X) Partnership</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-8\">( ) Joint Venture ( ) Other: _</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">Appellant predicates its appeal on the depositions of Mr. John Wenig, who prepared the policy in question and Mrs. Nelda Pickering, an employee of the partnership and Mr. Townsend.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">Briefly, Mr. Wenig testified that it was his intent to insure only two persons and entities <em>viz., </em>Engebretson-Grupe Co., as a partnership and K. L. Engebretson as an individual. He further testified that he checked both the \u201cindividual\u201d and \u201cpartnership\u201d boxes to distinguish between two separate operations (one which was individually owned by K. L. Engebretson and the other which was partnership owned by both Mr. Engebretson and Mr. Townsend). We find that this contention is not supported on the face of the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">Appellant\u2019s argument is based upon <em>Dolph v. Cortez, </em>8 Ariz.App. 429, 446 P.2d 939 (1968), which held that a partnership cannot be sued in its own right because it is not a legal entity. <em>Dolph </em>does not support appellant\u2019s contention that in order to insure Mr. Engebretson and Mr. Townsend as partners of the Engebretson-Grupe Co., it was necessary to check the \u201cindividual\u201d box.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-12\">Furthermore, appellant\u2019s argument raises the following questions: (1) What precluded the insurance company from making it clear on the face of the instrument, by express language, that Mr. Townsend was not being covered as an individual, but only as to his partnership interest? (2) Why then didn\u2019t appellant specify the extent of the coverage to Mr. Townsend by checking the \u201cother\u201d box category? (3) What language is there on the declaration/face sheet that would indicate Mr. Wenig\u2019s intent to insure the partnership and Mr. Engebretson and not Mr. Townsend as an individual?</p>\n<p id=\"b504-14\">Mr. Wenig on cross examination testified that, \u201cThere was nothing in the policy expressing his intent to insure Mr. Engebret-son as an individual, but not Mr. Townsend\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-15\">Ms. Nelda Pickering, who also had dealings with Mr. Wenig, testified that it was her understanding that the policy covered both men as well as the partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-16\">Appellant cites several cases for the proposition that the cardinal principle in construing policies of insurance is that the intention of the parties control. However, those cases also hold that it is the intention of the parties as expressed by the <em>terms </em>that govern a contract. <em>D. M. A. F. B. Federal Credit Union v. Employers Mutual Liability Insurance Co. of Wisconsin, </em>96 Ariz. 399, 396 P.2d 20 (1964), and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-17\">We are not convinced by appellant\u2019s argument that although doubtful meanings contained in an insurance policy are to be construed in favor of the insured and against the insurer, that rule operates only upon the determination of identity of the insured pursuant to <em>Wylie v. Mountain Motors, </em>126 W.Va. 205, 27 S.E.2d 494 (1943). <em>Wylie </em>is narrow in construction and has not been accepted by Arizona courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-18\">We agree with the district court that on the face of the instrument, it is apparent that coverage extended to \u201cTommy Townsend\u201d individually. In view of the foregoing, judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
