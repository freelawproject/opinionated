We find there was error and remand. '</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-11\">I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND OF LITIGATION.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-12\">Plaintiffs (appellants) Ellen Ray and William Sehaap sent identical letters to the CIA requesting \u201ca copy of any file you may have on me.\u201d The CIA replied that while it did not have files on plaintiffs, there were documents in CIA files that referred to plaintiffs. The CIA refused to release those documents, and after administrative appeals were exhausted, plaintiffs brought this action under the FOIA. The CIA subsequently released portions of the withheld documents, and the government then moved for summary judgment, relying principally on affidavits of one Eloise Page. The critical affidavit, set out in the appendix, purports to describe the documents at issue and the grounds for the government\u2019s claims of exemption.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1251-19\">The district court granted the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion for <em>in camera </em>inspection.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It found that the withheld documents were exempt from disclosure under the FOIA on the basis of Exemption 1 alone, Exemption 3 alone, or the two exemptions coupled together. As to Exemption 1, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(1),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the court found that the affidavit showed that the documents were properly classified under Executive Order 11,652, 3 C.F.R. 339 (1974). As to Exemption 3, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the court found that the affidavits stated that the release of the information could reasonably be expected to reveal intelligence sources and methods as well as organizational data, and that 50 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 403(d)(3), 403g justified the CIA invocation of Exemption 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-20\">In a key passage, the district court\u2019s opinion stressed that \u201cthere has been no credible challenge to the veracity of these averments [in the affidavits] and nothing appears to raise the issue of bad faith.\u201d In denying <em>in camera </em>inspection, the district court relied on Weissman <em>v. CIA, </em>184 U.S.App.D.C. 117, 565 F.2d 692 (1977). Specifically, the court found with respect to Exemption 1 that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>[t]he affidavits in this record are specific and detailed. The record further indicates that the Agency dealt with plaintiffs\u2019 requests in a conscientious manner and released segregable portions of the material. No abuse of discretion has been shown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1252-4\">Memorandum Opinion at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-5\">Regarding Exemption 3, it ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1252-6\">With respect to documents withheld under exemption 3, in camera inspection is seldom, if ever, necessary or appropriate. * * * Exemption 3 differs from other FOIA exemptions in that its applicability does not depend on the factual content of specific documents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1252-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-8\">On appeal, the government insists that the pertinent documents are exempt under Exemption 1 and are also exempt under Exemption 3.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Plaintiffs assert that discovery and <em>in camera </em>inspection by the district court was required, because documents 2 through 10 contain segregable material that is not exempt, and because neither document 2 nor document 10 is exempt under Exemption 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-9\">II. RELEVANT CONSIDERATIONS IN FOIA CASES INVOLVING NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-10\">The FOIA was passed in 1966, as an amendment to the Administrative Procedure Act, in order to increase disclosure of government information to the American people. Agencies were required to disclose all records that did not come within one of nine explicit exemptions specified by Congress.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the event of agency nondisclosure, the Act provided for court review. In any such case, \u201cthe court shall determine the matter de novo . . . and the burden is on the agency to sustain its action.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1252-17\">A. <em>Judicial Interpretations and Legislative Modifications.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1252-18\">In <em>EPA v. Mink, </em>410 U.S. 73, 81-84, 93 S.Ct. 827, 35 L.Ed.2d 119 (1973), the Court considered Exemption 1, which at that time covered matters \u201cspecifically required by Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of the national defense or foreign policy.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(1) (1970). It held that a court should not review the substantive propriety of the classification or go behind an agency affidavit stating that the requested documents had been duly classified pursuant to Executive order.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Court said that \u201cCongress chose to follow the Executive\u2019s determination in these matters,\u201d and <em>in camera </em>inspection to test the propriety of the classification was not authorized. 410 U.S. at 81, 93 S.Ct. at 833.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-19\">In 1974 Congress overrode a presidential veto and amended the FOIA for the express <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number>purpose of changing this aspect of the <em>Mink </em>case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Exemption 1 was modified to exempt only matters that are \u201c(A) specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and (B) are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(1) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-5\">Furthermore, the 1974 revision changed the FOIA language describing the role of a reviewing court considering <em>any </em>claim of exemption. It provided that \u201cthe court shall determine the matter de novo, and may examine the contents of such agency records in camera to determine whether such records or any part thereof shall be withheld under any of the exemptions set forth in subsection (b) of this section, and the burden is on the agency to sustain its action.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) (1976). The Conference Report accompanying the amendments explained that \u201c[w]hile <em>in camera </em>examination need not be automatic, in many situations it will plainly be necessary and appropriate.\u201d S.Rep. No. 93-1200, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 9 (1974), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1974, p. 6287.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-6\">Exemption 3 originally exempted matters \u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3) (1970). In <em>FA A Administrator v. Robertson, </em>422 U.S. 255, 95 S.Ct. 2140, 45 L.Ed.2d 164 (1975), the Court held that a statute could \u201cspecifically exempt\u201d matters from disclosure even if the statute gave an agency broad discretion to determine whether the information should be withheld.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Concerned about excessive agency discretion, Congress in 1976 passed an amendment to change the result reached in <em>Robertson. </em>Exemption 3 now authorizes nondisclosure of matters \u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute provided that such statute (A) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (B) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3) (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-10\">B. <em>The Nature of De Novo Review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1253-11\">\n<em>Procedures to be observed</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-12\">In <em>Vaughn v. Rosen, </em>157 U.S.App.D.C. 340, 484 F.2d 820 (1973) <em>cert. denied, </em>415 U.S. 977, 94 S.Ct. 1564, 39 L.Ed.2d 873 (1974), this court sought to cope with the difficulty of providing de novo review of exemptions claimed by the government. It initiated procedures designed to mitigate the administrative burden on the courts and ensure that the burden of justifying claimed exemptions would in fact be borne by the agencies to whom it had been assigned by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-13\">The court took its cue from a portion of the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Mink </em>opinion that was not overruled by Congress \u2014 the portion discussing how a court should proceed when there is a factual dispute concerning the nature of the materials being withheld.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cExpanding\u201d on the Supreme Court\u2019s \u201coutline,\u201d the court established the following procedures: (1) A requirement that the agency submit a \u201crelatively detailed analysis [of the material withheld] in manageable segments.\u201d \u201c[C]onclusory and generalized allegations of exemptions\u201d would no longer be accepted by reviewing courts. 157 U.S. App.D.C. at 346, 484 F.2d at 826. (2) \u201c[A]n indexing system [that] would subdivide the document under consideration into manageable parts cross-referenced to the relevant portion of the Government\u2019s justification.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1192\">*1192</page-number><em>Id. </em>157 U.S.App.D.C. at 347, 484 F.2d at 827. This index would allow the district court and opposing counsel to locate specific areas of dispute for further examination and would be an indispensible aid to the court of appeals reviewing the district court\u2019s decision. (3) \u201c[A]dequate adversary testing\u201d would be ensured by opposing counsel's access to the information included in the agency\u2019s detailed and indexed justification and by <em>in camera </em>inspection, guided by the detailed affidavit and using special masters appointed by the court whenever the burden proved to be especially onerous. <em>Id. </em>157 U.S.App.D.C. at 348, 484 F.2d at 828.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1254-4\">In proposing the 1974 amendments, the Senate Committee outlined the ruling in <em>Vaughn </em>and added, \u201cThe committee supports this approach. . . . \u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1254-5\">\n<em>The judicial function as emphasized by 1974 amendments</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1254-6\">In some of the decisions involving national security issues, there has been confusion about the nature of the evidentiary burdens and the scope of the district judge\u2019s discretion. This uncertainty is due to a misunderstanding of the\u2019 legislative history of the 1974 amendments.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> There were differences in 1974 between the Senate Committee and the House, between the Senate and its Committee, and between the Legislative and Executive Branches. For an authoritative exposition of the purpose and effect of the 1974 amendments, it suffices for present purposes to quote a few key paragraphs of the Conference Committee report: <footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1254-11\">The conference substitute follows the Senate amendment, providing that in determining <em>de novo </em>whether agency records have been properly withheld, the court may examine records <em>in camera </em>in making its determination under any of the nine categories of exemptions under section 552(b) of the law. In <em>Environmental Protection Agency v. Mink, et al., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1193\">*1193</page-number>410 U.S. 73, 93 S.Ct. 827, 35 L.Ed.2d 119 (1973), the Supreme Court ruled that <em>in camera </em>inspection of documents withheld under section 552(b)(1) of the law, authorizing the withholding of classified information, would ordinarily be precluded in Freedom of Information cases, unless Congress directed otherwise. H.R. 12471 amends the present law to permit such <em>in camera </em>examination at the discretion of the court. While <em>in camera </em>examination need not be automatic, in many situations it will plainly be necessary and appropriate. Before the court orders <em>in camera </em>inspection, the Government should be given the opportunity to establish by means of testimony or detailed affidavits that the documents are clearly exempt from disclosure. The burden remains on the Government under this law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1255-5\">s(e * sfc <em>% </em>s(c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1255-6\">When linked with the authority conferred upon the Federal courts in this conference substitute for <em>in camera </em>examination of contested records as part of their <em>de novo </em>determination in Freedom of Information cases, this clarifies Congressional intent to override the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in the ease of <em>E.P.A. v. Mink, et al., </em>supra, with respect to <em>in camera </em>review of classified documents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1255-10\">However, the conferees recognize that the Executive departments responsible for national defense and foreign policy matters have unique insights into what adverse affects might occur as a result of public disclosure of a particular classified record. Accordingly, the conferees expect that Federal courts, in making <em>de novo </em>determinations in section 552(b)(1) cases under the Freedom of Information law, will accord substantial weight to an agency\u2019s affidavit concerning the details of the classified status of the disputed record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1255-11\">The legislative history underscores that the intent of Congress regarding de novo review stood in contrast to, and was a rejection of, the alternative suggestion proposed by the Administration and supported by some Senators: that in the national security context the court should be limited to determining whether there was a reasonable basis for the decision by the appropriate official to withhold the document.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In proposing a \u201creasonable basis\u201d standard, the Administration and supporting legislators argued that de novo responsibility and <em>in camera </em>inspection could not properly be assigned to judges, in part because of logistical problems, and in part because of their lack of relevant experience and meaningful appreciation of the implications of the material involved.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Those who prevailed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1194\">*1194</page-number>the legislature both resisted the Administration proposal on first consideration and voted to override President Ford\u2019s veto of the bill containing the provision for de novo review and <em>in camera </em>inspection. They stressed the need for an objective, independent judicial determination, and insisted that judges could be trusted to approach the national security determinations with common sense, and without jeopardy to national security.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> They emphasized that in reaching a de novo determination the judge would accord substantial weight to detailed agency affidavits and take into account that the executive had \u201cunique insights into what adverse affects might occur as a re-suit of public disclosure of a particular classified record.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1256-14\">The salient characteristics of de novo review in the national security context can be summarized as follows: (1) The government has the burden of establishing an exemption. (2) The court must make a de novo determination. (3) In doing this, it must first \u201caccord substantial weight to an agency\u2019s affidavit concerning the details of the classified status of the disputed record.\u201d <footnotemark>20</footnotemark> (4) Whether and how to conduct an <em>in camera </em>examination of the documents rests in the sound discretion of the court, in national security cases as in all other cases.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> To these observations should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1195\">*1195</page-number>added an excerpt <em>from our </em>opinion in <em>Weissman </em>(as revised): \u201cIf exemption is claimed on the basis of national security the District Court must, of course, be satisfied that proper procedures have been followed, and that by its sufficient description the contested document logically falls into the category of the exemption indicated.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1257-4\">In part, the foregoing considerations were developed for Exemption 1. They also apply to Exemption 3 when the statute providing criteria for withholding is in furtherance of national security interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-5\">\n<em>In camera inspection</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-6\">In the case at bar, the district court observed: \u201cWith respect to documents withheld under exemption 3, in camera inspection is seldom, if ever, necessary or appropriate.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The legislative history does not support that conclusion. Congress left the matter of <em>in camera </em>inspection to the discretion of the district court, without any indication of the extent of its proper use. The ultimate criterion is simply this: Whether the district judge believes that <em>in camera </em>inspection is needed in order to make a responsible de novo determination on the claims of exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-8\"> <em>In camera </em>inspection requires effort and resources and therefore a court should not resort to it routinely on the theory that \u201cit can\u2019t hurt.\u201d When an agency affidavit or other showing is specific, there may be no need for <em>in camera </em>inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-9\">On the other hand, when the district judge is concerned that he is not prepared to make a responsible de novo determination in the absence of <em>in camera </em>inspection, he may proceed <em>in camera </em>without anxiety that the law interposes an extraordinary hurdle to such inspection. The government would presumably prefer <em>in camera </em>inspection to a ruling that the case stands in doubt or equipoise and hence must be resolved by a ruling that the government has not sustained its burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-14\">The issue of bad faith merits a word. The memorandum of the district court noted that there was no evidence of bad faith on the part of the Agency\u2019s officials. Where the record contains a showing of bad faith, the district court would likely require <em>in camera </em>inspection. But the government\u2019s burden does not mean that all assertions in a government affidavit must routinely be verified by audit. Reasonable specificity in affidavits connotes a quality of reliability. When an affidavit or showing is reasonably specific and demonstrates, if accepted, that the documents are exempt, these exemptions are not to be undercut by mere assertion of claims of bad faith or misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-15\"><em>In camera </em>inspection does not depend on a finding or even tentative finding of bad faith. A judge has discretion to order <em>in camera </em>inspection on the basis of an uneasiness, on a doubt he wants satisfied before he takes responsibility for a de novo determination. Government officials who would not stoop to misrepresentation may reflect an inherent tendency to resist disclosure, and judges may take this natural inclination into account.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-16\">III. RULINGS FOR THE CASE AT BAR</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-17\">Two affidavits were executed by Eloise Page, Chief, Operations Staff of the Directorate of Operations of the CIA. The first is a general statement about the dangers at large of disclosure, background and local color rather than any attempt to link these concerns with specific documents. It is of little aid in the task of deciding whether the nine specific documents now sought come within the claimed exemptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1196\">*1196</page-number>\n<em>Documents 2-6</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-4\">Page\u2019s second affidavit, set out in the appendix, purports to link specific exemptions to specific documents. A glaring defect is that it lumps the exemptions together and fails to identify whether different exemptions are claimed as to different parts of each document. The statement for document 2 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-5\">This document is a three-page memorandum the subject of which is \u201cRennie Davis and Friends.\u201d It is essentially the debriefing report of a sensitive intelligence source. The majority of the information concerns individuals other than the plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-6\">This document has been denied in its entirety, primarily to protect intelligence sources and methods since the release of any meaningful portion would disclose the identity of the source, and further, to protect cryptonyms, names of CIA personnel and CIA organizational data. Thus exemptions (b)(1), (b)(3) and (b)(6) apply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1258-7\">The statement for documents 3, 4 and 5 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1258-8\">These documents are one-page cables from an overseas CIA installation which advise Headquarters of the receipt of documents and information from a foreign intelligence service and which concern the plaintiffs and other individuals. They are denied in their entirety pursuant to Freedom of Information Act exemptions (b)(1), (b)(3) and (b)(6).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1258-9\">In reviewing the judgment on documents 2-6, we encounter a complex of difficulties. Exemption 3 permits a withholding under the provisions of 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 403g (1970), which specifies that \u201cin order further to implement the proviso of section 403(d)(3) of this title that the Director of Central Intelligence shall be responsible for protecting intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure, the Agency shall be exempted from . . . the provisions of any . . . law which require the publication or disclosure of the organization, functions, names, official titles, salaries, or numbers of personnel employed by the Agency . . . .\u201d <em>Goland v. CIA, </em>No. 76-1800, slip op. at 16-17 (D.C.Cir., May 23,1978); <em>cf. Weissman v. CIA, </em>184 U.S.App.D.C. 117,119, 565 F.2d 692,694 (1977). However, in <em>Goland, </em>the affidavit demonstrated \u201cin nonconclusory and detailed fashion\u201d (slip op. at 21), that the deleted material disclosed intelligence sources and methods. The CIA\u2019s affidavit as to documents 2-6 is not a specific presentation such as that in <em>Goland. </em>The statement that the release of any meaningful portion of document 2 would disclose the identity of a \u201csensitive intelligence source\u201d has some particularity, but it runs into a failure to address specifically whether the disclosure of substantive information may be possible without the disclosure of source, and if not why not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-14\">As to Exemption 1, the information that document 2 relates to \u201cRennie Davis and Friends,\u201d might be some indication that it was reasonable for the official involved to have classified it in the first instance. But that mere reference is not enough information to permit a judge to make an independent ruling that the classification was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-15\">Finally, what overhangs and in a sense pervades this case, more vivid as to document 2 but implicit as to the other documents, is the real possibility that what animates the CIA\u2019s broadsword withholding is the fact that the documents contain commentary on a group of persons, with the CIA\u2019s position being that Exemption 6 prohibits any revelation from its files about individuals other than appellants. We discuss Exemption 6 further below. It suffices here to say that we do not have any analysis of Exemption 6 by the district court, and the problem is complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-16\">Overall, we have a critical problem of segregability, that some portion of the document(s) may be exempt, but that the FOIA might contemplate disclosure in part. The difficulty arises from the CIA\u2019s proffer of multiple exemptions for each withheld document, and is maintained by the district court\u2019s conclusory rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1197\">*1197</page-number>The reviewing court should not be required to speculate on the precise relationship between each exemption claim and the contents of the specific document. The district judge is not called upon to take on the role of censor \u2014 going through a line-by-line analysis for each document and removing particular words. If, however, the problematic material appears in a particular place or places that can be manageably identified, indexing is not to be bypassed because it is something of a chore.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-5\">\n<em>Documents 7-9</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-6\">Page\u2019s affidavit describes document 7 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1259-7\">Document No. 7 is a three-page cable from CIA Headquarters to the Director, FBI, which provides information on an individual under investigation for the bombing <em>of </em>the United States Capitol on March 1, 1971. It is the report of a highly sensitive, foreign intelligence source.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1259-8\">Page\u2019s affidavit identifies documents 8 and 9 as intra-agency cables concerning the same matter. It continues: \u201cEach of these documents contains a single, peripheral and non-substantive reference to the Plaintiff Schaap. In each case, that portion has been provided to the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-9\">Documents 7 \u2014 9 identify a particular subject: information concerning an individual under investigation for the 1971 bombing of the Capitol. There are manifest disclosure problems under Exemption 6 in view of the privacy interests of that individual, as well as under Exemptions 1 and 3. However, the CIA affidavit does not specifically claim that all of the documents (7-9) are exempt under Exemption 6, and that there are no other portions that may be reasonably seg-regable. And the district court's ruling was solely on Exemptions 1 and 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-10\">Apparently the only direct reference to Schaap in these three documents is the material that CIA has furnished to him, a bare mention of his name and address in document 7, plus the information in documents 8 and 9 that he is a partner in a law firm that has represented the Black Panther party.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-12\">The CIA does not take the position that the furnishing of these references is fully responsive to Schaap\u2019s request. It has properly refrained from an approach whereby FOIA applications are read technically and narrowly, like a common law pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-13\">However, the CIA again has not been responsive to the requirement that it provide specific affidavits that segregate each of its claims. The \u201cexemption by document\u201d approach has been rejected by our opinions, notably <em>Vaughn, </em>157 U.S.App.D.C. at 345-46, 484 F.2d at 825-26, and <em>Mead Data Central, Inc. v. Dept. of the Air Force, </em>184 U.S.App.D.C. 350, 367-70, 566 F.2d 242, 259-62 (1977). The agency may not rely on that approach even in a national security context. The agency must provide a reasonable segregation as to the portions of the document that are involved in each of its claims for exemption. As indicated in <em>Mead, </em>it is important that the affidavit indicate the extent to which each document would be claimed as exempt under each of the exemptions. The courts cannot meaningfully exercise their responsibility under the FOIA unless the government affidavits are as specific as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-14\">\n<em>Document 10</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-15\">The withholding of document 10 cannot be disposed of on the basis of Exemptions 1 and 3, as the district court held. The government concedes that some of the information in that document is not within the ambit of those exemptions. It argues instead that there is justification for withholding under Exemptions 6 and 7. However, the district court did not rule on these exemptions. We think that their applicability should be considered in the first instance by the district court and remand for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-16\">The applicability of Exemption 6 depends, as the Supreme Court, held in <em>Department of Air Force v. Rose, </em>425 U.S. 352, 96 S.Ct. 1592, 48 L.Ed.2d 11 (1976), on a particularized balancing of privacy interests and the \u201c'public\u2019s right to governmental information.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 372, 96 S.Ct. 1592 (quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1198\">*1198</page-number>S.Rep. No. 813 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 9 (1965)). An Exemption 6 claim was raised by the CIA for all the documents sought by plaintiffs and its position was set forth in a paragraph of the first Page affidavit.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The first sentence of that paragraph suggests that the CIA conducts its own balancing test to determine whether the disclosure of the names of others would involve a \u201cclearly unwarranted invasion of privacy.\u201d The remainder of the paragraph tends to indicate that the CIA has a broad policy that prohibits disclosures from CIA files of references to individuals other than the applicant as an invasion of privacy. The point is made that many of these references are innocent yet would reflect disparagingly on the individuals due to the climate of opinion concerning the CIA and its activities. This application of Exemption 6 would be more far-reaching than our conclusion that privacy interests protected by Exemption 6 are brought into play by a stigmatizing disclosure of another individual as linked to a bombing of the Capitol.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-5\">The problem requires a balancing analysis. Before the district court considers the matter on remand, it will be able to obtain clarification as to CIA policy and approach. * <em>* </em>* * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-6\">We remand for reconsideration of the CIA\u2019s exemption claims in light of clarification of the affidavits and for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-8\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-9\">SUPPLEMENTAL AFFIDAVIT</p>\n<p id=\"ay9-dedup-0\">Eloise Page, being first duly sworn, deposes and says:</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-10\">1.

When forced to support its denial with detailed affidavits,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the CIA revealed that it controlled 10 documents that referred to one or both appellants and released portions of five of these. The Agency continued to withhold most of the information, however, relying on Exemptions 1, 3, 6, and 7(F).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The CIA then moved for summary judgment on the basis of its affidavits, and appellants moved for an <em>in camera </em>inspection of the disputed information. Before any discovery had taken place the District Court denied appellants\u2019 motion and granted summary judgment for the CIA on the ground that all the information still being withheld was exempt from disclosure under Exemptions 1 and 3.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court found it unnecessary to determine whether any other exemptions applied. Ray and Schaap then appealed to this court, challenging the grounds on which the District Court had granted summary judgment and the sufficiency of the CIA affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-13\">I. THE EVOLUTION OF FOIA REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b1263-14\">In 1966 Congress amended the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) to increase disclosure of government information to the American people.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Congress had determined that the previous \u201cpublic information\u201d section of the APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002 (1964), was \u201cof little or no value to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>public in gaining access to records of the Federal Government\u201d because it allowed \u201cany Government official * * * under color of law [to] withhold almost anything from any citizen under the vague standards \u2014or, more precisely, lack of standards \u2014 in [Section 1002].\u201d S.Rep. No. 813, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 5 (1965). Section 1002 gave the agencies broad and effectively unreviewa-ble discretion to determine whether information should be withheld \u201cfor good cause\u201d or \u201cin the public interest,\u201d and Congress found that as a result \u201c[innumerable times * * * information is withheld only to cover up embarrassing mistakes or irregularities * * Id. at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-4\">The Freedom of Information Act sought to remedy these defects by transferring from the agencies to Congress and the courts primary responsibility for determining whether information could be withheld. Several specific provisions accomplished this transfer: (1) agencies were required to disclose all records that did not come within one of nine specific exemptions written by Congress;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (2) courts were given authority to review de <em>novo </em>any denial of access \u201cin order that the ultimate decision as to to the propriety of the agency\u2019s action is made by the court and [to] prevent [review] from becoming meaningless judicial sanctioning of agency discretion\u201d;<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and (3) in any review proceeding an agency denying disclosure, rather than enjoying a presumption of correctness, was saddled with the burden of proving that its action was proper.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1264-10\">A. <em>Restrictive Interpretation and Corrective Legislation: </em>Mink <em>and </em>Robinson</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-11\">The ambitious scheme established by the FOIA was not without its difficulties. The agencies were quick to discover ambiguities in the language of the nine exclusive exemptions, and courts have often proved too sensitive to the potential burdens of <em>de novo </em>review and to their alleged lack of expertise. Indeed, in two of its first FOIA cases the Supreme Court interpreted the two exemptions relied on by the District Court in this case in ways that restricted the reviewing court\u2019s role and preserved the discretion of the withholding agency. In each case Congress soon reversed the Court\u2019s interpretation by legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1264-12\">First, in <em>EPA v. Mink, </em>410 U.S. 73, 81-84, 93 S.Ct. 827, 35 L.Ed.2d 119 (1973), the Court held that when an agency relied on Exemption 1, which at that time covered matters \u201cspecifically required by Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of the national defense or foreign policy,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(1) (1970), a reviewing court could affirm the nondisclosure solely on the basis of an agency affidavit stating that the requested documents had been duly classified pursuant to Executive order.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> According to the Court, \u201cCongress chose to follow the Executive\u2019s determination in these matters,\u201d and <em>in camera </em>inspection to test the propriety of the classification was neither authorized nor permitted. 410 U.S. at 81, 93 S.Ct. at 833. Within two years Congress <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>overrode a presidential veto to amend the FOIA with the express purpose of overruling this aspect of the <em>Mink </em>case.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Exemption 1 was modified to exempt only matters that are \u201c(A) specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and (B) are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(1) (1976). Furthermore, the language describing the role of a reviewing court considering <em>any </em>claim of exemption was amended to provide that \u201cthe court shall determine the matter de novo, and may examine the contents of such agency records in camera to determine whether such records or any part thereof shall be withheld under any of the exemptions set forth in subsection (b) of this section, and the burden is on the agency to sustain its action.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(a)(4)(B) (1976). The Conference Report accompanying the amendments explained that \u201c[w]hile <em>in camera </em>examination need not be automatic, <em>in many situations it will plainly be necessary and appropriate.\u201d </em>S.Rep. No. 1200, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 9 (1974) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-5\">The second Supreme Court case involved Exemption 3, which originally exempted matters \u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3) (1970). In <em>FAA Administrator v. Robertson, </em>422 U.S. 255, 95 S.Ct. 2140, 45 L.Ed.2d 164 (1975), the Court held that a statute could \u201cspecifically exempt\u201d matters from disclosure even if the statute gave an agency broad discretion to determine whether the information should be withheld.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As noted above, congressional concern about excessive agency discretion to withhold information had been a prime stimulus to enactment of the FOIA. Alarmed by the threat to the purposes of the FOIA created by the <em>Robertson </em>decision, Congress acted within 15 months to overrule the case by legislation.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Exemption 3 now authorizes nondisclosure of matters \u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute * * * <em>provided that such statute (A) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (B) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.\u201d </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3) (1976) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-9\">B. <em>Creative Judicial Responses: </em>Vaughn v. Rosen</p>\n<p id=\"b1265-10\">Not all judicial decisions involving the FOIA have suffered from the restrictive attitude apparent in the aspects of the <em>Mink </em>and <em>Robertson </em>cases overruled by Congress.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Courts have sometimes shown a willingness to assume the initiative in developing creative solutions to the problems associated with <em>de novo </em>review of refusals to disclose information. In <em>Vaughn v. Ro-sen, </em>157 U.S.App.D.C. 340, 484 F.2d 820 (1973), for example, this court acknowledged the difficulty of reviewing the record before it, but then attempted to do something to correct the situation. The Civil Service Commission had withheld documents totalling \u201cmany hundreds of pages\u201d and had supported its action with an affida<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>vit stating only in general terms that the material was exempt under three exemptions to the FOIA.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The appellants challenged not only the claim that the exemptions covered the material withheld but also the agency\u2019s description of the nature of the material. <em>De novo </em>review under these circumstances would have required an enormous expenditure of judicial energy, not only to inspect all the material <em>in camera, </em>but to determine which portions were exempt under which exemptions. 157 U.S.App.D.C. at 345, 484 F.2d at 825. The District Court had granted summary judgment in favor of the agency, but had not stated any grounds for its action, thus leaving the Court of Appeals with nothing to review except the conclusory affidavit and the withheld materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b1266-4\">This court noted the irony that, while the FOIA placed an \u201coverwhelming emphasis upon disclosure,\u201d the facts relevant to judicial review of nondisclosure were totally within the control of the party refusing disclosure. <em>Id., </em>157 U.S.App.D.C. at 343, 484 F.2d at 823. Even an <em>in camera </em>inspection by the court is an <em>ex parte </em>proceeding conducted without the adversarial assistance of the party seeking disclosure.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Thus, although the statute specified that the <em>agencies </em>were to bear the burden of sustaining their refusals to disclose requested materials, the greatest burden was in practice being placed on the <em>courts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1266-5\">To bring practice more into line with the statutory mandate, this court initiated procedures designed to shift the burden of justifying nondisclosure back to the agencies and to give the party seeking disclosure a greater chance to participate in the review proceeding. The court took its cue from a portion of the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Mink </em>opinion that was not overruled by Congress \u2014 the portion discussing how a court should proceed when there was a factual dispute concerning the nature of the materials being withheld.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> \u201cExpanding\u201d on the Supreme Court\u2019s \u201coutline,\u201d the court established the following procedures: (1) A requirement that the agency submit a \u201crelatively detailed analysis [of the material withheld] in manageable s\u00e9gments.\u201d \u201c[C]onclusory and generalized allegations of exemptions\u201d would no longer be accepted by reviewing courts, 157 U.S.App.D.C. at 346, 484 F.2d at 826. (2) \u201c[A]n indexing system [that] would subdivide the document under consideration into manageable parts cross-referenced to the relevant portion of the Government\u2019s justification.\u201d <em>Id., </em>157 U.S.App.D.C. at 347, 484 F.2d at 827. This index would allow the District Court and opposing counsel to locate specific areas of dispute for further examination and would be an indispensable aid to the Court of Appeals reviewing the District Court\u2019s decision. (3) \u201c[A]dequate adversary testing,\u201d to be insured by opposing counsel\u2019s having the information included in the agency\u2019s detailed and indexed justification and by <em>in camera </em>inspection, guided by the detailed affidavit and using special masters appointed by the court when the burden was espe-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>dally onerous. <em>Id., </em>157 U.S.App.D.C. at 348, 484 F.2d at 828.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1267-5\">The <em>Vaughn </em>procedures were an innovative step toward making <em>de novo </em>review a reality, but even this court has recognized that they are no panacea. <em>See, e. g., Cuneo v. Schlesinger, </em>157 U.S.App.D.C. 368, 374, 484 F.2d 1086, 1092 (1973) (Bazelon, J., concurring). Commentators generally have applauded the decision,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> but some have raised troublesome questions about whether the new procedures would be enough to achieve the \u201cadversariness\u201d and real <em>de novo </em>review required by the FOIA.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1267-6\">C. <em>Special Problems in Gases Involving National Security</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1267-7\">While achieving the goals of the FOIA may well demand more than <em>Vaughn </em>requires, implementing even the minimal procedures outlined in <em>Vaughn </em>has proven difficult in cases that, like the one before us, involved claims of danger to national security. Persistent controversy has surrounded the question whether FOIA cases involving national security claims should be treated differently from other FOIA cases. Arguments have focused on the proper standard of judicial review and on the use of certain techniques \u2014 primarily <em>in camera </em>inspection \u2014 in the review process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1267-11\">The Supreme Court sought to resolve this controversy when it held in <em>Mink </em>that courts could not question the substantive propriety of agency classifications in suits involving refusals to disclose based on Exemption 1 and that <em>in camera </em>inspection was therefore improper in such cases.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In response to the <em>Mink </em>case, however, Congress specifically considered the standard of review and the propriety of <em>in camera </em>inspection in cases involving national security issues (primarily Exemption 1 cases) when it developed and passed the 1974 FOIA amendments. Provisions concerning these issues were a major focus not only of congressional debate on these amendments, but also of President Ford\u2019s veto message. As noted above,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Congress overrode the President\u2019s veto and expressly provided for <em>de novo </em>review and permissive <em>in camera </em>examination in <em>all </em>FOIA cases, including those involving national security claims, thus rejecting the Nixon and Ford Administrations\u2019 attempts to salvage the <em>Mink </em>case\u2019s special limits on the scope and methods of review in national security cases. Nevertheless, some recent court decisions reveal a confusion over several passages in the legislative history of the 1974 amendments,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>and a somewhat detailed examination of the legislative history is therefore in order to clarify congressional intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1268-4\">1. <em>Legislative History of the 1974 FOIA Amendments</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1268-5\">During committee consideration of the legislation that was to become the 1974 FOIA amendments, the Nixon Administration, asserting that the courts lacked the expertise to determine what information should be classified, vigorously resisted any attempt to overrule the restrictive holding of the <em>Mink </em>case.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The House Committee on Government Operations nevertheless refused to accord special treatment to national security cases and reported a bill providing for <em>de novo </em>review and permissive <em>in camera </em>inspection in all FOIA cases.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The full House overwhelmingly approved the reported bill with only a minor technical amendment.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1268-7\">The bill reported by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, on the other hand, reflected to some degree the influence of the Administration\u2019s arguments. It provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1268-8\">(ii) In determining whether a document is in fact specifically required by an Executive order or statute to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy, * * * [i]f there has been filed in the record an affidavit by the head of the agency certifying that he has personally examined the documents withheld and has determined after such examination that they should be withheld under the criteria established by statute or Executive order referred to in subsection (b)(1) of this section, the court <em>shall sustain such withholding unless, </em>following its in camera examination, <em>it finds the withholding is without a reasonable basis under such criteria.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ax3-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>S. 2543, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., \u00a7 b(2), <em>reprinted in </em>Staffs of Senate Committee on the Judiciary and House Committee on Government Operations, Freedom of Information Act and Amendments of 1974 (P.L. 93-502): Source Book: Legislative History, Texts, and Other Documents (Committee Print 1975) (hereinafter cited as Source Book), at 282 (emphasis added). The Committee Report accompanying the bill explained: \u2022</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1269-4\">This standard of review does not allow the court to substitute its judgment for that of the agency \u2014 as under a <em>de novo </em>review \u2014 but neither does it require the court to defer to the discretion of the agency, even if it finds the determination not arbitrary or capricious. Only if the court finds the withholding to be without a reasonable basis under the applicable Executive order or statute may it order the documents released.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1269-5\">S.Rep. No. 93-854, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. (1974), <em>reprinted in </em>Source Book, <em>supra, </em>at 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-6\">This partial victory for the Administration\u2019s viewpoint was short-lived. When the bill reported by the Committee reached the Senate floor, Senator Muskie, challenging the \u201coutworn myth that only those in possession of military and diplomatic confidences can have the expertise to decide with whom and when to share their knowledge[,]\u201d introduced an amendment to delete the provision establishing a special \u201creasonable basis\u201d standard of judicial review in national security cases.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The Muskie amendment passed easily<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> despite continued arguments from Administration supporters that requiring <em>de novo </em>review with the burden on the government would be unconstitutional and would risk exposing \u201cclassified material which the judicial branch is unprepared to properly evaluate.\u201d <footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1269-12\">After the Senate had passed the amended version of its bill, the Senate and House bills were referred to a Conference Committee to iron out the differences. During the Conference deliberations. President Nixon resigned and was succeeded by President Ford, who wrote to the Conference Committee to express his reservations about certain aspects of the proposed legislation. President Ford objected in particular to placing the burden on the government to justify its classification of documents in a <em>de novo </em>proceeding. His proposed alternative indicated the areas of controversy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AO6\">I could accept a provision with an express presumption that the classification was proper and with <em>in camera </em>judicial review only after a review of the evidence did not indicate that the matter had been reasonably classified in the interests of our national security. Following this review, the court could then disclose the document if it finds the classification to have been arbitrary, capricious, or without a reasonable basis. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1269-13\">Letter from President Gerald R. Ford to Honorable William S. Moorhead, August 20, 1974, <em>reprinted in </em>Source Book, <em>supra, </em>at 380.</p>\n<p id=\"b1269-14\">The Conference Committee did not adopt the President\u2019s proposal. Instead it followed the language of the Senate bill pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>viding for <em>de novo </em>review with the burden on the government and permissive <em>in camera </em>inspection in all FOIA cases, regardless of the exemption claimed. The Conference Report described the Committee\u2019s position as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1270-4\">The conference substitute follows the Senate amendment, providing that in determining <em>de novo </em>whether agency records have been properly withheld, the court may examine records <em>in camera </em>in making its determination under any of the nine categories of exemptions under section 552(b) of the law. In <em>Environmental Protection Agency v. Mink, et al., </em>410 U.S. 73 [93 S.Ct. 827, 35 L.Ed.2d 119] (1973), the Supreme Court ruled that <em>in camera </em>inspection of documents withheld under section 552(b)(1) of the law, authorizing the withholding of classified information, would ordinarily be precluded in Freedom of Information cases, unless Congress directed otherwise. H.R. 12741 amends the present law to permit such <em>in camera </em>examination at the discretion of the court. While <em>in camera </em>examination need not be automatic, in many situations it will plainly be necessary and appropriate. Before the court orders <em>in camera </em>inspection, the Government should be given the opportunity to establish by means of testimony or detailed affidavits that the documents are clearly exempt from disclosure. The burden remains on the Government under this law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1270-5\">S.Rep. No. 1200, <em>supra, </em>at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-6\">With regard to Exemption 1 in particular, the Conference combined the language of the House and Senate bills to ensure that \u201c[w]hen linked with the authority conferred upon the Federal courts in this conference substitute for <em>in camera </em>examination of contested records as part of their <em>de novo </em>determination in Freedom of Information cases, [the new language of Exemption 1] clarifies Congressional intent to override the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in the case of <em>E.P.A. </em>v. <em>Mink, et al., </em>supra, with respect to <em>in camera </em>review of classified documents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12. Then, without shifting the burden of proof or weakening the requirement of <em>de novo </em>review or curtailing the propriety of <em>in camera </em>examination, the Conference Report added the following qualification with respect to judicial review in cases involving national defense and foreign policy matters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1270-9\">However, the conferees recognize that the Executive departments responsible for national defense and foreign policy matters have unique insights into what adverse affects [s/c] might occur as a result of public disclosure of a particular classified record. Accordingly, the conferees expect that Federal courts, in making <em>de novo </em>determinations in section 552(b)(1) cases under the Freedom of Information law, will accord substantial weight to an agency\u2019s affidavit concerning the details of the classified status of the disputed record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1270-10\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1270-11\">This qualification was apparently designed to allay the fears expressed by President Ford, but the President was unwilling to accept legislation that still clearly placed the burden on the government under a <em>de novo </em>standard of judicial review. The President therefore vetoed the bill after both Houses of Congress had passed the Conference version.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> In his veto message the President offered a final proposal, quite similar to the bill originally reported by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary and rejected by the full Senate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1270-12\">I propose, therefore, that where classified documents are requested the courts could review the classification, but would have to uphold the classification if there is a reasonable basis to support it. In determining the reasonableness of the classification, the courts would consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>all attendant evidence prior to resorting to an <em>in camera </em>examination of the document.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1271-5\">Message from the President of the United States Vetoing H.R. 12471, H.Doe. No. 93-983, 93d Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>Source Book, <em>supra, </em>at 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-6\">The debate on whether to override the President\u2019s veto rehearsed for one last time the arguments over the need for and the danger of <em>de novo </em>judicial review in cases involving issues of national security. In the wake of Watergate the sentiments of both Houses of Congress were perhaps most succinctly summarized by Senator Baker:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1271-7\">In short, recent experience indicates that the Federal Government exhibits a proclivity for overclassification of information, especially that which is embarrassing or incriminating; and I believe that this trend would continue if judicial review of classified documents applied a presumption of validity to the classification as recommended by the President. De novo judicial determination based on in camera inspection of classified documents \u2014 as provided by the Freedom of Information Act amendments passed by the Congress \u2014 insures confidentiality for genuine military, intelligence, and foreign policy information while allowing citizens, scholars, and perhaps even Congress access to information which should be in the public domain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1271-8\">In balancing the minimal risks that a Federal judge might disclose legitimate national security information against the potential for mischief and criminal activity under the cloak of secrecy.

Basic Principles Governing Judicial Review of FOIA Cases Involving National Security Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ACbk\">The basic thrust of the amendments is clear on the face of the bills passed by both Houses of Congress and the statute passed over the President\u2019s veto: claims of exemption from FOIA based on national security are, like all other claims of exemption, to be subject to <em>de novo </em>judicial review with the burden on the government and with permissive <em>in camera </em>examination. This court\u2019s task \u2014 one that the court\u2019s <em>per curiam </em>opinion in my view fails to perform adequately \u2014 is to explain what these general directions mean in practical terms and to take proper account of certain language inserted into the Conference Report in an unsuccessful attempt to compromise with the Ford Administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b1271-16\">a. De Novo <em>Review With the Burden on the Government and Permissive </em>In Camera <em>Inspection.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1271-17\">The appropriate standard of review was at the core of the controversy between Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>gress and President over the 1974 amendments. Both the Nixon and the Ford Administrations urged Congress to replace the <em>de novo </em>review applied in other FOIA cases with some lesser degree of scrutiny in cases allegedly involving sensitive national security materials. The major argument made in favor of this special treatment was that judges lack the knowledge and expertise necessary to make decisions about disclosure in such cases.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Congress soundly rejected this contention, however, and refused to create a presumption in favor of agency classifications or to retreat from full <em>de novo </em>review.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1272-4\">The statutory requirement that review be <em>de novo </em>is intended to \u201cprevent it from becoming meaningless judicial sanctioning of agency discretion.\u201d S.Rep. No. 813, <em>supra, </em>at 8. Congress feared more than \u201cbad faith\u201d in the exercise of agency discretion to withhold government information. Even \u201cgood faith\u201d interpretations by an agency are likely to suffer from the bias of the agency, particularly when the agency is as zealous as the CIA has been in its responsibility to protect \u201cnational security.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Being aware of the dangers of relying too much on agency \u201cexpertise,\u201d Congress required the courts to take a fresh look at decisions against disclosure as a check against both intentional misrepresentations and inherent biases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1272-11\">In order to take the \u201cfresh look\u201d required for <em>de novo </em>review, a District Court must not only be aware of the relevant provisions in statutes and Executive orders, but must also know enough about the specific factual situation involved to enable it to decide for itself whether the materials are properly exempt from disclosure. The government, which bears the burden of proving that any exemption applies, can provide the District Court with the information necessary for its <em>de novo </em>determination in several ways. The Conference Report, in a passage responding in part to President Ford\u2019s objections, suggests that an agency should first be given \u201cthe opportunity to establish by means of testimony or detailed affidavits that the documents are <em>clearly </em>exempt from disclosure.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> These methods of supplying the relevant data also comport with the concern of this court in <em>Vaughn </em>to get as much information as possible into the public record in order to aid the adversary proc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>ess.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the Conference Report also recognizes that affidavits and testimony will not always provide the court with sufficient information to make such a \u201cclear\u201d determination \u2014 for example, in cases where affidavits sufficient to allow <em>de novo </em>review would reveal the very information that the agency claims is exempt, or in cases where the court suspects the agency of bad faith or overzealousness \u2014 and that <em>in camera </em>inspection will therefore \u201cin many situations * * * plainly be necessary and appropriate.\u201d S.Rep. No. 1200, <em>supra, </em>at 9.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1273-5\">By expressly endorsing <em>in camera </em>examination as a technique in the <em>de novo </em>review of <em>all </em>claimed exemptions, Congress rejected the various arguments that had been raised against this technique in the hearings and during the debates. The most frequently voiced objection to <em>in camera </em>inspection was the familiar argument against <em>de novo </em>review mentioned above: that judges lack the knowledge and expertise to evaluate the effects of releasing allegedly sensitive documents. Congress responded to this concern by noting that the reviewing court would have the benefit of the agency\u2019s affidavits \u2014 possibly including additional <em>in camera </em>affidavits \u201cin some cases of a particularly sensitive nature\u201d \u2014 when making its <em>in camera </em>examination<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> and by expressing its expectation that the reviewing court would accord \u201csubstantial weight\u201d to agency affidavits reflecting special knowledge or expertise.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Congress steadfastly refused, however, to modify the language of the statute endorsing permissive <em>in camera </em>inspection in national security cases because of a fear of judicial incompetence that it considered \u201cunfounded.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1273-9\">Opponents of <em>in camera </em>examination also warned that court personnel and procedures presented a high risk of unauthorized leaks. In response to this fear the Senate Report suggested initiation of reasonable precautions, including \u201climiting access by court personnel to those obtaining appropriate security clearances\u201d or appointing a \u201cspecial master who may be required by the court to obtain such security clearance as had been previously required for access to the contested documents.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1273-10\">Congress likewise recognized and encouraged the development of flexible responses to eliminate a third objection to <em>in camera </em>examination: the potential burden on the courts. The Senate Report approved <em>Vaughn\u2019s </em>suggestion that special masters be appointed in cases involving numerous documents.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Courts have also avoided the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1212\">*1212</page-number>burden of conducting a \u201cline-by-line\u201d analysis of thousands of pages by requiring indic-es and detailed affidavits and then examining only random samples of the contested material <em>in camera </em>as a check on the general accuracy and adequacy of the agency\u2019s analysis.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1274-4\">Finally, <em>in camera </em>examination has been criticized because it is conducted <em>ex parte, </em>without the benefit of an adversarial proceeding. The Senate Report recognized this deficiency and encouraged such procedures as requiring <em>Vaughn </em>indices and affidavits <em>in addition to in camera </em>examination and even allowing plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to have access to the contested documents <em>in camera </em>under special agreement \u201cwhenever possible.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Notably, the party usually opposing <em>in camera </em>inspection is not the plaintiff seeking disclosure, but, as in this case, the agency seeking suppression- \u2014 even from the court. Since the purpose of <em>in camera </em>inspection is to allow the court to determine the facts <em>de novo </em>without revealing the requested documents to the plaintiff, as a true adversary proceeding would require, it is difficult to imagine a legitimate reason for the agencies\u2019 resistance to this technique that is essentially designed for their benefit. It goes without saying that covering up an agency\u2019s \u201cmistakes\u201d is not an acceptable reason for denying disclosure under the FOIA. In any event, where the affidavits and index are available and there is still a dispute of fact concerning the nature or contents of the documents sought to be produced under the FOIA, an <em>in camera </em>inspection <em>increases </em>the \u201cadversariness\u201d of the proceeding \u2014 or at least provides a minimal substitute for true \u201cadversariness\u201d \u2014by allowing the court to test the accuracy of the agency\u2019s representations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-10\">Congress\u2019 resistance to these objections and its encouragement of flexible responses to overcome them reflect its recognition that the possibility of an <em>in camera </em>inspection is \u201cin many situations\u201d essential to <em>de novo </em>review and is an indispensable incentive to assure the accuracy of agency affidavits and testimony.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number>b. <em>According \u201cSubstantial Weight to an Agency\u2019s Affidavit Concerning the Details of the Classified Status of the Disputed Report.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1275-5\">Although Congress refused to alter the statutory provisions calling for <em>de novo </em>review with the burden on the government and permissive <em>in camera </em>inspection, the Conference Committee did include language in its report designed to assuage the President\u2019s \u201cunfounded\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> fears without compromising on these fundamental issues. These passages are a legitimate part of the legislative history and should influence the conduct of the courts to the extent that they are compatible with the fundamental directions on the face of the statute itself. One such passage, providing that agencies should be given the chance to prove that requested materials are \u201cclearly exempt\u201d using detailed affidavits or testimony, has already been discussed.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1275-6\">A second passage, located in a portion of the Report referring to Exemption 1, expresses the Committee\u2019s recognition that agencies \u201cresponsible for national defense and foreign policy matters have unique insights into what adverse effects might occur as a result of public disclosure of a particular classified record\u201d and the Committee\u2019s expectation \u201cthat Federal courts, in making de novo determinations in section 552(b)(1) cases under the Freedom of Information law, will accord substantial weight to an agency\u2019s affidavit concerning the details of the classified status of the disputed record.\u201d S.Rep. No. 1200, supra, at 12. These words responded to the image of uninformed judges recklessly exposing sensitive information \u2014 an image cultivated by the opponents of <em>de novo </em>review and <em>in camera </em>examination.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> The Conference Committee countered this image by registering its anticipation that rational judges conducting <em>de novo </em>reviews would naturally be impressed by any special knowledge, experience, and reasoning demonstrated by agencies with expertise and responsibility in matters of defense and foreign policy. As Senator Muskie remarked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1275-10\">As a practical matter, I cannot imagine that any Federal judge would throw open the gates of the Nation\u2019s classified secrets, or that they would substitute their judgment for that of an agency head without carefully weighing all the evidence in the arguments presented by both sides.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1275-11\">Source Book, <em>supra, </em>at 449. This logical interpretation of the Conference Report passage is perfectly consistent with the actual words of the 1974 amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-12\">It is important to recognize the limits, as well as the value, of this language in the Conference Report. Stretching the Conference Committee\u2019s recognition of the \u201csubstantial weight\u201d deserved by demonstrated expertise and knowledge into a broad presumption favoring all agency affidavits in national security cases would contradict the clear provisions of the statute and would render meaningless Congress\u2019 obvious intent in passing these provisions over the President\u2019s specific objections. An affidavit explaining in detail the factors about particular material that have convinced the agency that the material should be classified should and will be quite influential with a reviewing court. On the other hand, an affidavit stating only in general or con-elusory terms why the agency in its wisdom has determined that the criteria for nondisclosure are met should not and cannot be accorded \u201csubstantial weight\u201d in a <em>de novo </em>proceeding. To substitute a presumption favoring conclusory agency affidavits for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>the courts\u2019 responsibility to make a <em>de novo </em>determination <em>with the burden on the government </em>would repeal the very aspects of the 1974 amendments that made it necessary for the Congress to override the President\u2019s veto.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-4\">3. <em>Summary</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1276-5\">Congress has already reversed overly restrictive judicial interpretations of the FOIA twice, <em>see </em>Part I-A <em>supra, </em>and congressional intent is by now sufficiently clear that a third legislative reversal should not be necessary. In FOIA cases involving exemptions based on national security, as in other FOIA cases, the government bears the burden of proving in a <em>de novo </em>proceeding before a court that any material not disclosed comes within one of the statutory exemptions. The government should be given the opportunity to establish by detailed affidavits or testimony that the requested material is clearly exempt from disclosure, and in conducting its <em>de novo </em>review in a national security case the court should give substantial weight to the agency\u2019s affidavits insofar as they reflect the agency\u2019s special knowledge and expertise. However, if the government fails to demonstrate by these means that the material is <em>clearly </em>exempt and that no segregable portions remain, or if the court has any suspicion of bad faith on the part of the agency,<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> some form of <em>in camera </em>examination will be \u201cnecessary and appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-6\">D. <em>Outline of the Review Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"Afph\">My examination of the provisions and purposes of the FOIA and of the relevant judicial precedents suggests that a District Court reviewing an agency\u2019s claim that requested material falls within an exemption should generally proceed as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-11\">1. <em>Requirements of Index and Detailed Affidavits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1276-12\">As outlined in <em>Vaughn, </em>the court should require the agency to support its claim of exemption with (1) an index dividing the material into manageable segments and identifying what parts of it are withheld under which exemptions, and (2) detailed affidavits describing the matters withheld and giving any other evidence relevant to the particular exemptions claimed. To enhance the adversary process, the affidavits should be as detailed as possible without revealing the information claimed to be exempt.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> This requirement may be modified, but only under extreme circumstances.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1276-13\">2. <em>Questions for the Court</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1276-14\">Once the index and affidavits have been submitted, the court must undertake several different types of inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b1276-15\">a. <em>The Legal Issues.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1276-16\">The court must first determine the legal criteria for applying the exemption claimed by the agency. The words of the statute and the relevant precedents establish the kinds of matters that are exempt and any necessary procedural steps that are required for exemption. This aspect of the court\u2019s inquiry is fully open and adversarial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1215\">*1215</page-number>b. <em>The Factual Issues.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1277-5\">The court must then determine the facts of the particular case: the nature of the matters withheld and other relevant issues, such as the purposes for which the information was created,<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> whether requisite procedures were followed,<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> and the possible effects of disclosure.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Deciding these issues may be difficult because of the absence of normal adversary procedures. The court may rely on affidavits and testimony, whose usefulness is directly related to their detail; discovery, which may be particularly useful in determining whether requisite procedures have been followed; and <em>in camera </em>inspection. The court\u2019s task will be easiest where the parties stipulate to the relevant facts.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Adequately detailed affidavits and opportunities for discovery may encourage such stipulations. When factual issues are disputed, the burden of proof is on the government. If the burden cannot be <em>clearly </em>met by detailed affidavits and testimony, or when there is any indication of bad faith on the part of the agency, the court may not, in my view, sustain the agency\u2019s action without conducting an <em>in camera </em>inspection of the matters withheld. A court may appoint a special master or inspect portions of the record at random when the burden of inspection is significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-6\">c. <em>Application of Law to Facts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AoSC\">Finally, the court must decide whether the claimed exemption applies on the facts of the particular case. The statutory language and relevant precedents will often provide a clear answer, but, inevitably, some cases will present ambiguities that must be resolved. When such ambiguity is present courts should be guided by FOIA\u2019s emphasis on increasing disclosure and Congress\u2019 decision to place the burden on the party withholding information. If the government is unable to establish that the material withheld meets all the legal requirements necessary to qualify for one of the nine statutory exemptions, the material must be released.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> If the court sustains the agency\u2019s refusal to disclose the requested information, it must provide a statement of its conclusions as to the relevant law and facts to assist the plaintiff in deciding whether and on what grounds to appeal the decision and to assist the Court of Appeals if the plaintiff appeals.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1277-13\">With this framework in mind, I now turn to the particular circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-14\">II. REVIEW IN THIS CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b1277-15\">A. <em>Adequacy of Index and Affidavits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1277-16\">An examination of the record in this case immediately reveals a problem: the CIA\u2019s affidavits are ambiguous about what exemptions apply to what portions of the withheld information. The affidavits specify that ten documents are involved, give a brief description of each document, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>enumerate the exemptions pursuant to which each document has been withheld.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> One affidavit also explains the rationales of the exemptions relied on and describes the general types of materials for which each exemption is claimed.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> The affidavits do not, however, indicate what portions of each document are allegedly covered by each of the multiple exemptions listed as grounds for nondisclosure. For example, the affidavits assert that Document 2 has been withheld pursuant to Exemptions 1, 3, and 6; but the affidavits fail to specify whether any one of these three exemptions covers the whole document or whether, on the contrary, each exemption covers different parts and all three exemptions are thus necessary to justify withholding the entire document.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> The Agency\u2019s description of the document and its reliance on multiple exemptions based on quite different criteria suggest that the latter situation is more likely.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> The same problem infects the Agency\u2019s affidavits with respect to at least nine of the ten documents in this case.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1278-12\">This ambiguity as to which exemptions are claimed for which material is one of the very problems that led this court in <em>Vaughn </em>to require adequate indexing and detailed affidavits. The value of the <em>Vaughn </em>procedures is evident in this case. The ambiguity caused by the CIA\u2019s failure adequately to follow <em>Vaughn </em>caused the District Court to make an error that requires this court to reverse it. Apparently interpreting the ambiguous affidavit to assert that all the non-disclosed material could be withheld under Exemption 1 alone or under Exemption 3 alone, the District Court upheld the Agency\u2019s action on the alternative grounds of \u201cexemption 1 alone, on the basis of exemption 3 alone, or on the basis of the two exemptions coupled together,\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1217\">*1217</page-number>even reaching Exemptions 6 or 7. The government itself now admits that its own description of Document 10 indicates that it is withholding material to which Exemptions 1 and 3 do not apply.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> An examination of the affidavits indicates that this same defect is probably also present with respect to Documents 2-9.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1279-5\">B. <em>Exemption 1</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1279-6\">As the court\u2019s <em>per curiam </em>opinion briefly recognizes,<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> the District Court\u2019s opinion does not reflect an adequate examination of either the law or the facts relevant to the CIA\u2019s claim based on Exemption 1. As a result of congressional amendments designed to override the restrictive holding of the <em>Mink </em>case, Exemption 1 now applies only if the District Court determines that (1) the material withheld is properly classifiable under the substantive criteria set forth in the relevant Executive order, and (2) the material has in fact been properly classified according to procedures outlined in the Executive order.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> The substantive and procedural criteria relevant to this case are established by Executive Order 11652 and a National Security Council directive of May 17, 1972.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> The threshold substantive test for determining whether material may be classified under Executive Order 11652 is \u201cwhether its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause * * * damage to the national security.\u201d Procedural requirements cover such matters as the authority and identification of the original classifier, the proper time for classification, the conspicuous marking of classified material, the identification and segregation of nonclassifiable segments of classified material, and mandatory review and declassification at set time intervals<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> Failure to comply with proper procedures, just like failure to employ the proper substantive standard, can make Exemption 1 inapplicable. <em>See Halperin v. Department of State, </em>184 U.S.App.D.C. 124, 565 F.2d 699 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-16\">In this case the government submitted affidavits of Eloise Page, Chief of the Operations Staff of the Directorate of Operations of the CIA, who swore that she had \u201cdetermined that some of these documents, or portions thereof, may not be released because * * * [t]hey are currently properly classified pursuant to the criteria and procedures set forth in Executive Order 11652 * * Affidavit of Eloise Page, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1218\">*1218</page-number>August 13,1976, JA 31. After describing in general terms some of the major substantive and procedural requirements for application of Exemption 1, Ms. Page asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AHE3\">5. The determination was made by me that, in the case of each document, or portion thereof, which is withheld because it is currently and properly classified, release of that document, or portion thereof, at a minimum, could reasonably be expected to cause damage to the national security. In each case a document determined to contain classified information bears the appropriate markings on its face to evidence its classified status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Am6V\"><em>Id. </em>at 33. On the basis of this statement and some general description of the types of information contained in the documents,<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> the District Court concluded that \u201c[t]he affidavits on file herein clearly show that the documents in question were properly classified under Executive Order 11,652,\u201d and sustained the Agency\u2019s withholding of all the information on the basis of Exemption 1 alone.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1280-4\">Appellants and <em>amicus curiae </em>raise several convincing objections to the District Court\u2019s conclusion. First, appellants point out that the affidavits do not indicate that all the material being withheld is exempt under Exemption 1. Ms. Page\u2019s affidavit is deliberately ambiguous, stating that the material is being withheld under Exemptions 1 \u201cand or\u201d 3 \u201cand/or\u201d 6 <footnotemark>78</footnotemark> ; and the CIA has admitted on appeal that it cannot rely solely on Exemption l.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> The District Court\u2019s failure to recognize this problem with the affidavit raises serious doubts about the adequacy of its <em>de novo </em>review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-11\">Second, appellants emphasize that summary judgment was granted before any discovery took place. Interrogatories and depositions are especially important in a case where one party has an effective monopoly on the relevant information. Discovery may be particularly useful to appellants in testing whether the procedural requirements of Exemption 1 have been met in this case.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1280-12\">Finally, <em>amicus </em>draws attention to the conclusory nature of the affidavit, which often merely parrots the language of the statute or Executive order. According to <em>amicus, </em>the CIA has developed \u201cstandard form\u201d affidavits to handle cases such as this one. The CIA replies that its standard language reflects the typical nature of FOIA cases, and claims that any more particular descriptions might reveal the very information the Agency seeks to protect. While this concern may explain an agency\u2019s failure to produce sufficiently detailed affidavits in a particular case, it does not relieve either the agency or the court of its statutory responsibilities. When an agency cannot get beyond generalities in its affidavits for fear of revealing too much, <em>de novo </em>review requires the court to employ additional techniques, such as <em>in camera </em>inspection and more detailed <em>in camera </em>affidavits.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1280-13\">Faced with the conclusory affidavits produced in this case, appellants requested <em>in camera </em>examination, but the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number>denied appellants\u2019 motion, citing this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Weissman v. CIA, </em>184 U.S.App.D.C. 117, 565 F.2d 692 (1977). The version of the Weissman opinion relied on by the District Court was later amended after a motion for rehearing. Order, D.C.Cir. No. 76-1566, April 4, 1977. Passages in the original version that suffered from an excessive deference to agency \u201cexpertise\u201d may explain the District Court\u2019s unacceptably deferential approach to this case.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> Today\u2019s <em>per curiam </em>opinion reaffirms Congress\u2019 intent to require independent <em>de novo </em>review, <em>per curiam, </em>190 U.S.App.D.C. at ---, 587 F.2d at 1193-1194, and clearly holds that there is no presumption against <em>in camera </em>examination in national security cases, <em>id., </em>190 U.S.App.D.C., at ----, 587 F.2d at 1194-1195, thus reducing the likelihood of excessive deference in this case on remand and in future eases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-8\">C. <em>Exemption 3</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1281-9\">The <em>per curiam </em>also finds the District Court\u2019s approach to Exemption 3 unsatisfactory. <em>Per curiam, </em>190 U.S.App.D.C. at -, 587 F.2d at 1196. Following its amendment in 1976 to overrule the result in <em>Robertson, </em>Exemption 3 applies to matters that are \u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute,\u201d but only if the exempting statute either leaves no room for agency discretion to determine whether the information is to be disclosed or establishes effective guidelines for agency discretion by specifying \u201cparticular criteria for withholding\u201d or \u201cparticular types of matters to be withheld.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3) (1976). The 1976 amendment thus removed the <em>Robertson </em>loophole by insuring that no agency could rely on an \u201cexempting\u201d statute unless the statute contained clear guidelines upon which a court could rely in reviewing the agency\u2019s refusal to disclose requested information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-14\">Proper judicial review of an Exemption 3 claim involves several steps: (1) determining whether the alleged exempting statute qualifies under Exemption 3 as amended, <em>see American Jewish Congress v. Kreps, </em>187 U.S.App.D.C. 413, 574 F.2d 624 (1978), (2) determining what matters the exempting statute covers \u2014 what substantive and procedural requirements must be met before it permits nondisclosure, and (3) determining the facts of the particular case and whether the specific information withheld qualifies for nondisclosure under the alleged exempting statute. As with review of other claimed exemptions, the courts must consider each of these questions <em>de novo. See Brandon v. Eckard, </em>187 U.S.App.D.C. 28, 32-35, 569 F.2d 683, 687-690 (1977); S.Rep. No. 1200, <em>supra, </em>at 8-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-15\">The CIA\u2019s Exemption 3 claim in this case is based on the applicability of 50 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7. 403(d)(3) (directing the Director of the CIA to protect \u201cintelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure\u201d) &amp; 403g (exempting the CIA from any law requiring \u201cdisclosure of the organization, functions, names, official titles, salaries, or numbers of personnel employed by the Agency\u201d) (1970). The District Court, following unanimous pre-1976 precedents from this circuit,<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> found that these statutes qualified under the pre-amendment version of Exemption 3, but did not address the effect of the 1976 changes in the FOIA. This court has recently held that these statutes still qualify under the new language because they \u201c \u2018refer[ ] to particular types of matters to be withheld\u2019 \u2014 namely, information respecting intelligence sources and methods.\u201d <em>Goiand </em>v. <em>CIA, </em>(D.C.Cir. No. 76-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>1800, decided May 23, 1978) (slip op. at 18). Nevertheless, while the \u201cparticular types of matters\u201d listed in Section 403g (e. <em>g., </em>names, official titles, salaries) are fairly specific,<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> Section 403(d)(3)\u2019s language of protecting \u201cintelligence sources and methods\u201d is potentially quite expansive. To fulfill Congress\u2019 intent to close the loophole created in <em>Robertson, </em>courts must be particularly careful when scrutinizing claims of exemptions based on such expansive terms. A court\u2019s <em>de novo </em>determination that releasing contested material could in fact reasonably be expected to expose intelligence sources or methods is thus essential when an agency seeks to rely on Section 403(d)(3).<footnotemark>85</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1282-4\">Since the District Court\u2019s review of the CIA\u2019s affidavits in this case was based on the pre-amendment language of Exemption 3, it understandably does not demonstrate the kind of \u201chard look\u201d necessary to assure adherence to congressional purpose. The District Court\u2019s extreme deference to the Agency\u2019s interpretation of what constitutes an \u201cintelligence source or method\u201d is evident in such passages as the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1282-5\">Affidavits on file herein state that documents 2 through 9 contain information regarding intelligence sources and methods. There has been no credible challenge to the veracity of these statements and nothing appears to raise the issue of bad faith. The Court therefore concludes that release of this information can reasonably be expected to lead to unauthorized disclosure of intelligence sources and methods, and that the Agency may rely on exemption 3 and 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 403(d)(3) to withhold this information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1282-9\"><em>Ray v. Bush, </em>Civil Action No. 76-0903 (D.D.C. Jan. 25, 1977), at JA 66-67. This is hardly the <em>de novo </em>review mandated by Congress, with the <em>government </em>having the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1282-10\">The District Court denied appellants\u2019 motion for <em>in camera </em>inspection with the comment that \u201c[wjith respect to documents withheld under exemption 3, in camera inspection is seldom, if ever, necessary or appropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at JA 68. The court apparently based this conclusion on language in cases under the pre-amendment version of Exemption 3 to the effect that in review of an Exemption 3 claim \u201cthe only question \u2018to be determined in a district court\u2019s <em>de novo </em>inquiry is the factual existence of [a specific statute of the kind described in Exemption 3], regardless of how unwise, self-protective, or inadvertent the enactment might be.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>86</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1282-11\">This court today definitively rejects this position as inconsistent with the language and legislative history of the FOIA.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> The 1976 amendments to the language of Exemption 3 provide conclusive support for the court\u2019s position. To be sure, a court must abide by <em>Congress </em>\u2019 statutory decision that certain criteria should govern disclosure and that particular types of information should be exempt. But when courts review an agency\u2019s claim of Exemption 3 based on the <em>agency\u2019s </em>interpretation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>what Congress has done in a particular statute, they must not only decide whether the statute qualifies under Exemption 3, but also determine the facts of the particular case and decide whether the statute applies to the contested materials under the circumstances. Without <em>de novo </em>review of all these issues by the courts, Congress\u2019 effort to check agency discretion in the 1976 amendment would be reduced to an impotent formality.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> The propriety and necessity of <em>in camera </em>examination as part of the court\u2019s <em>de novo </em>review of the relevant factual issues in Exemption 3 cases is therefore essentially the same as in <em>de novo </em>review of Exemption 1 cases. <em>See </em>Part I-C-2 <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1283-5\">An effective <em>de novo </em>review \u2014 using <em>in camera </em>inspection of material claimed to reveal \u201cintelligence sources and methods\u201d when appropriate \u2014 will achieve the goal Congress intended in amending Exemption 3. Courts will be able to insure that agencies do not impermissibly expand by unre-viewed interpretations the \u201cparticular types of matters\u201d Congress has exempted from disclosure. Although precedents detailing what <em>may </em>be withheld to protect intelligence sources or methods may not be possible, courts will be able to declare in published opinions what is <em>not </em>an acceptable interpretation of \u201cprotecting intelligence sources and methods.\u201d<footnotemark>89</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1283-6\">D. <em>Exemptions 6 and 7(F)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1283-7\">The CIA\u2019s affidavit also relied on Exemptions 6 and 7(F) to withhold certain parts of the documents sought by appellants.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> The Agency relied on Exemption 6, which exempts from disclosure \u201cpersonnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, to withhold the names of private individuals other than appellants and information relating to such other individuals. Exemption 7(F), which exempts \u201cinvestigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes * * * to the extent that the production of such records would * * * endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel,\u201d was used to withhold the name of a United States Customs officer who was the source of one of the ten documents sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-11\">As mentioned above, the District Court failed to reach these claims because it misinterpreted the Agency\u2019s ambiguous affidavit. The court\u2019s <em>per curiam </em>opinion remands for a more specific affidavit and recognizes that once the Agency has specified which material is allegedly exempt under which exemptions the District Court may well have to consider Exemptions 6 and 7. <em>Per curiam, </em>190 U.S.App.D.C. at -, 587 F.2d at 1197.</p>\n<p id=\"b1283-12\">In ruling on an Exemption 6 claim, a court must determine <em>de novo </em>(1) whether the material requested falls within the type of matter covered by the exemption, <em>i. e., </em>\u201cpersonnel and medical files and similar files,\u201d <em>and </em>(2) whether disclosure would constitute a \u201cclearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d Unless the documents in question are indeed \u201cpersonnel and medical files and similar files,\u201d the latter inquiry becomes unnecessary. \u201cPersonnel\u201d files, as the Supreme Court wrote in <em>Department of the Air Force v. Rose, supra, </em>ordinarily contain information such as \u201cwhere [an individual] was born, the names of his parents, where he has lived from time to time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1222\">*1222</page-number>his high school or other school records, results of examinations, evaluations of his work performance.\u201d 425 U.S. at 377, 96 S.Ct. at 1606. In that case the Court also provided an indication of what is intended by \u201csimilar\u201d files, as it held Air Force Academy case summaries \u201crelatpng] to the discipline of cadet personnel\u201d to be similar to personnel files in the sense intended by Congress in Exemption 6. <em>Id. </em>at 376-377, 96 S.Ct. at 1606. Moreover, the Court has stated, also in <em>Rose, </em>that it is \u201c \u2018only the identifying connection to the individual that casts the personnel, medical, and similar files within the protection of [the] sixth exemption.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 371, 96 S.Ct. at 1604 <em>(quoting </em>the District Court in <em>Rose). </em>If material is found to fall within the language \u201cpersonnel and medical files and similar files,\u201d the second inquiry required by Exemption 6 \u2014 whether disclosure would constitute a \u201cclearly unwarranted invasions of personal privacy\u201d \u2014 should be undertaken. This inquiry proceeds on a case-by-case basis, balancing the privacy interests of the individual against the public\u2019s right to governmental information. <em>Id. </em>at 370\u2014 382, 96 S.Ct. 1592; <em>Getman v. NLRB, </em>146 U.S.App.D.C. 209, 212-216, 450 F.2d 670, 673-677 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-4\">Consideration of an Exemption 7(F) claim likewise requires a court to determine <em>de novo </em>(1) whether the material involved consists of \u201cinvestigatory records compiled for <em>law enforcement purposes </em>\u201d<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> (emphasis added) <em>and </em>(2) whether its production would \u201cendanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel.\u201d The District Court, of course, has not yet addressed any of these issues. If on remand it finds that both conditions for Exemption 6 or 7(F) are met with regard to any of the material for which these exemptions have been claimed, the District Court must also, as the <em>per curiam </em>indicates, <em>per curiam, </em>190 U.S.App. D.C. at---, 587 F.2d at 1197, assure itself that any segregable material is released.</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1284-10\">Effective <em>de novo </em>review by the courts is essential to assure that government agencies comply with Congress\u2019 commitment to compel disclosure of information that is being \u201cwithheld only to cover up embarrassing mistakes or irregularities * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> My opinion in this case is an effort to consolidate some of the wisdom of prior cases and the legislative history regarding what courts must do to make <em>de novo </em>review a reality. The evolution of the review process must continue; additional creative innovations by counsel, the courts, and Congress are necessary to solve the problems that persist. For the time being, however, the courts can at least see to it that the progress that has already been made is not lost.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1261-20\">. I concur in the court\u2019s conclusions (1) that the CIA\u2019s affidavits in support of its claims of exemption are ambiguous and unsatisfactory; (2) that the District Court erred in recognizing presumptions against <em>in camera </em>examination (a) in national security cases and (b) in cases involving claims of Exemption 3; and (3) that the case must therefore be remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with the mandate of Congress and the precedents of this court. The per <em>curiam\u2019s </em>changes, in the light of experience, in the advice given the District Courts in earlier cases, such as <em>Weissman v. CIA, </em>184 U.S.App.D.C. 117, 565 F.2d 692 (1977), are obvious and significant. Nevertheless, I am disturbed by the terse and at times conclusory fashion in which these important conclusions are rendered. The per <em>curiam </em>opinion fails, in my view, to address adequately the arguments that agencies have used and will no doubt continue to use in their attempts to undermine the positions the court now embraces. Furthermore, the court\u2019s discussion of the legislative history leaves out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>much of the information that District Courts should have before them when they structure their <em>de novo </em>reviews of FOIA claims. For these reasons, and because of the importance of the issues involved, I have decided to set forth in full my views on them and on their application to the facts of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1262-6\">.

The First Circuit relied heavily on a portion of Senate Report No. 93-854, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 16 (1974), that describes a provision in the Senate bill as reported from committee that was later deleted on the floor of the Senate because it was considered too deferential to the agencies. <em>See </em>563 F.2d at 487; text and notes at notes 31-33 <em>infra. </em>The result in <em>Bell </em>may be justified by the particular circumstances of that case (a suit to release over 500,000 documents gathered by the Allied Intelligence Service in World War II under the ULTRA program which the Secretary of Defense had exempted from the automatic declassification schedule pending completion of a specific program designed to review individually the classifications of all the documents by 1980). To the extent that any language in <em>Beil </em>is inconsistent with the approach outlined in this opinion, I must respectfully decline to depart from my understanding of the unambiguous mandate of Congress.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b1268-11\">.

In order to supply the court with the information necessary for de <em>novo </em>review when it fears that public affidavits containing such information would reveal too much, an agency may also provide more detailed affidavits to the court <em>in camera.

The lack of adversariness in this procedure presents special dangers, however, especially if it is not accompanied by at least some form of <em>in camera </em>inspection.

It is therefore not surprising that the authorities suggesting use of <em>in camera </em>affidavits have always cautioned that the procedure must be reserved for unusual and especially sensitive circumstances. As a check against agency abuse of the <em>in camera </em>affidavit procedure, a court should require the agency to explain why the information in its <em>in camera </em>submission should not have been included in a public affidavit, and should make available to all parties any portions of the <em>in camera </em>affidavits that it determines, after full consideration of the agency\u2019s arguments, do not warrant a protective order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"44\">\n<p id=\"b1273-12\">.

In this case, for instance, it was only after this suit was brought with the attendant threat of <em>in camera </em>inspection that the CIA, which had <em>twice </em>before found no segregable portions among the requested materials (JA 17-18, 21-22) \u2014 once even flatly stating that no such portions existed (JA 21-22) \u2014 eventually discovered that there were indeed segregable portions (see JA 27-30, 42-52; see <em>also </em>text at notes 7-9 and note 7 <em>supra). </em>Furthermore, it was only under the additional specific threat of plaintiff\u2019s motion for <em>in camera </em>inspection that the Agency submitted the \u201csupplemental affidavit\u201d of Eloise Page, giving more detailed, but still inadequate, descriptions of the items withheld (JA 62-64).</p>\n<p id=\"b1274-8\">Another recent case also underscores the vital role that the threat of <em>in camera </em>inspection can play, perhaps especially with respect to the CIA. In that case, <em>Goland v. CIA </em>(D.C.Cir. No. 76-1800, decided May 23, 1978), plaintiffs \u201crequested documents from the [CIA] relating to the legislative history of the Agency\u2019s organic statutes, slip op. at 2.\u201d Not convinced of the thoroughness with which the Agency had searched for responsive documents, and questioning the Agency\u2019s refusal to make available concededly responsive materials, plaintiffs brought suit under the FOIA. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the CIA; the opinion of this court affirming the District Court issued on May 23, 1978. One week later, on May 30, 1978, the CIA for the first time disclosed to plaintiffs\u2019 counsel and to this court the existence of various other documents that had been determined by the Agency six months earlier to be potentially relevant to the <em>Goland </em>case. These documents totaled 321, and were supplied to plaintiffs in June 1978. The CIA thus withheld from the plaintiffs and from the judicial process until after the opinion of the appellate court had issued the existence of over 300 documents of at least potential relevance to the <em>Goland </em>case. By so doing the CIA has again amply demonstrated the need for incentives such as <em>in camera </em>inspection to ensure compliance with the requirements of the FOIA. Similarly, in <em>Marks </em>v, <em>CIA </em>(D.C.Cir. No. 77-1225, decided this day), (slip op. at 1 n.4). (Wright, C. J., concurring and dissenting), the Agency, subsequent to the District Court\u2019s opinion and to that court\u2019s refusal to conduct an <em>in camera </em>inspection of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number>disputed materials, although prior to this court\u2019s judgment, released information that previously had been withheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b1275-8\">Even in a case in which a specific finding of the Agency\u2019s good faith had been made, <em>in camera </em>inspection resulted in disclosure of additional information, thus emphasizing the difficulties that inhere in permitting an agency to be the final judge of its own cause. <em>See Halpe-rin v. CIA, </em>446 F.Supp. 661, 666-667 (D.D.C.1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"52\">\n<p id=\"b1275-14\">. <em>See </em>text and note at note 46 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"53\">\n<p id=\"b1275-15\">. <em>See </em>text and notes at notes 41-43 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"54\">\n<p id=\"b1275-16\">. <em>See, </em>e. <em>g., </em>Source Book, <em>supra </em>note 28, at 316-317, 322-323 (remarks of Sen.

A court might suspect bad faith if an agency failed to correct deficiencies in its affidavits when given a second chance to be more specific, or if an agency submitted affidavits in the first instance that suffered from defects pointed out in previous court decisions. The District Court, of course, has discretion to employ <em>in camera </em>examination whenever it feels a need to check the accuracy of the agency\u2019s representations to meet its responsibility in conducting a de <em>novo </em>review. <em>See per curiam, </em>190 U.S.App.D.C. at-, 587 F.2d at 1195.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"56\">\n<p id=\"b1276-9\">.

This list was secured by the United States Customs Service from an individual at a border checkpoint in a search incident to his arrest for importation of narcotics into the United States. The memorandum was provided to the Plaintiff Schaap with only minor deletions (names of CIA employees, organizational data concerning the CIA, name of a United States Customs Agent). Only that portion of the list containing plaintiff\u2019s name was provided. Thus exemptions (b)(1), (b)(3), (b)(6) and (b)(7)(F) apply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1279-12\">Supplemental Affidavit of Eloise Page, <em>supra </em>note 8, at JA 63-64.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"71\">\n<p id=\"b1279-13\">. The Agency now claims that it did not rely on Exemptions 1 and 3 to withhold the name of the Customs agent and the names of other individuals in Document 10, brief for appellee at 19, yet it continues to rely on Exemptions 1 and 3 to withhold the names of other individuals and information relating to them contained in other documents, <em>id. </em>at 10-19. This distinction, which the government makes in its brief on appeal, is certainly not so clear on the face of the affidavit. <em>Compare the </em>statement concerning Document 10, <em>supra </em>note 70, <em>with </em>the statement concerning Documents 3, 4, and 5, <em>supra </em>note 68.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"72\">\n<p id=\"b1279-19\">. <em>Per curiam, </em>190 U.S.App.D.C. at-,--, 587 F.2d at 1196.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"73\">\n<p id=\"b1279-21\">.
