The lawsuit arose out of HEW\u2019s recoupment of reimbursement funds paid to provider hospitals for medical services that Blue Cross, plaintiffs\u2019 fiscal intermediary, unilaterally determined were unnecessary. The plaintiffs contend that they were constitutionally entitled to a hearing at some point during or after the recoupment process. The district court agreed. Jurisdiction to hear the case was based on 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701-706 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331(a). We conclude that the district court acted without subject matter jurisdiction and we vacate its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-14\">There was clearly no jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701-706, better known as \u00a7 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act. <em>Califano v. Sanders, </em>430 U.S. 99, 107, 97 S.Ct. 980, 985, 51 L.Ed.2d 192, 200-01 (1977). Nor under this court\u2019s decisions in <em>Dr. John T. MacDonald Foundation v. Califano, </em>571 F.2d 328 (CA5) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 99 S.Ct. 250, 58 L.Ed.2d 238 (1978), and <em>American Association of Councils of Medical Staffs v. Califano, </em>575 F.2d 1367 (CA5), <em>pet. for cert. filed, </em>47 U.S.L.W. 3267 (U.S. Oct. 3, 1978), was there jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-17\"><em>MacDonald </em>involved a challenge by a provider of Medicare services to HEW\u2019s method of determining reimbursable cost. On the basis of <em>Weinberger v. Salfi, </em>422 U.S. 749, 95 S.Ct. 2457, 45 L.Ed.2d 522 (1975), this court concluded that the incorporation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(h) into the Medicare Act through 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395U, eliminated subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331(a) to review the validity of HEW\u2019s reimbursement procedures. That decision controls this case. The plaintiffs argue that <em>MacDonald </em>can be distinguished because \u00a7 405(h)\u2019s bar to jurisdiction applies only to appeals from findings and decisions of the Secretary, and here the plaintiffs sued because HEW held no hearing. But this court decided in <em>American Association of Councils of Medical Staffs v. Califano, supra </em>at 1372, that the lack of an \u201cadministrative hearing or decision . . . does not serve as a relevant distinction from <em>MacDonald.\u201d Id. </em>at 1372; <em>accord, Trinity Memorial Hospital v. Associated Hospital Services, </em>570 F.2d 660, 667 (CA7, 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-19\">We have held that Medicare plaintiffs whose claims are barred by \u00a7 405(h) may go to the Court of Claims. <em>American Association of Councils of Medical Staffs v. Califano, supra </em>at 1373; <em>Dr. John T. MacDonald Foundation v. Califano, supra </em>at 332.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court of Claims does not have the power to grant the plaintiffs\u2019 request for declaratory and injunctive relief, but it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>can decide the issue raised by the plaintiffs because they have requested damages. <em>See American Association of Councils of Medical Staffs v. Califano, supra </em>at 1373.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(c), the appeal is DISMISSED and the cause is TRANSFERRED to the Court of Claims. <em>See Dr. John T. MacDonald Foundation v. Califano, 571 F.2d </em>328 (CAS) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S.---, 99 S.Ct. 250, 58 L.Ed.2d 238 (1978).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b825-10\">.
