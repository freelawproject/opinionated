Count I charged a conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, the general conspiracy statute, in that from January 1, 1976, to December 9, 1976, defendants agreed to commit four offenses against the United States, namely,</p>\n<p id=\"b940-19\">A. To violate the mail fraud statute (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341) by scheming to obtain money by false pretenses from Central Soya Company through use of the mails;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b940-20\">B. To bribe public officials in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(f) by giving money to two grain inspectors licensed by the United States Department of Agriculture under the United States Warehouse Act in return for their falsely certifying the grain they inspected to be of higher quality than it actually was;</p>\n<p id=\"b940-21\">C. To make false statements in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 by causing false United States Warehouse Act inspection and weight certificates to be issued; and</p>\n<p id=\"b940-22\">D. To cause two licensed grain inspectors to issue false weight and inspection certificates, in violation of 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-23\">Eight overt acts in furtherance of the alleged conspiracy were listed in Count I. Counts II through IV charged defendants with the substantive offense of violating the mail fraud statute (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341), and Counts V through VIII charged them with the substantive offense of making false statements in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Counts IX through XII, which charged the defendants with causing the issuance of false or fraudulent weight and inspection certificates in violation of 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 270, were dismissed by the district court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A jury found defendants guilty under all of the remaining eight counts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>they received concurrent sentences of six months on each count, plus fines aggregating $2500.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">I. <em>Sufficiency of Count I of Indictment</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aqq\">Relying on <em>Hamner v. United States, </em>134 F.2d 592 (5th Cir. 1943), defendants first assert that Count I, the conspiracy count, is fatally defective because it \u201cproceeded to allege substantive crimes which had been committed\u201d (Br. 8). However, in <em>Reno v. United States, </em>317 F.2d 499, 504 (5th Cir. 1963), certiorari denied, 375 U.S. 828, 84 S.Ct. 72, 11 L.Ed.2d 60, an indictment grammatically worded like the present one was sustained, with the court stating that if the <em>Reno </em>case \u201ccannot be validly distinguished from <em>Hamner, </em>then we think <em>Hamner </em>is no longer good law.\u201d As noted, Count I of the present indictment charges that defendants agreed to violate three provisions of the Criminal Code and a provision of the Warehouse Act and specifies numerous overt acts committed in furtherance of the conspiracy. Although paragraphs A through D of Count I inartfully set forth what the defendants agreed to do in the past tense rather than the future tense, under the <em>Reno </em>rationale this Count I was sufficient. It contained enough to apprise the defendants with certainty what allegations they must be prepared to meet and put them in a position to plead double jeopardy to any subsequent charge of the same offense. The use of the past tense in paragraphs A-D of Count I therefore will be deemed harmless error. See Rule 7(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">II. <em>Jurisdiction over Paragraphs B-D of Count I of Indictment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b941-8\">Defendants next contend that apart from the alleged mail fraud violation (under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341) described in paragraph A of Count I, the other objects of the conspiracy, <em>viz., </em>the alleged violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(f), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, and 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 270, do not constitute offenses against the United States over which the district court had jurisdiction under the facts shown in the rest of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-11\">(a) <em>Bribery Charge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b941-12\">Paragraph B of Count I describing bribery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(f) as one of the objects of the conspiracy is based on defendants\u2019 promising money to Kinley E. Gunder and Gary L. Byrd, both grain inspectors licensed by the United States Department of Agriculture under 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 252 and regulations thereunder (7 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.61 <em>et seq.). </em>Defendants contend that those grain inspectors were not \u201cpublic officials\u201d within the purview of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(f) which proscribes bribing \u201cany public official\u201d for past or future official acts. It is true that the inspectors were employed by Central Soya rather than by the Government. However, Congress provided for such grain inspectors to act on behalf of the Department of Agriculture in an official capacity. See 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 252,256. That is sufficient to make them \u201cpublic officials\u201d because the bribery statute defines a \u201cpublic official\u201d as a \u201cperson acting for or on behalf of * * * any department [of the United States] * * * in any official function, under or by authority of any such department * * *\u201d (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(a)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b941-13\">Privately employed licensed grain inspectors under the United States Grain Standards Act<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 71, 74, 79, 84-87h) and regulations thereunder have been con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>sidered public officials under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(g). <em>United States v. Fleetwood, </em>528 F.2d 528, 529 (5th Cir. 1976).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Similarly, Gunder and Byrd, licensed under the United States Warehouse Act, meet the definition of public official in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(a) since they were acting \u201con behalf of\u201d the Department of Agriculture by issuing the certificates required by the Warehouse Act and its implementing regulations. Therefore bribing them constitutes an offense against the United States under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(f). In reaching this conclusion, we reject the defendants\u2019 principal contention, which in different guises underlies each of their objections to the jurisdiction of the district court under this indictment. The defendants insist that the Warehouse Act confers jurisdiction on the Department of Agriculture only over bailments of grain and not, as is the case here, over purchases of grain which is then stored by the purchaser in its own licensed warehouse. The argument turns on whether the term \u201cstored\u201d as used in the Act is the equivalent of \u201cbailed\u201d or is to be understood more colloquially as \u201cheld for future use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">The Warehouse Act empowers the Secretary of Agriculture to provide for the licensing of inspectors of \u201cany agricultural product or products, stored or to be stored\u201d in a licensed warehouse (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 252). These provisions of the statute are implemented by 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.19, which requires all storage and non-storage grain received into a licensed warehouse to be inspected, graded and weighed by a licensed inspector. Non-storage grain is defined in 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.2(k) as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b942-5\">\u201cGrain received temporarily into a warehouse for conditioning, transferring, assembling for shipment, or lots of grain moving through a warehouse for current merchandising or milling use, against which no receipts are issued and no storage charges assessed * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b942-10\">The regulations thus explicitly adopt a broad, nontechnical interpretation of \u201cstored\u201d grain to include all grain kept in a licensed warehouse, not merely grain which is held as a bailment and for which warehouse receipts have been issued. Although the defendants correctly note that \u201cnon-storage grain\u201d is not defined in the statute, they do not directly attack the regulations. Judge Steckler expressly adopted a broad interpretation of \u201cstored\u201d which is consistent with the regulations (Tr. 383-384, 472\u2014 474). We think this is the correct reading of the statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-11\">Defendants insist that the purpose of the Act was to foster confidence in warehouse receipts for grain stored as a bailment in order to facilitate financing. While this clearly was an important purpose of the Act, the legislative history suggests that broader goals of protecting the agricultural commodities themselves and establishing consistent standards also motivated the Act\u2019s passage. See <em>Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., </em>331 U.S. 218, 235 n. 13, 67 S.Ct. 1146, 91 L.Ed. 1447. In any event, the statutory language does not support the narrow reading advocated by defendants.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-12\">We conclude that it is immaterial that the grain delivered by defendants to Central Soya Company was sold to it rather than merely stored with it, since Central Soya\u2019s storage of the purchased grain in its own warehouse brings the Act into play. The term \u201cwarehouse\u201d as used in the Warehouse Act includes \u201cevery building * * * in which any agricultural product is or may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>be stored\u201d (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 242). Since the Act provides for the licensing of inspectors of \u201cany agricultural product or products, stored or to be stored\u201d in a licensed warehouse (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 252), such inspectors, including the defendants here, are \u201cpublic officials\u201d for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-4\">(b) <em>False Statements Charge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">Paragraph C of Count I describing false statements in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 as another object of the conspiracy charges that defendants caused false and incorrect United States Warehouse Act inspection and weight certificates to be executed and issued under the Warehouse Act (7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 241 <em>et seq.). </em>Counsel for defendants again argues that paragraph C does not allege an offense against the United States because the false statements were made to Central Soya, a private purchaser of grain. However, as explained above, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 252 places the regulation of the storage of agricultural products in all licensed warehouses within the jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture. Because this object of the conspiracy was to have Gunder and Byrd \u201cin any matter within the jurisdiction of any department * * * of the United States\u201d make any knowingly \u201cfalse, fictitious or fraudulent statements\u201d (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001), the false statement statute has been satisfied. <em>Ebeling v. United States, </em>248 F.2d 429, 434 (8th Cir. 1957), certiorari denied, 355 U.S. 907, 78 S.Ct. 334, 2 L.Ed.2d 261; see also <em>Bryson v. United States, </em>396 U.S. 64, 70-71, 90 S.Ct. 355, 24 L.Ed.2d 264; <em>United States v. Lambert, </em>501 F.2d 943, 946 (5th Cir. 1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">(c) <em>Issuance of False Weight and Inspection Certificates</em></p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">Paragraph D of Count I, describing the issuance of false and fraudulent weight certificates in violation of 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 270<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as the fourth object of the conspiracy, is based on defendants\u2019 causing Gunder and Byrd to issue such documents. Defendants again reiterate their view that paragraph D does not charge an offense against the United States because it covers the purchase and sale of grain rather than storage. However, as already pointed out, the United States Warehouse Act does cover the Central Soya warehouse and the certification of grain stored in it. The Secretary of Agriculture is empowered to prescribe rules and regulations with respect to such certification (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 252) and defendants admit that these inspection and weight certificates were approved by the Department of Agriculture (Br. 13). The regulations provide that after the weighing and inspection of the grain, the inspector is to issue an inspection and weight certificate (7 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 102.65, 102.67, 102.68). Copies of such certificates must be kept by the inspector for one year, with another copy being filed with the warehouse (7 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.69). The regulations require the inspection of all grain coming into a licensed warehouse (7 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 102.19,102.44). Since these regulations are authorized by the Warehouse Act (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 268), defendants\u2019 argument that paragraph D does not charge facts constituting an offense against the United States must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the district court correctly refused to dismiss Count I of the indictment and to deny the motions for acquittal insofar as they related to this subject matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-13\">III. <em>Multiplicious Counts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b943-14\">In their brief, defendants have submitted without amplification that Counts I, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>II-IV of the indictment are multiplicious (Br. 6). However, Count I was a conspiracy count covering a period from January 1, 1976, to December 9, 1976, and would require different proof than the substantive mail fraud charges in Counts II \u2014 IV. The mere facts that Count I charges, <em>inter alia, </em>conspiracy to commit mail frauds and that two of the overt acts alleged in Count I involve fraudulent mailings do not make Count I multiplicious as to the mail fraud counts. Similarly, the three mail fraud counts involved mailings on November 4, 1976, November 10,1976, and November 11, 1976. Because they involve different mailings, they stated separate offenses and were also not multiplicious with each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Defendants contended below that Counts IX-XII under 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 270 are multiplicious \u201cin that they charge the same offenses\u201d (Br. 5). On the other hand, each of those counts involved separate weight and inspection certificate numbers, thus also requiring different evidence, so that again there was no fatal multiplicity.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">Although defendants\u2019 brief does not argue that false and fraudulent weight and inspection certificate Counts IX-XII are multiplicious as to false statement Counts V-VIII, the Government\u2019s brief candidly concedes that the false statement counts (V-VIII) under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 are comparable to the false and fraudulent certificate counts (IX-XII) under 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 270. In order to avoid multiplicity, the Government submits that Counts V-VIII require proof that the false statements were made \u201cas to material facts in a matter within the jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, while no such proof is required under 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 270 (Br. 25). We need not decide whether each of the foregoing two pairs of counts respectively states only a single offense because the district court dismissed Counts IX-XII (Tr. 466), so that the question has become moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">IV. <em>Sufficiency of Counts V-VIII</em></p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">Defendants claim that Counts V-VIII under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 do not charge facts constituting an offense against the United States because they do not allege \u201cin what way the alleged false statements were material, in what way were they false, or in what way they were made in a matter within the jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture\u201d (Br. 12). However, an indictment need state only \u201cthe essential facts constituting the offense charged\u201d (Rule 7(c)(1) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure). These counts each alleged that defendants caused the issuance of false and incorrect inspection and weight certificates which under 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 244 and 252 was a matter within the jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture. The materiality of the false statements was adequately shown because the grand jury charged that the certificates purported to show \u201cthe true and accurate inspection and grade of the grain represented thereby\u201d while defendants knew the inspection and grade were false. What could be more material and substantial (cf. defendants\u2019 Br. 18) than to cause inspector Gunder to falsify both the \u201cinspection and grade\u201d on the certificates as charged in Counts V-VIII? The materiality of the false statements is self-apparent because these sophisticated defendants would know that the falsified grade, percentage of moisture, foreign material, weight and damage stated in these certificates would determine the amount paid for the grain by Central Soya Company, the storage conditions and processing to which it would be subjected and possibly the resale price (see e. <em>g., </em>Tr. 32, 46 \u2014 47). Further particularity in the indictment was unnecessary. <em>United States v. Satterfield, </em>411 F.2d 602 (5th Cir. 1969); <em>United States v. Silver, </em>235 F.2d 375 (2d Cir. 1956), certio-rari denied, 352 U.S. 880, 77 S.Ct. 102, 1 L.Ed.2d 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-9\">V. <em>Defendants\u2019 Proffer of Tests Conducted on Sample Grains of Corn </em>Was <em>Properly Rejected</em></p>\n<p id=\"b944-10\">Defendants\u2019 proffered evidence concerning tests conducted by their witnesses on samples of corn to show that the moisture testing and inspection procedures used by Government witness Gunder were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>inexact. In rejecting the proffer, the district court stated that the defendants\u2019 reason to offer the evidence was to attack the credibility of the Government\u2019s evidence that the grain certificates were materially false. The Government's case was partly based on the testimony of Mr. Gunder, a licensed inspector at Central Soya Company, that he had intentionally falsified the certificates. The theory of the defense was that if the testing procedures were inexact, the Government would not be able to prove that the certificates materially misrepresented the quality of the grain, notwithstanding the fact that the person who issued them intended that they should do so. The court concluded that the proffered evidence \u201cgoes too far beyond the scope of relevant evidence to the issue herein involved\u201d (Tr. 426). Gunder\u2019s testimony had related to certain Motomeo moisture machines that he had used at Central Soya in 1976, whereas the defendants\u2019 proposed evidence involved tests run in 1978 by the Board of Trade and an independent grain elevator. Because of the time gap, the district court could consider that evidence as irrelevant. Even if relevant, the court could properly exclude it on the ground that its probative value might confuse the issues and mislead the jury under Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. Since by the cross-examination of Government witnesses Gunder, Byrd, Bailey and Haggarty the defendants had been able both to attack their credibility and to show the possibility of moisture content variances, the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to receive this additional evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-4\">VI. <em>Refusal of Seven Tendered Instructions of Defendants</em></p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">Defendants next assert that the district court should have given its proposed Instructions 24, 29, 36, 40, 42, 43 and 52. In considering this matter, the instructions must of course be viewed as a whole <em>(United States v. Rajewski, </em>526 F.2d 149,159 (7th Cir. 1975), certiorari denied, 426 U.S. 908, 96 S.Ct. 2231, 48 L.Ed.2d 833). It is unnecessary to give a proposed charge where the essential points are covered in other instructions. <em>United States v. Cook, </em>530 F.2d 145, 153 (7th Cir. 1976), certiorari denied, 426 U.S. 909, 96 S.Ct. 2234, 48 L.Ed.2d 835.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">Defendants\u2019 Instruction 24 told the jurors that they could not find defendants guilty under Count I unless it found they were involved in the same single conspiracy. This was sufficiently covered by Instructions 8, 9, 13-19 (Tr. 574-575, 580-587), all dealing with the elements of a conspiracy with meticulous care.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">Defendants\u2019 Instruction 29 related to the weight the jurors were to give circumstantial evidence. This was adequately covered by the court\u2019s Instruction 38 (Tr. 596-597).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-9\">Defendants\u2019 proposed Instruction 36 dealt with accomplice testimony. The court\u2019s Instruction 39 was to the same effect (Tr. 597), rendering defendants\u2019 Instruction 36 surplusage. See <em>United States v. Marzano, </em>537 F.2d 257, 274 (7th Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Rajewski, supra, </em>526 F.2d at 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-10\">Defendants\u2019 proposed Instruction 40 defined the essential elements of violating the mail fraud statute (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341). It was covered adequately by the court\u2019s Instructions 10, 20-24 (Tr. 575-576, 587\u2014 590).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-11\">Defendants\u2019 proposed Instruction 42 dealt with the issuance of warehouse receipts under 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 251. Since the indictment did not relate in any respect to warehouse receipts, it was unnecessary to give this instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-12\">Defendants\u2019 proposed Instruction 43 would have required the district judge to read to the jury various regulations under the United States Warehouse Act, particularly with respect to their supposedly \u201crequiring warehouse receipts in all transactions under the Warehouse Act\u201d (Br. 22).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As already stated, this instruction was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>required because the indictment did not relate to any warehouse receipts.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">Defendants\u2019 proposed Instruction 52 would have told the jury that to constitute a scheme to defraud (apparently referring to Counts II-IV with respect to mail fraud under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341), the evidence must \u201cportray beyond a reasonable doubt a systematic plan to defraud as the underlying basis of the deceit.\u201d This was covered by Instructions 21 and 22 (Tr. 588-589).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">VII. <em>Court\u2019s Instructions 12, 18, 82 and 89 Were Permissible</em></p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">Defendants criticize Instruction 12 because it covers only 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 241, 242, 244, 252, 254 and 256 and does not include other Sections of the Warehouse Act which refer to warehouse receipts. However, the evidence shows that warehouse receipts were not utilized by Central Soya in these transactions and they were not mentioned in the indictment. Consequently, it would have been misleading and confusing for the district court to refer to the statutory warehouse receipt provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">Defendants also criticize Instruction 18 because it told the jury it could find \u201ca conspiracy under Count I of the indictment if the evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt a conspiracy to violate any one of the [4] statutes alleged\u201d (Tr. 587). This instruction is correct. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Grizaffi, </em>471 F.2d 69, 73 (7th Cir. 1972); <em>United States v. Tanner, </em>471 F.2d 128, 140 (7th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-8\">Defendants contend that Instruction 22, defining a scheme to defraud under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341, was deficient because it did not indicate \u201cthat the falsity need be substantial\u201d (Br. 22). However, the court\u2019s instruction was taken from 2 Devitt and Blackmar, <em>Federal Court Practices and Instructions, </em>\u00a7 47.04 (3d ed. 1977), and has been approved in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>522 F.2d 641, 651, notes 10 and 11 (7th Cir. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">Defendants also object to court Instruction 39 dealing with accomplice testimony. Such an instruction was drawn from 1 Devitt and Blackmar, <em>Federal Jury Practices and Instructions, </em>\u00a7 17.06 (3d ed. 1977), and has been approved in <em>United States v. Morales, </em>477 F.2d 1309, 1313 (5th Cir. 1973). Because the instruction told the jury that accomplice testimony \u201cis to be received with caution, scrutinized closely, and weighed with great care\u201d (Tr. 597), defendants were adequately protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-10\">VIII. <em>Constitutionality of False Statement Statute</em></p>\n<p id=\"b946-11\">Counts V-VIII charged that defendants made false statements within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 by causing the issuance of false and incorrect grain inspection and weight certificates. Defendants\u2019 final position is that the application of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 to these facts \u201crender[s] it unconstitutionally vague and indefinite\u201d (Br. 23). Since the evidence shows that the subject matter of this indictment was within the jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture and that defendants caused federally licensed grain inspector Kinley Gunder to falsify a material fact, namely, the inspection grade and weight on the certificates, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 clearly applies and cannot be deemed unconstitutional on grounds of vagueness. See <em>United States v. Matanky, </em>482 F.2d 1319, 1322 (9th Cir. 1973), certiorari denied, 414 U.S. 1039, 94 S.Ct. 539, 38 L.Ed.2d 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-12\">Judgments of conviction affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b940-16\">. Central Soya Company is located in Indianapolis, Indiana, and is in the business of processing and merchandising soybeans, corn and wheat. It is a licensed warehouse pursuant to the United States Warehouse Act (7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 241 <em>et seq.). </em>It apparently does not store grain owned by others and issue receipts for the grain for which it is the bailee, but instead purchases all of the grain it stores, either for resale or for processing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b940-25\">. Judge Steckler concluded that \u00a7 270 (note 7 infra) applied only to certificates on the basis of which warehouse receipts were to be issued (Tr. 466). He nevertheless charged the jury that causing the issuance of false or fraudulent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>certificates could have been the object of a criminal conspiracy under paragraph D of Count I, even though it was clear that Central Soya never contemplated issuing warehouse receipts (Tr. 573, Instruction 7). Since we have concluded that \u00a7 270 applies to all weight and inspection certificates issued under the Act by licensed inspectors, regardless of whether or not warehouse receipts were to be based on them (see discussion in section 11(c) infra), we need not resolve the seeming discrepancy. The Government has not appealed the dismissal of Counts IX through XII.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b941-15\">.
