Plaintiff argues that because the word \u201cpenalties\u201d appears in the heading of 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 450d plaintiff\u2019s civil action <em>qui tam </em>is specifically authorized by 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 201,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which \u201cprovides that an action to recover * * * civil penalties imposed by Title 25, U.S.C. may be brought either by a private person as an informer or by the government. If an informer sues and recovers, he is entitled to retain one-half of the recovery with the other half being paid over to the government.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Chase </em>v. <em>Wald, </em>557 F.2d 157, 159 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1002, 98 S.Ct. 647, 54 L.Ed.2d 498 (1977). Whether a penalty may be enforced by a civil action brought by a private citizen or only by a criminal suit prosecuted by the government is a matter of legislative discretion, direction, and intent, and if a statute contemplates recovery only by a criminal proceeding, a civil remedy cannot be adopted. <em>United States v. Regan, </em>232 U.S. 37, 43, 34 S.Ct. 213, 58 L.Ed. 494 (1914); <em>Bass Angler Sportsman </em>Soc\u2019y v. <em>United States Steel Corp., </em>324 F.Supp. 412, 415-16 (D.Ala.), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>447 F.2d 1304 (5th Cir. 1971). We find that Congress intended section 450d to create criminal penalties,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> so that no private right of action exists to enforce this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-11\">Plaintiff alleges no other basis for federal jurisdiction. Neither the courts nor the parties may confer federal jurisdiction \u2022 and even though non jurisdictional <em>defects </em>may be waived, the requirement oi subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived by the parties or ignored by the courts. <em>California v. LaRue, </em>409 U.S. 109, 113 n. 3, 93 S.Ct 390, 34 L.Ed.2d 342 (1972); <em>United States v. Redstone, </em>488 F.2d 300, 301 (8th Cir. 1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-12\">That the action was filed <em>qui </em>tam<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> does not alter our decision. No common law right to maintain <em>qui tam </em>actions exists and authority to file such actions must be found in legislation. <em>Connecticut Action Now, Inc. v. Roberts Plating Co., Inc., </em>457 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>F.2d 81, 84 (2d Cir. 1972). Where sanctions for violation of a statute are clearly criminal, they are beyond the scope of <em>qui tam </em>proceedings. <em>Gerbing v. I.T.T. Rayonier Inc., </em>332 F.Supp. 309, 310 (M.D.Fla.1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">The dismissal by the district court for lack of jurisdiction is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b85-30\">. \u00a7 450d. Criminal activities involving grants, contracts, etc.; penalties</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-31\">Whoever, being an officer, director, agent, or employee of, or connected in any capacity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>with, any recipient of a contract, subcontract, grant, or subgrant pursuant to this Act or [sections 452 to 457 of this title], embezzles, willfully misapplies, steals, or obtains by fraud any- of the money, funds, assets, or property which are the subject of such a grant, subgrant, contract, or subcontract, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than two years, or both, but if the amount so embezzled, misapplied, stolen, or obtained by fraud does not exceed $100, he shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b86-6\">. \u00a7 201. Penalties; how recovered</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-7\">All penalties which shall accrue under this title shall be sued for and recovered in an action in the nature of an action of debt, in the name of the United States, before any court having jurisdiction of the same, in any State or Territory in which the defendant shall be arrested or found, the one half to the use of the informer and the other half to the use of the United States, except when the prosecution shall be first instituted on behalf of the United States, in which case the whole shall be to their use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">Plaintiff contends that \u00a7 201 and \u00a7 450d are contemporaneous. We disagree. Section 201 was enacted June 30, 1834, and \u00a7 450d was enacted January 4, 1975.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b86-9\">. \u201cSection 6 [codified as 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 450d] is a new section adopted by the Subcommittee pursuant to recommendations of the Department of the Interior.

Historically a qui tam action is one brought by an informer under a statute which establishes a penalty or forfeiture for the commission or omission of some act, and which additionally provides for the recovery of the same in a civil action with part of the recovery to go to the person bringing the action. * * * All of the qui tam cases also recognize the statutory origin of the right of action. It arises not from a statutory right to share in the penalty but from the express or implied statutory grant of authority to maintain the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-17\"><em>Bass Angler Sportsman Soc\u2019y v.
