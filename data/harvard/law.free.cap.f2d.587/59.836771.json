The references disclose structure for encoding and decoding multiple audio signals. With specific values for alpha and beta in appellant\u2019s claims, the examiner found the formulas equivalent to those disclosed by and set forth in the claims of Takahashi and Bauer.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">Scheiber said his present application, a continuation-in-part of two earlier applications,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was entitled to an effective filing date antedating the references,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because, upon substitution of the specific alpha and beta values suggested by the examiner, the presently claimed subject matter was disclosed in his earlier applications in full compliance with 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, first paragraph. The examiner found insufficient disclosure in the earlier applications to support the claims or to teach the anticipatory subject matter in the references.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-17\">\n<em>The Board</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b123-18\">Finding no basis in appellant\u2019s earlier applications for the beta angle now claimed, the board denied appellant his earlier filing date. The board refused to review the examiner\u2019s position on the relationship between the earlier applications and the references, because it considered that relationship \u201cnot germane.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-19\">\n<em>Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b123-20\">The issue is whether Scheiber\u2019s present claims are entitled to the benefit of his earlier application\u2019s filing date.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-21\">OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b123-22\">\n<em>35 U.S.C. \u00a7 120/Rule 131</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b123-23\">\u201cInvention,\u201d as used in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 120,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> refers to the claimed invention in a continuing application. <em>In re Lukach, </em>442 F.2d 967, 968, 58 CCPA 1233, 1235, 169 USPQ 795, 796 (1971); <em>In re Brower, </em>433 F.2d 813, 817, 58 CCPA 724, 728, 167 USPQ 684, 687 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-24\">The operation of \u00a7 120 differs from the operation of Patent and Trademark Office Rule 131 (37 CFR 1.131).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The latter provides an applicant a mechanism for overcoming specific prior art references predating his effective filing date. The applicant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>need show priority with respect to only so much of the claimed invention as the references disclose, <em>In re Stempel, </em>241 F.2d 755, 760, 44 CCPA 820, 826, 113 USPQ 77, 81 (1957), or only so much as to render the claimed invention obvious. <em>In re Spiller, </em>500 F.2d 1170, 1177, 182 USPQ 614, 619 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1974). Section 120, on the other hand, concerns only an applicant\u2019s effective filing date. Unlike Rule 131, \u00a7 120 operates independently of the prior art, of which it makes no mention, and it expressly requires an earlier application to disclose the claimed subject matter in compliance with 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, first paragraph. Thus it is entirely appropriate that the showing required under \u00a7 120 differs from that required under Rule 131.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">\n<em>The Present Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Scheiber admits that his claims are directed to general three-dimensional systems and are not supported by his earlier applications. That admission would normally end the inquiry under \u00a7 120. In the present case, however, Scheiber alleges that his earlier applications do support his claims when the claims are interpreted as reading on the specific systems taught by Takahashi and Bauer. That the claims under consideration are subject to that interpretation and, as so interpreted, are anticipated by the two references, is not disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Nevertheless, although Scheiber\u2019s claims are rejected on references that teach no more than is disclosed in his earlier applications, that circumstance does not entitle him to claim his earlier filing date under \u00a7 120 for claims not supported in those applications.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This court denied an applicant the benefit of \u00a7 120 under similar circumstances in <em>In re Lukach, supra. </em>In that case, a composition claim reciting a range of molecular weight distribution was denied the filing date of a parent application, even though the reference cited against the claim disclosed a composition identical to that in the parent application. Denial of the earlier date was premised on failure of the parent application to disclose the range recited in the claim. The court noted that \u201cthe description of a single embodiment of broadly claimed subject matter constitutes a description of the invention for anticipation purposes * * * whereas the same information in a specification might not alone be enough to provide a description of that invention for purposes of adequate disclosure\u201d under the first paragraph of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112. <em>In re Lukach, supra, </em>442 F.2d at 970, 58 CCPA at 1236, 169 USPQ at 797; <em>accord, In re Sichert, </em>566 F.2d 1154, 1165, 196 USPQ 209, 218 (Cust. &amp; Pat.App.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">Scheiber argues unfairness in what he views as the employment of one claim interpretation in finding anticipation under \u00a7 102, and of a different interpretation in denying him his earlier filing date. Any apparent unfairness results, however, from Scheiber\u2019s choice of claim language. Claim 10, the broadest claim, includes means for generating a class of output signals defined by a mathematical expression. Substitution of certain values for alpha and beta in the expression creates a specific subclass of output signals, causing the claims to read on allegedly identical disclosures in the references and in the earlier applications. Thus the claims are being given not inconsistent interpretations, but a single interpretation encompassing a class and subclass.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">If Scheiber\u2019s position were to prevail, the claims under consideration would be granted one filing date when viewed as encompassing general three-dimensional systems, and a different, earlier date under \u00a7 120 when viewed as encompassing certain specific systems. The filing date made available under \u00a7 120, however, is limited to claimed subject matter disclosed in an earlier application in the manner required by \u00a7 112. Hence the board correctly, and necessarily, determined that the relationship of the claims to certain references, and of the references to Scheiber\u2019s earlier applications, were not germane.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-13\">Accordingly, the decision of the board is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b124-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b123-10\">.

I would, however, consider another question not reached by the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">I have carefully considered appellant\u2019s brief, reply brief, and the extensive prosecution history of this application in the PTO and yet I find no cogent statement of the theory upon which appellant seeks relief. The theme recurring throughout the brief is that appellant wishes to \u201crely on the filing dates of his \u2019886 and \u2019792 patents to overcome Bauer and Takahashi to the extent those patents contain the same disclosures as the references.\u201d <em>How </em>he wishes to \u201crely\u201d on those dates is not certain.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Ordinarily, failure of an appellant to present a clear question for the court to decide with attendant legal theories to support the desired answer to that question would be fatal to the appeal. However, since the arguments and facts herein could support different pathways of legal reasoning, and, more importantly, possibly different results, it would seem to be worthwhile to explore one apparent alternative rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">There are at least two ways that this ease may be treated. First, the court may find that appellant is asking it to make the decision that various bits of his claimed invention are supported in the parent applications (now patents \u2019886 and \u2019792 \u2014 both filed before Bauer and Takahashi) and thereby provide a \u00a7 120 immunity to the claimed invention. The majority opinion properly rejects this approach. Alternatively, appellant may be asking the court to treat his prior patents as some type of <em>pro forma </em>Rule 131 affidavit. The argument is made here (as it was before the board) that the principles discussed in <em>In re Rainer, </em>390 F.2d 771, 55 CCPA 853, 156 USPQ 334 (1968)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> should apply in a similar manner in this case since, appellant argues, \u201cthe essential issue * * * is the question of priority [of invention] and nothing else.\u201d Obviously, appellant has not submitted a Rule 131 affidavit to overcome Bauer and Tak-ahashi.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But through the years this court has taken a \u201crule-of-reason\u201d approach in permitting an appellant to antedate a reference whenever proffered extrinsic evidence fairly indicates that the appellant is the first inventor. In one such situation, in which an appellant\u2019s evidence did not conform to the then-existing norm of presentation, the court cut through the formalities and faced the issue squarely:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-16\">The real issue is whether <em>all </em>the evidence, including the references, truly shows knowledge by another <em>prior to the time appellants made their invention </em>or whether it shows the contrary. It is a question of fact. [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-17\"><em>In re Land, </em>368 F.2d 866, 878, 54 CCPA 806, 823, 151 USPQ 621, 632 (1966).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is possible that this record contains enough evidence to support appellant\u2019s argument. However, since the pertinent evidence has not been directly addressed and argued, the sufficiency thereof is not approached in the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-18\">The pertinent statutory inquiry<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(e),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> i. e., can the appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>demonstrate that he was in possession of his invention prior to the filing dates of the Bauer and Takahashi patents? Or, can he show prior invention of at least as much of the invention as is shown in those two patents?<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Appellant points to the <em>specifications </em>of his \u2019886 and \u2019792 patents and answers that he can. Although the contents of those specifications are to be considered, they are not <em>necessarily </em>indicative of the subject matter appellant can claim as his invention. For instance, discussions of pri- or art are often found in disclosures and portions of the subject matter might be derived from another inventor.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">There are two parts of those specifications that are to be considered as evidence of the inventions \u2014 the <em>claims </em>as <em>filed </em>and the <em>claims </em>as <em>issued. </em>The Rules of Practice in Patent Cases require that an applicant, upon filing an application, swear or affirm, in essence, that he believes himself to be the inventor of the subject matter for which he solicits a patent.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That subject matter is found in the claims. So, by operation of the rules, <em>originally filed </em>claims are to be considered as the invention contemplated by the inventor as of the date of filing. Further, as we found in <em>In re Faci-us, </em>408 F.2d 1396, 1406, 56 CCPA 1348, 1358, 161 USPQ 294, 301 (1969) \u201ca patent evidences inventorship <em>by the patentee </em>of everything <em>both </em>disclosed <em>and </em>claimed.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The evidentiary value of an <em>allowed </em>claim would presumably date back to the time of the entry of that claim, in its allowed form, in the specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The claim-as-evidence is in a form that is necessarily conclusory in nature. The inventor presents the conclusion that \u201cthis is the invention.\u201d Arguably this is a different type of showing than that often presented in Rule 131 affidavits where facts <em>tending </em>to show the invention are presented rather than merely a conclusion of invention. Nonetheless, if the \u201cconclusion\u201d of the inventor as shown in the claims was made prior to the time he had any interest in the outcome of the question in issue,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the claims should be accorded some weight as evidence. Whether that weight is sufficient to become dispositive is a fact question.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">Appellant\u2019s patent \u2019886 has a filing date of December 12, 1969, and an issue date of January 1, 1972; \u2019792 has corresponding dates of June 15, 1970, and July 17, 1973. The filing date of Bauer is March 15, 1971, and that of Takahashi is July 3, 1972. At first blush, the originally filed claims of \u2019886 are useful as evidence against the disclosure of Bauer and similarly the originally filed claims of \u2019792 are applicable against Tak-ahashi.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The allowed claims in neither of appellant\u2019s patents are ostensibly of interest because of the respectively later issue dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-12\">The appellant has made comparisons between the decoder matrix of Bauer and that of \u2019886 as well as the matrix of Tak-ahashi and that of \u2019792. These comparisons were presented to the examiner (who responded in his Answer to the board and found them to be non-persuasive), to the board (which considered the comparisons not to be germane to the \u00a7 120 basis on which it decided the case), and to this court. However, the comparisons were based on the <em>specifications </em>of \u2019886 and \u2019792 rather than on the pertinent sets of claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-13\">As to \u2019886, the originally filed claims appear to be close enough in content to the argued portion of the specification to allow the arguments to be considered. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>in \u2019792, the argued matrix constants are not clearly found in the original claims. Derivation of the matrix is clearly beyond the scope of review in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">In sum, even though appellant\u2019s appeal, as viewed by the majority opinion, is one that must be rejected under law; under the rationale suggested here, the appeal may be deficient only in the presentation of the evidence. In any event, the decision of the board is properly affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-8\">. Rainer is oft cited to show \u201cthat an anticipatory disclosure, not a statutory bar, may be removed as a reference against a generic claim by a Rule 131 affidavit showing prior reduction to practice of as much of the claimed invention as the reference shows.\u201d <em>Id. </em>390 F.2d at 773, 55 CCPA at 855, 156 USPQ at 336.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b125-9\">.
