Our jurisdiction stems from 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 1294(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-10\">I. <em>FACTS:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1032-11\">In 1972, appellant, Fred Walking Badger,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and co-defendant, Jesse Bojorquez, were prisoners in the custody of the State of Arizona at the penitentiary in Florence. They were accused by indictment of assaulting three prison guards on October 8, 1972. In March, 1973, they were brought to trial in state court. Each defendant elected to represent himself, although standby counsel was provided. Their trial lasted six days. Under circumstances which we examine below, appellant was expelled three times and finally barred from further proceedings until the imposition of sentence. On March 14, 1973, the jury returned a verdict of guilty as to both defendants on two counts of assault to commit murder and one count of being prisoners in possession of a weapon. On the basis of this conviction appellant was sentenced to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-16\">An appeal was taken to the Arizona Supreme Court, which affirmed. <em>Arizona v. Delvecchio, </em>110 Ariz. 396, 519 P.2d 1137 (1974). The petition to the district court followed, alleging principally that appellant had been denied his right to be present during trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-17\">II. <em>DISCUSSION:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1032-18\">The right of an accused to be present at his trial is an ancient and well-established one which draws on several constitutional sources. In <em>Hopt v. People of the Territory of Utah, </em>110 U.S. 574, 579, 4 S.Ct. 202, 28 L.Ed. 262 (1884), the Supreme Court held that the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment requires the defendant\u2019s attendance at trial. On the same footing, the right was declared applicable to states \u201cto the extent that a fair and just hearing would be thwarted by [the defendant\u2019s] absence.\u201d <em>Snyder v. Massachusetts, </em>291 U.S. 97, 107-108, 54 S.Ct. 330, 333, 78 L.Ed. 674 (1934); <em>Lowery v. Cardwell, </em>535 F.2d 546, 549 (9th Cir. 1976). More recently, the Supreme Court has stated that the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment guarantees the right of an accused to be present not only whenever testimony is taken, <em>Snyder, supra, </em>291 U.S. at 102, 54 S.Ct. 330, but \u201cin the courtroom at every stage of his trial.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Allen, </em>397 U.S. 337, 338, 90 S.Ct. 1057, 1058, 25 L.Ed.2d 353 (1970); <em>compare Diaz v. United States, </em>223 U.S. 442, 455, 32 S.Ct. 250, 56 L.Ed. 500 (1912). This corollary of his right of confrontation was incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment and made applicable to the states in <em>Pointer v. Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965). <em>Allen, supra, </em>397 U.S. at 338, 90 S.Ct. at 1057; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"971\">*971</page-number><em>Bustamonte v. Eyman, </em>456 F.2d 269, 271\u2014 273 (9th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-4\">The right to be present, thus secure, is however not absolute. <em>Polizzi v. United States, </em>550 F.2d 1133, 1137 (9th Cir. 1976). While we would have defendants present at their trials, we must also have those trials fair and conducted in an atmosphere of sufficient calmness and decorum.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-5\">It is essential to the proper administration of criminal justice that dignity, order, and decorum be the hallmarks of all court proceedings in our country. The flagrant disregard in the courtroom of elementary standards of proper conduct should not and cannot be tolerated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1033-6\"><em>Allen, supra, </em>397 U.S. at 343, 90 S.Ct. at 1061. Dictum in <em>Snyder, supra, </em>291 U.S. at 106, 54 S.Ct. at 332, had indicated that \u201cthe privilege [of presence] may be lost . at times even by misconduct.\u201d In <em>Allen, supra, </em>the Supreme Court expressly held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-7\">a defendant can lose his right to be present at trial if, after he has been warned, by the judge that he will be removed if he continues his disruptive behavior, he nevertheless insists on conducting himself in a manner <em>so disorderly, disruptive, and disrespectful of the court that his trial cannot be carried on with him in the courtroom. </em>Once lost, the right to be present can, of course, be reclaimed as soon as the defendant is willing to conduct himself consistently with the decorum and respect inherent in the concept of courts and judicial proceedings. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1033-8\">397 U.S. at 343, 90 S.Ct. at 1061.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-9\">Appellant\u2019s absence from the courtroom on March 8, March 13, and March 14 constitutes a <em>prima facie </em>denial of his right to be present. Appellee raises, as a defense, acts of misconduct which he alleges waived that right. We must decide whether appellant\u2019s behavior at trial did rise to the level of misconduct described in <em>Allen. </em>If it did not, we must decide further whether the error of the trial court in excluding appellant was harmless.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1033-11\">A. Was it error to exclude the defendant?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1033-12\">The <em>Allen </em>standard is notably couched in general terms. It announces no <em>per se </em>rule of excludable conduct. It remits us to a careful examination of the record. But in looking at the unique facts of this case, we must do so in light of <em>Allen </em>and its progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-13\">In <em>Allen, </em>the defendant continued to talk after he had been replaced by appointed counsel, threatened to make a corpse of the judge, threw the papers of his file on the floor, declared that he would prevent any trial whatsoever, and responded to questions with vile and abusive language. The decision of the trial court to exclude him was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-14\">In <em>United States v. Ives, </em>504 F.2d 935 (9th Cir. 1974), the leading case applying <em>Allen </em>in this circuit, the defendant refused to answer questions, argued with the judge, struck defense counsel on several occasions, shouted from his cell beneath the courtroom, and physically attacked the United States attorneys. His exclusion was likewise sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-15\">Most recently, in <em>United States v. Kizer, </em>569 F.2d 504 (9th Cir. 1978), the defendant interrupted the prosecuting attorney\u2019s closing argument, demanded discharge of her attorney and a new trial, and continued to argue with the judge after her motions were denied. This court upheld the order to remove her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-16\">These decisions give some idea of the nature of misconduct which heretofore has justified exclusion of the defendant. They therefore provide a useful comparison for each of the trial court\u2019s rulings in the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-17\">1. <em>The first expulsion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AXb\">a) Events.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-18\">At an appearance on January 11, 1973, two months before trial, appellant interrupted the remarks of other parties several times and changed the subject to inquire of motions he had filed. The trial judge clearly warned him that \u201cunruly or disruptive\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"972\">*972</page-number>behavior at trial would forfeit his right to conduct his defense and to stay in the courtroom. Tr. Jan. 11, pp. 20, 28, 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">These warnings were forcefully repeated on the first day of trial, March 6, 1973, when it was finally determined that appellant would represent himself.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Shortly afterwards, during the selection of jurors, the defendant raised several matters out of turn, and once interrupted the judge as he was talking to him. When he interrupted the judge two more times in quick succession, and insisted that witnesses leave immediately before the jury entered, the court stopped and issued an extended warning that it, not the defendant, would preside in the courtroom. During this warning the defendant interrupted the judge and inquired, \u201cAre you looking for excuses, Your Honor, to take me out of the court?\u201d The rest of the day passed without further serious incident, although the defendant was variously guilty of interrupting, asking repetitive questions, and arguing his case or with the witnesses. On each occasion he was admonished. Tr. Mar. 6, pp. 3, 4, 9,10, 68, 71, 76, 125, 129, 133, 180-1, 184, 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-16\">On March 7, the second day of trial, the defendant\u2019s participation was limited to cross-examination of prosecution witnesses. From time to time he became argumentative and had to be admonished. On one occasion he entered into an irrelevant dialogue with a witness. Tr. Mar. 7, pp. 24, 46, 63, 68, 74, 77, 115-6, 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-17\">On March 8, the third day of trial, the court took up several housekeeping matters before calling in the jury for resumption of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"973\">*973</page-number>the testimony. The defendant learned that the witnesses he had planned to call first would not be available until later. The court denied his motion for a continuance until they arrived. Next, copies of proposed instructions were distributed early, to give the parties extra time for study. The court denied the defendant\u2019s immediate motion to dispense with instructions, prompting him to complain that \u201cI can\u2019t have my trial and my rights at the same time.\u201d Thereupon co-defendant Bojorquez moved that new counsel be assigned to him, saying his present attorney had failed to make objections on his behalf. The court denied this request as well and was proceeding to explain the limited role of standby counsel when defendant interrupted to provoke an increasingly heated dialogue.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After arguing with the judge, appellant raised a clenched fist, and finally taunted the court to expel him. The court obliged. Tr. Mar. 8, pp. 2-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-5\">b) Analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-6\">In judging whether the preceding events constituted sufficient grounds for concluding that the trial could not have proceeded fairly and efficiently so long as appellant was present in the courtroom, we are mindful that we are engaged, to some extent, in \u201csecond guessing.\u201d Deference would be owed in any event to the decision of the judge in whose hands the actual responsibility for courtroom conduct is placed. Discretion attends his position. <em>See Allen, supra, </em>397 U.S. at 343,90 S.Ct. at 1061; <em>Kizer, supra, </em>569 F.2d at 507; <em>Ives, supra, </em>504 F.2d at 942. Still further deference is due in this case, however, because we view the evidence from a cold record.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1035-14\">[T]he appellate court is not in as good a position as the trial judge to determine the effect a defendant\u2019s disruptive conduct may have had on the proceedings. Even though facial expressions, gestures and other nonverbal conduct are often tremendously significant, they cannot be transcribed by the court reporter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1035-15\"><em>Id. </em>We must, and do, give great deference to the decision of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-16\">We sustain the removal order of March 8. Defendant\u2019s behavior was seriously disruptive. Baiting the trial judge to remove him was a direct challenge to the court\u2019s authority which left the court little choice in establishing its credibility. The display of a clenched fist, either as a sign of disrespect or as a gesture of intimidation, would shatter the courtroom\u2019s atmosphere of careful inquiry. These acts transcended the defendant\u2019s role as his own attorney. Fair warning of the consequences of misbehavior had been given. <em>Allen, supra, </em>397 U.S. at 343,90 S.Ct. at 1061; <em>Ives, supra, </em>504 F.2d at 942. The appropriate assurance that the defendant could return as soon as he agreed to conduct himself in an orderly manner was also extended. <em>Id. </em>397 U.S. at 343, 90 S.Ct. 1057; Tr. Mar. 8, pp. 6, 58. The defendant was therefore properly expelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-17\">2. <em>The second expulsion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A6n\">a) Events.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-18\">The defendant was returned to the courtroom later the same day, in time to begin the presentation of his case in chief. The court advised him at length to question as a lawyer would, not to argue with witnesses, and, especially, not to interrupt the court or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>to argue with it except on strictly legal matters. The defendant promised to conduct himself in a proper manner. He spent the remainder of the day examining his first two witnesses with only occasional lapses. Tr. Mar. 8, pp. 61-3, 95-6, 122-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">On March 9, the fourth day of trial, the defendant continued to present his case through the testimony of fellow inmates. While questioning his first witness he once strayed into irrelevant matters; later he interrupted the cross-examination and had to be admonished. Interruptions of the prosecutor continued during cross-examination of the next witness. The second time this happened the court excused the jury and warned appellant, \u201cThe next time you will have to go and Mr. Wildermuth [standby counsel] is going to be in your place.\u201d The defendant interrupted the court twice during the warning itself. He was allowed to put on his next witness, however, before the court stood in early recess until March 13. Tr. Mar. 9, pp. 19-20, 23, 49-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">March 13, the fifth day of trial, opened with the examination of Dr. Glenn Walker. Dr. Walker was present as a result of last-minute efforts to obtain an expert who would testify to the effects of tear gas, which had been employed against the defendant during the incident of October 8, 1972. Earlier in the trial, the defendant had apparently been extremely upset to learn that he had missed his opportunity to subpoena witnesses he wanted while he was in prison. Tr. Mar. 6, pp. 67-71, 146-148.</p>\n<p id=\"AQze\">Now he claimed to be disappointed that his witness was not an eye specialist but a general practitioner. That dismay increased when, after some initially favorable testimony, Dr. Walker examined a cartridge of the tear gas used in the prison and declared it to be one of the milder forms. An escalating exchange with the court then took place.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To save his argument, the defendant asked that he be shot with tear gas in front of the jury. He interrupted the court when it advised him to ask questions and to defer other matters until the recess, then complained that \u201c[the jury] never hear what\u2019s going on.\u201d When he continued to argue about the function of the jury, the jury was excused and he was ordered removed from the courtroom. Appellant still objected after this order, and in the end the trial judge was forced to leave the room to end the \u201ctirade.\u201d Tr. Mar. 13, pp. 8-9, 12-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-15\">b) Analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-16\">Our review of these events may begin with the observation that there is no difference in kind between the \u201cmisconduct\u201d of the defendant after he returned on March 8 until he was expelled on March 13, and his \u201cmisconduct\u201d on March 6 and 7. In both periods we are looking at an inartful and inept examiner, occasionally irrelevant, often repetitious, and \u2014 most serious \u2014 seemingly incapable of letting others finish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>speaking when what they said went against him. But, appellant was not expelled on March 6 or 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-5\">We find no sign in these proceedings to compare with the earlier baiting and raised fist, or, much less, with the verbal and physical assaults of the defendants in <em>Allen </em>and <em>Ives, </em>which would indicate an opposition to the concept of a trial itself. Indeed, the evidence of the defendant\u2019s attitude runs strongly in the other direction. Before his second expulsion, the defendant had frequently apologized for his errors, Tr. Mar. 6, pp. 120, 177; Tr. Mar. 7, p. 193; Tr. Mar. 6, p. 184; Tr. Mar. 9, pp. 50-51. And the court had agreed that they were not intentional. Tr. Mar. 6, p. 184. Twice the defendant had volunteered to take responsibility for his co-defendant\u2019s conduct. Tr. Mar. 6, pp. 131, 168. He had not seized every occasion, although he had seized many, to raise an objection or to insist on his rights. Tr. Mar. 6, pp. 56, 87, 88, 150. When ejected, his vigorous and truthful protestations that he had not been violent show he held a real (if imperfect) vision of conduct befitting an accused, which he had meant to follow. Tr. Mar. 8, pp. 5-6; Tr. Mar. 13, pp. 15, 31. The very fact that the trial had managed to progress for five days is final evidence that appellant was not opposed to the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-6\">The defendant in <em>Kizer, supra, </em>also was guilty simply of interruptions and arguing, yet was removed. That case is distinguishable. There, the defendant was not in the position of representing herself so it was clear that her mere presence would be disruptive. Here, appellant\u2019s behavior was exhibited as he was playing the attorney\u2019s role. In light of all the evidence, including both the limited nature of his misconduct and the evidence as to his intent, it is impossible to tell if the arguing and the interruptions would have persisted, had that role been withdrawn and assigned to another person.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-7\">We find error in the second expulsion of the defendant, therefore, even when we accord the trial judge the full measure of deference due his position and superior acquaintance with the facts. We emphasize that we do not hold that the trial court could take no action under the circumstances. We do hold that the action it took was excessive. Where constitutional rights of the accused are at stake, including the right to be present, a trial court must look for corrective measures that do least injury to these rights consistent with the preservation of an orderly court atmosphere.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-11\">3. <em>The third expulsion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AzGi\">a) Events.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-12\">The examination of Dr. Walker on the morning of March 13 was completed by appellant\u2019s standby counsel. When he had finished appellant was brought back again and warned that he would be sent from the courtroom only so many times. Tr. Mar. 13, pp. 31-33. Appellant then promised to \u201cremain as a proper Indian.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p. 33. He was allowed to continue with his case despite interrupting the prosecutor soon after-wards and objecting to a court ruling in a disrespectful manner. <em>Id., </em>pp. 36, 37. With a few exceptions, <em>id., </em>pp. 48, 49, 51, all went well until the examination of Dale Brand-fast and Arthur Gomes. These men were respectively the assistant superintendent and superintendent of the Florence prison. Whether by design or by instinct, the defendant sought to use their presence on the stand to try the prison system as a whole, including his treatment thereunder. Consequently he became increasingly argumentative, <em>id., </em>pp. 86, 87, 89, 93 \u2014 96 and 102, repetitious, <em>id., </em>p. 95, irrelevant, <em>id., </em>pp. 96, 97, and hostile to objections of the prosecution to these traits of his inquiry, <em>id., </em>pp. 85, 90. Having admonished the defendant repeatedly, the court finally excused the jury and warned him not to argue with the witness. In the ensuing conversation appellant refused to give the court a straight answer, interrupted the court as it was advising him, indicated that his own perceived harassment in prison justified the scope of his examination, and in a disrespectful manner agreed to follow the court\u2019s instruc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>tions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At this point the court ordered that he be taken from the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">b) Analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-5\">These events need not delay us long, for they raise no novel issue. The later record on March 13 illustrates the same propensities and the same deficiencies that the defendant showed on March 6 and 7 and before his second exit. Without condoning appellant\u2019s behavior in the least, we again find no sign that it was <em>not </em>associated with the speaking role he chose to play; hence, that there is no sufficient showing he could not have remained peacefully in the courtroom if relieved of that role.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-22\">4. <em>The fourth expulsion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1038-23\">On the morning of March 14 the defendant was brought back to determine if he wished to testify. He was not readmitted for the purpose of self-representation. Assurances of good behavior were neither sought nor extended. When the defendant did not respond directly to its repeated inquiries, Tr. Mar. 14, pp. 2-6, the court ordered that he be permanently removed until sentencing, <em>id., </em>pp. 6-8, stating that its order was based on the defendant\u2019s <em>past </em>conduct, <em>id., </em>pp. 7, 8. Thus, properly considered, the fourth expulsion was but an extension of the third. The error of the previous day was not only continued, but enhanced.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>B. Was the exclusion harmless error?</p>\n<p id=\"Aops\">1. <em>Contribution to the verdict.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1039-4\">Appellee argues that even if the later exclusions were error, the error was harmless. He points out first that appellant was not left unrepresented. Standby-counsel stepped in to cross-examine the state\u2019s witnesses and to present a closing argument. The presence of counsel alone at trial can never be harmless <em>per </em>se, however, <em>Bustamonte, supra, </em>456 F.2d at 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-5\">Appellee next argues that the evidence of guilt was overwhelming by the time appellant was removed. This contention mistakes the evidence necessary to withstand an acquittal motion for the evidence necessary to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-6\">As a result of his later removals, appellant missed part or all of the testimony of Dr. Walker, the expert he had called on the effects of tear gas; Arthur Gomes, who was to testify on the qualifications and experience of the prison staff; Dale Brand-fast, who testified regarding the absence of the task force of prison guards who would normally have handled the October 8 disturbance; and Charles Teeples, a medical assistant at the prison who testified to the condition of the defendants directly following the incident. He was also not present during closing argument, instruction of the jury, the proof of his prior conviction,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the return of verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-13\">The statements of these witnesses went to the heart of two defensive theories: first, that the use of tear gas prevented any reconstruction of events free of reasonable doubt; second, that the use of unreasonable force by the guards warranted the prisoners in defending themselves. By his absence the defendant was prevented from assisting in the development of these theories. Likewise he could not be seen by the witnesses who testified against him, or by the jurors who decided his fate. He could not assist in preparation for the presentation of a closing argument. The combination of these circumstances leaves, in our mind, a reasonable doubt that appellant\u2019s exclusion contributed to the guilty verdict obtained. Therefore, we find the constitutional error complained of was not harmless. <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-14\">2. <em>Denial of due process.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1039-15\">There is a second separate ground for our decision. The very absence of an accused, without good reason from so many stages of his trial calls for reversal. The defendant in this case could not hear the testimony of several witnesses. He could not observe the closing arguments of counsel, the jury instructions, of the trial to the court on the issue of his previous eonvic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"978\">*978</page-number>tions. Most critically, he was forced to learn second-hand whether the jury had found him guilty or not.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The right of presence is extended not only to protect the integrity and reliability of the trial mechanism. As has been stated by the Fourth Circuit, the right of presence</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ABTZ\">[assures] nondisruptive defendants the opportunity to observe \u2014 and, it is to be hoped, to understand \u2014 all stages of the trial not involving purely legal matters generally incomprehensible to the layman, in order to prevent the loss of confidence in courts as instruments of justice which secret trials would engender.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Al6\"><em>United States v. Gregorio, </em>497 F.2d 1253, 1258 and n. 10, (4th Cir. 1974). Those events, then, infringe on a societal interest in seeing that the forms of trial are preserved, that due process is not entirely a matter of contingencies. The law requires that the defendant be present at his trial. We reverse to ensure that \u201cneither [life nor liberty] is taken except in the mode prescribed by law.\u201d <em>Bustamonte, supra, </em>456 F.2d 274, <em>citing Hopt, supra, </em>110 U.S. at 579, 4 S.Ct. 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b1040-4\">III. <em>CONCLUSION:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1040-5\">Clearly, this was a trial where things were not going well. A measure of unorthodoxy, confusion, and delay is to be expected in any <em>pro se </em>case. <em>United States v. Dougherty, </em>154 U.S.App.D.C. 76, 87, 473 F.2d 1113, 1124 (1972). These proceedings were particularly ill-starred. They featured a defendant who was twice the subject of competency motions; was incarcerated until the time of trial; was ignorant of the most basic conventions of courtroom procedure; failed to write out the questions he intended to ask; failed to confer with his own witnesses and therefore could not anticipate their testimony; felt keenly that he had suffered abuse at the hands of other witnesses; and knew only, or knew best, the prison style of assertiveness as a way of being recognized. We are thus not surprised that his self-representation cast his trial into serious jeopardy. Had the judge ordered standby counsel to take his place, on this record we might well have affirmed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1040-19\">However, the court first threatened and finally imposed a different sanction. It is quite apparent that, in doing so, the court identified the defendant\u2019s right to represent himself with the defendant\u2019s right to be present.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> That identification is easy to make in the heat of trial. Both rights arise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"979\">*979</page-number>from assurances of the Sixth Amendment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Both rights are exercised when an accused stands <em>in propria persona. </em>Both rights may be curtailed on behalf of the same institutional interest.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> And, as a factual matter, both rights are usually lost by the same or succeeding acts. <em>See, e. g., Allen, supra; United States v. Evans, </em>542 F.2d 805 (10th Cir. 1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 1101, 97 S.Ct. 1124, 51 L.Ed.2d 550 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-5\">The similarities between these rights should not conceal other differences, however. Thus, the right of self-representation must be claimed to be granted, while the right to be present is extended as a matter of course. It has been suggested elsewhere that the right of presence may be more readily reclaimed. <em>Dougherty, supra, </em>154 U.S.App.D.C. at 88, 473 F.2d at 1125 n. 20. Our discussion here implies that it is also less easily lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-6\">In simplest terms, the Constitution calls upon a trial court faced with a defendant who is representing himself, and who is misbehaving, to ask two questions. Can there be a fair and efficient trial so long as the defendant plays the role of attorney. Can there be a fair and efficient trial while the defendant remains in the courtroom? The requirement that both questions be asked is the unremarkable result of the defendant\u2019s concurrent exercise of two constitutional rights. In many cases the answers to these questions will be the same. Where only the representation right has been waived, however, the defendant must be permitted to remain in the courtroom-on the understanding and condition that further misconduct may indeed waive his right to be present.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-12\">It is reasonable to suppose that there are cases in which a defendant becomes so aroused in arguing and questioning, so frustrated by an inevitable succession of defeats on matters he little understands, so angered at his inability to elicit favorable testimony and to discredit damaging testimony, that in representing himself he loses self-control and seriously disrupts his trial. Yet, the same accused may be capable of listening and even assisting while another person, more versed in the substance and procedure of law, conducts his defense. Appellant may have been such a person. On this record we do not know; neither could the trial judge have known.</p>\n<p id=\"b1041-13\">Accordingly, the decision of the district court is reversed, with instructions to issue the writ, first allowing the state a reasonable time for bringing defendant to trial anew.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1032-13\">. At the time of the original state court proceeding appellant, a Native American, was named Fred Delvecchio. Subsequently he changed his name to Fred Walking Badger. To avoid confusion we refer to him as \u201cthe defendant\u201d or \u201cappellant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1032-20\">. Other federal claims on appeal, only one of which we decide, are discussed in footnotes 7 and 9, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1034-5\">. Although the question was not raised on appeal, the defendant\u2019s handling of his case naturally draws our attention to his waiver of counsel. We express grave doubts whether he was ever sufficiently examined. The defendant \u201cshould be made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, so that the record will establish that \u2018he knows what he is doing and his choice is made with eyes open.\u2019 \u201d <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 835, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 2541, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975), <em>citing Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann, </em>317 U.S. 269, 279, 63 S.Ct. 236, 87 L.Ed. 268 (1946); <em>United States v. Gillings, </em>568 F.2d 1307, 1308-1309 (9th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-6\">When appellant made his first request to represent himself, at his arraignment on December 4, 1972, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-7\">MR. DELVECCHIO: Your Honor, we can\u2019t be denied the right to represent ourselves.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A63\">THE COURT: If the Court makes a determination you can intelligently do so, we will allow you to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-8\">MR. DELVECCHIO: And you haven\u2019t decided at this point in the trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-9\">THE COURT: <em>I don\u2019t think it is in your best interests at this time.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-10\">MR.

DELVECCHIO: When will a determination be made?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-13\">THE COURT: Sometime prior to trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-14\">MR. DELVECCHIO: Well, prior to trial we have to establish grounds to fight our defense. And if these lawyers \u2014 if we are not going to cooperate with these lawyers, we are not going to have any defense, Your Hon- or.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-19\">THE COURT: Well, <em>at this time, I am telling you it is in your best interest to have the service of counsel. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1034-20\">Tr. Dec. 4, p. 6. Judge McBryde, who was then presiding, thus denied defendant\u2019s request <em>pro tempore </em>in anticipation that a later judge would make the appropriate inquiry on self-representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-21\">Appellant renewed his request to represent himself on January 11, 1973. This time Judge Roylston informed him that the court would appoint an attorney whom he could use as he wished. The following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOc\">THE COURT: . . . Also, with respect to you, Mr. Bojorquez, if you want Mr. Stokes to represent you, he can represent you in the matter and he will talk further with you and you make the decision whether or not you want the lawyer to represent you or whether you want to conduct your own case. Now it makes no difference to me. But <em>I will tell you that the trial will run smoother and that you will probably be much better represented if you permit the lawyer to do it. </em>But I am not telling you nor am I asking you to let the lawyer do it. If you want to represent yourself, you will have the right. But the lawyer will be available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-23\">Now do you understand what I have explained to you, Mr. Delvecchio?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-24\">MR. DELVECCHIO: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-25\">THE COURT: Do you understand, Mr. Bojor-quez?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1034-26\">MR. BOJORQUEZ: Yes. (Emphasis added.) Tr. Jan. 11, p. 29. On our record, the preceding passages represent the entire effort by the court to warn the defendant of \u201cthe dangers and disadvantages of self-representation.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1035-7\">.

One clear error raised in appellant\u2019s brief was the failure to obtain the consent of the defendant to such a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-8\"><em>Duncan v. Louisiana, </em>391 U.S. 145, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 20 L.Ed.2d 491 (1968), which incorporated the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial into the Fourteenth Amendment, also federalized the standards governing waiver of that right. The applicable test, set forth in <em>Adams v. United States ex rel. McCann, </em>317 U.S. 269, 63 S.Ct. 236, 87 L.Ed. 268 (1942), speaks of the \u201cexpress, intelligent consent\u201d of the \u201caccused.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 275, 277-278, 63 S.Ct. 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-9\">The accused in this case never was consulted, much less did he consent. After the jury had retired, and in the defendant\u2019s absence, the trial judge asked if counsel would stipulate to try the allegations of prior convictions to the court. Tr. Mar. 14, p. 91. The prosecutor was of the opinion that the presence of both defendants was needed as an evidentiary matter, <em>id., </em>pp. 92, 94, but he did not object to the proposal of a bench trial. Counsel for appellant would neither object nor stipulate to a bench trial. <em>Id., </em>p. 92. Finding no objection to its proposal, the court proceeded to try the question of prior convictions and to find that the allegations were true. <em>Id., </em>p. 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-17\">The error of obtaining the defendant\u2019s consent in this matter is not lessened by the fact that he had been banished from the courtroom for misbehavior. Assuming that the banishment was justified, which it was not, see <em>text, supra, </em>the personal right to be consulted on the form of one\u2019s trial is qualified, if at all, by different considerations from those that qualify the participatory rights of presence and self-representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-18\">The waiver proceedings here bore no resemblance to the careful inquiry of the trial court in <em>United States v. Penick, </em>496 F.2d 1105, 1107-1108 (7th Cir. 1974). Therefore, we would reverse as to the trial of the priors in any event.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1040-6\">. <em>Compare </em>the defendant\u2019s remarks at the time he was sentenced:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1040-7\">I haven\u2019t been given justice.
