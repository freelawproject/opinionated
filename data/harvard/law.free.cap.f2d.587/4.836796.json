Rea appeals from an order of the district court dismissing with prejudice his claims of religious discrimination filed pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16. The appeal was submitted on briefs by stipulation of the parties. The district court dismissed the complaint upon the ground that it was not filed within the limitations period provided by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16(c) which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-26\">Within 30 days of receipt of notice of final action taken by a department, agen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>cy or unit ... an employee or applicant for employment, if aggrieved by the final disposition of his complaint, or by the failure to take final action on his complaint, may file a civil action as provided in Section 2000e-5 of this title, in which civil action the head of the department, agency, or unit, as appropriate, shall be the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">Rea received notice of the adverse administrative decision regarding his claim of discrimination on October 20, 1976, and his attorney received similar notice on October 26, 1976, pursuant to 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 713.-221(b)(1). The present action was filed on November 24, 1976, thirty-five days after Rea received personal notice of the adverse determination. Rea, however, asserts that the 30 day limitations period prescribed in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-16 began running at the time his attorney received notice and, thus, the action was filed within the time period prescribed by the statute. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Although \u00a7 2000e-16(c) fails to state specifically whether notice must be received by the employee or applicant or by his representative, the pertinent regulations and relevant case law contemplate personal receipt of notice by the employee or applicant as the crucial date for initiating the running of the 30 day limitations periods. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 713.281(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\">\u00a7 713.281 Statutory right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-7\">An <em>employee or applicant </em>is authorized by section 717(c) of the Civil Rights Act, as amended, 84 Stat. 112, to file a civil action in an appropriate U.S. district court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-8\">(a) Within thirty (30) calendar days of <em>his </em>receipt, of notice of final action taken by <em>his </em>agency on a complaint. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">It is significant that this provision does not mention the employee\u2019s representative, in contrast to 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 713.221(b)(1) which requires that notice must be sent to the representative of the aggrieved employee or applicant. Thus, although notice must be given to the representative, if any, the date of this notice is not the determinative date for initiation of the 30 day filing period. In <em>Bell v. Brown, </em>181 U.S.App.D.C. 226, 231, 557 F.2d 849, 854 (D.C. Cir. 1977), the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-12\">[T]he 30-day period for suit is not set in motion until notice of the final administrative action is obtained by the affected employee, irrespective of when it might reach a representative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-13\">We agree with the reasoning of the court in <em>Bell </em>and hold that the district court did not err in dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
