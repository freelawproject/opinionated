The drug covered by NADA 65-381 is a fixed combination drug containing in each 14-milliliter dosage unit procaine penicillin G (100,000 units) and neo-mycin sulfate (25 milligrams). The drug is designed for treatment of acute and chronic mastitis in lactating cows. Masti-Kure Products Company, Inc., producer of the drug, petitions this court to set aside the Deputy Commissioner\u2019s order. <em>See 21 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 360b(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-5\">A. <em>The Statutory and Regulatory Framework</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1163-6\">The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) prohibits the marketing in interstate commerce of any new animal drug<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> unless an NADA for the drug has been approved. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 360b(a)(l)(A), 351(a)(5), 331(a). The Act states that the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may withdraw approval of an NADA if he finds \u201con the basis of new information before him with respect to such drug, evaluated together with the evidence available to him when the application was approved, that there is a lack of substantial evidence that such drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling thereof . . . .\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360b(e)(l)(C). The Act defines \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d to mean;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Auib\">evidence consisting of adequate and well-controlled investigations, including field investigation, by experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug involved, on the basis of which it could fairly and reasonably be concluded by such experts that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling or proposed labeling thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdCx\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360b(d)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-13\">FDA has promulgated regulations implementing this statutory scheme. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 371(a); 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.1(a)(1) (1977). It has required that for a fixed combination new animal drug such as that covered by NADA 65-381, substantial evidence must be provided both that the drug is effective for its intended use and that \u201c[e]ach ingredient designated as active\u201d contributes to the claimed effects. 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 514.-l(b)(8)(v) (1977). In addition, FDA has by regulation set out standards for \u201cadequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1102\">*1102</page-number>and well-controlled investigations\u201d acceptable as substantial evidence of effectiveness.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1164-4\">When the Commissioner determines, on the basis of new information before him, that an approved NADA lacks substantial evidence of effectiveness, FDA regulations require him to notify the holder of the NADA in writing and \u201cafford an opportunity for a hearing on a proposal to withdraw approval of such application.\u201d 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 514.115(b) (1977). <em>Cf. </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360b(e)(l). FDA has developed summary judgment procedures, however, to be used when the holder of an NADA fails to submit substantial evidence of drug effectiveness sufficient on its face to meet regulatory standards.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has in principle approved such procedures, stating that, \u201c[w]e cannot impute to Congress the design of requiring, nor does due process demand, a hearing when it appears conclusively from the applicant\u2019s \u2018pleadings\u2019 that the application cannot succeed.\u201d <em>Weinber-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1103\">*1103</page-number><em>ger v.

The notice stated there were insufficient data to demonstrate that the ingredients of NADA 65-381 were effective in accordance with the requirements for fixed combination drugs as set forth in 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 514.1(b)(8)(v) (1977).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Masti-Kure thereupon requested a hearing and submitted data purporting to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug covered by NADA 65-381. Joint Appendix (J.A.) at 160. On March 5, 1975, FDA served upon Masti-Kure a proposed order analyzing Masti-Kure\u2019s submission and concluding that summary judgment should be instituted since the data submitted failed on its face to meet regulatory standards. J.A. at 684. Masti-Kure was given sixty days \u201cto respond with sufficient data, information, and analyses to demonstrate that there is a genuine and substantial issue of fact which justifies a hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Masti-Kure responded on May 9 with a revised evidentia-ry submission. FDA concluded, however, that the deficiencies in the data were un-remedied, and, on February 17, 1976, issued its final order withdrawing approval of NADA 65-381 and denying Masti-Kure\u2019s request for a hearing. 41 Fed.Reg. 7141 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-5\">II. THE APPROPRIATENESS OF SUMMARY JUDGMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-6\">The drug covered by NADA 65-381 is a combination antibiotic containing penicillin and neomycin. It is designed to treat mastitis in lactating cows. Masti-Kure\u2019s rationale for combining penicillin and neomycin in a single drug is that bovine mastitis is an infectious disease that results from pathogenic microorganisms, principally <em>Streptococcus agalactiae </em>(strep) and <em>Staphylococcus aureus </em>(staph). Although penicillin is usually effective in eliminating the infection caused by strep, it is sometimes ineffective against staph, which is known to produce an enzyme capable of destroying penicillin. Neomycin, it is postulated, is usually effective against staph, although not against strep. In actual field use, infecting organisms are not identified and the susceptibility patterns not determined before commencing treatment of mastitis. Use of penicillin or neomycin alone, therefore, will produce treatment failures in cows infected with organisms resistant to the drug used. Combining the drugs will result in fewer failures, because an infection resistant to one may respond to the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-10\">To substantiate that the drug covered by NADA 65-381 is thus effective under the combination drug policy, <em>21 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 514.-l(b)(8)(v) (1977), Masti-Kure must demonstrate the validity of two assumptions. First, it must show that the combination of penicillin and neomycin is more effective in treating staph infections than is penicillin alone. Second, and more critical, it must show that in a population of cows with bacteriologically uncharacterized mastitis infections \u2014 which is the intended patient population under Masti-Kure\u2019s rationale\u2014 there exists a statistically significant proportion of infections that are resistant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1104\">*1104</page-number>one of NADA 65-381\u2019s two ingredients but susceptible to the other (or that the combination for any reason cures more infections than does either of its components alone). <em>See </em>41 Fed.Reg. at 7142.</p>\n<p id=\"b1166-4\">Masti-Kure must demonstrate the validity of these two assumptions through \u201cevidence consisting of adequate and well-controlled investigations, <em>including field investigation . </em>. . .\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360b(d)(3) (emphasis added). Masti-Kure submitted to FDA two field investigations, one conducted in 1973, and one in 1974. Applying its regulatory criteria of adequate and well-controlled investigations, <em>supra </em>note 2, FDA found numerous deficiencies in both studies. Should we find each study to be conclusively deficient with respect to even a single regulatory standard, we must sustain FDA\u2019s February 17, 1976 order.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ak9-dedup-0\">Our inquiry is controlled by <em>Weinberger v. Hynson, Westcott &amp; Dunning, </em>412 U.S. 609, 93 S.Ct. 2469, 37 L.Ed.2d 207 (1973). In that case the Supreme Court examined FDA regulations specifying standards for the \u201cwell-controlled investigations\u201d required by the Act to demonstrate the efficacy of new drugs designed for human use, and concluded that they provided \u201cdrug manufacturers . . . full and precise notice of the evidence they must present to sustain their NDA\u2019s . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 622, 93 S.Ct. at 2479.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Given such specific regulations, FDA was not required to \u201cprovide a formal hearing where it is apparent at the threshold that the applicant has not tendered <em>any </em>evidence which <em>on its face </em>meets the statutory standards as particularized by the regulations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 620, 93 S.Ct. at 2478. This reasoning, of course, only applies \u201cto those regulations that are precise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 621 n. 17, 93 S.Ct. at 2479. The Court offered as an example of a \u201cpre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1105\">*1105</page-number>cise\u201d regulation 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.-lll(a)(5)(ii)(a)(5) (1977), which provides that the plan or protocol for a study must include a \u201csummary of the methods of analysis and an evaluation of data derived from the study, including any appropriate statistical methods.\u201d <em>Compare </em>21 C.F.R. \u00a7 514.-111(a)(5)(iv) (1977), <em>supra </em>note 2. The Court stated that \u201c[a] mere reading of the study submitted will indicate whether the study is totally deficient in this regard.\u201d 412 U.S. at 621 n. 17, 93 S.Ct. at 2479.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although we have elsewhere noted that the FDA regulations defining \u201cwell-controlled investigations\u201d cannot be categorically classified as precise or imprecise, <em>Cooper Laboratories, Inc. v. FDA, </em>163 U.S.App.D.C. 212, 220, 501 F.2d 772, 780 (1974), we conclude in this case that, since Masti-Kure\u2019s field investigations violate manifestly clear regulations, FDA must be sustained in its order of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-6\">In its 1973 study Masti-Kure infected cows with mastitis caused by both strep and staph. Approximately 20% of the infected cows were randomly selected to serve as no-treatment controls. The remaining cows were treated by the drug covered by NADA 65-381. FDA\u2019s criticism of this study was that it logically proved only that treatment by the drug covered by NADA 65-381 was more effective than doing nothing, and thus that it failed utterly to demonstrate whether the combination drug was more effective than either penicillin or neomycin alone, as required by 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 514.1(b)(8)(v) (1977). According to regulatory standards, the latter conclusion can be demonstrated only by comparing the effect of the drug covered by NADA 65-381 on a test population against the effect on control populations of neomycin and penicillin. <em>See </em>21 C.F.R. \u00a7 514.111(a)(5)(vi), <em>supra </em>note 2. The regulatory requirement that a \u201cwell-controlled investigation\u201d include a control group is precise, and since Masti-Kure completely failed to comply with it, we sustain FDA\u2019s finding that the 1973 study is conclusively \u201cinadequate or uncontrolled in light of the pertinent regulations.\u201d <em>Weinberger v. Hynson, Westcott &amp; Dunning, </em>412 U.S. 609, 622, 93 S.Ct. 2469, 2479, 37 L.Ed.2d 207 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1167-13\">In its 1974 field investigation, Masti-Kure combined the results of experiments on three separate herds: the Harvey herd, the Cleveland herd, and the Reeves herd. Parts of the udders (quarters) of the cows in these three herds were infected with staph and strep.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> All quarters treated in the Harvey and Cleveland herds were treated with penicillin, 100,000 units.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In the Reeves herd tests were conducted using both the drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1106\">*1106</page-number>covered by NADA 65-381 and penicillin, 100,000 units. Those quarters in the <em>Reeves </em>herd which were infected with strep and which were treated with penicillin demonstrated a cure rate of 28/30.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Those infected with strep and treated with the experimental drug demonstrated a 35/36 cure rate. The cure rates for quarters in the Reeves herd infected with staph, however, were 3/5 for penicillin and 1/2 for the drug covered by NADA 65-381.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1168-4\">FDA regulations require that an adequate and well-controlled investigation include a \u201cmethod of selection of the animals to be studied and those to serve as controls\u201d which \u201cprovides for . . . Assignment of the animals and control groups to test under conditions which exclude or minimize bias.\u201d 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 514.111(a)(5)(ii)(b), <em>supra </em>note 2. In addition FDA regulations require such an investigation to include \u201c[a] description of the steps taken to document comparability of variables such as species, age, sex, duration, and severity of disease, management practices, and use of drugs other than those being studied.\u201d 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 514.111(a)(5)(iv), <em>supra </em>note 2. These requirements are particularly important with respect to Masti-Kure\u2019s 1974 field investigation, since the drug covered by NADA 65-381 was used only on the Reeves herd and not randomly applied to the cows studied. The test group was thus drawn exclusively from the Reeves herd, whereas the control group (insofar as effectiveness under the combination drug policy was to be demonstrated) consisted of cows drawn from all three herds. FDA notes that herds of cows are likely to differ according to important variables, such as management practices, sanitation, and general health. <em>See </em>41 Fed. Reg. at 7146. The 1974 field investigation, however, fails to provide <em>any </em>\u201cdescription of the steps taken to document comparability\u201d of test and control groups. No explanation at all was offered for the odd distribution of test animals. We conclude that the investigation\u2019s complete violation of the letter and spirit of FDA regulations renders it conclusively inadequate.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>Weinberger </em>v. <em>Hynson, Wescott &amp; Dunning, </em>412 U.S. 609, 621 n. 17, 93 S.Ct. 2469, 37 L.Ed.2d 207 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b1168-10\">Masti-Kure also attempts to combine the data of the 1973 and 1974 field studies so as to produce yet a third set of results. This procedure is unacceptable, however, because, among many other reasons, Masti-Kure has failed to provide a \u201cdescription of the steps taken to document comparability of variables\u201d among the test and control groups thus constituted. The issue is not, as Masti-Kure phrases it, whether \u201cmultiple data studies in different years\u201d is forbidden by FDA regulations, reply brief for petitioner at 22, but whether, if such multiple data studies are attempted, an adequate description of the steps taken to assure comparability is also included. Since Masti-Kure did not include such a description, we agree with FDA that pooling of the data is impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1169-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1107\">*1107</page-number>Masti-Kure submitted a third study in support of its claim for the effectiveness of the drug covered by NADA 65-381. <em>See </em>note 6 <em>supra. </em>Both in its proposed order of March 5, 1975, and in its final order of February 17, 1976, FDA characterized this third study as a clinical rather than a field investigation. Although this court is unaware of the criteria distinguishing field from clinical investigations, Masti-Kure did not contest FDA\u2019s characterization of Masti-Kure\u2019s third study in its May 9th submission to the agency, nor does Masti-Kure now dispute FDA\u2019s characterization in its briefs before this court. Therefore, since Masti-Kure failed to submit, as required by statute, any adequate and well-controlled field investigations, we conclude that FDA\u2019s order withdrawing approval from NADA 65-381 and denying a hearing must be affirmed.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1169-4\">\n<em>So Ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1163-7\">.

FDA concluded, however, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1166-8\">Masti-Kure must demonstrate, by adequate and well-controlled field investigations, that the drug covered by NADA 65-381 has the effect it is purported or represented to have under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in its labeling (21 U.S.C. 360b(d)(3)). Therefore, even if the experimental infection study met the criteria for an adequate and well-controlled investigation, and supported Masti-Kure\u2019s rationale for the combination, neither of which is the case, that study alone cannot provide the substantial evidence of effectiveness necessary to prevent withdrawal of approval of NADA 65-381. This is so not only because of the statutory requirement, but also because Masti-Kure\u2019s rationale for the combination requires it to demonstrate the existence of a naturally occurring population of mastitis infections resistant to one component and susceptible to the other, which can only be done in a field investigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1166-9\">41 Fed.Reg. at 7145. <em>See </em>21 C.F.R. \u00a7 514.-l(b)(8)(ii) (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1166-10\">. New drugs designed for human use, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(p), can be marketed only if approved new drug applications (NDA\u2019s) are on file at FDA. The reasoning and conclusions of <em>Weinberger </em>apply in full to the statutory and regulatory scheme for new animal drugs. <em>See </em>Hess <em>&amp; Clark, Division of Rhodia, Inc. v. FDA, </em>161 U.S.App.D.C. 395, 405, 495 F.2d 975, 985 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1166-15\">. We find no merit to petitioner\u2019s claim that the changing nature of FDA regulations was so confusing as to fail to provide adequate notice of regulatory requirements. <em>Compare </em>21 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 135.4a(b)(8)(v), 135.12(a)(5) (1972) <em>with </em>21 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 514.1(b)(8)(v), 514.111(a)(5) (1977). We dismiss as frivolous petitioner\u2019s contention that the phrase, \u201csubstantial evidence that such drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have,\u201d when used in FDA regulations involving withdrawal of approval of NADAs, see 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 514.-115(b)(3)(iii) (1977), does not include by reference the combination drug requirement of \u00a7 514.1(b)(8)(v). The regulations involving withdrawal of an NADA also do not reference FDA criteria for adequate and well-controlled investigations. See 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 514.111(a)(5) (1977). The Act, however, requires a demonstration of the same \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d regardless of whether FDA is contemplating approving or withdrawing an NADA. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360b(d)(3). To suggest that FDA may not refer to regulations articulating the meaning of the term \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d merely because there is no cross reference in the Code of Federal Regulations does violence to common understanding. It would result in the establishment of an incongruous double standard for determining sufficiency of data, a result for which petitioner has demonstrated no logical basis or justification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1167-7\">. The Court also noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1167-8\">Some of the regulations, however, are not precise, as they call for the exercise of discretion or subjective judgment in determining whether a study is adequate and well controlled. For example, [\u00a7 314.-lll(a)(5)(ii)(a)(2)(i)] required that the plan or protocol for the study include a method of selection of the subjects that provide <em>\u201cadequate </em>assurance that they are suitable for the purposes of the study.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The qualitative standards \u201cadequate\u201d and \u201csuitable\u201d do not lend themselves to clear-cut definition, and it may not be possible to tell from the face of a study whether the standards have been met. Thus, it might not be proper to deny a hearing on the ground that the study did not comply with this regulation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1167-10\">412 U.S. at 621 n. 17, 93 S.Ct. at 2479.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1167-11\">.

Notably, the data for the Reeves herd fail to substantiate the claim of superior effectiveness for the combination over penicillin alone in a statistically significant manner against either <em>Streptococcus agalactiae </em>or <em>Staphylococcus au-reus </em>infections.
