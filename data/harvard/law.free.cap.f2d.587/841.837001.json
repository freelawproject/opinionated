After determining the allowance to be made to plaintiff for attorney\u2019s fees in representing her individually, the District Court shall separately determine the reasonable value of the legal services rendered to, and expenses incurred by, the plaintiff in obtaining the injunction and in establishing the illegality of the company\u2019s challenged practices. In making that determination the Court shall consider the amount finally allowed to the class. In other words, if the recovery by the class is in only a small amount, an award such as was previously made by the District Court, could not be supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-19\">In all other respects, our opinion is hereby ratified, approved and confirmed. The petition for rehearing is accordingly denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
