Barlow\u2019s, </em>436 U.S. 307, 98 S.Ct. 1816, 56 L.Ed.2d 305 (1978) and <em>Camara v. Municipal Court, </em>387 U.S. 523, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 18 L.Ed.2d 930 (1967). Such inspections in response to employee complaints are required by section 8(f)(1) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 657(f)(1), (\u201cthe Act\u201d). Affirming the district court, we hold that the warrant application here was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-18\">The paragraphs of the affidavit seeking to establish probable cause state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-19\">2. On February 15, 1977, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d) received a written complaint from an employee of Northwest Airlines, Inc. This complaint alleged, in pertinent part, that violations of the Act exist which threaten physical harm to the employees, and an inspection by OSHA was requested. Based on the information in the complaint, OSHA had determined that there are reasonable grounds to believe that such violations exist, and desires to make the inspection required by section 8(f)(1) of the Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-20\">3. The desired inspection is also part of an inspection and investigation program designed to assure compliance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>the Act and is authorized by section 8(a) of the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Joint App. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">In an opinion preceding <em>Marshall v. Barlow\u2019s, supra, </em>the district court held that paragraph 2 of the affidavit failed to establish particularized probable cause because it did not provide the magistrate with the underlying factual data giving rise to the compliance officer\u2019s belief that a violation existed. Furthermore, it found that paragraph 3 failed to show that \u201creasonable legislative or administrative standards for conducting an . inspection are satisfied with respect to a particular [establishment],\u201d <em>Camara, supra </em>at 538, 87 S.Ct. at 1736, because the affidavit did not describe the inspection program or set forth the criteria employed by the Secretary in determining that this inspection was part of such a program.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\"><em>Barlow\u2019s </em>confirmed the district court\u2019s analysis that probable cause for an administrative search could be established either by (1) specific evidence of an existing violation or (2) a showing that reasonable legislative or administrative standards for conducting an inspection are satisfied with respect to a particular establishment. 98 S.Ct. at 1824.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-11\">The Secretary does not attempt to argue that his affidavit establishes specific evidence of an existing violation. Rather, he argues that section 8(f)(l)\u2019s provision for the inspection of plants from which OSHA receives an employee complaint constitutes a \u201creasonable legislative standard\u201d for conducting inspections.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-12\">The question of whether section 8(f)(1) constitutes \u201ca general administrative plan . . . derived from neutral sources,\u201d <em>Barlow\u2019s, supra </em>at 1825, should not, however, divert us from the true problem in this case, which is the total lack of any description of the \u201cinspection and investigation program\u201d referred to in paragraph 3 of the affidavit. In <em>Barlow\u2019s </em>the Supreme Court stated in reference to a warrant application virtually identical to paragraph 3 of the application in the instant case<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that \u201cthe program was not described ... or any facts presented that would indicate why an inspection of Barlow\u2019s establishment was within the program.\u201d 98 S.Ct. at 1826 n. 20. This passage makes it clear that the magistrate has two functions to perform under <em>Barlow\u2019s </em>second method of establishing probable cause: (1) He must determine that there is a reasonable legislative or administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>inspection program and (2) he must determine that the desired inspection fits within that program.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The affidavit here provides insufficient information for the magistrate to perform the first of these functions, so a <em>fortiori </em>he is unable to perform the second. Paragraph 3\u2019s bare assertion that there is an \u201cinspection and investigation program\u201d does not permit the magistrate to ascertain that there is in fact a program or what the nature of such a program might be, let alone whether it is reasonable. It is only in the Secretary\u2019s briefs that we are told the \u201cprogram\u201d of paragraph 3 refers to the alleged section 8(f)(1) \u201cprogram\u201d of inspecting pursuant to employee complaints. But the identification of the program must take place in the warrant application itself in order to enable the magistrate to perform his first function under <em>Barlow\u2019s. </em>Accordingly, we hold that the warrant application here was insufficient to support the issuance of a warrant as it failed to describe or identify the program which allegedly supported the desired inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Because of our disposition of the case we need not decide whether section 8(f)(1) constitutes the type of \u201cgeneral administrative plan for the enforcement of the Act derived from neutral sources\u201d contemplated by <em>Barlow\u2019s </em>or whether such plans fall within the definition of a \u201crule\u201d under APA \u00a7 551(4) and therefore must be adopted in conformity with the informal rule-making procedure of APA \u00a7 553. We also do not reach the issue of whether the magistrate must be presented with the substance of the employee complaint in order to fulfill his second function of determining whether the desired inspection fits within the plan or program.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">For the reasons stated, the judgment appealed from is</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b76-8\">. The district court ruled on the probable cause issue in the first instance because the United States Magistrate had accepted Northwest\u2019s argument that he lacked jurisdiction to issue a warrant to OSHA. The district court held that the magistrate did have jurisdiction but made the probable cause determination itself rather than remand the case to the magistrate. 437 F.Supp. 533 (E.D.Wis.1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b76-9\">. Section 8(f)(1) of the Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-10\">Any employees or representative of employees who believe that a violation of a safety or health standard exists that threatens physical harm, or that an imminent danger exists, may request an inspection by giving notice to the Secretary or his authorized representative of such violation or danger. Any such notice shall be reduced to writing, shall set forth with reasonable particularity the grounds for the notice, and shall be signed by the employees or representative of employees, and a copy shall be provided the employer or his agent no later than at the time of inspection, except that, upon the request of the person giving such notice, his name and the names of individual employees referred to therein shall not appear in such copy or on any record published, released, or made available pursuant to subsection (g) of this section. If upon receipt of such notification the Secretary determines there are reasonable grounds to believe that such violation or danger exists he shall make a special inspection in accordance with the provisions of this section as soon as practicable, to determine if such violation or danger exists. If the Secretary determines there are no reasonable grounds to believe that a violation or danger exists he shall notify the employees or representative of the employees in writing of such determination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-15\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 657(f)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b76-16\">.
