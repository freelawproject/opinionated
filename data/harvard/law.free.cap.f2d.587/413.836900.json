He does not claim that there was any error in the trial of Count 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">Appellant began work for Morrow in 1972 as a salesman. In 1973, he became marketing manager under a written contract that gave him a base cash salary plus a percentage, on a sliding scale, of gross sales. Nothing was said in the contract of stock purchase rights. On March 29, 1974, following contract negotiations in which stock purchase rights had been discussed, Morrow\u2019s president signed a memorandum stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-8\">\u201cTo confirm our recent conversation regarding your future employment at Morrow Electronics, the company plans the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-9\">\u201cTo revise your current employment contract and extend the agreement one year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-10\">\u201cTo add a stock purchase clause, allowing you to purchase stock for services at a total of 2%, at <em>Vz </em>of 1% per year of employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-11\">\u201cAll of this subject to the advice of Morrow Electronics\u2019 lawyer as to the best tax situation for all concerned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-12\">\u201cYour salary also will be adjusted to $1200 per month, starting April 1, 1974. \u201cI hope we will have all this in final form by May 1, 1974.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-13\">It is appellant\u2019s position that the 1973 contract, or the 1974 memorandum, or both, constituted an \u201cinvestment contract\u201d so as to bring him within the protection of the federal securities statutes. <em>Securities and Exchange Commission v. Howey Co., </em>328 U.S. 293, 66 S.Ct. 1100, 90 L.Ed. 1244 (1946), defines an investment contract as a \u201ccontract, transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.\u201d 328 U.S. 298-99, 66 S.Ct. 1103. This definition applies not only to the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77b(l)) but also to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78c(a)(10)). <em>Tcherepnin v. Knight, </em>389 U.S. 332, 88 S.Ct. 548, 19 L.Ed.2d 564 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-14\">Under the 1973 contract appellant was entitled to receive cash salary and a percentage of gross sales in return for his services. The 1974 memorandum would add stock purchase rights. It is drafted in terms of a contingency that did not occur; appellee\u2019s uncontroverted affidavit states that the company tax attorney recommended against the stock purchase plan and that it was never adopted. Appellant was terminated in July, 1974, without the \u201cfinal form\u201d (referred to in the memorandum) ever having been executed and no stock purchase plan ever having been adopted as to him or any other employee. There is no need to rule on the legal effect of the 1974 memorandum as it is clear that appellant cannot meet the requirements of the <em>Howey </em>definition. Thus, even assuming for purposes of argument that the 1974 memorandum created legal rights in appellant, it contemplated no \u201cinvestment of money\u201d by him. His only investment was of his services <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and he offers no convincing authority for the theory that his services constituted an \u201cinvestment of money\u201d because he believes he was working for less than he was worth.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Moreover, we cannot find that this arrangement complied with <em>Howey\u2019s </em>test that the plaintiff be \u201cled to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.\u201d In <em>Securities and Exchange Commission v. Glenn W. Turner Enterprises, Inc., </em>474 F.2d 476, 482-83 (9th Cir. 1973), this court adopted a liberal approach to the interpretation of the word \u201csolely\u201d as it had been used in <em>Howey. </em>In <em>Turner </em>the arrangement was one by which self improvement courses were offered to the public for an investment of money and then the investors were permitted to participate in the promotion of the courses and receive payment on a type of commission basis. We held that the scheme was no less an investment contract merely because the investor was permitted to perform those services if he chose to. We stated that \u201csolely\u201d was not to be defined literally but that it should be \u201cconstrued realistically, so as to include within the definition those schemes which involve in substance, if not [in] form, securities.\u201d Our test was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">\u201c . . . whether the efforts made by those other than the investor are the undeniably significant ones, those essential managerial efforts which affect the failure or success of the enterprise.\u201d 474 F.2d at 482.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">This case bears little analogy to <em>Turner. </em>Here appellant was himself the marketing manager of the purported \u201cpromoter\u201d. He cannot claim that he expected profits \u201csolely\u201d from the efforts of his employer and he cannot claim that his own managerial efforts were nominal and did not affect the failure or success of Morrow Electronics. The arrangement on which appellant relies cannot meet the <em>Howey </em>definition, even as broadened by <em>Turner. </em>There is no \u201cinvestment contract\u201d within the meaning of the securities acts and the district court properly granted summary judgment as to counts 1 a.nd 2 of the amended complaint. Counts 3 and 4, based on a pendant jurisdiction theory, were also properly the subject of summary judgment in the district court\u2019s discretion. <em>United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b476-15\">We do not speculate on the effect of an agreement under which the plaintiff receives a percentage of \u201cprofits\u201d rather than \u201csales\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
