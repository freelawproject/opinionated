Petitioner argues that summary judgment is inappropriate because it has presented evidence of adequate and well-controlled investigations demonstrating the effectiveness of Nylmerate for <em>Haemophi-lus vaginalis </em>vaginitis. As a second ground for relief, petitioner urges that FDA acted arbitrarily by disregarding, without explanation and without a hearing, the recommendation of the National Academy of Sciences-National Research Council (NAS-NRC) Drug Efficacy Study Group that Nyl-merate be considered \u201ceffective\u201d for treatment of <em>Haemophilus vaginalis </em>vaginitis.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Fed. Reg. 15030 (1972). We affirm the Commissioner\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-16\">It is clear that summary judgment is appropriate if petitioner has not submitted any evidence that on its face meets FDA\u2019s regulatory standards for adequate and well-controlled investigations. <em>See 21 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 355(d); 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 314.111(a)(5)(ii) (1977); <em>Weinberger v. Hynson, Wescott &amp; Dunning, </em>412 U.S. 609, 93 S.Ct. 2469, 37 L.Ed.2d 207 (1973). Holland-Rantos, however, claims to have submitted an investigation by Dr. Herman Gardner that meets FDA\u2019s regulatory standards. <em>See </em>Joint Appendix (J.A.) at A-93-A-100. The Gardner study compared Nylmerate\u2019s efficacy against that of Sultrin Cream, a drug known to be effective. <em>See 21 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 314.-lll(a)(5)(ii)(a)(4)(iii) (1977). The observed rate of remission for Sultrin Cream was 56.5%; that for Nylmerate was 27.6%. Nyl-merate thus was not shown to be as effective as Sultrin, the active control.</p>\n<p id=\"b1236-19\">Petitioner nevertheless contends that the Gardner study meets FDA regulatory standards because it is \u201cwell-controlled.\u201d We decline to interpret FDA\u2019s regulations in so self-defeating a fashion. The point of a control is to provide a basis of comparison from which the action of an experimental agent may be measured. When a well-controlled study relates an ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>perimental agent to a control that is known to be effective, it yields meaningful results only if the remission rate associated with the experimental agent is at least as high as that of the control. If the experimental agent yields a remission rate that is less than that of the control, nothing is demonstrated as to the efficacy of the experimental agent, for it cannot be inferred from the study whether that lower remission rate is any higher than what would have been achieved by no treatment or a placebo. If it is to be demonstrated that the experimental agent is more effective than no treatment or a placebo, then the agent must be compared to no treatment or a placebo in an appropriately well-controlled study. Although petitioner argues that the 27.6% remission rate observed for Nylmerate in the Gardner study proves that Nylmerate is more effective than no treatment, this conclusion has not been established by a well-controlled study. The Gardner study, while well-controlled, compared Nylmerate to Sultrin; and that comparison produced no evidence of Nylmerate\u2019s efficacy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1237-5\">We are concerned at FDA\u2019s refusal without reasons to accept the NAS-NRC panel\u2019s recommendation that Nylmerate be considered \u201ceffective\u201d in the treatment of <em>Haemophilus vaginalis </em>vaginitis. FDA\u2019s cavalier and unexplained rejection of the opinion of its expert panel strains a \u201ccornerstone requirement\u201d of the administrative process, that of \u201creasoned decision making.\u201d <em>Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, </em>147 U.S.App.D.C. 175, 182, 454 F.2d 1018, 1025 (1971). Nevertheless, in the circumstances of this case, we conclude that this behavior does not constitute sufficient grounds to set aside the Commissioner\u2019s final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-6\">In 1962 the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act was amended to prohibit the introduction into commerce of any \u201cnew drug,\u201d <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(p), without substantial evidence that the drug was effective for its intended uses. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(d). Since the amended Act required \u201caffirmative agency approval, all NDA\u2019s \u2018effective\u2019 prior to 1962 were deemed \u2018approved\u2019 under the new definition, and manufacturers were given two years to develop substantial evidence of effectiveness, during which previously approved NDA\u2019s could not be withdrawn by FDA for a drug\u2019s lack of effectiveness.\u201d <em>Weinberger v. Hynson, Wescott &amp; Dunning, </em>412 U.S. 609, 614, 93 S.Ct. 2469, 2475, 37 L.Ed.2d 207 (1973).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Faced with \u201cthe massive task of reevaluating almost all marketed drugs,\u201d <em>SmithKline Corp. v. FDA, </em>190 U.S.App.D.C.--at -, 587 F.2d 1107 at 1112 (D.C.Cir., 1978), a task hopelessly beyond FDA\u2019s administrative capabilities, FDA turned for assistance to the NAS-NRC panels, which reviewed by class the efficacy of previously marketed new drugs. <em>See </em>31 Fed. Reg. 9426 (1966). If a panel rated a drug \u201ceffective,\u201d it meant that the manufacturer of the drug was excused from the requirement of producing substantial evidence of the drug\u2019s effectiveness; any other rating meant that the manufacturer had to submit the adequate and well-controlled investigations required by the Act. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(d). The recommendations of the NAS-NRC panels are advisory in nature. <em>See Upjohn Co. v. Finch, </em>422 F.2d 944, 948 (6th Cir. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b1237-12\">In these circumstances any remedy this court might afford petitioners would be futile. FDA\u2019s decision not to accept the NAS-NRC panel\u2019s rating of \u201ceffective\u201d was essentially a judgment that petitioner had not yet offered substantial evidence of Nylmerate\u2019s effectiveness and should be put to its proof, as the statute affirmatively required. Subsequent events have vindicated this judgment, since petitioner has been unable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>to produce the necessary adequate and well-controlled studies. It would constitute the most arid formalism for this court to remand this case to FDA to require it to state what has since become obvious; namely, its reasons for concluding that, contrary to the recommendation of the NAS-NRC panel, petitioner had not yet demonstrated the effectiveness of Nylmerate under statutory standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-4\">The order of the Commissioner is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b1238-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1236-14\">. Petitioner also urges that FDA\u2019s Notice of Opportunity for Hearing, <em>see </em>38 Fed. Reg. 22994 (1973), was fatally deficient because it failed to reveal the basis for the agency\u2019s less than \u201ceffective\u201d classification of Nylmerate. We reject this contention. FDA\u2019s Notice clearly stated that its reason for proposing to withdraw approval of Nylmerate\u2019s NDA was that there was a lack of \u201csubstantial evidence of effectiveness for the various labeled indications.\u201d FDA can reach this conclusion on the basis of a reevaluation of existing research data. <em>See Bell </em>v. <em>Goddard, </em>366 F.2d 177, 181 (7th Cir. 1966). Under these circumstances, we consider the Notice sufficiently specific to inform petitioner of the grounds of the proposed withdrawal. <em>See Weinberger v. Hynson, Wescott &amp; Dunning, </em>412 U.S. 609, 622, 93 S.Ct. 2469, 37 L.Ed.2d 207 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1237-7\">. Petitioner urges that the 27.6% cure rate is significant because <em>Haemophilus vaginalis </em>va-ginitis does not resolve spontaneously. Whether or not <em>Haemophilus vaginalis </em>vaginitis resolves spontaneously, however, is irrelevant to the pertinent legal conclusion, which is that the effectiveness of Nylmerate has not been demonstrated by any adequate and well-controlled investigations which on their face meet FDA\u2019s regulatory criteria.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1237-16\">. The NDA for Nylmerate was first approved on July 17, 1945.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
