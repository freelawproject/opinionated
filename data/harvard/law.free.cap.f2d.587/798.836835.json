He received a prison sentence totaling twenty-five years. He then filed a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 to vacate his sentence, which the district court denied. Wheat appeals the denial of his motion, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-24\">Wheat contends that the sentencing judge erred in relying on a false presen-tencing report that stated that Wheat had been arrested on sixty separate occasions prior to his conviction. He also asserts that he cannot be convicted of both forging and uttering a stolen check. He contends that the district court erred in failing to hold a hearing to resolve the factual issues underlying his \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-25\">We have examined each of Wheat\u2019s assignments of error and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-26\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
