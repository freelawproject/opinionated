There is also a cross-appeal from the order of the district court denying a motion of appellees to amend the findings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court judgment was contrary to the ruling of the bankruptcy court which held the debt dis-chargeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-19\">After a careful review of the record and the briefs of counsel, it is our opinion that the trial judge correctly concluded that the state court judgment debt owing by appellant to appellees was non-dischargeable under the fraud provisions of \u00a7 17(a)(2) and \u00a7 17(a)(4) for the reasons stated in his opinion. <em>In Re Stanley G. Harris; Inahara, et al. v. Harris, </em>458 F.Supp. 238 (D.Or.1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b514-14\">. 17(a)(2) and (4) of the Bankruptcy Act is found at 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 35(a)(2) and (4) and reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-15\">(a) A discharge in bankruptcy shall release a bankrupt from all of his provable debts, whether allowable in full or in part, except such as . (2) are liabilities for obtaining money or property by false pretenses or false representations, or for wilful and malicious injuries to the person or property of another . (4) or were created by his fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation or defalcation while acting as an officer or in any fiduciary capacity; .</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b514-23\">. The district court, in finding that appellees\u2019 state court judgment debt was non-dischargea-ble under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 35(a)(2), addresses only the fraud section, i. e., the \u201cfalse pretenses or false representations\u201d section. The district court did not rely upon or make any findings regarding the \u201cwilful and malicious injuries\u201d portion. The appellees\u2019 motion, requesting that the district court make findings in this regard, was denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
