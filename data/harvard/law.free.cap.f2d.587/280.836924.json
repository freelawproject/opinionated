Johnston were agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and stationed at Dayton. On this date the two agents got into an argument and, without trying to detail the progress of it, Johnston discharged his gun and injured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>the appellant. The appellant then shot Johnston and mortally wounded him. A federal grand jury investigated the incident but declined to return an indictment against the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">As a result of this shooting incident, the sequence of events as affecting the appellant are as follows: On April 8, 1975, the appellant was first removed from his duties because of the killing of Johnston and the adverse publicity to the Bureau. On July 31, 1975, the Civil Service Commission found the removal fatally defective as lacking in specificity. The ATF was ordered to restore the appellant to his former position, grade and salary, retroactive to the date of his removal. The ATF, however, advised that the appellant would be removed from active duty upon return to his position. Under such circumstances the appellant chose to accept reinstatement but in the status of being on leave without pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">On October 24, 1975, the appellant was again removed from his position in the ATF for the same reasons given in the first removal, in addition to the reason that appellant allegedly exhibited a lack of good judgment in continuing a hostile confrontation. On February 2,1976, the Civil Service Commission again ordered that the appellant be restored to his former position, grade and salary. The ATF was given thirty (30) days to comply with the Commission\u2019s order, but did not restore appellant to active duty until March 8, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">During the pendency of the Civil Service proceedings relative to appellant\u2019s second removal, the appellant herein filed his action on December 15, 1975, in the district court. In his complaint he sought reinstatement to active duty, full allowance of back pay, an order to the United States Postal Service enjoining it from withholding documents requested by the appellant under the Freedom of Information Act and an allowance of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">The district judge granted reinstatement to active duty with full back pay, denied that the appellant was entitled to any more documents under the Freedom of Information Act and allowed attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $5,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">The questions on the appeals challenge whether full back compensation has been paid, whether it was proper to allow attorney\u2019s fees to the appellant and whether the court erred in denying the appellant\u2019s request for documents under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">The appellant' denies the government\u2019s claim that full back compensation has been paid. We have insufficient evidence in the record before us from which we can determine the amount of back pay due to the appellant to compensate him for all periods of time during which he was deprived of active duty status. We therefore remand the case to the district court to conduct a hearing and determine the amount of back pay due the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">With reference to attorney\u2019s fees, the trial judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-12\">\u201cThe Court notes with concern ATF\u2019s recalcitrant conduct in this matter and defiance of orderly administrative procedures. Such conduct by an enforcement agency of the United States has implications far beyond the limits of this case. It may well be that it has reached the level of bad faith and vexaciousness (sic) justifying an award of attorney fees to the plaintiff. See <em>Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, </em>421 U.S. 240, 95 S.Ct. 1612, 44 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975); <em>U. S. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>522 F.2d 962, 967 (6th Cir. 1975); <em>Smoot v. Fox, </em>353 F.2d 830, 832 (6th Cir. 1965). Accordingly, defendant is hereby ordered to show cause why reasonable attorney fees should not be awarded the plaintiff in this matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-b\">Subsequently, the court ordered the appel-lees to pay attorney\u2019s fees in the amount of $5,000. We conclude that in the absence of statutory authority attorney fees are not allowed against the government even though bad faith may have been involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-13\">We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-14\">Section 2412, Title 28, U.S.C. provides in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-15\">\u201cExcept as otherwise specifically provided by statute, a judgment for costs, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>enumerated in section 1920 of this title <em>but not including the fees and expenses of attorneys </em>may be awarded to the prevailing party in any civil action brought by or against the United States or any agency or official of the United States acting in his official capacity, in any court having jurisdiction of such action.\u201d (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">This statute then precludes the award of attorney\u2019s fees to a prevailing party in an action against the United States or any agency or official thereof, even though the prevailing party may recover his costs as provided in Section 1920, Title 28 U.S.C. Accordingly, attorney\u2019s fees may not be awarded to a prevailing party in such litigation even as costs since, as stated by this court,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">\u201c * * * it seems basic that if a party is immune from an award of attorneys\u2019 fees as such, that immunity is not altered by taxing the fees as part of the costs. If the award is void on one form, it is void in the other.\u201d <em>Jordon </em>v. <em>Gilligan, </em>500 F.2d 701, 705 (6th Cir. 1974); <em>cert. den. </em>421 U.S. 991, 95 S.Ct. 1996,44 L.Ed.2d 481 (1975).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Appellant argues, however, that an exception to the statutory language should be made in this case in view of the district court\u2019s finding of vexatious, bad faith conduct on the part of defendants. It is true that federal courts, in the exercise of their equitable powers, may award attorney\u2019s fees when the interests of justice so require. <em>Hall v. Cole, </em>412 U.S. 1, 4, 93 S.Ct. 1943, 36 L.Ed.2d 702 (1973). More recently, the Supreme Court in <em>Alyeska Pipeline Co. v. Wilderness Society, </em>421 U.S. 240, at 258-259, 95 S.Ct. 1612, at 1622, 44 L.Ed.2d 141<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (1975), noted that attorney\u2019s fees may be awarded by a federal court where \u201cthe losing party has \u2018acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">As stated by the court in <em>Rhode Island Com. on Energy v. General Services, </em>561 F.2d 397, at 405 (1st Cir. 1977),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-9\">\u201c * * * the (Supreme) Court there was discussing, <em>(Alyeska Pipeline Co. v. Wilderness Society) </em>in the context of an award of attorney\u2019s fees against a private party, the \u2018bad faith\u2019 exception to the \u2018American rule\u2019 that attorney\u2019s fees are not to be awarded to a prevailing party. The Court nowhere suggested that \u00a7 2412\u2019s prohibition of attorney\u2019s fees contained, by implication, a bad faith exception. Later in its opinion, the Court rejected the suggestion that a \u2018private attorney general\u2019 exception existed to \u00a7 2412, which \u2018on its face, and in light of its legislative history, generally bars such awards, which, if allowable at all, must be expressly provided for by statute <em>f if</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-11\">Appellant has not referred this court to any such authorizing statute nor has this court discovered any in its own research, which expressly provides for the award of attorney\u2019s fees in litigation such as is now before the court. As stated by the court in <em>Rhode Island Com. on Energy, supra, </em>at 405,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-12\">\u201cBy its literal terms, \u00a7 2412 admits of no judicially fashioned \u2018bad faith\u2019 exception. Only exceptions \u2018specifically provided by statute\u2019 will subject the United States or its agencies to liability for attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-13\">Section 2412, being a limited waiver of sovereign immunity, its</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1x\">\u201climitations and conditions * * * must be strictly observed and exceptions thereto are not to be implied.\u201d <em>Soriano v. United States, </em>352 U.S. 270, 276, 77 S.Ct. 269, 273, 1 L.Ed.2d 306 (1957).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-15\">We conclude that the district court erred in allowing attorney\u2019s fees against the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-16\">One of the claims of the appellant is that the district court erred in not enjoining the Postal Service from withholding documents requested by him under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>In <em>Hawkes v. Internal Revenue Service, </em>467 F.2d 787, at 791 (6th Cir. 1972), the Court quoted Chief Judge Bazelon of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia as stating the purpose of the Act as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\">\u201cThe legislative history establishes that the primary purpose of the Freedom of Information Act was to increase the citizen\u2019s access to government records.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Agv\">We examine the record of this case then, having in mind this legislative purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"A57\">With respect to appellant\u2019s request for documents of the United States Postal Service pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, the district judge ruled that the documents, unedited copies of which the court did not examine <em>in camera </em>were exempt from disclosure. The documents had been gathered by the Postal Service in connection with an investigation into a mail fraud scheme in which appellant alleged in his complaint other agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms had participated. Appellant alleged that although he expressed his belief that the scheme was unlawful to his superior at the Bureau, the Bureau took no action. Instead, according to appellant, the Bureau\u2019s concern about the complicity of some of its staff in the scheme becoming public knowledge was an \u201cunderlying reason\u201d for the Bureau\u2019s dismissal of appellant. Hence, in addition to seeking reinstatement and back-pay in this action, appellant also requested disclosure, pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552 of \u201ccopies of all documents, including statement and interview notes and memoranda, in connection with (the United States Postal Service) investigation into this chain letter scheme in violation of the mail fraud statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">The district judge reasoned that the documents were exempt from disclosure pursuant to Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3) and Title 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 410(c)(6). Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3) provides that disclosure of documents is not required if such documents are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1bl\">\u201c * * * specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than section 552(b) of this title) provided that such statute (A) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (B) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld;\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-13\">The district judge reasoned further that the documents requested by appellant were specifically exempted from disclosure by Title 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 410(c)(6), which provides that the United States Postal Service\u2019s disclosure is not required of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5c\">\u201c * * * investigatory files, whether or not considered closed, compiled for law enforcement purposes except to the extent available by law to a party other than the Postal Service.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-15\">The district judge said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-16\">\u201cThe unqualified exemption of investigatory materials under 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 410(c)(6) is comparable to the exemption set forth in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7) before it was narrowed by amendment in 1974. (Public L. 93-502, enacted November 21, 1974) Had Congress meant to narrow 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 410(c)(6) as well, it would have done so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-17\">In support of his statutory interpretations, the district judge cited <em>Administrator, FAA v. Robertson, </em>422 U.S. 255, 95 S.Ct. 2140, 45 L.Ed.2d 164 (1972). While <em>Robertson </em>does reflect an expansive judicial interpretation of the phrase \u201cspecifically exempted from disclosure by statute\u201d contained in Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3), that statute was subsequently amended by Pub.L. 94-409, enacted <em>September 13, 1976, </em>to set forth the conditions (A) and (B) which a statute must meet in order to be held to be one specifically exempting disclosure within the meaning of Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3). Although now in effect, the statute did not become effective until 180 days after its enactment and was, therefore, not in effect on <em>November 5, 1976 </em>when the order now before this court was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-18\">Yet, legislative history of the amendment makes it clear that Congress intended the amendment of \u00a7 552(b)(3)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>\u201c * * * to <em>overrule </em>the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Administrator, FAA v. Robertson, </em>422 U.S. 255, 95 S.Ct. 2140, 45 L.Ed.2d 164 (1972).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-5\">\u201cBelieving that the decision misconceives the intent of exemption (3), the committee recommends that the exemption be amended to exempt only material required to be withheld from the public by any statute <em>establishing particular criteria or referring to particular types of information.\u201d </em>H.R.Rep. No. 94-880, 94th Cong. 2d Sess. (1976), reprinted in 3 U.S. Code Cong, and Admin.News 2183, at 2205. (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">In addition, in the discussion of the amendment in the final Conference Report, it is stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-7\">\u201cThe conferees intend this language to overrule the decision of the Supreme Court in <em>Administrator, FAA </em>v. <em>Robertson </em>422 U.S. 255, 95 S.Ct. 2140,45 L.Ed.2d 164 (1975) * * * \u201d H.R.Rep. No. 94-1441, 94th Cong. 2d Sess. (1976), reprinted in 3 U.S.Code Cong, and Admin.News 2244, at 2260.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">It is clear then, as stated by the court in <em>Phillippi v. Central Intelligence Agency, </em>178 U.S.App.D.C. 243, at 245-246, n. 4, 546 F.2d 1009, at 1011-1012, fn. 4 (1976),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-9\">\u201cThis latest amendment (to Section 552(b)(3)) shows plainly that Congress is determined that the exemptions to the FOIA should be interpreted narrowly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">The district judge\u2019s reliance upon <em>Robertson </em>in this case makes it apparent that the court decided appellant\u2019s claim on the basis of Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3) as in effect at the time of the court\u2019s order. In view of authority cited herein, however, establishing the intent of Congress to overrule <em>Robertson </em>through amending that statute in a manner now in effect, remand of this action to the district court is necessary for that court to determine whether 39 U.S.C. \u00a7 410(c)(6) qualifies as an exempting statute within Title 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(3), as amended.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b344-8\">.
