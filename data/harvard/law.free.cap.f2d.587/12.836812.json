His conviction was affirmed by this court on appeal, but the Supreme Court of the United States vacated and remanded. <em>Haddad v. United States, </em>434 U.S. 1057, 98 S.Ct. 1226, 55 L.Ed.2d 758 (1978). Following remand this court ordered that appellant be furnished a complete trial transcript and be permitted to file a supplemental brief. The case is now before the court on the supplemental briefs of the parties, oral argument having been waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-22\">The only issue raised in the supplemental brief is that the evidence produced at trial failed to establish the existence of a conspiracy and that the district court should have granted appellant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-23\">Upon examination of the record on appeal the court concludes that there was sufficient competent evidence from which the jury could find the existence of the necessary agreement between the parties which is the basis of the conspiracy charge. The jury was justified in finding from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the activities of defendant-appellant and other parties established more than mere association.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-24\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
