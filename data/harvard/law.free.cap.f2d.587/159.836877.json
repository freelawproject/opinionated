Originally filed on November 12,1973, in the Northern District of Texas under the caption <em>King Arts Theatre, Inc. v. McCrea, </em>it was subsequently consolidated by the Chief Judge of this Court with other obscenity cases pending before a three-judge court sitting in the Southern District of Texas. That court had initially been constituted to hear a single case, <em>Universal Amusement Co. v. Vance, </em>the caption of which graces this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-17\">The consolidated cases eventually mushroomed to twenty, and the three-judge court selected for trial three representative cases: <em>King Arts Theatre, Inc. v. McCrea, Dexter v. Butler, </em>and <em>Ellwest Stereo Thea-tre, Inc. v. Byrd. </em>The district court\u2019s opinion is reported under the caption <em>Universal Amusement Co. v. Vance, </em>404 F.Supp. 33 (S.D.Tex.1975). A panel of this Court affirmed the district court\u2019s decision in <em>Dexter </em>but reversed its ruling in <em>King Arts Universal Amusement Co. v. Vance, </em>559 F.2d 1286 (5 Cir. 1977). The <em>Ellwest Stereo </em>case was not appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-18\">This court ordered the two cases reheard <em>en banc </em>and subsequently severed and renumbered them, although both will continue to carry the <em>Universal Amusement </em>caption. This opinion thus treats only the appeal in <em>King Arts, </em>No. 75-4312,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and for the reasons stated below, we reverse the panel and affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-19\">The facts can be briefly summarized. In 1973, King Arts Theatre, Inc. was operating an indoor, adults-only motion picture thea-tre in San Angelo, Texas, that showed sexually explicit films. On October 30 of that year, the landlord from whom the theater building was rented gave notice to King Arts that its lease was to be terminated as of November 15. According to the notice, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>County Attorney George E. McCrea had informed the landlord that he intended to obtain an injunction to abate the theater as a public nuisance in order to prohibit the future showing of allegedly obscene motion pictures.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">King Arts filed suit on November 12 in the Northern District of Texas seeking in-junctive and declaratory relief from any action by the county attorney under the Texas nuisance statutes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The case was then transferred to the three-judge court, and the parties agreed to maintain the status quo until the case could be decided. The district court found that the landlord was terminating King Arts\u2019 lease \u201cat the suggestion\u201d of the county attorney, and that he intended to seek an injunction based on the nuisance statutes and to pursue cancellation of the lease.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The district court concluded that <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), did not preclude granting the requested relief since no prosecution \u2014 either civil or criminal \u2014 was pending. It also found that a proceeding under the nuisance statutes would not cause irreparable injury and, accordingly, declined to grant injunctive relief. Reaching the merits of King Arts\u2019 claims, the court held that Texas courts would construe the phrase \u201cobscene material\u201d in the applicable Texas nuisance statute as the phrase was defined in the state\u2019s penal code and upheld that definition against a claim of unconstitutional vagueness. However, the court held that the Texas nuisance statutes, construed together, constituted an unconstitutional pri- or restraint on the distribution of materials not yet judicially determined to be obscene. In addition, the court expressed serious doubts about the validity of the Texas injunction procedures as applied in the obscenity context.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">The state of Texas<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> appealed from the district court\u2019s judgment that the nuisance statutes were unconstitutional. King Arts did not appeal from the court\u2019s denial of injunctive relief or its upholding of the state\u2019s obscenity definition. Because this is an appeal from the grant of declaratory relief alone, the Supreme Court is without jurisdiction to hear a direct appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1253, and the appeal is properly before this Court. <em>Gerstein v. Coe, </em>417 U.S. 279, 94 S.Ct. 2246, 41 L.Ed.2d 68 (1974); <em>Beal v. Doe, </em>432 U.S. 438, 443, 97 S.Ct. 2366, 53 L.Ed.2d 464 n.5 (1977).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-15\">The only issue on appeal<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is the constitutionality of the Texas nuisance stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>utes as applied to obscenity, although this question requires three separate but related inquiries. At the outset, we stress that while obscenity is not within the purview of the first amendment, <em>Roth v. United States, </em>354 U.S. 476, 485, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (1957), state regulation must not be permitted to impinge upon \u201cspeech that matters.\u201d Justice Brennan eloquently expressed this important concept in <em>Bantam Books, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>372 U.S. 58, 83 S.Ct. 631, 9 L.Ed.2d 584 (1963):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-4\">[T]he Fourteenth Amendment requires that regulation by the States of obscenity conform to procedures that will ensure against the curtailment of constitutionally protected expression, which is often separated from obscenity only by a dim and uncertain line. It is characteristic of the freedoms of expression in general that they are vulnerable to gravely damaging yet barely visible encroachments. Our insistence that regulations of obscenity scrupulously embody the most rigorous procedural safeguards is therefore but a special instance of the larger principle that the freedoms of expression must be ringed about with adequate bulwarks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANR6\">\u201c[T]he line between speech unconditionally guaranteed and speech which may legitimately be regulated ... is finely drawn. . . . The separation of legitimate from illegitimate speech calls for . . . sensitive tools.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 66, 83 S.Ct. at 637 [citations and internal quotations omitted].<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">Our initial concern is whether the Texas statutory scheme operates as an unconstitutional prior restraint by allowing the state to close, for one year, an establishment that has exhibited obscene films or sold obscene printed matter. Although the instant case involves motion pictures, our analysis is equally applicable to printed material.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">Article 4666 of the Texas Revised Civil Statutes <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> provides for suits in the name of the state to enjoin a nuisance. If an establishment is deemed a nuisance, there exists the rather Draconian remedy of closing the establishment \u201cfor one year from the date of said judgment,\u201d unless the operator posts a penal bond ranging from $1,000 to $5,000 against future violations of the nuisance laws. Article 4664<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> defines three types of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>establishments as \u201ccommon nuisances,\u201d and the proprietor of such an establishment is guilty of \u201cmaintaining a nuisance\u201d: gambling houses, houses of prostitution, and places where intoxicating liquors are illegally kept, manufactured, sold, or given away.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Article 4667<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> defines the commercial manufacture, distribution, or exhibition of obscene material as a \u201cpublic nuisance\u201d and also sets forth a list of other nuisances, including gambling, prostitution, and bull fighting. The statute further provides that such activities \u201cshall be enjoined at the suit of either the State or any citizen thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The Texas courts have not examined the relationship between Articles 4666 and 4667. <em>Compare State ex rel. Ewing v. \u201cWithout a Stitch,\u201d </em>37 Ohio St.2d 95, 307 N.E.2d 911, 917-18 (1974), <em>app. dism\u2019d, </em>421 U.S. 923, 95 S.Ct. 1649, 44 L.Ed.2d 82 (1975) (interpreting one-year closing provision of state nuisance statute). The plain language of the statutes suggests that obscenity, which is defined as a nuisance under Art. 4667, is thus subject to the one-year closing provisions of Art. 4666. So read, the statutes would be patently unconstitutional insofar as they pertain to obscenity.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-15\">A prior restraint of expression comes before this court with \u201ca heavy presumption against its constitutional validity.\u201d <em>Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, supra </em>372 U.S. at 70, 83 S.Ct. at p. 639; <em>New York Times Co. v. United States, </em>403 U.S. 713, 714, 91 S.Ct. 2140, 29 L.Ed.2d 822 (1971). Read together, Articles 4666 and 4667 clearly create a prior restraint. The statutes allow the state to close, for one year, a theatre that has exhibited obscene films. Unless a bond from $1,000 to $5,000 is posted, the showing of <em>any </em>motion picture is punishable by contempt of court. Thus, future conduct that may fall within the purview of the first amendment is absolutely prohibited after a finding of unprotected present conduct. It was precisely this practice that was condemned by the Supreme Court in the landmark case of <em>Near v. Minnesota, </em>283 U.S. 697, 51 S.Ct. 625, 75 L.Ed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>1357 (1931). Moreover, although a theater operator may post the bond and show films, he forfeits that bond if one of the films he has selected is deemed obscene. This statutory scheme obviously encourages a theater operator to steer wide of the danger zone by avoiding borderline films that are nonetheless protected under the first amendment. The line between obscenity and protected speech is \u201cdim and uncertain,\u201d <em>Bantam Books, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, supra </em>372 U.S. at 66,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> 83 S.Ct. 631, and difficulty in locating that line leads to self-censorship, a particularly subtle and most insidious form of the malady. <em>Cf. New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964) (defamation).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Application of the one-year closing provisions in obscenity cases under the Texas nuisance statutes would constitute an impermissible prior restraint, since the state would be \u201cenjoin[ing] the future operation of a [business] which disseminates presumptively First Amendment protected materials solely on the basis of the nature of the materials which were sold ... in the past.\u201d <em>Speight v. Slaton, </em>356 F.Supp. 1101, 1107 (N.D.Ga.1973) (Morgan, J., dissenting), <em>vacated and remanded, </em>415 U.S. 333, 94 S.Ct. 1098, 39 L.Ed.2d 367 (1974). Many courts have so held.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">However, the federal courts should refrain from passing upon a constitutional question if there is an alternative ground such as statutory construction upon which the case may be decided. <em>Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, </em>297 U.S. 288, 347, 56 S.Ct. 466, 80 L.Ed. 688 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring); <em>Pugh v. Rainwater, </em>572 F.2d 1053, 1058 (5 Cir. 1978) (en banc). Accordingly, we hold that the one-year closing remedy provided in Article 4666 is inapplicable to obscenity and that the injunctive remedy provided in Article 4667 is the exclusive procedure for abating obscene exhibitions as nuisances. Thus, the one-year abatement procedure can be applied in cases of gambling, prostitution, and liquor law violations, all of which are defined as nuisances in Article 4664, but not in cases of obscenity, bull fighting, and live sex shows, which are covered only by Article 4667. This reading of the statutes, while somewhat strained,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> is not implausible, given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>the fact that Articles 4664 \u2014 66 were enacted in one bill, prior to enactment of Article 4667, and that Article 4667 did not contain the term \u201cnuisance\u201d until its amendment in 1973. <em>See </em>559 F.2d at 1291 (panel opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">King Arts also urges that the injunction permitted <em>by </em>Article 4667(a)(3) is constitutionally deficient because the state can obtain an injunction that prohibits the future showing of various unnamed \u201cobscene\u201d films. The district court hinted its agreement but did not discuss the matter at length in view of its disposition of the case. The panel, however, determined that the injunctive procedure was \u201cbasically sound.\u201d 559 F.2d at 1292.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Wholly apart from first amendment considerations, such a broadly drawn injunction would be invalid under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, which require that the injunctive order \u201cbe specific in terms\u201d and \u201cdescribe in reasonable detail . the act or acts sought to be restrained . .\u201d Rule 683, Tex.R.Civ.P. As the Texas Supreme Court explained in <em>Villalabos v. Holquin, </em>146 Tex. 474, 208 S.W.2d 871, 875 (1948):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">[A]n injunction decree must be as definite, clear and precise as possible, and when practicable it should inform the defendant of the acts he is restrained from doing, without calling on him for inferences or conclusions about which persons might well differ and without leaving anything for further hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-8\"><em>See also Ex parte Slavin, </em>412 S.W.2d 43 (Tex.1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">For example, in <em>Moore </em>v. <em>State, </em>470 S.W.2d 391 (Tex.Civ.App. \u2014 San Antonio 1971, writ ref. n. r. e.), the trial court had granted a temporary injunction prohibiting the sale of certain specific magazines and books, as well as the sale of \u201csimilar\u201d material. In holding the \u201csimilar material\u201d portion of the injunction invalid under Rule 683, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-12\">[The order] does not sufficiently appraise [sic] appellants of the acts they are restrained from doing. In effect, the court is passing upon the obscenity of books, magazines, newspapers and films not before it, and perhaps not now in existence; and it prohibits generally the defendants from violating a penal statute without clear, precise or definite guidelines.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-13\">470 S.W.2d at 396. Moreover, in <em>Richards v. State, </em>497 S.W.2d 770 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014 Beaumont 1973, no writ), the court was faced with an injunction prohibiting, <em>inter alia, </em>the exhibition and distribution of obscene material in violation of the Texas Penal Code. Relying on <em>Moore, </em>the court held this portion of the injunction invalid under Rule 683: \u201cThis facet of the decree does not even comport with our basic rules of civil procedure, much less the almost insurmountable obstacle of the First Amendment.\u201d 497 S.W.2d at 778.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-14\">However, the <em>Richards </em>decision indicates that the Texas courts are willing to uphold more specifically framed injunctions against unnamed future films or publications. Another portion of the injunction in <em>Richards </em>prohibited the defendants from \u201cexhibiting or selling any other films which show actual acts of fellatio . . ., cunnilingus . . ., actual oral genital contact between two or more males or females, any sexual intercourse between any human and any animal or any scenes depicting actual sexual intercourse between human males and females.\u201d The court, while recognizing the first amendment problems, upheld this part of the injunction as being \u201cspecific, definite, and clear.\u201d 497 S.W.2d at 780.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Similarly, in <em>Locke v. State, </em>516 S.W.2d 949 (Tex.Civ.App. \u2014 Texarkana 1974, no writ), the trial court had issued a temporary injunction enjoining appellant from commercially exhibiting films portraying acts of sexual intercourse, deviate sexual intercourse, and bestiality as defined by Texas Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 21.01, 21.07. The court upheld the injunction, concluding that it was not impermissibly vague and was not a prior restraint. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-4\">The order in question here restrains only the exhibition of films depicting specific activities conducted in a certain manner. All these activities are expressly defined by statute and have been authoritatively construed to constitute obscenity not entitled to constitutional protection. The order does not contain a blanket suppression of films vaguely labeled \u201cobscene,\u201d and there is no suppression of films by name or any other designation except by reference to the specific conduct depicted therein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">516 S.W.2d at 954-55 [citations omitted].<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">It thus appears that Rule 683, as interpreted by the Texas courts, would allow the issuance of an injunction against the future exhibition of unnamed films that depict particular acts enumerated in the state\u2019s obscenity statute.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> That is, while an injunction cannot simply forbid the showing of \u201cobscene films,\u201d it can prohibit the showing of films that fall within the statutory definition of obscenity, so long as the prohibited acts are spelled out in the injunction. If this is the case \u2014 and the <em>Richards </em>and <em>Locke </em>decisions apparently represent the current state of the law \u2014 then we must examine such an injunction in light of the first amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-15\">Injunctions that abridge conduct protected by the first amendment are constitutionally impermissible. <em>Organization for a Better Austin v. Keefe, </em>402 U.S. 415, 91 S.Ct. 1575, 29 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971); <em>United Transp. Union v. State Bar, </em>401 U.S. 576, 91 S.Ct. 1076, 28 L.Ed.2d 339 (1971). Although obscenity is not protected speech, \u201c[t]he line between legitimate and illegitimate speech is often so finely drawn that the risks of freewheeling censorship are formidable.\u201d <em>Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, </em>420 U.S. 546, 559, 95 S.Ct. 1239, 1247, 43 L.Ed.2d 448 (1975). Accordingly, the Supreme Court has recognized the validity of injunctions against obscenity only when various safeguards are employed. For example, in <em>Kingsley Books, Inc. v. Brown, </em>354 U.S. 436, 445, 77 S.Ct. 1325, 1330, 1 L.Ed.2d 1469 (1957), the Court upheld a New York statute, which, as authoritatively construed, \u201cstudiously withholds restraint upon matters not already published <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>and not yet found to be offensive.\u201d Similarly, in <em>Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, </em>413 U.S. 49, 55, 93 S.Ct. 2628, 2634, 37 L.Ed.2d 446 (1973), the Court emphasized that a Georgia statute imposed no restraint on the exhibition of films \u201cuntil after a full adversary proceeding and a final judicial determination by the Georgia Supreme Court that the materials were constitutionally unprotected.\u201d No such safeguards exist under Texas law. <em>See, e. g., Richards v. State, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">An order banning the exhibition of unnamed \u201cobscene\u201d films would prohibit the showing of films that have not been judicially declared obscene, as well as films that may not have even been produced. Such a blanket ban is not rendered unobjectionable by the interweaving of threats of language from obscenity statutes, for the end result is a sweeping prohibition against the screening of obscene films in general. Incorporation of the statutory definition of obscenity \u2014 usually a listing of forbidden sexual acts or acrobatics \u2014 merely begs the question, for few of us have the omniscience to determine, in advance of a final judicial ruling, whether a film is legally obscene. Moreover, it is possible that a film containing many of the acts listed in the statute may eventually be held <em>not </em>to be obscene, since the work must be taken as a whole, <em>Miller v. California, supra, </em>and since state law cannot define the \u201ccontemporary community standards\u201d that must be applied by the fact finder. <em>Smith v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 291, 97 S.Ct. 1756, 52 L.Ed.2d 324 (1977). An injunction that forbids the showing of any film portraying the particular acts enumerated in the obscenity statute suppresses future films because past films have been deemed offensive. As Chief Justice Hughes wrote in <em>Near v. Minnesota, supra </em>283 U.S. at 713, 51 S.Ct. at 630, \u201c[tjhis is of the essence of censorship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">We therefore hold that Article 4667(a)(3) is unconstitutional insofar as it authorizes injunctions against the future exhibition of unnamed films. Such a broad injunction simply cannot stand, for it amounts to a prior restraint on materials not yet declared obscene. <em>Parish of Jefferson v. Bayou Landing, Ltd., </em>350 So.2d 158 (La.1977); <em>News Mart, Inc. v. State ex rel. Webster, </em>561 S.W.2d 752 (Tenn.1978); <em>Ranck </em>v. <em>Bonal Enterprises, Inc., </em>467 Pa. 569, 359 A.2d 748 (Pa.1976); <em>Fehlhaber v.

Projection Room Theatre, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">King Arts also contends that Article 4667(a)(3) lacks the procedural safeguards required under <em>Freedman v. Maryland, </em>380 U.S. 51, 85 S.Ct. 734, 13 L.Ed.2d 649 (1965).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Those safeguards were recently affirmed in <em>Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v.

Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s decision is not a ruling on the merits of the case, but rather a determination of whether the applicant has shown a \u201cprobable right\u201d and a \u201cprobable injury.\u201d In carrying this burden, the applicant is not required to establish that he will finally prevail in the litigation. The judgment of the trial court will be upheld unless the appellate court is convinced there was a clear abuse of discretion, and there is no such abuse if the evidence \u201ctends\u201d to sustain the cause of action as alleged. <em>State v. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., </em>526 S.W.2d 526 (Tex.1975); <em>Oil Field Haulers Ass\u2019n v. Railroad Comm\u2019n, </em>381 S.W.2d 183 (Tex.1964); <em>Janus Films, Inc. v.

Co. v. Texas &amp; N.O. R.R. Co., </em>155 Tex. 407, 289 S.W.2d 217 (1956); <em>North East I.S.D. v. North East Federation of Teachers, </em>541 S.W.2d 191 (Tex.Civ.App. \u2014 El Paso 1976, no writ).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">Pursuant to Rules 680-693a of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, the state can obtain, ex parte, a 10-day temporary restraining order against the showing of an allegedly obscene film. As soon as possible within the 10-day period, a hearing on a temporary injunction is obtainable. As the cases cited above make clear, this hearing is not a final adjudication on the merits, and, accordingly, the issuance of a temporary injunction is not a final judicial determination of obscenity. Rather, the granting of such an injunction represents the trial court\u2019s determination that the applicant has shown a \u201cprobable right\u201d and a \u201cprobable injury\u201d and has presented evidence that \u201ctends\u201d to sustain his cause of action. On appeal from the temporary injunction, the theater operator who has been enjoined cannot argue that the suppressed film is not obscene. Rather, \u201c[t]he action under appellate review . is the exercise by the trial court of the discretionary power [to issue the injunction] pending trial, thereby maintaining the status quo.\u201d <em>State v. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., supra </em>at 528.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Under the Texas procedure, the obscenity case is treated no differently than any other civil ease. Thus, if the theater operator is unable to convince an appellate court that the trial court abused its discretion in granting the temporary injunction, the order remains in effect and the film \u2014 which is presumably protected under the first amendment \u2014 remains suppressed pending a full-blown trial on the merits.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> At such a trial, it is quite possible for the court to hold that the film is not obscene, <em>cf. Texas Foundries, Inc. v. Foundry Workers, supra </em>261 S.W.2d at 464; <em>Lloyd A. Fry Roofing Co. v. State, </em>541 S.W.2d 639, 648 (Tex.Civ. App. \u2014 Dallas 1976, writ ref. n. r. e.), with the end result being that a film protected by the first amendment has been indefinitely suppressed before an on-the-merits judicial determination of obscenity. The Court recognized such a danger in <em>Freedman: </em>\u201cthe procedure must also assure a prompt final judicial decision, to minimize the deterrent effect of an interim and possibly erroneous\u201d preliminary restraint. 380 U.S. at 59, 85 S.Ct. at 739. Moreover, in <em>Southeastern Promotions </em>the Court, as in <em>Freedman </em>analyzing an administrative system, stressed that a final on-the-merits judicial determination was not immediately available. Justice Blackmun wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-5\">The board\u2019s system did not provide a procedure for prompt judicial review. Although the District Court eommendably held a hearing on petitioner\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction within a few days of the board\u2019s decision, it did not review the merits of the decision at that time. The question at the hearing was whether petitioner should receive <em>preliminary </em>relief, i. e., whether there was a likelihood of success on the merits and whether petitioner would suffer irreparable injury pending full review. Effective review on the merits was not obtained until more than five months later. * * During the time prior to judicial determination, the restraint altered the status quo.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">420 U.S. at 561-62, 95 S.Ct. at 1248 [emphasis in original].</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">The identical situation is present under the Texas injunction procedure; the hearing on the temporary injunction does not constitute an on-the-merits determination of obscenity, and there is no provision for a prompt review on the merits. And, while such a temporary injunction is in effect, the status quo is obviously altered \u2014 rather than maintained \u2014 and presumably protected speech is indefinitely suppressed. It is difficult to improve upon the words of Judge Aldisert in <em>Grove Press, Inc. v. Philadelphia, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-12\">The mischief we perceive ... is that there is no guarantee a final hearing will be seasonably scheduled after the issuance of a preliminary injunction and that a prompt decision will be forthcoming thereafter. The preliminary restraint could exist days, and even months, before the judicial decision on the merits; where this possibility exists, an unacceptable threat to the freedom of expression without due process of law results.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-13\">* 8{S * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Where expression is inhibited as a result of prompt judicial decision reached after an adversary proceeding, there can be no procedural due process complaint. But where the inhibition occurs in a preliminary proceeding, with no guarantee of a prompt judicial decision on the merits, the procedure is constitutionally defective because a restraint of presumably protected expression not only occurs but is capable of persisting for an unlimited time prior to the required judicial determination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">418 F.2d at 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Accordingly, we hold that Article 4667(a)(3), which authorizes injunctions in the obscenity context, is constitutionally infirm for its failure to provide the safeguards mandated by <em>Freedman. </em>In short, the Texas procedure does not treat obscenity with the kid gloves that the first amendment requires, for the state\u2019s process for ascertaining whether certain materials are obscene must ensure \u201cthe necessary sensitivity to freedom of expression.\u201d <em>Freedman v. Maryland, supra </em>380 U.S. at 58, 85 S.Ct. at 739. <em>Compare </em>the New York procedure outlined in <em>Kingsley Books, Inc. v. Brown, supra, </em>which the <em>Freedman </em>Court described as a \u201cmodel.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Although this court can construe two state statutes to be exclusive of one another in order to avoid a constitutional difficulty, as we have done in Part I of this opinion, we cannot judicially rewrite the Texas statutes and rules to incorporate the <em>Freedman </em>safeguards. As the Supreme Court said in <em>Freedman </em>\u201c[h]ow or whether Maryland is to incorporate the required procedural safeguards in the statutory scheme is for the state to decide.\u201d 380 U.S. at 60, 85 S.Ct. at 740. <em>Compare United States v. Thirty-Seven Photographs, supra </em>(federal statute). The task of complying with <em>Freedman </em>must therefore be left to the State of Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-12\">King Arts seeks a remand to the district court for a determination and award of costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.

By way of comparison, this court has held that a federal district court, in order to grant a preliminary injunction, must find that the moving party has satisfied four prerequisites: (1) substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) a showing of irreparable injury unless the injunction issues; (3) proof that the threatened injury to the movant outweighs whatever damage the proposed injunction may cause the opposing party; and (4) a showing that the injunction, if issued, would not be adverse to the public interest. The movant has the heavy burden of persuading the district court that all four elements are satisfied, and this court will overturn the district court\u2019s decision only for abuse of discretion. <em>E. g., Hardin v.

It is no answer to maintain that the theater operator could obtain a prompt, final judicial determination of obscenity by violating the injunction and thus bringing about contempt proceedings. <em>See </em>Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 1911a; Rule 692, Tex.R.Civ.P. Such a violation would constitute constructive criminal contempt, <em>Ex parte Werbiud, </em>536 S.W.2d 542 (Tex. 1976), and the state would have the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Surely one is not required to risk criminal sanction in order to obtain what <em>Freedman </em>requires the state to provide. Under the contempt procedure, the burden of obtaining a prompt, final judicial determination of obscenity is impermis-sibly placed on the theater operator. Moreover, although the state has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the theater operator is guilty of contempt, it is not clear whether the state also has the burden of proving that the film is obscene, as <em>Freedman </em>requires. <em>Cf.

The Texas statutes defining obscenity are couched in the language of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Miller v. California, </em>413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973), and there is no contention that their standards or definitions are overbroad. Further, the Texas courts (as a matter of general procedural law) require in the obscenity context as elsewhere that injunctions be specific, clear and definite. In the example chosen by the majority, <em>Richards </em>v. <em>State, </em>497 S.W.2d 770 (Tex.Civ.App. \u2014 Beaumont 1973, no writ hist.), the injunction prohibited \u201cexhibiting or selling any other films which show actual acts of fellatio . . ., cunnilingus . . ., actual oral genital contact between two or more males or females, any sexual intercourse, between any human and any animal or any scenes depicting actual sexual intercourse, between human males and females.\u201d 497 S.W.2d at 772. Modifying the decree to incorporate the holding of <em>Miller v. California, supra,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Texas court upheld the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-19\">Thus the holding of the majority appears to be that any injunction, no matter how specific, that restrains the exhibition of films by definitions or categories rather than one-by-one and after the fact of a specific, prior adjudication of obscenity is invalid. To quote from the opinion (Maj. op. p. 169):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-20\">\u201cAn injunction that forbids the showing of any film portraying the particular acts enumerated in the obscenity statute suppresses future films because past films have been deemed offensive. As Chief Justice Hughes wrote in <em>Near v. Minnesota, supra, </em>283 U.S. 697, at 713, 51 S.Ct. 625, \u2018[t]his is of the essence of censorship.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-21\">I think that there are serious flaws in this reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-22\">In the first place, the majority\u2019s statement is simply incorrect: an injunction against exhibiting a film depicting enumerated acts from the obscenity statute suppresses that film not at all \u201cbecause past films have been deemed offensive\u201d but be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>cause the present film depicts the acts in a manner forbidden by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">In the second, the quotation from <em>Near v. Minnesota </em>is a characterization of an entirely different sort of act \u2014 the suppression of publication of future issues of a newspaper because earlier issues were deemed scandalous. The analog of such a,n act in the present context would be the closing of King Art\u2019s Theatre to exhibition of <em>any </em>film because it had exhibited obscene ones in the past. This would indeed be \u201cof the essence of censorship,\u201d but it is a far cry from an injunction forbidding in specific terms the exhibition of such films only as violate the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Indeed, the majority\u2019s reasoning on this head comes to little more than announcing that injunctions are prior restraints and prior restraints are bad. The suggestion that an injunction merely against obscene matter \u2014 admittedly unprotected by the first amendment \u2014 might be valid is disposed of, as nearly as I can understand the opinion, by the observation that obscenity cannot be defined with sufficient precision to be the subject matter of a valid injunction. Unless this is what the sentence at Maj. op. p. 169 commencing \u201cIncorporation of the statutory definition of obscenity . merely begs the question\u201d means, then I do not know what it means. But this argument proves too much, for if the definition is too vague for an injunction, surely it must also be too vague to satisfy due process as giving fair notice of conduct subject to criminal penalties?</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">More, the argument is overbroad in another respect. It implies that no injunction in a first amendment context is valid, though we know this is not so. Indeed, as a practical matter, I can see little if any difference between an injunction against exhibiting obscene films (constitutionally defined) and a statute against doing so, and what difference there is favors the injunction. As Mr. Justice Frankfurter wrote for the Court in <em>Kingsley Books v. Brown, </em>354 U.S. 436, 441-2, 77 S.Ct. 1325, 1 L.Ed.2d 1469 (1957):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-7\">\u201cThe phrase \u2018prior restraint\u2019 is not a self-wielding sword. Nor can it serve as a talismanic test. The duty of closer analysis and critical judgment in applying the thought behind the phrase has thus been authoritatively put by one who brings weighty learning to his support of constitutionally protected liberties: \u2018What is needed,\u2019 writes Professor Paul A. Freund, \u2018is a pragmatic assessment of its operation in the particular circumstances. The generalization that prior restraint is particularly obnoxious in civil liberties cases must yield to more particu-laristic analysis.\u2019 The Supreme Court and Civil Liberties, 4 Vand.L.Rev. 533, 539.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-10\">\u201cWherein does \u00a7 22-a differ in its effective operation from the type of statute upheld in Alberts? Section 311 of California\u2019s Penal Code provides that \u2018Every person who wilfully and lewdly . keeps for sale . . . any obscene . book ... is guilty of a misdemeanor . . . .\u2019 Section 1141 of New York\u2019s Penal Law is similar. One would be bold to assert that the <em>in terro-rem </em>effect of such statutes less restrains booksellers in the period before the law strikes than does \u00a7 22-a. Instead of requiring the bookseller to dread that the offer for sale of a book, may without prior warning, subject him to a criminal prosecution with the hazard of imprisonment, the civil procedure assures him that such consequences cannot follow unless he ignores a court order specifically directed to him for a prompt and carefully circumscribed determination of the issue of obscenity. Until then, he may keep the book for sale and sell it on his own judgment rather than steer \u2018nervously among the treacherous shoals.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-13\">Thus if a statute forbidding publication of obscenity can be constitutionally valid, it is hard for me to see how an injunction doing the same thing is per se invalid. Yet as nearly as I can understand the majority opinion, this is what Part II of it says.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-15\">\n<em>Of Kid Gloves and Obscenity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A6m\">Part III of the court\u2019s opinion purports to invalidate Texas Article 4667(a)(3) on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>additional ground that it \u201clacks the procedural safeguards required by <em>Freedman v. Maryland, </em>380 U.S. 51, 85 S.Ct. 734, 13 L.Ed.2d 649 (1965)\u201d (Maj. op. p. 169) and hence fails to \u201ctreat obscenity with the kid gloves that the first amendment requires, .\u201d (Maj. op. p. 172). But since Article 4667(a)(3) does no more than in general terms authorize an injunction, thus implicitly referring to the basic Texas injunction procedures, it is in fact these latter which the opinion finds procedurally deficient when sought to be employed against obscenity. These procedures are patterned on the Federal ones, Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 680 and 681 which define them being copied from Federal Rule 65, with minor and insignificant textual changes. It is plain, therefore, that a necessary consequence of the majority opinion is to invalidate our Rule 65 procedures to the same extent as the Texas ones, an effect which practitioners in our courts should note. Thus we impliedly hold today that those who crafted and promulgated our own Federal system of injunctions overlooked providing a procedure valid for use in the obscenity context, a somewhat far-reaching and arresting conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The majority reaches this result by fixing on one word of the Supreme Court\u2019s language in two cases arising in a somewhat different context from this, court review of <em>administrative </em>censorship. With deference, it seems to me that the contexts are sufficiently dissimilar that the language in question need not and should not be applied here, where no administrator and no censor \u2014 only courts \u2014 figure in the matter anywhere. The two cases are <em>Freedman v. Maryland, </em>380 U.S. 51, 85 S.Ct. 734, 13 L.Ed.2d 649 (1965), and <em>Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, </em>420 U.S. 546, 95 S.Ct. 1239, 43 L.Ed.2d 448 (1975); the word seized upon is the term \u201cfinal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">In a nutshell, the majority holds that Texas (and hence Federal) injunction procedures are invalid as applied to obscenity because they do not require a \u201cfinal\u201d ruling on the merits of obscenity before preliminary injunctions may issue against the pornographer, only the ascertainment of that \u201cprobable right\u201d thought a sufficient basis for the interlocutory writ in all other contexts. This holding is said to be required by an expression of the Supreme Court in <em>Freedman, </em>refined and restated in <em>Southeastern, </em>running as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-11\">We held in <em>Freedman, </em>and we reaffirm here, that a system of prior restraint runs afoul of the First Amendment if it lacks certain safeguards: First, the burden of instituting judicial proceedings, and of proving that the material is unprotected, must rest on the censor. Second, any restraint prior to judicial review can be imposed only for a specified brief period and only for the purpose of preserving the status quo. Third, a prompt <em>final </em>judicial determination must be assured. 420 U.S., at 560, 95 S.Ct. at 1247 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">The context of <em>Freedman </em>and <em>Southeastern, </em>however, was very different from this. Here all action, from start to finish, was judicial; no administrator or censor figured in the matter at any stage;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the only conceivable \u201cprior restraint\u201d would have been a preliminary injunction pendente lite. In <em>Freedman, </em>by contrast, there was involved a procedure for the absolute administrative suppression of a film by refusal of a censor\u2019s license; and in <em>Southeastern, </em>the use of a theatre was administratively refused, thus preventing entirely the production of a musical there. These were \u201cfinal\u201d administrative acts; final, that is, unless and until those complaining of them took their cases to court and bore the burden of overturning them. In such situations, the quoted formulation by the Supreme Court makes sense and has full application: limiting the censor to a brief, administrative restraint, followed by judicial review at the instance of the censor, with the burden of proof upon him, and a required prompt, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>final judicial determination ending the administrative ministry one way or the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Nor has the Court left us in doubt about why it requires prompt and final judicial action in such a context: it is because \u201c[djuring the time prior to judicial determination, the [administrative] restraint altered the status quo\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and after administrative intervention \u201ca judicial determination must occur \u2018promptly so that administrative delay does not in itself become a form of censorship.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In other words, only a brief <em>non </em>-judicial interdiction of matter arguably protected by the first amendment will be tolerated; and if material has been taken off the market by a final administrative action pending a judicial decision, that decision must come quickly. Here, however, neither reason for such a rule obtains. There neither was nor could have been any administrative restraint to alter the status quo. Nor could such a restraint (since there neither was nor could have been one) have required hurried judicial action finally upholding or reversing it, lest administrative delay become itself an instrument of suppression.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">That these holdings have application to proceedings such as this, which contemplate neither censor nor other administrator but only the normal judicial process, is far from clear to me. To apply, their rule must be rewritten to run as follows: where a preliminary judicial decision resulting from an adversary hearing has been made that matter is probably obscene and should be taken off the market pendente lite, a procedural scheme \u2014 to be valid as applied to pornography \u2014 must further require that the judge conduct a prompt hearing on the merits of obscenity and render a prompt final judgment on it as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">I do not deny that there are arguments that can be made in support of such a rule. It seems to me, however, that they are of quite a different sort than those which underlie the rule of <em>Freedman </em>and <em>Southeastern: </em>that censors (all too often, history teaches, afflicted by tunnel vision) should not be permitted to remove first-amendment type matter from the marketplace indefinitely or cast the burdens of going forward or of proof on its purveyors; and that where such matter is censored, prompt and effective review by a judge must be provided so that the matter is, if protected, returned to the marketplace without any lengthy languishing under administrative ban. I hope that I am not insensitive to first amendment considerations and issues; but it seems to me that where mere successive stages of judicial consideration \u2014 usually before the same judge \u2014 are concerned rather than review by the judge of a censor\u2019s fiat, the general procedures which suffice for all other purposes should be sufficient for dealing with pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b238-12\">For the above reasons, I respectfully dissent from Parts II and III of the opinion herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b235-15\">. \u201cThe injunction granted by this paragraph of the order is limited to works which, taken as a whole, appeal to the prurient interest in sex, which portray sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, and which, taken as a whole, do not have any serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\u201d 497 S.W.2d at 782.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b237-7\">.
