(Supp. V 1975). The district court dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction due to Rodriguez\u2019s failure to file his discrimination charge within 180 days of the alleged discriminatory act. The court subsequently denied Rodriguez\u2019s motion to set aside the judgment of dismissal. Rodriguez appeals from both orders. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>Rodriguez failed to file his notice of appeal within 30 days of the entry of the underlying judgment of dismissal. Therefore, this court lacks jurisdiction to review it. Fed.R.App.P. 4(a); <em>Alexander v. Sacha, </em>439 F.2d 742 (9th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-5\">Rodriguez moved to set aside the judgment on the ground that the district court committed a \u201cmanifest error in the interpretation of the jurisdictional statute,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e) (Supp. V 1975).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This motion was not timely filed as a motion to alter or amend the judgment under Rule 59 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and it must be treated as a motion for relief from judgment under Rule 60(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 60(b) motion must be affirmed unless the court abused its discretion in ruling that sufficient grounds for setting aside the judgment were not shown. <em>United States v. Russell, </em>578 F.2d 806, 807 (9th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-6\">In his motion to set aside the judgment, Rodriguez argued that \u00a7 2000e-5(e) permitted him to file his charge within 300 days after the discriminatory act because Oregon is a \u201cdeferral state\u201d with state remedies for employment discrimination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Southern Pacific argued that Rodriguez had 300 days in which to file his charge with the EEOC, but only if it had been filed with a state agency within 180 days. Rodriguez's position was supported by an EEOC regulation, 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 1601.12(b)(l)(v) (1975), and a district court decision, <em>Ortega v. Construction and General Laborer\u2019s Union No. 390, </em>396 F.Supp. 976 (D.Conn.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-15\">However, in <em>Olson v. Rembrandt Printing Co., </em>511 F.2d 1228, 1231-33 (8th Cir. 1975), the only circuit court to address the issue had carefully explored the legislative history and policy of the statute and had adopted the position urged in this case by Southern Pacific. <em>Accord, Wiltshire v. Standard Oil Co. of California, </em>447 F.Supp. 756 (N.D. Cal.1978). The district court concluded that the Eighth Circuit had stated the better view in <em>Olson </em>and that there was no reason to set aside judgment of dismissal. Because the district court\u2019s interpretation of the statutory jurisdictional requirements had substantial support at the time of the denial of the motion, we cannot say that it abused its discretion in declining to set aside its judgment of dismissal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1043-16\">Rodriquez also contends that his charge was filed within 180 days of a discriminatory demotion or of a continuing discriminatory act. These arguments were not presented to the district court on the motion to set aside the judgment, and they are substantively without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1043-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1043-7\">. Section 2000e-5(e) provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1043-8\">\u201cA charge under this section shall be filed within one hundred and eighty days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred . . . except that in a case of an unlawful employment practice with respect to which the person aggrieved has initially instituted proceedings with a State or local agency with authority to grant or seek relief from such practice . . . such charge shall be filed . . within three hundred days after the alleged unlawful employment practice.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1043-12\">. It is not clear whether relief can ever be granted under Rule 60(b) on grounds of judicial error of law; the circuits have split on this issue. However, it is unnecessary to decide this question because, even assuming that Rodriguez alleged proper grounds for relief, the district court properly denied relief on the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1043-20\">. <em>See Pacific Maritime Ass\u2019n v. Quinn, </em>465 F.2d 108 (9th Cir. 1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1043-21\">. In <em>Doski v. Goldseker Co., </em>539 F.2d 1326 (4th Cir. 1976), the Fourth Circuit rejected the position adopted by the Eighth Circuit in <em>Olson. </em>However, <em>Doski </em>was not decided until after the district court denied Rodgriques\u2019s motion to set aside the judgment, and it cannot be cited as a ground for holding that the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion to set aside.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
