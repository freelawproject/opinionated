Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AED\">This case presents two appeals by Robert Helbig from zoning authorities of the fire district of Noank. The first appeal, institu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>ted in April, 1976* <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (the April appeal), arose out of the decision of the zoning commission of the Noank fire district that Helbig\u2019s nse of his Bayside Avenue property as a commercial boatyard violated the zoning ordinance of the Noank fire district, and the commission\u2019s consequent order to its zoning enforcement officer to undertake action seeking a warrant for Helbig\u2019s arrest for violating the zoning regulations. This order was issued after the commission, following a hearing, rejected Helbig\u2019s claim, inter alia, that his use was a valid nonconforming use. The April appeal, in challenging the commission\u2019s action as illegal, arbitrary and in abuse of its discretion, also attacked the zoning ordinance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Thereafter, on April 19, 1976, Helbig appealed to the zoning board of appeals from the zoning enforcement officer\u2019s decision that a nonconforming use did not exist on his property. On May 26,1976, the zoning board of appeals held a public hearing, at which the plaintiff appeared and presented his case. Due to a recorder malfunction, a rehearing was scheduled on July 17, 1976. The plaintiff appeared and presented additional evidence in support of his claim of a \u201cvalid, pre-existing, continuous non-conforming use.\u201d On July 30, 1976, the zoning board of appeals denied his appeal and affirmed the decision of the zoning enforcement officer and of the commission. On August 17, 1976, Helbig appealed from the decision of the zoning board of appeals (the August appeal). Both the April and August appeals were presented at the same time for determination by the Superior Court, which consolidated the two appeals. The Superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Court sustained the April appeal and determined that the August appeal was moot because of its decision on the April appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">In deciding the April appeal, the Superior Court permitted the plaintiff to attack the constitutionality of \u00a7 13.7 of the zoning ordinance of the Noank fire district, which section pertains to the establishment of nonconforming uses.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court concluded that \u00a7 13.7 was \u201cinvalid due to its total lack of evidentiary standards and due to insufficient guidelines for the commission and the affected property owners.\u201d In reaching this conclusion, the court stated that \u201c[t]he language of Section 13.7 which requires \u2018sufficient proof as the Zoning Commission may require\u2019 to prove . . . the existence of a nonconforming use must necessarily result in unequal and arbitrary application of the section to affected property owners.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6On this appeal, the defendants<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> claim that the trial court erred: (1) in concluding that the plaintiff \u201ccould attack the constitutionality of the subject zoning ordinance in the same action in which he sought the benefits of the ordinance\u201d and (2) in \u201cdeclaring that the subject zoning ordinance section requiring registration of, pre-existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>nonconforming uses lacks sufficient evidentiary standards <em>to </em>guide the zoning commission and affected property owners.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The defendants state their claim in the August appeal as follows: \u201cDid the trial court err in declaring the plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the action of the zoning board of appeals moot because of its decision in the plaintiff\u2019s zoning commission appeal when the defendant board of appeals not only ruled on the zoning commission\u2019s action based on the ordinance later held to be invalid, but also ruled on a separate issue unrelated to that ordinance\u2014i.e., the zoning enforcement officer\u2019s prior issuance of a violation notice to the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">We take up first the defendants\u2019 claims on the April appeal. Deferring to the right of a party to raise the issue of the constitutionality of an ordinance or statute, we have held that a party cannot seek the relief provided in an ordinance or statute and later in the same proceeding raise the question of its constitutionality. See <em>Society for Savings </em>v. <em>Chestnut Estates, Inc., </em>176 Conn. 563, 567, 409 A.2d 1020 (1979); <em>Holley </em>v. <em>Sutherland, </em>110 Conn. 80, 85, 147 A. 300 (1929); cf. <em>Bruno </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commission, </em>184 Conn. 246, 249, 440 A.2d 155 (1981). This is the rule extant in our zoning cases. See, e.g., <em>J &amp; M Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Norwalk, </em>156 Conn. 185, 191, 239 A.2d 534 (1968); <em>St. John\u2019s Roman Catholic Church Corporation </em>v. <em>Darien, </em>149 Conn. 712, 717-18, 184 A.2d 42 (1962); <em>Florentine </em>v. <em>Darien, </em>142 Conn. 415, 428, 115 A.2d 328 (1955); <em>Strain </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>137 Conn. 36, 38-39, 74 A.2d 462 (1950), and cases cited therein. Mr. Justice Brand\u00e9is, concurring in <em>Ashwander </em>v. <em>Tennessee Valley Authority, </em>297 U.S. 288, 348, 56 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>S. Ct. 466, 80 L. Ed. 688 (1936), formulated the rule as follows: \u201cThe Court will not pass upon the constitutionality of a statute at the instance of one who has availed himself of its benefits.\u201d See <em>Fahey </em>v. <em>Mallonee, </em>332 U.S. 245, 255, 67 S. Ct. 1552, 91 L. Ed. 2030 (1947); <em>United Fuel Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Railroad Commission, </em>278 U.S. 300, 307-308, 49 S. Ct. 150, 73 L. Ed. 390 (1929).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">There are, however, exceptions to such a rule at both the federal and state level. Where compliance with the statute under attack is under compulsion, compliance can hardly be deemed voluntary, and one will not be estopped to challenge the statute. See <em>Hialeah Race Course, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gulfstream Park Racing Assn., Inc., </em>245 So. 2d 625, 629 (Fla. 1971); <em>Donoho </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connell\u2019s, Inc., </em>18 Ill. 2d 432, 435, 164 N.E.2d 52 (1960); <em>People </em>v. <em>Arthur Morgan Trucking Co., </em>16 Ill. 2d 313, 317, 157 N.E.2d 41 (1959); <em>Begin </em>v. <em>Inhabitants of the Town of Sabattus, </em>409 A.2d 1269, 1272 (Me. 1979); 16 Am. Jur. 2d, Constitutional Law \u00a7 211; 16 C.J.S., Constitutional Law \u00a7 89. Stated another way, estoppel will not prevent a challenge to the validity of a statute where there is compliance with a statute that requires a duty mandatory in form, accompanied by penalties for failure to obey its provisions, or which is otherwise coercive; in such cases, the element of voluntary action (or embracing the benefits of such a statute) essential to waiver or estoppel is absent. 16 Am. Jur. 2d, Constitutional Law \u00a7 211. The unique circumstances of the April appeal with the plaintiff looking directly at a clear and present threat of criminal liability for a visible use of his property which he seriously urged predated zoning, leads us to conclude that he may properly mount his constitutional attack. This matter hardly falls within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>the aphorism \u201c[undoubtedly, men may not take advantage of a law when it suits them, and then attack it when it does not.\u201d See <em>Owens </em>v. <em>Corporation Commission of State of Oklahoma, </em>41 F.2d 799, 803 (W.D. Okla. 1930), and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Moreover, we note that our estoppel doctrine does not preclude a party from attacking the constitutionality of a statute or ordinance in an independent proceeding. <em>St. John\u2019s Roman Catholic Church Corporation </em>v. <em>Darien, </em>supra, 718; <em>Florentine </em>v. <em>Darien, </em>supra, 430; <em>Strain </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 40. The record in this ease indicates that the plaintiff has filed an independent declaratory judgment action concerning the constitutionality of \u00a7 13.7.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> No action has been taken on this case pending a resolution of the present appeals. We agree with the claim made by the defendants in their reply brief that \u201cthese appeals present a situation where further litigation could be avoided by deciding the issue of the constitutionality of \u00a7 13.7.\u201d Thus, we reach that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Certain circumstances demonstrating the posture of these matters before and during the activities of the zoning commission and the zoning board of appeals may be appropriately set out at this point. The plaintiff maintains that a predecessor in title had purchased the property in question in 1954 and had established a boatyard thereon before the adoption of zoning by the Noank fire district on July 17, 1956. With the passage of zoning in 1956, the premises lay partly in a residential zone and partly in an industrial zone. The plaintiff claims that because of this zoning, the portion used as a boatyard was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>in a residential zone, and tiras became a nonconforming nse, while the portion of the premises in the new industrial zone became a conforming nse.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Some time later, in 1967, the industrial zone, within which a portion of the premises was located, was eliminated and zoned residential. The plaintiff maintains that the entire nse of the property thus became a nonconforming use. On May 1, 1972, the plaintiff entered into a lease-option agreement to purchase this property from the Watrous estate, and he subsequently purchased it on March 3,1976.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">On June 22, 1974, the zoning ordinance of the Noank fire district was again amended in several respects: (1) the subject premises were designated as \u201cvillage residential\u201d; (2) \u00a713.7, concerning the establishment of nonconforming uses, was added to the zoning ordinance; and (3) \u00a713.2.2 was also added to the regulations.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>After several requests for information regarding the claimed preexisting nonconforming use of the parcel as a commercial boatyard, on November 27, 1974, the zoning enforcement officer sent notices of violation to the plaintiff and the Watrous estate. The zoning enforcement officer stayed action on his violation notices upon the agreement of the plaintiff to apply for recognition of a nonconforming use under \u00a7 13.7 of the zoning ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">On December 19, 1974, the plaintiff, pursuant to \u00a7 13.7, submitted a site plan showing the property and boatyard at Bayside Avenue.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On March 17, 1975, he was notified that the commission was still reviewing his request for recognition of a nonconforming use for the boatyard. On May 28,1975, the zoning enforcement officer notified him that, in the opinion of the commission, a preexisting nonconforming use did not exist at the property and that, unless tax records were presented indicating the operation of a boatyard prior to 1956, the commission would deny his \u201capplication for a nonconforming use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">On June 19, 1975, the zoning enforcement officer informed the plaintiff that the commission had decided that a preexisting nonconforming use did not exist on the property and that he was in violation of the zoning ordinance of the fire district. At that time, he was also notified that unless all boats and the travel trailer lift were removed from the property within ten days, the matter would be turned over to the prosecutor\u2019s office. On July 21, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>1975, the zoning enforcement officer requested the prosecutor to issue a warrant for the plaintiff\u2019s arrest. Thereafter, however, on December 1, 1975, the zoning enforcement officer informed the plaintiff that the commission had decided to offer him an opportunity to present additional evidence concerning the preexistence of a nonconforming use of his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">On January 7,1976, the commission held a special meeting to hear evidence on the history of the use of the plaintiff\u2019s property on Bayside Avenue. At that hearing, the plaintiff presented evidence* 2345678**<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> in support of his claim. In addition, former owners of the property, a lessee of the property, the plaintiff and other citizens of Noank spoke on the history and use of the property.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> On March 23, 1976, the commission voted to reaffirm its previous stand that there was insufficient evidence to prove a preexisting, continuous, nonconforming use on the plaintiff\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">On April 19, 1976, the plaintiff appealed to the zoning board of appeals of the Noank fire district from the decision of the zoning enforcement officer that no nonconforming use existed on his property. Two public hearings were held on this appeal, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>the plaintiff appeared and presented additional evidence in support of his claim.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> On July 30, 1976, the zoning board of appeals denied the plaintiff\u2019s appeal and affirmed the decision of the zoning enforcement officer.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">We turn now to the plaintiff\u2019s attack on \u00a7 13.7 of the regulations. We initially note that zoning legislation has been upheld as a legitimate subject for the exercise of police power provided it has a reasonable relation to the public health, safety and welfare, and operates in a manner which is not arbitrary, destructive or confiscatory. See <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>161 Conn. 24, 30-31, 282 A.2d 907 (1971); <em>Teuscher </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>154 Conn. 650, 658-59, 228 A.2d 518 (1967); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hillman, </em>110 Conn. 92, 100, 147 A. 294 (1929). Whether specific regulations meet the test of a constitutional exercise of the police power must be determined in the light of the circumstances shown to exist in a particular case. See <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 31. \u201cWhen a question of con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>stitntionality is raised, the court presumes validity and sustains the legislation unless it clearly violates constitutional principles.\u201d <em>Teuscher </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 659, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>143 Conn. 698, 703, 125 A.2d 477 (1956); see <em>New Milford </em>v. <em>SCA Services of Connecticut, Inc., </em>174 Conn. 146, 148, 384 A.2d 337 (1977); <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>145 Conn. 141, 145, 139 A.2d 599 (1958). The plaintiff has the burden of overcoming this presumption; <em>Teuscher </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra; <em>Murphy, Inc. </em>v. <em>Westport, </em>131 Conn. 292, 302-303, 40 A.2d 177 (1944); and that burden is not a \u201clight one.\u201d <em>DeForest &amp; Hotchkiss Co. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>152 Conn. 262, 271, 205 A.2d 774 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The commission points out that the registration and regulation of \u201clegal\u201d nonconforming uses is proper within the authority of General Statutes \u00a7 8-2 and Special Act No. 34 of the 1947 General Assembly.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See 6 Rohan, Zoning and Land Use Controls \u00a741.01 [2]. Section 8-2 authorizes \u201cthe zoning commission of each city, town or borough . . . to regulate within the limits of any such municipality,\u201d many facets of the use of land. The section, however, also provides in relevant part that: \u201cSuch regulations shall not prohibit the continuance of any nonconforming use, building or structure existing at the time of adoption of such regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>We have observed that \u201c \u00a3[t]he accepted policy of zoning ... is to prevent the extension of nonconforming uses\u2019\u201d; <em>Hyatt </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>163 Conn. 379, 384, 311 A.2d 77 (1972); see <em>Baccante </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>153 Conn. 44, 47, 212 A.2d 411 (1965); <em>DeForest &amp; Hotchkiss Co. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 268; and that it is the \u201cindisputable goal of zoning to reduce nonconforming to conforming uses with all the speed justice will tolerate.\u201d <em>Blum </em>v. <em>Lisbon Leasing Corporation, </em>173 Conn. 175, 181, 377 A.2d 280 (1977); see <em>Gunther </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>136 Conn. 303, 309, 71 A.2d 91 (1949). Nevertheless, the rule concerning the continuance of a nonconforming use protects the \u201cright\u201d of a user to continue the same use of the property as it existed before the date of the adoption of the zoning regulations. <em>Beckish </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>162 Conn. 11, 16, 291 A.2d 208 (1971); <em>Abbadessa </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>134 Conn. 28, 34, 54 A.2d 675 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">We appreciate, however, that unless these uses are identified and their status determined, zoning enforcement concerning them is almost impossible and often difficult. See 3 Anderson, American Law of Zoning (2d Ed.) \u00a7 17.04. Such regulation is necessary for efficient zoning administration. Regulations such as \u00a7 13.7 of the Noank fire district look to the cataloguing, determination and supervision of nonconforming uses in a town or district that must deal with such uses claimed to predate zoning. If a regulation such as \u00a7 13.7 does not meet constitutional standards, however, it must be stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">The defendants specifically claim that the trial court erred in declaring that \u00a7 13.7 lacked \u201csufficient evidentiary standards to guide the zoning commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>sion and affected property owners.\u201d Maintaining that the trial court did not accord the presumption of constitutionality or utilize established rules of statutory construction in making its determination, the defendants argue that the court \u201cfocused solely upon the language of \u00a7 13.7 in reaching its decision and did not consider or review \u00a7\u00a7 13.1 through 13.6 of the Zoning Ordinance.\u201d \u201cThese sections,\u201d maintain the defendants, \u201cstate a legislative policy and standards which give guidance to the Zoning Commission in implementing the strategy of the Noank Fire District for dealing with nonconforming uses.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The defendants argue that the requirement of a site plan under \u00a7 13.7, along with \u201csufficient proof as the Zoning Commission may require\u201d to prove the existence of a nonconforming use \u201csuch as tax receipts or sales tax permits . . .\u201d together with other portions of \u00a713, \u201cgive(s) the zoning authority definite guidelines as to the minimum evidence which must be requested but allows sufficient flexibility for the zoning authority to consider the diverse types of proof which might be available in different factual situations.\u201d We cannot accept these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">There is no question that criteria contained in a zoning commission\u2019s regulations must be as reasonably precise as the subject matter requires and as reasonably adequate and sufficient to guide the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>mission and to enable those affected to know their rights and obligations. <em>Forest Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>155 Conn. 669, 680, 236 A.2d 917 (1967); see <em>American Power &amp; Light Co. </em>v. <em>S.E.C., </em>329 U.S. 90, 105, 67 S. Ct. 133, 91 L. Ed. 103 (1946). Although \u201c[i]t is unrealistic to demand detailed standards which are impracticable or impossible\u201d; <em>Forest Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 679; \u201c[a] \u2018statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application, violates the first essential of due process of law\u2019 .... And this is no less true of a municipal ordinance or regulation.\u201d <em>O\u2019Connell </em>v. <em>Brockton Board of Appeals, </em>344 Mass. 208, 212, 181 N.E.2d 800 (1962), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>325 Mass. 519, 521, 91 N.E.2d 666 (1950). We have explicitly said: \u201c[E]very owner of property located in a town which has adopted zoning is entitled to be able to ascertain, with reasonable certainty, what uses he may legally make of any portion of his property.\u201d <em>Lebanon </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>153 Conn. 182, 191, 215 A.2d 112 (1965); see <em>Forest Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning </em>Commission, supra. This requirement of standards is a fundamental aspect of constitutional law. <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Common Council, </em>154 Conn. 156, 159, 222 A.2d 337 (1966); <em>Eastern Oil Refining Co. </em>v. <em>Court of Burgesses, </em>130 Conn. 606, 611, 36 A.2d 586 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">We turn, then, to the challenged section, \u00a7 13.7, which involves the procedure concerning the establishment of nonconforming uses. Section 13.7 in its entirety, provides as follows: \u201c13.7 establishment op nonconforming use. The owners of all nonconforming uses existing as of June 22,1974, must sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>mit a plan indicating sufficient data to indicate the extent of such nonconforming use as of the date indicated above. Such plan shall be prepared by either an engineer, architect, land surveyor or others acceptable to the Commission and indicate sufficient information as required in Section 11.4 to fully define the existing nonconformity. This plan along with sufficient proof as the Zoning Commission may require to prove the existence of a nonconforming use such as tax receipts or sales tax permits shall be submitted to the Zoning Commission no later than six months after the date indicated above. Upon approval of the Zoning Commission that the nonconforming use is in fact a preexisting nonconforming use, a Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued indicating the location, nature and extent of the nonconforming use and such other details as may be necessary for the issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy, and the plan shall be recorded by the owner in the Land Records of the town of Groton.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">\u201cThe above Certificate of Occupancy shall state that the use may be continued indefinitely as long as it conforms to the requirements of Section 13 of these regulations and failure to obtain such Certificate of Occupancy shall be a violation of these Zoning Regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The plaintiff provided the site plan referred to in \u00a7 13.7, and no issue is raised about any failure of his to \u201cindicate sufficient information as required in Section 11.4 to fully define the existing nonconformity.\u201d The defendant commission, however, ultimately concluded that the plaintiff failed to provide sufficient evidence, under \u00a7 13.7, to prove a preexisting continuous nonconforming use.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>In its conclusion that \u00a7 13.7 was unconstitutional, the trial court focused on that language of \u00a7 13.7 which requires \u201csufficient proof as the Zoning Commission may require\u201d to prove the existence of a nonconforming use. The court held that such language \u201cmust necessarily result in unequal and arbitrary application of the section to affected property owners.\u201d We agree. The language in \u00a7 13.7 relied upon by the trial court, even with its reference to such things as tax receipts or sales tax permits, renders \u00a7 13.7 unconstitutional because of its failure to meet the constitutional mandate that a regulation be as reasonably precise as the subject matter requires and as reasonably adequate and sufficient to guide the commission and to enable those affected to know their rights and obligations. See <em>Forest Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra. We reach this conclusion even after examining \u00a7 13 in its entirety. None of the subsections of \u00a7 13 adds sufficient precision to \u00a7 13.7 to allow it to pass constitutional muster.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Section 13.1<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> embodies the statement of purpose of \u00a7 13. Besides defining a nonconforming use, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>building or structure, it merely declares that the fundamental principle of zoning law that nonconformities are not to be expanded is \u201cthe intent of this ordinance.\u201d It also states that \u201c[i]t is the further intent of this ordinance that existing nonconformities shall not cause further departures from the Zoning Ordinance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Section 13.2 is entitled \u201cGeneral Provisions\u201d and has several subsections. Section 13.2.1 provides that \u201c[n]othing in the regulations shall prohibit the continuance of any nonconforming use, building or structure existing at the time of the adoption of these regulations or any amendment thereto\u201d except as otherwise specified. Section 13.2.2<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> states that no conformity shall be deemed to have existed on the date of the ordinance or any amendment thereto unless \u201ca. The nonconformity has been in existence on a continuous basis and to the fullest possible extent\u201d and \u201cb. If such nonconformity is a use, such use had not been abandoned within the meaning of Section 13.6.2.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">Section 13.2.3 merely proclaims that in order to protect the fair interests of all parties, nothing in the ordinance shall be deemed to require a discontinuance of a nonconformity because of mere change of title or possession of property, except in the case of nonconforming lots under \u00a72.12. Section 13.2.4 provides that any nonconforming use located in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>district in which a special exception may be granted for snch a nse under \u00a7 12 of the regulations \u201cmay be continued as a permitted use if a plan is submitted and approved in accordance with Section 13.7 of these regulations.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Sections 13.2.5<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and 13.2.6<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> also hardly contribute to any reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>standard, ascertainable by a use of affected land, toward the determination of what the commission may require in passing upon an application for the establishment of a nonconforming use under \u00a7 13.7. Sections 13.3, 13.4 and 13.5 concern \u201cEnlarging or Moving,\u201d \u201cChange of Use\u201d and \u201cMaintenance and Eestoration of Structures Containing Nonconforming Uses\u201d respectively and an examination of them, because of their focus, yields no standards relevant to a \u00a7 13.7 determination. Section 13.6, entitled \u201cAbandonment of Nonconforming Uses,\u201d contains a definition of abandonment, and provides that any such use, once abandoned, shall not be reestablished. That section also sets out several examples which constitute prima facie evidence of intent to abandon. This section does not aid the defendants in their argument concerning the existence of ascertainable standards in the ordinance for a \u00a7 13.7 determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">In agreeing with the trial court\u2019s conclusion, we do not adopt the defendants\u2019 view of <em>American Power &amp; Light Co. </em>v. <em>S.E.C., </em>329 U.S. 90, 67 S. Ct. 133, 91 L. Ed. 103 (1946), and <em>Ours Properties, Inc. </em>v. <em>Ley, </em>198 Va. 848, 96 S.E.2d 754 (1957), two cases to which both parties refer. The defendants argue that the language sustained in <em>American Power S Light </em>is \u201csimilar in breadth to that of the subject Noank ordinance.\u201d We cannot accept this claim because the language involved in that case, which allegedly set out unconstitutional standards, was reasonably qualified by language that immediately followed the standard attacked.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> This is not so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>here where the granting or denying of a \u00a7 13.7 application is left to the undefined discretion of the commission. The standard of \u201csufficient proof\u201d as the commission \u201cmay require\u201d is set forth without any reasonable parameters.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The defendants also claim that the language sustained in <em>Ours Properties </em>contains \u201ca delegation of fact-finding authority stated in language similar to that of the Noank ordinance at issue.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The defendants argue that the standard in the <em>Ours Properties </em>ordinance, i.e., \u201cfor which satisfactory evidence is presented,\u201d is similar to the language challenged here. In <em>Ours Properties, </em>the Virginia Supreme Court said: \u201cSatisfactory evidence \u2018means evidence which\u2019 frees from doubt, suspense or uncertainty; gives assurance to \u2018sets at rest the mind; * # *.\u2019 Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, Second Edition . . . .\u201d <em>Ours Properties, Inc. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number><em>Ley, </em>supra. After examining the relevant portion of the ordinance in that case, and comparing it with the Noank ordinance, we disagree with the defendants\u2019 claim of similarity. Again, the language that follows the \u201csatisfactory evidence\u201d phrase in <em>Ours Properties </em>is much different from that found in the Noank ordinance. In conclusion, \u00a7 13.7 does not pass the constitutional test necessitating ascertainable standards; the parameters of the commission\u2019s discretion are not as reasonably defined as required.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Neither a reading of the section in context, nor the reference to such things as tax receipts or sales tax permits, save it.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">There is no error in the April appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">We take up now the August appeal which the plaintiff claims, and the defendants deny, is moot. The defendants claim that the trial court erred in holding that the August appeal was moot solely because the court had held \u00a7 13.7 invalid in the other action.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The defendants specifically argue that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>court should have considered \u201cthe status of the Zoning Enforcement Officer\u2019s decision to issue a notice of violation to the plaintiff for the conduct of a commercial boatyard in an area zoned for residential use.\u201d The defendants contend that, in issuing the notice of violation to the plaintiff, the zoning enforcement officer \u201cacted independently from the Zoning Commission under color of provisions other than the disputed \u00a7 13.7.\u201d They maintain that when a property owner or occupant conducts a commercial boatyard in a village residential district, he is in violation of the ordinance concerning which the zoning enforcement officer is empowered to issue a notice of such violation, and whose action is subject to review by the zoning board of appeals. The defendants thus claim that because the zoning enforcement officer acted \u201cindependently\u201d of the zoning commission under \u201ccolor\u201d of provisions other than \u00a7 13.7, the August appeal is not moot. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Under \u00a7 13.7, the zoning commission is the entity that determines whether or not a valid nonconforming use exists; nothing in the ordinance authorizes the zoning enforcement officer to make any such determination. The matter before the defendant board of appeals was the violation notice issued by the zoning enforcement officer on June 19, 1975. That notice was the result of the determination by the commission, under \u00a7 13.7, that the plaintiff had not established a valid nonconforming use under \u00a7 13.7. This was the posture in which the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>board of appeals received and decided<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> that appeal. The zoning enforcement officer did not act independently of the commission; rather he acted as the commission\u2019s agent in issuing the violation notice which was appealed.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> He had no authority under the ordinance to make an independent determination of a nonconforming use. Moreover, we note that \u00a713.7 provides in part that \u201c[u]pon approval of the Zoning Commission that the non-conforming use is in fact a pre-existing non-conforming use, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued . . . Section 19.6 of the regulations, entitled \u201cCertificate of Occupancy,\u201d provides in part \u201ca Certificate of Occupancy [shall be] . . . issued by the Building Inspector . . . .\u201d This underscores the lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>authority of the zoning enforcement officer to issue the certificate of occupancy provided for by \u00a7 13.7. Once \u00a7 13.7 is found to be invalid, we agree with the plaintiff that this determination removes from the Noank fire district zoning regulations the only procedure under those regulations for \u201cdetermining\u201d what constituted a valid nonconforming use.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">With regard to the defendant\u2019s claim that the court erred by not considering the matter of the zoning enforcement officer\u2019s authority to issue a notice of violation under provisions other than \u00a7 13.7, we find no merit. Even if we assume that the pleadings in the August appeal properly raised this issue, this was hardly the theory upon which this appeal was presented to and decided by the trial court. See <em>Machiz </em>v. <em>Homer Harmon, Inc., </em>146 Conn. 523, 525, 152 A.2d 629 (1959); <em>Treat </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>145 Conn. 406, 409, 143 A.2d 448 (1958); <em>Stavola </em>v. <em>Bulkeley, </em>134 Conn. 186, 189, 56 A.2d 645 <em>(1947); </em>Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7 42. It is true that the August appeal was taken to the defendant zoning board of appeals from the \u201cdecision\u201d of the zoning enforcement officer. It is, however, abundantly clear that what was appealed to the zoning board of appeals was not an independent determination of the zoning enforcement officer, but the determination of the zoning commission, acting pursuant to \u00a7 13.7. We have already pointed out that the zoning enforcement officer had no authority to make a determination as to what was, or what was not, a valid preexisting nonconforming use under the ordinance.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> There is, then, no actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>controversy for us to decide under the August appeal. Moreover, the relief which the plaintiff sought in his August appeal had already been granted by the court in his April appeal. Accordingly, the August appeal is moot because of the \u201c \u2018well-settled general rule that the existence of an actual controversy is an essential requisite to appellate jurisdiction; it is not the province of appellate courts to decide moot questions, disconnected from the granting of actual relief or from the determination of which no practical relief can follow.\u2019 \u201d <em>Delevieleuse </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>184 Conn. 434, 436, 439 A.2d 1055 (1981), quoting <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Vroom, </em>130 Conn. 512, 515, 36 A.2d 22 (1944); see <em>Harkins </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em>165 Conn. 407, 409, 334 A.2d 901 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The August appeal <em>(Helbig </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals) </em>is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">There is no error in the April appeal <em>(Helbig </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b308-6\"> The record indicates that this appeal was filed on April 9, 1976.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b308-7\"><em> </em>This appeal also made other attacks on the action of the commission and its zoning enforcement officer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b309-6\"> The defendants filed a petition for certification in each appeal, and we granted both petitions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b309-7\"> For full text of \u00a7 13.7 of the zoning ordinance of the Noank fire district see text, infra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b309-8\"> In its memorandum of decision on the April appeal, the trial court observed that it \u201chas examined the zoning regulations of many towns with reference to the establishment of non-conforming uses and has not found any comparable to Section 13.7 of the Noank Fire District.\u201d In this opinion, we confine our determination of the validity of the Noank fire district regulation to \u00a7 13.7 of the Noank ordinance, without reference to regulations of any other town or district.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b309-9\"> The defendant zoning commission and the defendant zoning board of appeals filed a \u201cconsolidated\u201d brief and reply brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b312-7\"><em> Robert Helbig </em>v. <em>Noank Fire District, </em>No. 53319, filed in the Superior Court, Judicial District of New London, on October 12, 1978.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b313-7\"> The plaintiff claims that he purchased the property relying on the history and use of the property, and the knowledge that (1) the property had been used as a marina before the passage of a zoning ordinance by the Noank fire district, (2) the use as a marina had been continuous since that time, and (3) at the time of its purchase by the plaintiff, the property was being used as a marina.
