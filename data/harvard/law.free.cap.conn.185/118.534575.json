He signed a formal application for a speedy trial, which application became effective on January 9,1980,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> requiring the state to bring the case to trial within 120 days thereafter. General Statutes \u00a754-139(a). On April 24, 1980, Evans Jacobs, the attorney for the defendant, was permitted to withdraw because of a change in position, and the matter was referred to the public defender\u2019s office. At that time the state was ready to proceed with the trial. The trial court tolled the 120-day period \u201cuntil such time as the Public Defender\u2019s Office makes known to the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office that he is prepared to start trial.\u201d On June 2,1980, Douglas Nash, a public defender, filed his appearance for the defendant and on July 17, 1980, filed a motion for speedy trial on constitutional grounds. The trial court granted the motion for speedy trial, which was unopposed by the state, on July 29,1980, and further directed that the case go \u201cbefore Judge Hadden, when they finish a murder case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">On August 8, 1980, Nash was permitted to withdraw because of a conflict of interest, subject to new counsel\u2019s being appointed. Again the state was ready to proceed to trial. The trial court directed that a special public defender be appointed no later than August 15,1980, and tolled the statutory period \u201cuntil new counsel is appointed and that counsel is ready to proceed.\u201d Moreover, the trial court stated that \u201cwhoever is appointed as special public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>defender will be told that this case should proceed as rapidly as possible and it\u2019s to be anticipated that . . . the trial will begin prior to the end of August.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">A special public defender, Peter A. Kelly, was appointed on August 12, 1980, and on September 2, 1980, the trial began. The defendant filed a motion to dismiss the information on the ground that he was not brought to trial within the 120-day limit imposed by General Statutes \u00a7 54-139. The motion was denied on September 9,1980. In denying the motion, the court found that the 120-day period was tolled from April 24 to July 29, 1980, and from August 8 to September 2, 1980, and that the trial had been brought 115 days after the statutory period began to run. After the court denied the motion to dismiss, the defendant pleaded guilty to robbery in the second degree. The defendant has appealed from the denial of his motion to dismiss, claiming that the continuances granted were neither reasonable nor necessary and that, therefore, he was entitled to dismissal of the charges against him pursuant to General Statutes \u00a754-140 (now \u00a754-82d), and the Connecticut and United States constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">The defendant\u2019s first claim of error is that he is statutorily entitled to a dismissal of the charges against him. Under General Statutes \u00a7 54-140, if a criminal trial is not assigned within the statutory period set under \u00a7 54-139(a), the case must be dismissed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a754-139(a) mandated that the state bring a criminal defendant to trial within 120 days of the defendant\u2019s filing of a request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>for speedy trial. The 120-day period, however, may be tolled \u201cfor good cause shown in open court\u201d by \u201cnecessary or reasonable continuance [s].\u201d Whether the two tolling periods in this case were \u201cnecessary or reasonable\u201d are the issues presented. Because \u201creasonable\u201d continuances would satisfy the statutory requirement, we need not consider whether the continuances were also \u201cnecessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">In construing language of the General Statutes, the \u201ccommonly approved usage\u201d should control. General Statutes \u00a71-1 (a); <em>Caldor, Inc. </em>v. <em>Heffernan, </em>183 Conn. 566, 570, 440 A.2d 767 (1981). \u201c \u2018Reasonable\u2019 is a relative term which varies in the context in which it is used, and its meaning may be affected by the facts of the particular controversy. 36 Words &amp; Phrases (1959 Sup.). It is also synonymous with \u2018[e]quitable, fair, just.\u2019 Webster, New International Dictionary (2d Ed.); <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Beacon Valley Rubber Co., </em>56 Conn. 493, 498, 16 A. 554 [1888].\u201d <em>E. M. Loew\u2019s Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Surabian, </em>146 Conn. 608, 612, 153 A.2d 463 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">The first tolling period was between April 24, 1980, when the defendant\u2019s first counsel withdrew, and July 29, 1980, when the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for speedy trial. The defendant does not dispute that a continuance was proper; what the defendant contends is that the duration of the tolling period was unreasonable. According to the continuance order, the termination of the tolling was entirely within the control of the defendant. The public defender need only have notified the state\u2019s attorney that he was ready for trial and the period would have been reinstated. At all times during the tolling the state was ready to proceed and the defendant\u2019s rights were protected. Only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>upon the court\u2019s disposition of the motion did the state\u2019s attorney know that the defendant was ready to proceed. Under these circumstances, it was reasonable for the court to have tolled the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The second tolling period was between August 8, 1980, when the second defense counsel withdrew, and September 2,1980, the date of trial. In granting the continuance, the trial court had ordered that the statute be tolled until new counsel was appointed and ready to proceed. After his appointment on August 13, 1980, defense counsel did nothing to signify his readiness for trial until he appeared in court on September 2, 1980. At all times during the tolling the state was ready to proceed, and it is undisputed that the defendant was adequately represented by counsel. The tolling was, therefore, reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">When reviewing the grant of continuances which toll the statutory period within which to bring a criminal case to trial, this court will find error only if a clear abuse is shown of the trial court\u2019s discretion in finding that a continuance is necessary or reasonable. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Best, </em>171 Conn. 487, 492, 370 A.2d 1035 (1976). There was no abuse of discretion shown in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">The defendant also perfunctorily claims that the denial of the motion to dismiss violates \u201chis state and federal constitutional rights to due process of law.\u201d We have considered this claim and hold that, because the trial court granted reasonable continuances and had proper jurisdiction over the defendant, the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b131-12\"> Section 54-139 (Rev. to 1979) of the General Statutes provided, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b131-13\">\u201cWhenever a person has entered upon a term of imprisonment in a correctional institution of this state and, during the continuance of the term of imprisonment, there is pending in this state any untried . . . information ... he shall be brought to trial within one hundred twenty days after he has caused to be delivered, to the state\u2019s attorney . . . his request for final disposition . . . provided, for good cause shown in open court . . . the court may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b132-7\"> The statutory period begins running from the time the defendant completes delivery of his request for a speedy trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Springer, </em>149 Conn. 244, 250, 178 A.2d 525 (1962).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b133-8\"> General Statutes \u00a754-140 (now \u00a7 54-82d) provided: \u201cIf the action is not assigned for trial within the period of time as herein provided, no court of this state shall any longer have jurisdiction thereof, nor shall the untried indictment or information he of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
