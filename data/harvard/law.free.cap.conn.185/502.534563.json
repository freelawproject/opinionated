The appellant\u2019s motion to intervene was denied by the trial court, and he appeals from that denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">Prospective third party intervenor Allan Dexter Coombs married Brenda Mae Coombs in March, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>1961. The couple then adopted two minor children, Donald Allan and Heather Eleanor. After the Coombs\u2019 divorce in July, 1974, Brenda Coombs married John P. Manter in February, 1975, using thereafter the name of Bonnie Manter. Because of the Manter marriage, Allan Coombs consented to the termination of his parental rights and the adoption of Donald and Heather by John Manter; the termination and adoption agreements were ordered by Probate Court decree on September 9, 1975.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After two years of marriage Bonnie and John Manter were divorced on January 18, 1978, with Bonnie Manter retaining custody of both children. The divorce decree was modified on April 6,1978, to deny John Manter visitation rights. To date he has not challenged that denial or the custody decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Seeking custody or visitation rights,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Allan Coombs moved on February 13,1979, to intervene in the divorce action of <em>Manter </em>v. <em>Manter </em>under General Statutes \u00a7 46b-57, which permits interested third parties to intervene in custody controversies before the Superior Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At a preliminary hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>ing the trial court on April 2 granted Coombs standing for the expressly limited purpose of a visitation study by the family relations office. By supplemental order dated October 1,1979, the court denied the motion to intervene on the dual grounds that no present dispute was then before the court and no facts were presented to qualify Coombs as an interested party under \u00a7 46b-57. Coombs now appeals from that denial of his motion to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"AAi\">General Statutes \u00a7 46b-57 assigns the court discretionary power to permit intervention upon motion by \u201cany interested third party or parties.\u201d A prerequisite to that intervention, however, is the existence of a controversy. Although the prospective intervenor argues that Bonnie Manter\u2019s opposition to his motion itself generates the necessary controversy, the statute does not support that reading. Section 46b-57 permits intervention \u201c[i]n any controversy before the superior court as to the custody of minor children, and on any complaint under this chapter or section 46b-l or 54-27.\u201d* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> **7Read in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>accordance with customary usage, this language clearly requires the controversy to precede the motion and to exist independently of it. Intervention is \u201ca device which enables one who was not originally a party to an action to become such a party on his own initiative.\u201d James &amp; Hazard, Civil Procedure (2d Ed.) $ 10.19, p. 511. The intervenor\u2019s posture is derivative; he assumes his role only by virtue of an action already shaped by the original parties. He must, therefore, take his controversy as he finds it and may not use his own claims to restyle or resuscitate their action. See <em>National Bank of Commerce of New London </em>v. Howland, 128 Conn. 307, 312-13, 22 A.2d 773 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>The controversy in which Coombs seeks to intervene is the divorce of Bonnie and John Manter. Their divorce decree was issued on January 18,1978 and modified on April 6, 1978, when John Manter was denied visitation rights. Coombs\u2019 motion to intervene was filed on February 13, 1979, thirteen months after the divorce decree and ten months after the modification. We need not now determine the precise moment at which the controversy surrounding a divorce deeree expires. In the circumstances of this case, the trial court could reasonably have concluded that no controversy existed when Coombs attempted to intervene. Where a statute provides that a court \u201cmay allow\u201d intervention under specified conditions, that court exercises discretion in determining the timeliness of the intervention. See <em>Lettieri </em>v. <em>American Savings Bank, </em>182 Conn. 1, 13, 437 A.2d 822 (1980); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Ricker, </em>172 Conn. 572, 575 n.3, 375 A.2d 1034 (1977); 37 A.L.R.2d 1306 (1954); cf. James <em>&amp; </em>Hazard, supra, 516. There was no abuse of that discretion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Since we agree that Coombs\u2019 motion was barred by the absence of a controversy, we should not in this case attempt to define the varieties of interest that would authorize intervention under \u00a7 46b-57. We do, however, observe that under its mandate to give \u201cparamount consideration in custody matters\u201d to the child\u2019s welfare; <em>Simons </em>v. Simons, 172 Conn. 341, 347, 374 A.2d 1040 (1977); the court may employ a flexible test of interest in harmony with the broad language of the statute. See <em>Presutti </em>v. <em>Presutti, </em>181 Conn. 622, 626-27, 436 A.2d 299 (1980).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>The traditional family model, never itself strictly limited to the nuclear unit, is today one among numerous variations on the extended family. See <em>Moore </em>v. <em>East Cleveland, </em>431 U.S. 494, 504-506, 97 S. Ct. 1932, 52 L. Ed. 2d 531 (1977); Zaharoff, \u201cAccess to Children: Towards a Model Statute for Third Parties,\u201d 15 Pam. L.Q. 165, 185-89 (1981). Courts in other jurisdictions have responded by granting visitation rights to such nontraditional parties as stepparents where the child\u2019s welfare dictated that result. See, e.g., <em>Looper </em>v. <em>McManus, </em>581 P.2d 487, 489 (Okla. Ct. App. 1978); <em>Spells </em>v. <em>Spells, </em>250 Pa. Super. 168, 172, 378 A.2d 879 (1977); 1 A.L.R.4th 1270 (1980). Our decision today is in no way intended to prejudge future interpretations of the phrase \u201cinterested third party\u201d under \u00a7 46b-57 where the controversy requirement is met and the trial court finds a prospective intervenor to have a significant concern for the welfare of the child. See Zaharoff, supra, 194-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">In this opinion Speziale, C.

In hearings before the Judiciary Committee, Samuel Sehoonmaker, Chairman of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>the Family Law Committee of the Connecticut Bar Association and one of the drafters of the statute, testified that \u201c[w]e also provide that in the case that neither party is in a position or fit to take charge of children parties who might be in a better position be permitted to come to court to have their case heard and if appropriate the judge could award custody and visitation rights to others such as grandparents, uncles and aunts and other people of that kind.\u201d Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 1, 1973 Sess., p. 209. There is no testimony further explaining the standards for intervention or defining \u201cother people of that kind.\u201d See also McAnerney <em>&amp; </em>Sehoonmaker, \u201cConnecticut\u2019s New Approach to Marriage Dissolution,\u201d 47 Conn. B.J. 375, 405-406 (1973): \u201cThe power of the court to award custody or visitation rights to third parties may, as a practical matter, be rarely used, but its existence underscores the philosophy that the court should go to whatever length it deems necessary to promote a child\u2019s welfare . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b521-6\">Parskey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ApI\">(concurring). Although I am prepared in a proper case to consider whether the language of General Statutes \u00a7 46b-57 is broad enough to encompass other than legal interests for the purpose of intervention in custody proceedings, I do not regard this case as appropriate for such consideration. While it is true that the third party \u201cintervenor\u201d had been an adoptive parent, the record discloses that he consented to the termination of his parental rights. His present claim that such consent was given under duress is not properly raised in a motion to intervene. The proper way to raise such claims is by filing, in a timely fashion, a motion to reopen and vacate the termination judgment. Failing that, the third party \u201cintervenor\u201d must be treated in the present case as a legal stranger.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Because the \u201cintervenor,\u201d nevertheless, presses a claim for intervention based on a broad view of \u201cinterest,\u201d additional observations are suggested. What appears on the surface as simply a problem of statutory construction on closer analysis involves more complex issues. To start with, assuming the existence of a present controversy, the immediate litigants are parents, each of whom possesses a constitutional right. The right of a parent to the companionship, care, custody and management of his or her children is not a mere lagniappe that comes with the relationship. Rather it is an essential constitutional right which warrants deference and, in the absence of a powerful countervailing interest, pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>tection. <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>405 U.S. 645, 651, 92 S. Ct. 1208, 31 L. Ed. 2d 551 (1972). The corollary to this proposition is that in any controversy \"between a possessor of a constitutionally protected custodial right and a possessor of a lesser interest, ordinarily the latter must give way.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Organization of Foster Families for Equality and Reform, </em>431 U.S. 816, 847, 97 S. Ct. 2094, 53 U. Ed. 2d 14 (1977); <em>Hao Thi Popp </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>182 Conn. 545, 551, 438 A.2d 755 (1980). Because I do not read the court\u2019s opinion as standing for the proposition that the flexible interest test for intervention would give the trial court discretion, under the rubric of \u201cthe best interests of the child,\u201d to override a person\u2019s constitutional parental rights in favor of such intervening party I concur both in the opinion and the result. See <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (Anonymous), </em>181 Conn. 638, 648, 436 A.2d 290 (1980) <em>(Parskey, J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b522-10\"> To what extent, if any, parental rights might be attenuated in a case in which a grandparent seeks visitation rights pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-59 need not be addressed at this time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
