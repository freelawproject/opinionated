J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQK\">In August, 1979, the defendant applied for a permit to add a second story to his restaurant. The proposed addition would intrude into the approach zone of runway 11-29 at Sikorsky Memorial Airport, which is owned and operated by the city of Bridgeport but located wholly within the town of Stratford. The Stratford town attorney notified the named plaintiff (commissioner) of the defendant\u2019s application. The commissioner objected that allowing the proposed construction would endanger air safety. The town attorney replied that he found no legal justification to refuse the application. The defendant was issued a building permit. Midway through construction, the commissioner obtained an ex parte temporary injunction prohibiting the defendant from increasing the height of the restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">The commissioner sought a permanent injunction. In his complaint the commissioner alleged that the addition would constitute an airport hazard as defined in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a715-34 (8)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 15-88 (b), and that this addition would be in violation of \u00a715-41-31 (d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies. The city of Bridgeport <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>intervened as a plaintiff. From a judgment granting the permanent injunction, the defendant has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The trial court found that the plaintiffs had established irreparable injury and the absence of an adequate remedy at law. The court further found that the defendant has not established a \u201ctaking\u201d of his property without just compensation in violation of the Connecticut and United States constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The first issue is whether the plaintiffs are barred from seeking an injunction because of their failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The State Building Code provides, in part: \u201cWhen a person other than such owner claims to be aggrieved by any decision of the building official, such person or his authorized agent may appeal, in writing, from the decision of the building officials to the board of appeals . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 19-402'.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Where a party has a right of appeal from a decision of an administrative agency, he may not instead bring an independent action to test the very issue which the appeal was designed to test. <em>Country Lands, Inc. </em>v. <em>Swinnerton, </em>151 Conn. 27, 33, 193 A.2d 483 (1963). A party, however, need not exhaust an administrative remedy that would be inadequate. <em>Bianco </em>v. <em>Darien, </em>157 Conn. 548, 554, 254 A.2d 898 (1969). The trial court found, and we agree, that a municipal board of appeals is ill-equipped to decide the issues involved in the complex statutory scheme governing aeronautics. See <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>178 Conn. 173, 178, 422 A.2d 290 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">A court may not grant an injunction unless the complainant\u2019s right is clear. See 42 Am. Jur. 2d, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Injunctions \u00a7 28. Under the present circumstances we conclude that the plaintiffs are not entitled to have the defendant permanently enjoined from erecting an addition to his restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">We note that there are no airport zoning ordinances involved in this case. Sections 15-88 through 15-97 of the General Statutes set forth a scheme authorizing zoning to regulate airport hazards. Section 15-91 (e) provides: \u201cIf any municipality fails to adopt airport zoning regulations within a reasonable time, the commissioner may, for the protection of public safey, adopt and from time to time as may be necessary amend or repeal such regulations for such municipality until airport zoning regulations herein provided for are adopted by such municipality.\u201d The statutes do not require the commissioner to adopt airport zoning ordinances. Neither the commissioner, nor the town of Stratford, has adopted such ordinances.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore the plaintiffs cannot invoke \u00a7\u00a7 15-88 through 15-97 to support their action for an injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The commissioner next contends that \u00a7\u00a7 15-44 and 15-74, which are part of chapter 266, authorize the injunction. Section 15-44 provides: \u201cThe commissioner and aeronautics inspectors of the department, and each state, county and municipal officer charged with the enforcement of state and municipal laws shall enforce and assist in the enforcement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>of this chapter and of all regulations made pursuant thereto, and of all other laws of this state relating to aeronautics.\u201d The only regulation which the commissioner relies upon is \u00a715-41-31 (d), concerning standards for commercial airports, which provides: \u201cApproach standards. The entire landing area shall be suitable for safe operations of aircraft under normal wind conditions. The landing area shall have approaches to all landing strips permitting a glide ratio of at least twenty to one and a transitional surface of at least seven to one.\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a715-41-31 (d). That section defines the minimum standards for commercial airport design and layout. Nothing in the regulation, however, restricts the rights of an adjacent landowner, or specifies the manner in which the airport is to secure safe approaches. For that, we must turn to the rest of the aeronautics statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">The aeronautics laws, in addition to chapter 266 (title 15), include \u00a7\u00a7 13b-39 through 13b-50 of chapter 242. Chapter 242 is the Transportation Act. We make every effort to construe a statutory scheme as a consistent whole. <em>Rustici </em>v. <em>Stonington, 174 </em>Conn. 10, 13, 381 A.2d 532 (1977). Section 15-73,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> dealing with airport protection privileges, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>states that where it is necessary in order to provide unobstructed airspace for landing or taking off at an airport, the commissioner for a state airport, or the municipality for a municipal airport, can acquire interests in airport hazards \u201cin the same manner as is provided for the acquisition of property for airport purposes . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Sikorsky Memorial Airport is a municipal airport owned by the city of Bridgeport. In the case of municipal airports General Statutes \u00a7 15-73 grants to the plaintiff municipality, the city of Bridgeport, the power to acquire easements in airspace. The sections that govern the procedures for the acquisition of property for airport purposes are contained in \u00a7\u00a7 13b-39 through 13b-50 of the Transportation Act. The city of Bridgeport must comply with \u00a7 13b-43.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 13b-43, Bridgeport <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>must obtain the approval of the town of Stratford, and pay the defendant just compensation for the interest taken. It has not done so. Sections 15-73 and 13b-43 provide a vehicle for a municipality to acquire interests in airport hazards to ensure the safe and efficient operation of an airport. The legislature, when it enacted \u00a7 15-73, explicitly granted the commissioner this power for airports acquired or operated by the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Section 15-74 provides, in part: \u201cThe commissioner shall cause notice to be given to the owner or person responsible for the existence of any obstacle so located as to constitute a hazard to aerial navig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>ation or to the efficient or safe use of any airport, requiring such owner or other person to remove such obstacle within such reasonable time as is fixed by said commissioner. The owner or owners of such airport shall pay to the owner of such obstacle just compensation for such removal . . . .\u201d This section grants the commissioner the power to compel removal of hazards for municipal as well as state acquired or operated airports. It does not, however, explicitly contain many of the procedures found in other sections dealing with the acquisition of interests in airport hazards. For example, in contrast to \u00a7 13b-43, it does not explicitly require the approval <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>of the mnnicipality in which such interests are located and, in contrast to \u00a7 15-73, it does not explicitly require the publication in detailed form of the standards by which the commissioner will make determinations. Because repeals by implication are disfavored we have managed with difficulty to answer the question raised by this appeal without reading \u00a7 15-74 out of the aeronautics law.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">The predecessor to \u00a7 15-74 was enacted into law by Public Acts 1929, e. 236, \u00a7 5. The predecessor to \u00a7 15-73 was enacted into law by Public Acts, Spec. Sess., May, 1946, No. 10, \u00a7 36. Sections 13b-43 and 13b-44 were enacted into law by Public Acts 1969, No. 768, \u00a7\u00a7 38 and 39. Sections 15-73, 13b-43 and 13b-44, therefore, were passed after \u00a7 15-74. To the extent that \u00a7 15-74 and \u00a7 15-73 may conflict, \u00a7 15-73 would control because it is both more recent and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>more specific.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>East Haven </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>159 Conn. 453, 467, 271 A.2d 110 (1970); <em>Connelly </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>104 Conn. 238, 253, 132 A. 690 (1926); <em>Fair Haven &amp; Westville R. Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>75 Conn. 442, 446, 53 A. 960 (1903), aff\u2019d, 203 U.S. 379, 27 S. Ct. 74, 51 L. Ed. 237 (1906); Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed.) \u00a7 23.09.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Section 15-74 applies to all airports, while \u00a7 15-73 applies only to state acquired or operated and municipal airports. Section 15-74 is not inconsistent with \u00a7\u00a7 15-73, 13b-43 and 13b-44 to the extent it applies to nonstate, nonmunicipal airports. It is also not inconsistent with \u00a7\u00a7 15-73, 13b-43 and 13b-44, in requiring just compensation to be paid to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>the owner of the hazard. Furthermore, \u00a7 15-74 avoids another potential conflict with \u00a7 15-73, unless we read into \u00a715-73 a prohibition on the commissioner\u2019s removal of hazards at municipal airports. We cannot manufacture such a conflict and therefore we conclude that \u00a7\u00a7 15-73, 13b-43 and 13b-44 do not cover the whole field of removing municipal airport hazards.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The circumstances of this appeal do not require us to decide whether \u00a7 15-74 allows the commissioner to remove municipal airport hazards by means which amount to the acquisition of an interest in the hazard. Even if \u00a7 15-74 allows removal by such means, it would not authorize a permanent injunction under the circumstances of this case. The legislature could not reasonably have intended to require more restrictive procedures when the commissioner acquires an interest in hazards at state acquired or operated airports and when a municipality acquires an interest in hazards at a municipal airport than when the commissioner acquires an interest in hazards at a municipal or other nonstate airport. Therefore if we were to construe \u00a7 15-74 to permit the commissioner to acquire an interest in a municipal airport hazard, we would also construe it to require the same procedural restrictions as \u00a7 15-73 before the commissioner could do so.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because obtaining a permanent injunction with respect to an airport hazard is the functional equivalent of acquiring an interest in the hazard, the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>erred in granting the plaintiffs snch relief before they complied with the necessary preliminary procedure.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b158-9\"> \u201c 'Airport hazard\u2019 means any structure, object of natural growth or use of land which obstructs the air space required for the flight of aircraft in landing or taking off at any airport or restricted landing area or is otherwise hazardous to such landing or taking-off.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 15-34(8).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b158-10\"> See text, infra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b160-7\"> The validity of airport zoning ordinances is discussed in Bohannon, \u201cAirport Easements,\u201d 54 Va.

Where necessary in order to provide unobstructed air space for the landing and taking-off of aireaft, in case of airports and restricted landing areas acquired or operated by the state, the commissioner, and, in case of municipal airports, the municipality, is granted authority to acquire, in the same manner as is provided for the acquisition of property for airport purposes, easements through or other interests in air space over land or water, interests in airport hazards outside the boundaries of the airports or restricted landing areas, and such other airport protection privileges as are necessary to insure safe approaches to the landing areas of such airports and restricted landing areas and the safe and efficient operation thereof. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>He is empowered to acquire in the same manner the right of easement for a term of years or perpetually to place or maintain suitable marks for the daytime marking and suitable lights for the nighttime marking of airport hazards for the purpose of maintaining and repairing such lights and marks.

We reject this approach. The legislature has set forth a scheme requiring compensation whether or not the acts of the state or municipality amount to a constitutional \u201ctaking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">The predecessor to \u00a7\u00a7 13b-43 and 13b-44 was \u00a7 15-79. Section 15-79, until it was repealed, provided a similar scheme of airport <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>expansion and improvement for both state and municipal airports. The present statutes treat expansion of airports by municipalities and by the state differently. Section 13b-43 applies to municipalities while \u00a7 13b-44 applies to the state. General Statutes \u00a7 13b-44 provides : \u201cESTABLISHMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF STATE AIRPORTS. (a) The state may establish, maintain and operate, and may expand, an airport at any location within the state in the following manner. The commissioner shall conduct and complete a study of the adequacy of existing airports, which study may be based upon the study authorized under section 13b-16, and shall determine the necessity for the establishment of additional airports or the expansion of existing airports. The commissioner shall, within one year of the completion of such study, formulate and adopt a plan of development which shall incorporate the findings of such study, showing the necessity for such establishment or expansion, in a manner consistent with the comprehensive long-range master transportation plan. The plan of development shall specify the lands or interests therein .the acquisition of which the commissioner deems necessary for such establishment or expansion and a copy of such plan of development shall be filed in the office of the town clerk of each municipality in which such establishment or expansion is proposed.</p>\n<p id=\"ASR\">\u201c(b) The commissioner shall cause a public hearing to be held at the expense of the department in each municipality in which such lands or interests therein are located. At such hearing the commissioner shall present and explain the plan of development, and any persons who are opposed to such plan may be heard and may state their reasons therefor. Such hearing shall be held not earlier than thirty days after such plan has been filed in the office of the town clerk of the municipality. Notice of the time and place of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>hearing shall be published in a newspaper having a substantial circulation in such municipality at least twice, at intervals of not less than two days, the first not more than fifteen days nor less than ten days and the second not less than two days before such hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">\u201c(c) Upon the completion of such hearing, the commissioner shall consider all the evidence relevant to the proposed plan of development, and if he determines that the airport establishment or expansion provided in the plan is necessary, shall make such changes or modifications in the plan as are in the public interest. The commissioner shall file a copy of the revised plan, showing the changes or modifications made, in the office of the town clerk of the municipality and shall notify and send a copy of such revised plan to the chief executive officer or first selectman of such municipality. Such notice shall contain the request that the municipality approve the proposed establishment or expansion, which approval shall be by vote of a town or borough, and by vote of the city council of a city.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">\u201c(d) If the municipality fails or neglects to act upon a request for approval within sixty days after the receipt thereof by its chief executive officer or first selectman, the municipality shall be deemed to have approved of such establishment or expansion. If the municipality by vote disapproves of the establishment or expansion, the commissioner may, within thirty days following such vote, appeal to the superior court for the judicial district in which the municipality is located and the appeal shall be accorded a privileged status on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>docket and trial list. The court shall, after hearing, determine whether the commissioner has proven the necessity for the establishment or expansion of an airport within the municipality and the burden of proving such necessity shall be upon the commissioner. If the court, after hearing, determines that the commissioner has not sustained such burden of proof, the court shall enter judgment for, and may award reasonable costs to, the municipality. If the court, after hearing, determines that the commissioner has sustained such burden of proof, the court may set aside the action of the municipality disapproving the establishment or expansion and may enter such order upon such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate to safeguard the rights of the parties and the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">\u201c(e) After a plan has been legally approved, or its disapproval has been set aside by the superior court, the state may take any lands or interests therein contained in the plan upon paying just compensation to the owner. In case the state cannot agree with such owner upon the amount of such compensation, the amount shall be determined in the manner prescribed in section 48-12. An appeal from the amount so determined shall not act as a stay of the taking of such land, provided no facility or land or interest therein held by a public service company for service to the public shall be so taken or removed unless, at the expense of the state, an adequate and equal substitute approved by the department of public utility control shall first be provided.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b166-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 15-74 was amended, in minor aspects, both simultaneously with and subsequent to the passage of \u00a7\u00a7 15-73, 13b-43 and 13b-44.
