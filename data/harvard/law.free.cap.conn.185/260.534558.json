Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATq\">After a trial to a jury, the defendant was found guilty of robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>\u00a7 53a-134 (a) (3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant has appealed from the judgment rendered on the verdict and claims error in two respects. He contends (1) that the court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of larceny in the third degree; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-124;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>the instructions to the jury were misleading and confusing on the issue of whether the defendant was an aider and abettor under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts: Stephen Wabunoha, a Ugandan refugee, came to this country with his wife and children on December 18, 1977. He and his family moved into an apartment in New Haven after Christmas, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">On January 31, 1978, at approximately 8 p.m., Wabunoha walked from his apartment to a nearby store to buy some milk for his family. Finding the store closed, he stopped in a bar to have a drink; he had recently learned of the death of his father. He had been speaking with two men in the bar when Donald Mack entered and greeted Wabunoha. Mack, at an earlier date, had introduced himself to Wabunoha and had previously asked Wabunoha for money. Wabunoha, at one time, had given him fifty cents. On the present occasion, Mack again asked Wabunoha for money. After Wabunoha gave him fifty cents, Mack left the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">At approximately 9 p.m., Wabunoha left the bar and again encountered Mack. Mack invited Wabunoha to meet his \u201ccousin\u201d who lived on Hallock Street. When they arrived at an apartment at 31 Hallock Street, Wabunoha and Mack were let in by the defendant, who was then introduced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>to Wabnnoha. The defendant returned to a couch in the living room where he had been lying while Mack and Wabunoha entered the kitchen. The kitchen was approximately fifteen to twenty feet from the couch.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Prior to entering the apartment, Mack had told Wabunoha to place his watch in the pocket of his overcoat. Once in the kitchen, Wabunoha removed his coat and placed it over a chair. Mack left the kitchen and traveled from the living room into the bedroom and back to the kitchen a number of times before he left the apartment to retrieve a glove which Wabunoha said that he had dropped on the stairway leading to the apartment. Upon returning, Mack left the kitchen for the last time before returning with a drawn knife demanding Wabunoha\u2019s watch and money.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Mack approached Wabunoha with the knife in his right hand, blade extended, and brought the blade to within a foot of Wabunoha\u2019s neck. Wabunoha became very upset and started yelling and screaming. The defendant then entered the kitchen from the living room and joined Mack in demanding Wabunoha\u2019s watch and wallet.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>The defendant held Wabunoha\u2019s hand while Mack removed Wabunoha\u2019s wallet from his rear pants pocket. The defendant and Mack both demanded to know why Wabunoha had not admitted that he had money in his wallet. Mack then took the watch from Wabunoha\u2019s outercoat pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Wabunoha became hysterical and begged Mack and the defendant not to kill him. The defendant ordered Wabunoha to leave but Wabunoha refused because he feared that the defendant and Mack would follow and kill him. The defendant helped Wabunoha to his feet and gave him a drink of gin to calm him down.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">After approximately three hours of pleading with Mack and the defendant for the return of his property, Wabunoha was walked outside by the two and in the direction of Wabunoha\u2019s apartment because Wabunoha was not familiar with the streets. The defendant returned Wabunoha\u2019s wallet but it did not contain the forty-five dollars that Wabunoha had in it.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">At trial, the jury were instructed on the elements of robbery in the first,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> second<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and third degrees,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and on aiding and abetting of a robbery.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>defendant\u2019s first claim of error relates to the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on larceny in the third degree as a lesser included offense of robbery in the first degree. Specifically, the defendant claims that all four elements of the test we enunciated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 588, 427 A.2d 414 (1980), which was made more precise in <em>State </em>v. <em>Tinsley, </em>181 Conn. 388, 397n, 435 A.2d 1002 (1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1086, 101 S. Ct. 874, 66 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1981), were satisfied, thus entitling him to an instruction on larceny in the third degree.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>A defendant is entitled to an instruction on a lesser offense only if each of the following four conditions are met: \u201c(1) an appropriate instruction is requested by either the state or the defendant; (2) it is not possible to commit the greater offense, in the manner described in the information or bill of particulars, without having first committed the lesser; (3) the evidence, introduced by either the state or the defendant, or by a combination of their proofs, justifies conviction of the lesser offense; and (4) the proof on the element or elements which differentiate the lesser offense from the offense charged is sufficiently in dispute to permit the jury consistently to find the defendant innocent of the greater offense but guilty of the lesser.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Kolinsky, </em>182 Conn. 533, 544, 438 A.2d 733 (1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 973, 101 S. Ct. 2054, 68 L. Ed. 2d 354 (1981), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Tinsley, </em>supra, 396-97; <em>State </em>v. <em>Morin, </em>180 Conn. 599, 601, 430 A.2d 1297 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>185 Conn. 63, 77, 441 A.2d 84 (1981). A refusal to charge will be justified if any of the four conditions is not satisfied. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kolinsky, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra, 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Under the second prong of <em>Whistnant, </em>the defendant would be entitled to a eharge on larceny in the third degree if it is not possible to commit the greater offense, in the manner described in the information or bill of particulars, without having first committed the lesser. <em>State </em>v. <em>Tinsley, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra, 588. The information charged that \u201cWilbert Cannon and Donald <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Mack, another participant in the crime, did commit a robbery of Stephen Wabunoha and in the course of the commission of the crime Donald Mack used and threatened the use of a dangerous instrument, to wit: a knife, in violation of Section 53a-134 (a) (3) of the General Statutes.\u201d The defendant, as was his right, did not move for a bill of particulars. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 830 through 833.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The second prong of <em>Whistnant </em>has not been satisfied in this case because it is possible to commit the greater offense in the manner described in the information, without having first committed the lesser. This is so because General Statutes \u00a7 53a-124<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> provides in relevant part that \u201c(a) A person is guilty of larceny in the third degree when: (1) The value of the property or service exceeds fifty dollars . . . .\u201d Clearly, the lesser offense of larceny in the third degree requires proof of an element, i.e., value of the property taken to exceed fifty dollars, which robbery in the first degree does not. Thus, this precludes our finding here that larceny in the third degree is a lesser included offense of robbery in the first degree.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The defendant\u2019s second claim of error rests on the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury regarding the defendant\u2019s status as an aider and abettor under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Basically, the defendant argues (1) that the court did not sufficiently relate its aiding and abetting instructions to its robbery instructions, and (2) that the trial court\u2019s supplemental instructions on aiding and abetting were delivered in such a manner as to read the requirement of proving criminal intent out of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The court, at trial, gave a lengthy instruction to the jury, including specific instructions on the elements of robbery in the first, second and third degrees, and an instruction, requested by the defendant, on aiding and abetting.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> During their deliberations, the jury requested supplemental instructions on the differences between the crimes of robbery in the first, second and third degrees, and on the need for proof of the defendant\u2019s criminal intent. In addition, the jury twice requested an explanation of the aiding and abetting statute \u00a7 53a-8 and once asked for the difference between the crimes of robbery in the first degree and aiding and abetting. The court duly responded to each inquiry from the jury. \u201cTo determine whether an error in a charge constitutes reversible error, the court must consider the whole charge. <em>Cupp </em>v. <em>Naughten, </em>414 U.S. 141, 147, 94 S. Ct. 396, 38 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1973); <em>State </em>v. <em>Piskorski, </em>177 Conn. 677, 746, 419 A.2d 866 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>173 Conn. 35, 40, 376 A.2d 391 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>172 Conn. 65, 69, 372 A.2d 154 (1976); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ralls, </em>167 Conn. 408, 422, 356 A.2d 147 (1974). In appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>not involving a constitutional question the court must determine whether it is reasonably probable that the jury were misled; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ralls, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Tropiano, </em>158 Conn. 412, 427, 262 A.2d 147, cert. denied, 398 U.S. 949, 90 S. Ct. 1866, 26 L. Ed. 2d 288 (1970); <em>Penna </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>154 Conn. 212, 215, 224 A.2d 536 (1966); <em>Allard </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>151 Conn. 284, 292, 197 A.2d 69 (1964)....\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>182 Conn. 262, 267-68, 438 A.2d 80 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">A charge to the jury will not be critically dissected for the purpose of discovering possible inaccuracies of statements, but the charge is to be considered, rather, as to its probable effect upon the jury in guiding them to a correct verdict in the case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 268; <em>State </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>172 Conn. 223, 226, 374 A.2d 203 (1977). The ultimate test of a court\u2019s main and supplemental instructions is whether, taken as a whole; <em>State </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>174 Conn. 287, 308, 386 A.2d 243 (1978); they fairly and adequately presented the case to the jury in such a way that injustice is not done to either party under the established rules of law. <em>State </em>v. <em>Tinsley, </em>supra, 396; <em>State </em>v. <em>Harden, </em>175 Conn. 315, 321-22, 398 A.2d 1169 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">The defendant claims that the trial court \u201cmade no attempt to connect\u201d the instructions on aiding and abetting with its previous instructions on the various degrees of robbery. He states that, as a result of the manner and sequence in which the instructions were delivered, the jury were confused on the required mental intent needed to be proved in order to be found guilty on aiding and abetting. Additionally, the defendant contends that the jury were also confused as to whether mere presence at the scene of the crime established guilt as an aider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>and abettor. The defendant, in Ms brief, claims that the court\u2019s instructions \u201cwere confusing and contradictory so that there was both a reasonable probability and possibility that the jury was misled. <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>182 Conn. 262, 268, 438 A.2d 80 (1980).\u201d The defendant attempts to reinforce tMs \u201cjury confusion\u201d issue by pointing out that the jury twice asked to be reinstructed on the aiding and abetting statute. Upon reviewing both the main and supplemental instructions taken as a whole, we find no merit to the defendant\u2019s claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">The record demonstrates that the court, both initially and subsequently, emphasized that mere presence at the scene of the crime does not constitute guilt as an aider and abettor, and that a person is not guilty under the aiding and abetting statute unless he possesses the requisite criminal intent or unlawful purpose.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The court also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>directed attention to the fact that the aiding and abetting statute was to be treated separately from the robbery statutes by stating, \u201caiding and abetting is a separate and distinct statute that is to be used in conjunction with the other sections I read to you.\u201d The mere fact that a jury requests reinstruction is not unusual, especially in a situation such as this, where the charge includes a number of sep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>arate and differing degrees of crimes to be considered. We believe that, if anything, these requests demonstrate the jury\u2019s conscientiousness and not their confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The second branch of the defendant\u2019s claim of error directed to the charge merits little discussion. Here the defendant argues that a portion of the court\u2019s charge in effect read out of the statute the requisite of proof of criminal intent.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Initially, the court gave a detailed charge on robbery in the first, second and third degrees, including the required mental states necessary to prove guilt. The court then instructed the jury on aiding and abetting and stated: \u201cTo find him guilty, you must, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>however, decide that he did more than being [sic] inactively present at the commission of the crime, or passively acquiescing in it, or innocently performing certain acts which in fact did aid in the commission of the offense. Unless there was a criminality of intent and an unlawful purpose or purposes in common with the actual perpetrator of the crime, he is not guilty under the statute.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Upon the jury\u2019s request, the court gave a supplemental instruction on each element of robbery and again referred to the requisite mental state. The court also reinstructed the jury on aiding and abetting and, in response to a specific request by the jury, reinstrueted on the element of proof of an accomplice\u2019s criminal intent.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> A final instruction was given concerning the aiding and abetting statute and the jury returned its verdict shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>In view of the numerous repetitions of the various charges, we believe that the jury were aware of the need to find the requisite criminal intent in order to find the defendant guilty of aiding and abetting under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018Of necessity, additional instructions given in immediate response to a request are more informal and expressed with less exactness than are studiously prepared formal charges.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>114 Conn. 354, 368, 158 A. 797 [1932].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>163 Conn. 527, 536, 316 A.2d 387 (1972). The charge, in its 'entirety, was correct in law and fairly presented the case to the jury. <em>State </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>supra, 308; <em>State </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>supra, 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b273-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (3) provides: \u201crobbery in the first degree: class b felony, (a) A person is guilty of robbery in the first degree when, in the course of the commission of the crime or of immediate flight therefrom, he or another participant in the crime ...

(\u201cA defendant is entitled to an instruction on a lesser offense <em>if, and, only if, </em>the following conditions are met.\u201d [Emphasis added.]) No such request to charge was submitted by either the state or the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b280-6\"> See footnote 3, supra. The information charged the defendant with robbery in the first degree as a principal and the state claims that the evidence at the trial was sufficient to support the defendant\u2019s conviction as a principal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b280-7\"> In oral argument before us the defendant\u2019s counsel admits that his request to charge on aiding and abetting, which he says was \u201cliberal,\u201d was given by the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b282-7\"> The court, in its main charge, stated: \u201cThis is the aiding and abetting section, Section 53a-8 of our Connecticut statutes. That statute provides, a person, acting with the mental state required for commission of an offense, who solicits, requests, commands, importunes or intentionally aids another person to engage in conduct which constitutes an offense shall be criminally liable for such conduct and may be prosecuted and punished as if he were the principal offender.. ..</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">\u201cThe words of the statute are, I think, clear, except perhaps as regards the word \u2018importune\u2019; and there the question is, did he encourage and incite the commission of this crime? To find him guilty, you must, however, decide that he did more than being [sic] inactively present at the commission of the crime, or passively acquiescing in it, or innocently performing certain acts which in fact did aid in the commission of the offense. Unless there was a criminality of intent and an unlawful purpose or purposes in common with the actual perpetrator of the crime, he is not guilty under the statute. Thus, if in this ease you should find that one of the defendants did something which really assisted in accomplishing the crime, but in doing it, because of his ignorance of the existence of some material facts, he did not realize that the doing of the act was in aid of the commission of the crime, then the doing of that act would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>make him guilty of the crime because it was not done with any criminal intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">\u201cFurthermore, whether a person who is present at the commission of a crime aids or abets its commission is a question of faet, the answer to which depends on the circumstances surrounding his presence and conduct both before the commission of the crime, during the commission of the crime, and after the commission of the crime. In this regard, I should admonish you that the mere fact that a person knew or had reason to believe a crime was being committed or about to be committed and was at or near the place where in fact a crime was committed does not warrant a finding of guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">The court also had previously said: \u201cNow, an accomplice must be found to be present and actively aiding or assisting in the crime. More presence of an inactive companion, passive acquiescence, or the doing of innocent acts which may in fact aid the one who commits the crime, does not constitute such aid within the meaning of the code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">Upon its first reinstruction, the court stated: \u201cYou have asked for the aiding and abetting statute, and I have permission to give it to you by both counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">\u201cThe statute provides, a person, acting with the mental state required for commission of an offense, who solicits, requests, commands, importunes or intentionally aids another person to engage in conduct which constitutes an offense shall be criminally liable for such conduct and may be prosecuted and punished as if ho were the principal offender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-12\">Upon second reinstruction, the court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b283-13\">\u201cQuestion 4: \u2018Please explain the section on aiding and abetting again. Is there a difference in the crimes of robbery one and aiding and abetting? If so, what is it?\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b283-15\">\u201cWell, aiding and abetting is a separate and distinct statute that is to be used in conjunction with the other sections I read to you. I\u2019ll read the aiding and abetting.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-16\">\u201cA person, acting with the mental state required for the commission of an offense, who solicits, requests, commands, importunes or intentionally aids another person to engage in conduct which eon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>stitutes an offense shall be criminally liable for such conduct and may be prosecuted and punished as if he were the principal offender. In other words, if the accused did any of the things specified in the statute he is, in the eyes of the law, just as guilty of the crimes of robbery one, robbery two or robbery three\u2014as related by the Court\u2014 the crime charged as though he had directly committed it or directly participated in its commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">\u201cI\u2019ll repeat that section again.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">\u201cA person, acting with the mental state required for the commission of an offense, who solicits, requests, commands, importunes or intentionally aids another person to engage in conduct whieh constitutes an offense shall be criminally liable for such conduct and may be prosecuted and punished as if he were the principal offender.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b284-11\"> Here the defendant\u2019s brief specifically quotes the following portion of the supplemental charge: \u201c\u2014\u2018if the accused did any of the things specified in the statute, he is, in the eyes of the law just as guilty\u2014as though he had directly committed or directly participated in its commission.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">The full sentence immediately preceding this portion as well as the first three words of the quoted portion reads as follows: \u201cA person, acting with the mental state required for the commission of an offense, who solicits, requests, commands, importunes or intentionally aids another person to engage in conduct which constitutes an offense shall be criminally liable for such conduct and may be prosecuted and punished as if he were the principal offender. In other words . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b285-5\"> See footnote 14, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b285-6\"> \u201cThird question: \u2018What about proof of criminal intent? Do we need to be concerned about Cannon\u2019s intent? There was a bit in your reading of 2nd degree robbery, where we were instructed to disregard acquiescence or innocent acts which might have been misinterpreted.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">\u201cI\u2019ll do the best I can regarding that particular part if you will bear with me a moment.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">\u201cIf I understand, it referred to robbery in the second degree. A person is guilty of robbery in the second degree when he commits robbery and is aided by another person actually present in the course of the commission of the crime, or he or another participant in the crime threatens the use of what he represents by his words or conduct to be a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">\u201cAn accomplice must be found to be present and actively aiding or assisting in the crime. Mere presence of an inactive companion, passive acquiescence, or the doing of innocent acts which may in fact aid the one who commits the crime, does not constitute such aid within the meaning of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">\u201cIs that what you mean? I\u2019ll read further if you want.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-12\">\u201cI find no hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-13\">\u201cQuestion 4: \u2018Please explain the section on aiding and abetting again. Is there a difference in the crimes of robbery one and aiding and abetting? If so, what is it?\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b285-15\">\u201cWell, aiding and abetting is a separate and distinct statute that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>is to be used ia conjunction with the other sections I read to you. I\u2019ll read the aiding and abetting.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\"><em>\u201cA </em>person, acting with the mental state required for the commission of an offense, who solicits, requests, commands, importunes or intentionally aids another person to engage in conduct which constitutes an offense shall be criminally liable for such conduct and may be prosecuted and punished as if he were the principal offender. In other words, if the accused did any of the things specified in the statute he is, in the eyes of the law, just as guilty of the crimes of robbery one, robbery two or robbery three\u2014as related by the Court\u2014 the crime charged as though he had directly participated in its commission.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b286-11\"> The defendant has relied upon <em>State </em>v. <em>Teart, </em>170 Conn. 332, 365 A.2d 1200 (1976), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Enanno, </em>96 Conn. 420, 114 A. 386 (1921), as support for his claim that a portion of the charge in effect read out of the statute the requisite of proving criminal intent. This reliance is misplaced. In <em>Heart, </em>the trial judge explicitly and erroneously instructed the jury to \u201ctreat [the defendant] as having the mental state required for the commission of a crime.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Teart, </em>supra, 335. In <em>Enanno, </em>the trial judge, in its instruction on aiding and abetting, failed to define the term \u201caccessory\u201d and also failed to explain what kind of conduct must be proven in order to be an \u201caccessory.\u201d In fact, the trial judge did not even quote the aiding and abetting statute or define its essential terms. <em>State </em>v. <em>Enanno, </em>supra, 425. Neither of these two eases avails the defendant here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
