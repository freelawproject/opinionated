The principal issue is whether the trial court abused its discretion in not ordering a modification of alimony under the authority of \u00a7 46b-86 (b) of the General Statutes, the so-called \u201ccohabitation\u201d statute; however, because we have decided to remand this case to the trial court for an articula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>tion of the basis of its decision, we do not reach the alimony issue at this time. As to the award of counsel fees, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">The marriage between the plaintiff, Harold L. Kaplan, and the defendant, Michele E. Kaplan, was dissolved on May 26, 1978. Among other awards, the defendant was awarded periodic alimony in the amount of $200 per week to continue until either her remarriage or the plaintiff\u2019s death. On April 17,1980, the plaintiff filed a motion for modification of alimony under the authority of subsection (b) of Greneral Statutes \u00a7 Jbb-Sb.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This provision states that the Superior Court may, in its discretion and after notice and hearing, modify an alimony award \u201cupon a showing that the party receiving the periodic alimony is <em>living with another person </em>under circumstances which the court finds should result in the modification, suspension, reduction or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>termination of alimony because the living arrangements cause such a <em>change of circumstances </em>as to <em>alter the financial needs </em>of that party.\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a746b-86 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">The plaintiff alleged<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and attempted to prove at a brief hearing that the defendant was living with another person under circumstances \u201ctantamount to remarriage\u201d and within the scope of \u00a7 46b-86 (b). On June 17, 1980, the plaintiff\u2019s motion for modification was denied by the court, <em>Edelb erg, J., </em>without any oral or written statement of the basis of its decision and the plaintiff appealed. On October 2, 1980, the court, <em>Santaniello, J., </em>awarded the defendant counsel fees \u201cto the extent of $2000.00\u201d as an allowance to defend this appeal, from which order the plaintiff also appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">As to the question of the counsel fees, under \u00a7 46b-62 of the General Statutes the trial court in its discretion may grant such fees. <em>Viglione </em>v. <em>Viglione, </em>171 Conn. 213, 219-20, 368 A.2d 202 (1976). The plaintiff challenges the allowance on the ground that the defendant is financially able to pay her counsel fees, citing this court\u2019s decision in <em>Koizim </em>v. <em>Koizim, </em>181 Conn. 492, 500-501, 435 A.2d 1030 (1980). Under \u00a7 46b-62 the trial court considers not only the \u201crespective financial abil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>ities\u201d of the parties, but also the same factors relevant to the determination of alimony. See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-82. In view of the defendant\u2019s lack of the \u201cample liquid funds\u201d referred to in this court\u2019s reversal of the fees award in <em>Koizim, </em>supra, the superior financial situation of the plaintiff, and the fact that the original dissolution judgment awarded periodic alimony to the defendant, we cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion in the allowance of counsel fees. <em>Fattibene </em>v. <em>Fattibene, </em>183 Conn. 433, 444, 441 A.2d 3 (1981); see also <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>180 Conn. 376, 380, 429 A.2d 897 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">As previously noted, the principal issue before us is whether the trial court abused its discretion by not ordering a modification of alimony under the so-called \u201ccohabitation\u201d statute, \u00a7 46b-86 (b). While this court has not previously had occasion to deal with \u00a7 46b-86 (b), it is clear that this provision was intended to apply to the factual situation alleged by the plaintiff.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It requires the party moving for modification to show that the party receiving alimony is \u201cliving with another person\u201d and that this living arrangement has caused a \u201cchange of circumstances\u201d which \u201calter [s] the financial needs\u201d of the party receiving alimony. General Statutes \u00a746b-86 (b). We note that the General Assembly chose the broader language of \u201cliving with another person\u201d rather than \u201ccohabitation\u201d and that this provision requires only a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>\u201cchange\u201d of circumstances, not a \u201csubstantial change\u201d as required by \u00a7 46b-86 (a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Our review of a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion for modification of periodic alimony is limited to deciding whether the trial court has abused its discretion. <em>Hardisty </em>v. <em>Hardisty, </em>183 Conn. 253, 260, 439 A.2d 307 (1981); <em>Koizim </em>v. <em>Koizim, </em>181 Conn. 492, 498, 435 A.2d 1030 (1980); <em>Jacobsen </em>v. <em>Jacobsen, </em>177 Conn. 259, 263, 413 A.2d 854 (1979). As previously indicated, the trial court simply denied the motion for modification without providing any oral or written basis for its decision. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7327, 3060B; cf. <em>Scherr </em>v. <em>Scherr, </em>183 Conn. 366, 368, 439 A.2d 375 (1981). In the absence of specific findings by the trial court and a basis for its decision, we are not able to determine whether the court\u2019s discretion was abused in this case. Where \u201cnecessary to the proper disposition of the cause,\u201d this court may \u201cremand the case for a further articulation of the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision.\u201d Practice Book \u00a73060D; <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>183 Conn. 124, 125, 438 A.2d 845 (1981). For the reasons set forth above, sua sponte we remand this case for an articulation of the trial court\u2019s denial of the plaintiff\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">There is no error as to the award of counsel fees, but as to the denial of the plaintiff\u2019s motion for modification of periodic alimony the case is remanded with direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b55-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] See. 46b-86. modification of alimony or support orders and judgments, (a) Unless and to the extent that the decree precludes modification, any final order for the periodic payment of permanent alimony or support or alimony or support pendente lite may at any time thereafter be continued, set aside, altered or modified by said court upon a showing of a substantial change in the circumstances of either party. This section shall not apply to assignments under section 46b-81 or to any assignment of the estate or a portion thereof of one party to the other party under prior law.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">\u201c(b) In an aetion for divorce, dissolution of marriage, legal separation or annulment brought by a husband or wife, in which a final judgment has been entered providing for the payment of periodic alimony by one party to the other, the superior court may, in its discretion and upon notice and hearing, modify such judgment and suspend, reduce or terminate the payment of periodic alimony upon a showing that the party receiving the periodic alimony is living with another person under circumstances which the court finds should result in the modification, suspension, reduction or termination of alimony because the living arrangements cause such a change of circumstances as to alter the financial needs of that party.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b56-8\"> In the second paragraph of his motion for modification the plaintiff alleged: <em>\u201c2. </em>For a substantial period of time following the [May 26, 1978 dissolution] Judgment and continuing up to the present time, the defendant, Michele E. Kaplan, has been living with \u00edtainer M. Doost, PHD [sic] at 61 MacDonald Court in Noank, Connecticut under circumstances tantamount to remarriage and [they] have been conducting themselves as married persons. Such conduct on the part of the defendant constitutes a change of circumstances sufficient to the Court to terminate, reduce or suspend the alimony payment in accordance with the statutes made and provided.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b57-8\"> The stated purpose of the bill which was eventually enacted as Public Acts 1977, No. 77-394, now \u00a7 46b-86 (b), was \u201cto correct the injustice of making a party pay alimony when his or her ex-spouse is living with a person of the opposite sex, without marrying, to prevent the loss of support.\u201d H.B. 6174, 1977 Sess.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b58-9\"> See footnote 1, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
