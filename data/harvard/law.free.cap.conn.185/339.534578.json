Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8U\">Upon trial to a jury, the defendant was found guilty of three counts of kidnapping in the first degree, each in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> From the judgment rendered on the verdict, he appeals and asserts six claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">From the evidence presented at trial, the jury could reasonably have found the following facts: In Shelton, on the evening of March 1, 1975, plant <em>No. </em>4 of the Grand Sheet Metal Company, popularly known as the Sponge Rubber Factory,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was destroyed by an incendiary explosion and fire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>of major proportion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Federal and state investigation led to the determination that the plant had been destroyed by a deliberately set fire, initiated by an explosive device with an accelerant and detonating cord used to spread the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The evidence disclosed that during the days immediately preceding March 1, 1975, three individuals named John Shaw, Dennis Tiche and Michael Tiche accumulated a large quantity of gasoline, dynamite and detonating cord which they loaded onto an Avis rental truck in Pennsylvania on February 27. This truck was driven to Shelton, Connecticut by another individual named Donald Connors. John Shaw, Dennis Tiche and Michael Tiche flew from Pittsburgh to New York and then traveled to Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">On the evening of February 27, in Pennsylvania, the defendant met with Albert Coffey and Ronald Betres; the three proceeded to drive from Pennsylvania to Danbury, Connecticut in Betres\u2019 Buick automobile. In Danbury, the three men registered in a Holiday Inn, where they were observed and subsequently identified by numerous hotel employees, and where the fingerprints of the defendant and Ronald Betres were later located in room 118, where the men stayed on the evening of February 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">On the morning of Saturday, March 1, 1975, the defendant and Ronald Betres drove to a Howard Johnson\u2019s restaurant in Derby where they met John Shaw, Dennis Tiche and Michael Tiche and another individual named David Bubar, who apparently had access to the Sponge Rubber Company plants.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>On that particular occasion, Bubar transported John Shaw, Dennis Tiche and Michael Tiche to plant No. 4, and the defendant and Betres returned to the Holiday Inn in Danbury. In the early evening of the same date the defendant, Ronald Betres and Albert Coffey returned again to the Howard Johnson\u2019s in Derby and met again with David Bubar. At that time, Betres had a loaded pistol and three sets of handcuffs in his possession. During the same evening of March 1, John Shaw, Dennis Tiche and Michael Tiche proceeded to distribute gasoline and dynamite throughout the plant and to connect the various items distributed by detonating cord.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Two company security guards, Roy Ranno and Alfred Hanley, and a company boilerman, Robert DeJoy, were working inside the plant that night. At approximately 10 p.m., three masked<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> individuals, later identified as the defendant, Albert Coffey and Ronald Betres, confronted the security guards, with Betres showing his pistol. At gunpoint, the two men were removed down a flight of stairs to a ladies rest room on the bottom floor of the plant, where their hands were handcuffed and their eyes were covered with tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The two guards, after their capture, informed their three abductors that there was another individual working in the boiler room. The defendant and Ronald Betres proceeded to that room where they captured DeJoy at gunpoint and removed him to the ladies rest room where the other two men were being held.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Subsequently, the three plant employees were led out of the plant in single file and placed inside Ranno\u2019s automobile. The men were in the car for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>approximately forty-five minutes, during which time they were driven to the town of Monroe. In Monroe, the Ranno automobile was driven onto a dirt lane; the employees\u2019 handcuffs were removed and their hands were taped. The defendant and his accomplices, Betres, Coffey, Shaw, Dennis Tiche and Michael Tiche, left the location in Betres\u2019 Buick automobile and, after stopping momentarily to verify that the plant had exploded, the men drove directly to New York City where they eventually separated into two groups and returned to Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">We take up first the defendant\u2019s claim that the court erroneously allowed the state to prove his guilt \u201cby proving the convictions of alleged co-conspirators.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6During the course of the trial, three of the defendant\u2019s accomplices, Albert Coffey, John Shaw and Ronald Betres, testified for the state. All three testified at some length, both on direct and on cross-examination, implicating themselves and the defendant. The present claim of error concerns the admission into evidence of the criminal convictions of these three men in the same criminal activity for which the defendant was tried below. Coffey<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Shaw<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> both testified about their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>convictions on direct examination without objection, and both were examined at some length about their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>convictions on cross-examination. Ronald Betres <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>testified8 on direct examination without objection about his conviction in the federal and state courts of certain crimes in connection with this incident; defense counsel did tender an objection to what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Ronald Betres pleaded in the state court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> No cautionary instruction was given at the time these witnesses so testified; none was requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Pikul, </em>150 Conn. 195, 198, 187 A.2d 442 (1962),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> we said: \u201cThe fact that one or more persons jointly charged with the commission of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>crime pleaded guilty is not admissible on the trial of another person so charged, to establish that the crime was committed. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gargano, </em>99 Conn. 103, 107, 121 A. 657 [1923] ; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Toner, </em>173 F.2d 140, 142 (3d Cir. [1949]); 2 Wharton, Criminal Evidence (12th Ed.) \u00a7439. This is so because a plea of guilty is, in effect, merely a confession of guilt which, having been made by one of those charged with the crime, can be no more than hearsay as to another who is so charged. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gargano, </em>supra, 108.\u201d After we decided <em>Pikul, </em>we had occasion to point out that <em>Pikul </em>\u201cstands for the principle that the guilty plea of one or more persons jointly charged with a crime cannot be admitted in the trial of another so charged \u2018to establish that the crime was committed.\u2019 . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>DellaCamera, </em>166 Conn. 557, 565, 353 A.2d 750 (1974); see, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harrell, </em>436 F.2d 606, 614-16 (5th Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 846, 93 S. Ct. 49, 34 L. Ed. 2d 86 (1972); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Toner, </em>supra, 142. While such evidence may be offered to affect credibility; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Pikul, </em>supra, 199; or for some permitted limited purpose, we believe a proper cautionary instruction to the jury should be given, generally upon objection overruled or sua sponte where the court views the potential for prejudice as likely.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The lack of a curative instruction, especially in the absence of objection and a request for one, does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>not necessarily constitute harmful error. Our focus on review is fairness, and a curative instruction is just one factor in determining whether substantial rights of a defendant have been unfairly prejudiced. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>King, </em>505 F.2d 602, 607 (5th Cir. 1974); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>DeLucca, </em>630 F.2d 294, 298 (5th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 983, 101 S. Ct. 1520, 67 L. Ed. 2d 819 (1981). We must, therefore, examine the facts and circumstances of this case in their proper context.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Each of the three accomplices testified at length. It was only at the end of their direct testimony and after each had implicated himself and the defendant that testimony was elicited about their convictions concerning the criminal activity involving themselves and the defendant. This evidence, quite apart from that of their guilty pleas, was properly received\u2014its breadth and detail probative of the defendant\u2019s guilt. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Riddall, </em>251 Or. 506, 446 P.2d 517 (1968). The purpose of the witness\u2019 testimony \u201cwas to give the facts and circumstances of the crime [s]. The testimony as to their pleas of guilty gave the circumstances under which they were testifying, and their status with regard to the charge, and went to their credibility as witnesses for the state.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>252 Or. 146, 155, 448 P.2d 523 (1968). Any prejudice resulting from the testimony of the pleas was rendered harmless when the guilt of the accomplices was established by their own testimony which also implicated the defendant. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Riddall, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Another factor militating against finding harmful error in this case is the lack of any claim by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>defendant that the evidence of the witnesses\u2019 guilty pleas was ever again brought to the attention of the jury by the state in a prejudicial fashion. There is no claim that the testimony of the pleas was either emphasized by the state, or argued by the state during final argument. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rothman, </em>463 F.2d 488, 490 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 956, 93 S. Ct. 291, 34 L. Ed. 2d 231 (1972); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>supra, 155; cf. <em>Bisaccia </em>v. <em>Attorney General, </em>623 F.2d 307, 308-309 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1042, 101 S. Ct. 622, 66 L. Ed. 2d 504 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">We also note that although the court did not give a curative instruction, the court, in its charge to the jury, instructed the jury on the care with which they were to scrutinize the testimony of accomplices, mindful of the fact that \u201cin their own testimony . . . [each accomplice] participated in the crimes charged against the accused Anthony Just.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>These instructions, as well as the instructions on the credibility of one previously convicted of a crime,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and on the defendant\u2019s presumption of innocence,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> also work against finding harmful error.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Finally, we note that the defendant\u2019s trial counsel did not take specific objection to the challenged testimony. Whether the lack of an objection or a request for a curative instruction is a matter of trial strategy is frequently not easy of determination. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>King, </em>supra, 608; cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>McDaniel, </em>176 Conn. 131, 134-35, 405 A.2d 68 (1978). This is especially so here where defense counsel was particularly searching in his cross-examination of the three accomplices, as well as with other witnesses, and made many objections and took a number of exceptions to the examination of witnesses. We note here the words of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>cnit which, in discussing whether the failure to object to such testimony could have been the result of tactical considerations, stated, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>King, </em>supra, that \u201c[o]ne legitimate defense consideration might be a concern that the remedy could be more injurious than the malady\u2014that is, that a corrective instruction might call more attention to a witness\u2019 guilty plea than the witness\u2019 admission.\u201d Id., 608 n.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Thus, although we strongly approve of the giving of a curative instruction, in the circumstances of this case we hold that the failure of the trial court to give such an instruction does not amount to harmful error.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">The defendant\u2019s second claim of error involves the court\u2019s charge to the jury on the issue of reasonable doubt and its statement, within the course of its charge, that \u201cthe law is not made to protect guilty persons.\u201d With regard to this argument, the defendant contends that by charging the jury in negative terms regarding reasonable doubt, and by stating that a reasonable doubt standard is one which requires \u201ca good, honest, sound, conscientious reason,\u201d the court diluted, to an unconstitutional degree, the reasonable doubt standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">We initially note that although the defendant now assigns error to the court\u2019s charge, no exceptions to the court\u2019s charge were taken by trial counsel and no pertinent request to charge was made. In such situations, this court has refused to consider claimed errors in the trial court\u2019s instruction. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Parham, </em>174 Conn. 500, 509, 391 A.2d 148 (1978); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gerak, </em>169 Conn. 309, 316, 363 A.2d 114 (1975). We note, however, that even if this issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>had been properly raised, under the reasoning set ont by this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Cari, </em>163 Conn. 174, 180, 303 A.2d 7 (1972), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Guthridge, </em>164 Conn. 145, 154, 318 A.2d 87 (1972), cert. denied, 410 U.S. 988, 93 S. Ct. 1519, 36 L. Ed. 2d 186 (1973), considering the charge as a whole, we would find no error. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Jonas, </em>169 Conn. 566, 578, 363 A.2d 1378 (1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 923, 96 S. Ct. 1132, 47 L. Ed. 2d 331 (1976). \u201c[T]he charge as given was proper and correct since it was used in conjunction with clear instruction both as to the presumption of innocence and as to the duty of the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant\u2019s guilt of the crimes with which he is charged. <em>State </em>v. <em>Colonese, </em>108 Conn. 454, 459, 143 A. 561 [1928].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cari, </em>supra, 181.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>in</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The defendant\u2019s third claim is that, with respect to his convictions of kidnapping in the first degree, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (B), the evidence did not establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. He specifically claims that the state \u201ctotally failed to prove . . . that the abductions in any way were done for the purpose of accomplishing the arson or advancing it.\u201d He argues: \u201cIndeed, the evidence showed without contradiction that the abductions were a humanitarian gesture designed to protect the three \u2018victims\u2019 from the consequences of the arson.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">We have repeatedly stated the test which this court employs to determine whether the evidence is sufficient to sustain a verdict: \u201c\u2018[T]he issue is whether the jury could have reasonably concluded, upon the facts established and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, that the cumulative effect of the evidence was sufficient to justify the verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt ....\u2019\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gaynor, </em>182 Conn. 501, 503, 438 A.2d 749 (1980), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Festo, </em>181 Conn. 254, 259, 435 A.2d 38 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Nemeth, </em>182 Conn. 403, 410, 438 A.2d 120 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Saracino, </em>178 Conn. 416, 419, 423 A.2d 102 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>176 Conn. 257, 262, 407 A.2d 948 (1978). \u201cIn ruling \u25a0on such a motion, the evidence presented at the trial must be given a construction most favorable to sustaining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra, 262; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Nemeth, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Chetcuti, </em>173 Conn. 165, 172, 377 A.2d 263 (1977). Each essential element of the crime charged must be established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>\u201c \u2018and although it is within the province of the jury to draw reasonable, logical inferences from the facts proven, they may not resort to speculation and conjecture.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gaynor, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Festo, </em>supra; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Stankowski, </em>184 Conn. 121, 126, 439 A.2d 918, cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1052, 102 S. Ct. 596, 70 L. Ed. 2d 588(1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">We have also stated: \u201cIntent is a mental process which ordinarily can be proven only by circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Zdanis, </em>182 Conn. 388, 396, 438 A.2d 696 (1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1003, 101 S. Ct. 1715, 68 L. Ed. 2d 207 (1981). \u201cThe intent of the actor is a question for the trier of fact, and the conclusion drawn by the trier in this regard should stand unless it is an unreasonable one.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Holley, </em>174 Conn. 22, 26, 381 A.2d 539 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Upon review, we conclude that the evidence, as set forth above, was sufficient to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Although the defendant may have had a \u201chumanitarian\u201d motive in abducting the three employees, this does not preclude a finding that the abductions were done for the purpose of accomplishing or advancing the commission of the arson.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The defendant\u2019s next contention is that the court erroneously instructed the jury concerning unlawful restraint in the first degree as a lesser included offense of the crime of kidnapping in the first degree. His argument is not that he has been convicted of an offense for which he was never given notice. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>180 Conn. 382, 402, 429 A.2d 919 (1980). He cannot make this argument since he was not convicted of unlawful restraint in the first degree; rather he was convicted of the greater offense of kidnapping in the first degree. His claim is as follows: \u201cBy improperly inflating the list of supposed lesser included offenses, the court totally confused the real and only issue in the case regarding lesser included offenses\u2014whether Mr. Just was guilty as charged or guilty of the lesser offense of kidnapping in the second degree. Every practicing lawyer knows the numbing effect upon even a trained mind of listing the supposed distinctions among a long list of lesser included offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Even assuming that this claim is properly before us,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> we do not find harmful error. Any error would be harmless. The defendant was not found guilty of unlawful restraint, but rather of the greater offense of kidnapping in the first degree. The court repeatedly charged the jury that they were not to consider the lesser offenses of kidnapping in the first degree if they found the defendant guilty of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>that crime.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The jury is to \u201cbe presumed, in the absence of a fair indication to the contrary, to have followed the instructions of the court as to the law. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>[156 Conn. 378, 383, 242 A.2d 763 (1968)]. There is nothing to indicate that the jury failed to follow the instructions of the court, and the defendant\u2019s claim of prejudice finds no support in the record.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bausman, </em>162 Conn. 308, 314, 294 A.2d 312 (1972); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>173 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Conn. 153, 156-57, 376 A.2d 1108 (1977). Thus, even if the charge were erroneous, any claimed error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The defendant next argues that the court\u2019s refusal to conduct a hearing, under <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S. Ct. 2674, 57 L. Ed. 2d 667 (1978), on the truthfulness of factual allegations made in the affidavit supporting the warrant leading to his arrest denied him due process of law. The arrest warrant in this case was based upon the joint affidavit of officers Robert Geoghan and Nicholas Valerio of the Connecticut state police. In the lengthy affidavit, the police officers detailed the information given to them by an informant named James Shaw. The defendant attacks that portion of the affidavit which asserts that Shaw was shown several photographs and identified one photograph as that of the defendant. The defendant, in his brief, claims that \u201c[t]hat assertion was false,\u201d and points to a sworn affidavit to support his claim that the warrant was intentionally untruthful. He further maintains that without this assertion, \u201cthere was no probable cause for the arrest warrant in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>The trial court, on the basis of our holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>169 Conn. 322, 329, 363 A.2d 72 (1975),<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> did not grant the defendant\u2019s request for a hearing. Subsequent to that decision, the United States Supreme Court handed down <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>supra, which discussed the issue of when a defendant can attack the veracity of a warrant affidavit after the warrant has been issued and executed. In <em>Franks, </em>the court held that \u201cwhere the defendant makes a substantial preliminary showing that a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit, and if the allegedly false statement is necessary to the finding of probable cause, the Fourth Amendment requires that a hearing be held at the defendant\u2019s request.\u201d Id., 155-56.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Although we are not con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>vinced that the defendant has met the first prong of this test, we need not decide the issue since we hold that even in the absence of the attacked assertion, there was probable cause to support the issuance of the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">We have recently stated that probable cause to arrest exists if: \u201c(1) there is probable cause to believe a crime has been committed; and (2) there is probable cause to believe that the person to be arrested committed that crime.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>DeChamplain, </em>179 Conn. 522, 529, 427 A.2d 1333 (1980) . If a warrant is based on an affidavit containing statements of an informant, the affidavit must recite \u201c(1) some of the underlying circumstances relied on by the person providing the information to the affiant; and (2) some' of the underlying circumstances from which the affiant concluded (a) that the informant, whose identity need not even be disclosed, was credible, or (b) that his information was reliable.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>162 Conn. 440, 446, 294 A.2d 517, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 870, 93 S. Ct. 198, 34 L. Ed. 2d 121 (1972); <em>State </em>v. <em>Bember, </em>183 Conn. 394, 410-11, 439 A.2d 387 (1981) ; see <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108, 114, 84 S. Ct. 1509, 12 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1964). In examining the affidavit in the present case, and deleting the attacked portion, we find that both prongs of this test, commonly referred to as the <em>Aguilar </em>test, have been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">The first prong of the test is clearly met. \u201cIf credited, the facts supplied by the informant more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>than entitle him to believe that the defendant participated in the crimes; the informant was not only an eyewitness to the crime but also a participant.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra, 446.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The second prong has also been amply satisfied. When an affidavit contains information from an untested informant, this court has employed several methods by which to judge the information\u2019s reliability or the informant\u2019s credibility. One of the most common factors used to evaluate the reliability of an informant\u2019s information is the corroboration of the information by the police. \u201cIf the police have evidence (such as from prior independent police work), which corroborates some of the details included in the affidavit, then an inference of reliability will arise. <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. 410, 417-18, 89 S. Ct. 584, 21 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1969); <em>Draper </em>v. <em>United States, </em>358 U.S. 307, 309-10, 79 S. Ct. 329, 3 L. Ed. 2d 327 (1959); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Canestri, </em>518 F.2d 269, 272 (2d Cir. 1975); <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra, 448.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>185 Conn. 104, 113, 440 A.2d 841 (1981). \u201cThe theory of corroboration is that a statement which has been shown true in some respects is reasonably likely to be true in the remaining respects.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra, 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">We have reprinted, in a footnote to this opinion, the joint affidavit of police officers Robert Geoghan and Nicholas Valerio.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> A review of that detailed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>statement, even after excising the challenged assertion, more than amply convinces us that there was sufficient corroboration of the information provided by Shaw so as to support the issuance of an arrest warrant for the defendant.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Declarations against penal interest by the informant-declarant are another factor used to evaluate the reliability of an informant\u2019s information. \u201cCommon sense in the important daily affairs of life would induce a prudent and disinterested observer to credit these statements. People do not lightly admit a crime and place critical evidence in the hands of the police in the form of their own admissions. Admissions of crime . . . carry their own indicia of credibility.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>403 U.S. 573, 583, 91 S. Ct. 2075, 29 L. Ed. 2d 723 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>(1971). Statements against penal interest, such as those made by Shaw in the present case, \u201cmay be a substantial basis for crediting an informant\u2019s tip and may be considered by an issuing authority in a warrant proceeding.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>supra, 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Furthermore, we note that \u201c[h]ere, there is no unidentified informer, but a named, available participant in the crime of which the defendant is accused. Although we do not rely solely on the fact that the informant in this case was a participant, we note that this fact has been given great weight in other jurisdictions. .. . [citations omitted.] That the informant was a participant has been held sufficient by itself to support a warrant in some cases. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>supra, 451-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The United States Supreme Court has stated that the magistrate\u2019s determination of probable cause should be paid great deference by reviewing courts. See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>362 U.S. 257, 270-71, 80 S. Ct. 725, 4 L. Ed 2d 697 (1960); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>supra, 118; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bember, </em>supra, 412. Having reviewed the affidavit presented to the magistrate, and having deleted that portion of the affidavit attacked by the defendant, we find no reason to challenge the judge\u2019s conclusion that probable cause to arrest the defendant was demonstrated. We conclude, then, that the defendant was not deprived of his due process rights by the failure of the trial court to conduct a hearing on the veracity of the allegations asserted in the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">The defendant\u2019s final claim of error is that he was denied his sixth and fourteenth amendment right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>the effective assistance of counsel. His argument is solely contingent upon this court\u2019s not reaching the merits of those claims of error now made on appeal which were not properly raised below. He argues that \u201c[i]f . . . this court is of the view that the trial attorney\u2019s failures now prevent Mr. Just from obtaining appellate relief from these serious violations, it must follow that the trial attorney failed to provide that minimal level of professional competence required by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment guarantees of effective assistance of counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">\u201cIt is fundamental that a defendant in a criminal matter is guaranteed the right to the assistance of counsel. <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em>372 U.S. 335, 344, 83 S. Ct. 792, 9 L. Ed. 2d 799 (1963). The right to counsel is the right to the effective assistance of counsel. <em>McMann </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>397 U.S. 759, 771 n.14, 90 S. Ct. 1441, 25 L. Ed. 2d 763 (1970); <em>Reece </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>350 U.S. 85, 90, 76 S. Ct. 167,100 L. Ed. 77 (1955); <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>287 U.S. 45, 71, 53 S. Ct. 55, 77 L. Ed. 158 (1932). \u2018\u201cDefense counsel\u2019s performance must be reasonably competent or within the range of competence displayed by lawyers with ordinary training and skill in the criminal law. The defendant\u2019s burden is to show that his counsel\u2019s conduct fell below that standard and that the lack of competency contributed to the conviction.\u201d \u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>170 Conn. 273, 283, 365 A.2d 1167, cert. denied, 425 U.S. 962, 96 S. Ct. 1748, 48 L. Ed. 2d 208 (1976).\u201d <em>Siemon </em>v. <em>Stoughton, </em>184 Conn. 547, 554, 440 A.2d 210 (1981); see <em>State </em>v. <em>McClain, </em>171 Conn. 293, 370 A.2d 928 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">We initially wish to reemphasize that the issue of the adequacy of trial counsel is more properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>pursued on a motion for a new trial or on a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, rather than on a direct appeal. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>173 Conn. 153, 154-55, 376 A.2d 1108 (1977). Absent an evidentiary hearing on this issue, the claim is extremely difficult to review. See Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">From what is before us, however, we find no merit to the defendant\u2019s argument. Even though several of the defendant\u2019s present claims of error were not raised below, we have, in this opinion, reviewed the disputed claims as if they had been properly raised. Our conclusion on each of these issues does not support a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">We also take note of the numerous pretrial motions filed by the defendant\u2019s trial counsel,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> the extensiveness of the cross-examination of the state\u2019s witnesses made by the defendant\u2019s trial counsel, the various exceptions and objections made by him, and the efforts of the defendant\u2019s trial counsel to obtain witnesses to testify on behalf of the defendant.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>We further take heed of the court\u2019s comment to counsel which was made at the end of the trial: \u201cI think for the record I would like to compliment both the state and Mr. Goldberger [the defendant\u2019s trial counsel] for the efforts put into this case, both on behalf of the State of Connecticut and on the defense. Mr. Goldberger had a very difficult job to perform as a special public defender in this case, especially in view of the attitude and conduct of the defendant himself who has wilfully and intentionally absented himself from this trial.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">We agree with the state\u2019s claim that \u201cthe defendant has not in any way demonstrated that his trial counsel was incompetent or that he failed to display the competence displayed by lawyers with ordinary training and skill in criminal law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b352-12\"> General Statutes <em>\u00a7 </em>53a-92 (a) (2) (B) provides: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of kidnapping in the first degree when he abducts another person and when: . . .

Now, they are known as accomplices. Under our law, it is not absolutely necessary that the testimony of an accomplice be corroborated before it is accepted as true by you, the jury. But in weighing the testimony of an accomplice, you must bear in mind that he is a self-confessed criminal and, everything else being equal, you would not believe the testimony of a man who has committed a felonious crime as readily as you would of a man of good character. Also, when you are listening to the testimony of a self-confessed accomplice who has not yet been sentenced, you are entitled to bear in mind the point that he may in his own mind be looking for or hoping for some favors in the disposition of his own ease and, therefore, he may have an interest in the outcome of the trial, so that his testimony may have been colored by that.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">\u201cFor these reasons, you as the jury must look with particular care to the testimony of an accomplice. However, you must also remember that his testimony may have been motivated by a desire to tell the truth, and that such testimony is worthy of acceptance by you, even though some hope or expectation of leniency has been offered to him by the State in exchange for his testimony. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>for you iu the exercise of your own sound judgment and discretion to determine what weight, if any, you will give to the testimony of an accomplice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b363-7\"> The court instructed: \u201cNow, you will also recall that during the course of this trial, Albert Coffey, Eonald Betres and John Shaw testified that they had previously been convicted of crimes either related or unrelated to the alleged crimes in question. We have a statute in Connecticut which provides that no person shall be disqualified as a witness because of a conviction of crime, but that such conviction may be shown to affect the credibility of the testimony which a convicted person has given. The fact that a witness was convicted of a crime does not disqualify him as a witness and he should not be considered by you in that light. The fact of a conviction of other crimes is one of the factors for you to take into consideration along with the other material facts in determining the credibility which you will afford to that particular witness.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b363-9\"> During these instructions the court said: \u201cThe accused Anthony Just does not have to prove that he did not commit the offense or offenses with which he stands charged.

But the law is made to protect society and innocent persons and not to protect guilty ones. If this presumption of innocence has been overcome or removed by evidence clearly demonstrating beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused person is guilty of the crime charged, then it is the sworn duty of the jury to enforce the law which is made for the protection of life, society and property and to render such a verdict as the evidence warrants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The instruction objected to in <em>State </em>v. <em>Guthridge, </em>164 Conn. 145, 318 A.2d 87 (1972), cert. denied, 410 U.S. 988, 93 S.

DeJoy was asked the following questions and gave the following answers concerning his being confronted by the defendant and Betres:</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">\u201cQ. Could you tell us approximately how long after Hanley left that something happened?</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">A. 20 minutes to a half hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">Q. And what was it that happened?</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">A.

If you do find him guilty of that offense, that is, kidnapping in the first degree, you will have no need to consider the lesser included offenses. And in that event, you will disregard what I have said and will say with respect to them, that is, the lesser included offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">\u201cOn the other hand, if you determine that Anthony Just is not guilty of the crime of kidnapping in the first degree, you must then decide whether or not he is guilty or not guilty of the lesser included offenses of kidnapping in the second degree or unlawful restraint in the first degree or unlawful restraint in the second degree. You are to understand, members of the jury, that this is not a direction to you to find that the accused committed a lesser offense, if you do not find him guilty of kidnapping in the first degree. But it is only an explanation that, if the greater crimes, that is, the more serious crimes of kidnapping in the first degree, are not proven by the State beyond a reasonable doubt against the accused Anthony Just, then you may consider the next lesser crime in degree. And if that crime is not proven beyond a reasonable doubt, then you will consider the next lesser included crime in degree, and so on. If after you have considered all of these lesser included crimes on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>which I shall instruct you in a moment, you find that none of them are proven beyond a reasonable doubt, then, of course, your verdict will be not guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">After the court charged the jury on the elements of the crime of kidnapping in the second degree, it stated: \u201cNow, if you find that the defendant Anthony Just is guilty of the crimes of kidnapping in the first degree, you need not consider the lesser included offenses of kidnapping in the second degree. If you find him not guilty of kidnapping in the first degree, then you must consider the lesser included offenses of kidnapping in the second degree.

Alibi evidence is merely a rebuttal of the state\u2019s evidence. ... At a plenary trial such an issue becomes one of credibility to be determined upon the whole evidence. . . . The court did not commit error in refusing to allow a full evidentiary hearing on the truthfulness of the affidavit supporting the search warrant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b371-5\"> The court, near the end of its opinion, elaborated on this holding: \u201cThere is, of course, a presumption of validity with respect to the affidavit supporting the search warrant. To mandate an evidentiary hearing, the challenger\u2019s attack must be more than conclusory and must be supported by more than a mere desire to cross-examine. There must be allegations of deliberate falsehood or of reckless disregard for the truth, and those allegations must be accompanied by an offer of proof. They should point out specifically the portion of the warrant affidavit that is claimed to be false, and they should be accompanied by a statement of supporting reasons. Affidavits or sworn or otherwise reliable statements of witnesses should be furnished, or their absence satisfactorily explained. Allegations of negligence or innocent mistake are insufficient. The deliberate falsity or reckless disregard whose impeachment is permitted today is only that of the affiant, not of any nongovernmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>informant. Finally, if these requirements are met, and if, when material that is the subject of the alleged falsity or reckless disregard is set to one side, there remains sufficient content in the warrant affidavit to support a finding of probable cause, no hearing is required.\u201d <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 171\u201472, 98 S.

That both are presently assigned to the Detective Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">\u201cThat on March 1, 1975, the Sponge Rubber Products Company, Canal Street, Shelton, Connecticut, a Division of Grand Sheet Metal Incorporated, Spencerville, Ohio, was engulfed by flames after an explosion and Are. Said explosion and Are began at approximately 11:30 P.M. and burned into the early morning hours of March 2, 1975, completely destroying the Plant #4 portion of said company. That said explosion and subsequent fire was reported to these affiants and other investigators by Shelton Fire Chief Leroy Brainard, State Police Fire Investigator, Sergeant Frederick Moffett, and other witnesses who heard the aforementioned explosion. That during the normal course of this investigation, members of the Connecticut State Police Department have regularly reported to said affiants regarding information received in said investigation and have reported the information contained herein, and the affiants have also consulted with and reviewed reports of members of the Federal Bureau of Investigation concerning such incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\u201cThat on March 1, 1975, prior to the Are, at approximately 10:00 PM, two security guards and a boilerman, the only three employees at Plant # 4 at the time, were kidnapped at gunpoint by three men wearing over the head ski masks. Handcuffs were placed on their wrists and their eyes were taped. They were led from the building at approximately 10:45 PM, after having been held at said Plant in the bound condition for approximately forty five minutes, placed in the rear seat of one of the guard's vehicles and driven to the Town of Monroe, Connecticut. The victims were left in the ear after the perpetrators removed the handcuffs from their wrists and bound them with adhesive tape.

Sergeant Moffett pointed out an indentation burned into the concrete on the first floor, leading past the entrance to the ladies room and to a point in the press room where there was a crater in the floor caused by an explosion. Sergeant Moffett stated that the burned indentation was caused, in his opinion, by detonating cord, used as an accelerant to detonate explosives. Sergeant Moffett further stated that he determined this by an alligator pattern left as the trail of the indentation crossed a piece of steel.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">\u201cThat on March 7, 1975, Trooper Robert O\u2019Shaughnessey of the Connecticut State Police Emergency Services Division, reported that after clearing debris at the burned out Plant, he found a trial from the detonating cord indicating that at least 5000 ft. was used. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>Trooper O\u2019Shaughnessey further reported that the remains of four paper fiber drums were found in the debris and that said drums had plastic lining inside. That a strong odor of gasoline or paint thinner was detected at said fiber drums. That the drums bore markings of the Kodak Film Company, indicating that they did not belong in the plant. That the fiber barrell remains were examined at the Federal Bureau of Investigation Laboratory in Washington, D.C., where gasoline traces were found in the plastie lining remains of the said barrels.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">\u201cThat on April 11, 1975, John W. Shaw, a resident of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, was interviewed by Special Agent James McNamara of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The interview took place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. That in a written statement obtained at that time from the said John W. Shaw, he stated that on February 18, 1975, he was contacted by one Dennis Tiche of Boyers, Pennsylvania. That he met with Dennis Tiche during the evening of February 18, 1975, and that Dennis Tiehe asked him to assist him in burning a building, and that he Shaw, would receive $2,500 as payment for his assistance. John W. Shaw further stated that Dennis Tiehe told him that he, Dennis Tiehe, and Anthony Just of Pennsylvania, had viewed the plant and that it was extremely large and that there were tanks in the plant that were very flammable. That on February 20, 1975, he received approximately $1,000 from Dennis Tiehe for expenses which would be incurred. That he then purchased 50 fifty gallon capacity fiber barrels from the Weissman Barrel Company in Braddock, Pennsylvania. John W. Shaw further stated in a detailed account, the manner in which the fifty fiber barrels were subsequently filled with gasoline and placed onto an Avis Bental truck together with a quantity of dynamite and detonating cord, and that a cousin of Dennis Tiche by the name of Michael Tiehe, assisted in loading the gasoline. John W. Shaw further stated that on February 28, 1975, at approximately 12:30 AM, he and Dennis Tiche met two or three men at a gasoline station in Boyers, Pennsylvania and that these men were in a Cadillac Eldorado, color blue, with a white top and a white interior. That an individual identified to him as \u2018Blaekie\u2019 proceeded directly to the aforementioned Avis Bental truck and drove off. That Dennis Tiche talked with an individual in the Cadillac Eldorado he later identified as, \u2018Pete.\u2019 John W. Shaw further stated that on February 28, 1975, at approximately 7:55 PM he, Dennis Tiehe, and Michael Tiche flew from Pittsburgh to New York City and then took a train to New Haven, Connecticut. That upon arrival in New Haven, they walked to the Park Plaza Hotel and they all signed in at the hotel. That he used his correct name and that Dennis Tiche and Michael Tiche used fictitious names and addresses. That when they arrived at LaGuardia Airport in New York, the subject named, \u2018Pete,\u2019 appeared and had a conversation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>with <em>Dennis </em>Tiehe. That Dennis Tiehe later told him that \u2018Pete\u2019 gave him $3,000 as partial payment and that while at the Park Plaza Hotel in New Haven, Dennis Tiehe gave him $1,000. John W. Shaw further stated that on the morning of March 1, 1975, he, Dennis Tiehe, and Michael Tiehe took a cab to Howard Johnson\u2019s Bestaurant, where they met four other men. That one of the men was Anthony Just, one was identified as \u2018Al,\u2019 and one as \u2018Bonnie.\u2019 That \u2018Al\u2019 was described as short and \u2018Bonnie\u2019 as being large, with a bald head.

That he and Dennis Tiehe were wearing work belts and that \u2018Dave\u2019 signed all three of them into the plant and told them that their \u2018alibi\u2019 was that they were telephone company workmen, setting up a new telephone system. That \u2018Dave\u2019 also told him that he had something to do with the water treatment of the company. John W. Shaw further stated that \u2018Dave\u2019 took the three of them on a tour of the plant and that he, Shaw, observed fiber barrels in the plant which were similar to those loaded onto the Avis Bental truck in Pennsylvania. That \u2018Dave\u2019 said that he had ordered them earlier and that he was glad that the fiber barrels looked the same. That they were held up in placing the material for the fire due to the elevator in the plant being broken down. That the same Avis Bental truek that had been loaded in Pennsylvania was parked at the loading dock at the plant and that \u2018Blaekie\u2019 was sitting in it. That after the elevator was repaired, he, Michael Tiehe, and \u2018Blaekie\u2019 unloaded the truck. That during the afternoon, \u2018Dave\u2019 said that he had talked to the guards at the plant and determined that they did not make any rounds of the plant until 8:00 PM. That between 5 and 7 PM they placed the barrels at random through the plant. John W.

That they drove to an area not familiar to him where they met \u2018Al\u2019 and \u2018Tony\u2019 who had the three employees. That they removed the handcuffs from the employees and threw the ear keys into the bushes. John W. Shaw further stated that he knew Anthony Just, having met him previously. That while at the plant, \u2018Dave\u2019 told him that he had already invested over $100,000 [sic] in this and that he and \u2018Pete\u2019 knew eaeh other.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>\u201cJohn W.
