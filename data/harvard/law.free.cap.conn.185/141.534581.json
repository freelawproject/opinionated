Asserting that the court abused its discretion in making these awards, the defendant has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>On appeal, the defendant contends that because the court made no award of periodic alimony, the award falls solely within the ambit of \u00a7 46b-81<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the General Statutes as an assignment of his estate and that the award exceeds his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The defendant\u2019s first contention would necessarily compel the conclusion that no lump sum alimony can be awarded pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 46b-82.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The short answer is that, in contrast to \u00a7 46b-86, \u00a7 46b-82 speaks of \u201calimony,\u201d not \u201cperiodic alimony.\u201d Under the provisions of General Statutes ^ 46-21 (repealed, Public Acts 1973, No. 73-373, \u00a7 43), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>alimony could take three distinct forms: (1) an assignment of a part of a husband\u2019s estate, (2) an award of periodic payments from income, or (3) a specific sum of money. <em>Viglione </em>v. <em>Viglione, </em>171 Conn. 213, 215, 368 A.2d 202 (1976). Under our present statutes an assignment of a specific portion of an estate is no longer \u201calimony\u201d but the statute did not otherwise change the previously established usage of the term \u201calimony.\u201d The trial court, in a dissolution action, therefore has the power to award to one party lump sum alimony which exceeds the size of the other\u2019s estate, if the court\u2019s consideration of all the factors listed in \u00a7 46b-82 reasonably supports such a lump sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The court had the following evidence before it. The parties were married thirty-four years and had two adult sons. The breakdown of the marriage was caused by the defendant\u2019s living with and sharing a home with another woman in Massachusetts. The plaintiff was fifty-six years of age and in poor health, suffering from arthritis of the spine.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She had been a housewife during the entire marriage and possessed no vocational skills other than that of hairdressing. Her only source of income was twelve dollars per week from her part-time hairdressing. The defendant was a sixty-year-old truck-driver who in 1977 earned $20,000 and in 1978 earned $25,000, plus weekly contributions of thirty-two dollars to his pension fund and ten dollars to a health and welfare fund. In November, 1978, he had a balance of $5820 in his credit union account. The plaintiff commenced this action in April, 1978. In the spring of 1978, the defendant transferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>between $10,000 and $25,000 to a son.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In July, 1978, he conveyed his one-half interests in two parcels of land in Harwinton to his sons. One parcel was two acres, the other was five acres. The defendant did not receive any consideration for the transfers of cash or real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">In determining whether the court abused its discretion, the ultimate question is whether the court could have reasonably concluded as it did. This court has repeatedly stated that because trial courts have a distinct advantage over an appellate court in dealing with domestic relations, where all the surrounding circumstances and the appearance and attitude of the parties are so significant, the court\u2019s broad discretion in determining a trial assignment of property and the type, amount, and duration of alimony will not be disturbed as long as the court reasonably could have concluded as it did. <em>Ridolfi </em>v. <em>Ridolfi, </em>178 Conn. 377, 423 A.2d 85 (1979); <em>Jacobsen </em>v. <em>Jacobsen, </em>177 Conn. 259, 413 A.2d 854 (1979); see also <em>Posada </em>v. <em>Posada, </em>179 Conn. 568, 572, 427 A.2d 406 (1980), and cases cited therein. In <em>Jacob-sen, </em>we stated that considerable weight is to be accorded the action of the trial court and every reasonable presumption given in favor of its correctness, since it is in the sole province of the trier to pass upon the credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be accorded the evidence. <em>Jacobsen </em>v. <em>Jacobsen, </em>supra, 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>On the basis of the evidence and the law applicable thereto, we conclude that the trial court reasonably could have concluded as it did conclude.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b154-7\">\u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 46b-81.
