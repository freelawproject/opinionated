The plaintiffs, non-probationary city employees, sued the city of New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>Britain and its mayor, Matthew J. Avitable, for an order of mandamus reinstating them in their positions after the commission\u2019s orders of reinstatement were ignored by the city. The trial court denied relief, and the plaintiffs have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The following facts are undisputed. The plaintiffs John Perretta, Mary Dzioba, John F. Cass III, John P. Argazzi, Pidel A. Blumes, and Daniel J. Begley, all classified, non-probationary employees of the city of New Britain, were laid off in accordance with the \u201cMayor\u2019s Office Layoff Plan\u201d on June 30,1976. Shortly after receiving their layoff notices the plaintiffs appealed to the civil service commission, which on or about July 9, 1976 ordered their reinstatement, including restoration of all monies, fringe benefits, and seniority rights lost during the hiatus. The defendants in this action, the city of New Britain and its mayor, did not respond to the commission\u2019s order, and this suit was filed. Three of the plaintiffs, Mary Dzioba, John P. Cass III, and Daniel J. Begley, withdrew from the trial court action, although the plaintiff Dzioba was later restored.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">In their complaint, later amended and rendered more specific, the plaintiffs claimed that their rights under the state and federal constitutions, the New Britain city charter (\u00a7\u00a7 302, 374 and 392), the Buies of the Civil Service Commission (\u00a7\u00a7 6, 12 and 19), and the Jacobs Survey of Classification and Compensation Plans had been violated. The subsequent complaint of the intervening plaintiffs, Katherine Argazzi, Thomas Baldino, Michael - L. Brochu, Pauline D\u2019Addabbo, Herman Glass, and Louis Spigno, claimed a failure by the city to comply with the commission\u2019s orders and requested man-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>damns. A nonsuit was subsequently entered against intervening plaintiffs Baldino, Brochu, Glass and Spigno.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">In its memorandum of decision, the trial court found that the city and the mayor had acted within the bounds of their authority when they ordered layoffs in response to a genuine fiscal crisis. Further, it held that the city charter did not give the commission jurisdiction over appeals from such fiscally motivated layoffs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court rendered judgment for the defendants against all plaintiffs. The remaining plaintiffs and intervening plaintiffs have joined in this appeal. The named plaintiff, John Perretta, has since withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">It is important to be clear about what is not at issue in this case. There is no claim that the discharges questioned were disciplinary in nature. They were not so characterized by the city, and the plaintiffs have not asserted that the city\u2019s fiscal problems were a subterfuge designed to conceal discharges which were disciplinary in fact, but not in name. Although the plaintiffs do challenge the city\u2019s assessment of its financial situation, they do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>not claim bad faith on the part of the city in basing its layoffs on an asserted lack of funds. Finally, all the parties are agreed that the authority of the civil service commission must be found in the terms of the city charter. No one claims any other source of authority, either in state statutes or in a binding collective bargaining agreement under the Municipal Employee Eelations Act.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">The disagreement of the parties about the availability of civil service commission review of layoffs for non-probationary employees rests on their disparate interpretations of several sections of the New Britain city charter.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is well established that a city\u2019s charter is the fountainhead of municipal powers. <em>State ex rel. Raslavsky </em>v. <em>Bonvouloir, </em>167 Conn. 357, 362, 355 A.2d 275 (1974). The charter serves as an enabling act, both creating power and prescribing the form in which it must be exercised. <em>Food, Beverage &amp; Express Drivers Local Union </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>147 Conn. 401, 405, 161 A.2d 587 (1960); <em>Thomson </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>100 Conn. 604, 606, 124 A. 247 (1924); <em>State ex rel. Southey </em>v. <em>Lashar, </em>71 Conn. 540, 545-46, 42 A. 636 (1899). It follows that agents of a city, including its commissions, have no source of authority beyond the charter. \u201c[TJheir powers are measured and limited by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>express language in which authority is given or by the implication necessary to enable them to perform some duty cast upon them by express language.\u201d <em>Turney </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>55 Conn. 412, 414, 12 A. 520 (1887).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">The civil service commission of New Britain is an agency of the city authorized by General Statutes \u00a7 7-407 et seq. Its organization, powers, and procedures are described by chapter 3 of the New Britain city charter. In a recent opinion this court had occasion to examine the civil service commission of New Britain. We concluded \u201cthat it was a body of special and limited jurisdiction and therefore that it had no powers except such as the laws of its creation gave it and that it could not enlarge upon its powers.\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commission, </em>175 Conn. 504, 508, 400 A.2d 721 (1978). This principle guides our construction of chapter 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">We turn then to the specific charter provisions on which the plaintiffs rely to establish that the civil service commission had the authority to adjudicate their appeals. Their argument is based principally upon \u00a7 392, entitled \u201cDischarge or removal; appeals.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That section allows commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>sion review of any action whereby a permanent classified employee \u201cshall be removed, discharged, or reduced in rank or pay, except for just cause.\u201d This grant of authority, they maintain, is unlimited and embraces discharges in the nature of layoffs as well as disciplinary discharges. In support of this expansive reading, they cite ^ 302 (2),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> giving the commission broad authority to \u201cmake investigations concerning the enforcement and effect of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>chapter\u201d and \u00a7 374,* *****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> requiring commission approval of discharges and layoffs of probationary employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The defendants counter this interpretation of the city charter both with general principles and with specific rebuttals derived from other provisions of the New Britain charter. They note first that layoffs are presumptively to be distinguished from disciplinary discharges because layoffs arising out of fiscal constraints are generally recognized to be a prerogative of management and hence to fall within managerial discretion in the absence of express charter provisions to the contrary.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In support of this presumption, they point to labor arbitration decisions,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to the charter\u2019s separate section on layoffs, \u00a7 391,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and to the language of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>section on discharges, \u00a7 392, which expressly links discharge with \u201cjust cause,\u201d a choice of words more indicative of fault and discipline than of financial stringency.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">The defendants maintain that the charter provisions amply respond to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that they have a due process right to be heard before they are discharged for any cause whatever.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We agree for two reasons. First, as the defendants note, all the plaintiffs except John Argazzi have a right to a hearing in accordance with the grievance provisions of their collective bargaining agreements. Such a grievance procedure will resolve any possible conflict between collective bargaining and the charter.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Second, even if collective bargaining procedures were deemed to be insufficient, or, as to the plaintiff Argazzi, were unavailable, we can discern no constitutional basis for a hearing when termination is grounded on financial needs of the employer rather than fault of the employee. <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>426 U.S. 341, 349-50, 96 S. Ct. 2074, 48 L. Ed. 2d 684 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>(1976); <em>Board of Regents </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 573-74, 577, 92 S. Ct. 2701, 33 L. Ed. 2d 548 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">Moreover, the defendants argue that the provisions of the New Britain charter rebut the claims made by the plaintiffs. The defendants rely, as did the trial court, on limiting language in \u00a7302 (3),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which empowers the commission to hear appeals only from disciplinary actions suspending, reducing or removing classified employees. The defendants also read \u00a7 392 as applicable exclusively to disciplinary removals and \u00a7 391 as determinative of layoff procedures. They distinguish \u00a7 374 because it is limited by its terms to probationary appointments.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The argument that \u201cdischarge\u201d in \u00a7 392 is all-encompassing is rebutted by the structure and language of the charter. Separate provision for layoffs is made in \u00a7 391, which prescribes only the order of termination and reinstatement in the event of layoff. There is further support for the view that the charter deliberately distinguishes layoffs from dismissals in \u00a7 374, which refers disjunctively to discharges and layoffs of probationary employees. Finally, \u00a7 302 (3), which empowers the commission to hear appeals from disciplinary actions suspending classified employees, limits that right of appeal to claims involving classification or allot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>ment of positions and disciplinary dismissals. The preceding section, \u00a7 302 (2), authorizes only investigations by the commission, and investigatory power cannot be read as identical to adjudicatory power where the charter clearly presents them as separate commission functions. See Davis, Administrative Law (2d Ed. 1978) \u00a7\u00a7 18.1,18.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on <em>Cammisa </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>175 Conn. 445, 399 A.2d 521 (1978), for the proposition that a layoff for lack of funds is a dismissal for cause within the bounds of \u00a7 392 is misplaced.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It is true that in <em>Gammisa </em>this court concluded that dismissal for cause as used in the Waterbury charter applied to the elimination of authorized teaching positions for financial reasons. Id., 451. The court concluded, however, that this broad reading was necessary to implement the clear intent of the Waterbury charter that Waterbury teachers be dismissed only for cause. The disputed sections of the Waterbury charter did not speak of economic layoffs and thus permitted no distinction between economic and disciplinary causes of dismissal. The New Britain charter, in contrast, clearly separates economic and disciplinary occasions for dismissal in \u00a7\u00a7 391 and 392. The intent of Waterbury may not be imposed on New Britain, and each city\u2019s charter will be interpretated independently according to its own language and design. <em>Local #1186, AFSCME </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>182 Conn. 93, 101, 438 A.2d 12 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>The court in <em>Cammisa </em>found it unreasonable to read the Waterbury charter as furnishing greater protection to teachers terminated for fault than to those terminated for budgetary reasons. <em>Cammisa </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>supra, 451. Similarly, the New Britain charter, under \u00a7 374, furnishes a civil service review to laid off probationary employees but not to laid off permanent employees like the plaintiffs. This apparent anomaly can be explained, however, by a greater need to protect probationary employees, presumably those most recently hired, from the use of layoff as a convenient screen for unjustified dismissals for cause. The drafters of the New Britain charter might reasonably have concluded that the vulnerable position of probationary employees required such additional protection from arbitrary termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">When ^4 391 and 392 of the New Britain charter are read together, it is apparent that the charter draws a sharp, explicit distinction between layoffs and dismissals for cause in the case of non-probationary employees. These two sections compose Article 9 of the charter, entitled \u201cTermination of Service.\u201d Together they divide up the field, offering specific and appropriate protections for employees who lose their positions in either manner. Section 391 mandates that employees laid off for lack of work or lack of funds be rehired according to their classification seniority when work or funds are available. In contrast \u00a7 392 mandates that employees removed, discharged or reduced in rank receive the reasons for such action in writing and the right to an appeal. In case of layoff, employees are protected against arbitrary or inequitable rehirings when circumstances change; in case of dismis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>sal for canse, employees are protected against arbitrary or inequitable loss of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Section 391, in contradistinction to \u00a7 392, provides no implementing procedures. Such an omission, in a charter that elsewhere provides and articulates review procedures in detail, supports the inference that the drafters intended to provide no right of review in case of layoffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Both provisions, \u00a7\u00a7 391 and 392, are nonetheless in harmony with the statutory purpose of the merit system, \u201cto provide means for selecting and promoting each public official and employee upon the sole basis of his proven ability to perform the duties of his office or employment more efficiently than any other candidate therefor . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 7-409. The basic distinction between layoff for lack of funds and dismissal for cause has been recognized elsewhere by this court. <em>State ex rel. Hartnett </em>v. <em>Zeller, </em>135 Conn. 438, 441-42, 65 A.2d 475 (1949). That distinction is clearly intended as well by the New Britain charter, which authorizes appeal to the civil service commission under \u00a7 392 only in the ease of dismissal for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">In his separate brief, in addition to joining the arguments of the other appellants, the plaintiff John Argazzi questions whether the defendant mayor had any authority to lay off a city employee when the civil service commission, acting in its dual capacities as the plaintiff\u2019s appointing authority and as the overseer of New Britain\u2019s merit system, failed to concur. At the time of the layoff, John Argazzi was employed as a personnel officer of the civil service commission. He argues, in gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>eral, that the New Britain charter confers no authority upon the mayor to lay off any city employee and, in particular, that only an appointing authority as defined in \u00a7 453 of the charter has the power of removal.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Since John Argazzi\u2019s employer, the commission, expressly voted not to lay him off, he argues that he was in fact never laid off. Furthermore, he claims his layoff was ineffective since the mayor failed to obtain the commission\u2019s consent and approval as required by \u00a7 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">John Argazzi\u2019s argument based on \u00a7 374 has already been addressed in the previous section of this opinion. That section deals with the rights of probationary employees. Since John Argazzi was not a probationary employee at the time of layoff, \u00a7 374 does not apply to him. His second argument, the mayor\u2019s alleged lack of authority to lay off city employees, must be resolved by reference to the fundamental principles of municipal government. These principles define municipal authority and locate executive authority, except as otherwise allocated, in a city\u2019s executive officer, here its mayor.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">As a creature of the state, a city \u201ccan exercise only such powers as are expressly granted to it, or such powers as are necessary to enable it to discharge the duties and carry into effect the objects and purposes of its creation.\u201d <em>Board of Police Commissioners </em>v. <em>White, </em>171 Conn. 553, 559, 370 A.2d 1070 (1976); <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>United Illuminating Co., </em>168 Conn. 478, 497, 362 A.2d 785 (1975); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number><em>Windham Community Memorial Hospital </em>v. <em>Willimantic, </em>166 Conn. 113, 122, 348 A.2d 651 (1974); <em>New Haven Water Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>152 Conn. 563, 566, 210 A.2d 449 (1965). In the absence of an express provision, the authority necessary for effective exercise of a granted municipal power will be conferred by implication. <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>American Arbitration Assn., </em>174 Conn. 472, 479, 391 A.2d 137 (1978). Cities with charters have the power to manage, regulate and control their finances; to protect the welfare of the city; and to make all lawful regulations and orders in furtherance of any granted powers. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a77-194 (6), (26), (57). The New Britain city charter gives to the city all municipal powers \u201cwhich may be reasonably necessary for the government and regulation of its inhabitants and its local affairs and for the performance of public services, not inconsistent with law or this charter.\u201d Section 103. The mayor of New Britain is its chief executive magistrate; New Britain city charter \u00a7 2341; and is charged with the responsibility of carrying into effect many attributes of his city\u2019s sovereignty. <em>Prudential Mortgage &amp; Investment Co. </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>123 Conn. 390, 394, 195 A. 609 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">The authority of New Britain to lay off city .. employees for reasons of economy falls within its expressed and implied powers. When the city determines that its welfare and the proper management of its financial resources require reduced expenditures, it has discretion to husband those resources by laying off city employees whose performance it judges expendable. A city may dismiss employees in such circumstances even in the face of civil service regulations, charter provisions or statutes requiring just cause for dismissals. See <em>Connecti</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number><em>cut State Employees Assn. </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>165 Conn. 757, 763-64, 345 A.2d 36 (1974); <em>State ex rel. Hartnett </em>v. <em>Zeller, </em>supra, 441-42; McQuillin, Municipal Corporations (3d Ed. 1979) \u00a712.246; 111 A.L.R. 432. In the absence of any charter provision limiting the mayor\u2019s authority to lay off city employees, that authority will be implied as necessary to the execution of his public duties as New Britain\u2019s chief executive officer. See <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>American Arbitration Assn., </em>supra, 480; <em>Rowland </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>124 Conn. 129, 137-38, 198 A. 337 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Section 391 clearly anticipates the possibility of layoffs for lack of work or lack of funds. To accept the plaintiff\u2019s argument that only an employee\u2019s direct appointing authority can order his layoff is to fragment municipal power and severely hamper its exercise in times of economic distress. We have previously recognized that this very charter, in its provisions for classified employees of school boards, entrusts to different municipal agencies the power of appointment and the power of removal. <em>Local # 1186, AFSCME </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 102-103. It is therefore clear that, regardless of where a city\u2019s charter locates appointment powers, the charter may expressly delegate the authority to lay off employees to any designated government agencies or officials, or may refer the issue to grievance procedures under a collective bargaining agreement. Where the charter has not done so, a city\u2019s mayor, as its chief executive officer, has the authority to order layoffs of city employees for the purpose of implementing a properly promulgated municipal budget that mandates fiscal stringency.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">In its decision the trial court, after holding that the civil service commission lacked jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs\u2019 appeals and that the layoffs were lawfully executed, went on to resolve what it termed the plaintiffs\u2019 other claims of law; the plaintiffs have appealed from those sections of the decision as well. Since, however, the plaintiffs\u2019 complaints raised no issue beyond the defendants\u2019 authority to execute these layoffs and requested no relief beyond mandamus, there is no need for this court to. reach any additional issues. <em>Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corporation </em>v. <em>Nasiatko, </em>129 Conn. 19, 23, 25 A.2d 661 (1942). Any error in those rulings would be harmless. Maltbie, Conn. App. Proc. \u00a7 24. The trial court\u2019s denial of mandamus was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b103-6\"> These intervening plaintiffs were nonsuited for failing to comply with an order for disclosure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b103-7\"> Although the court acknowledged that this holding was dispositive, it went on to clarify two additional issues. First, in addressing the question of seniority rights, it found the proper remedy to be a grievance under the plaintiffs\u2019 union contract. The court also construed \u201cseniority by department\u201d as used in the city charter to mean seniority within a job classification and held that the plaintiff John Argazzi, who alone among the plaintiffs was not covered by the collective bargaining agreement, was laid off in accord with the charter\u2019s seniority guidelines. Second, in addressing the question of the city\u2019s fiscal condition, the court held that the civil service commission exceeded its authority in finding that the city had sufficient funds to annul the layoffs and in referring to General Statutes \u00a7 7-468.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b104-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7\u00a77-467\u20147-477.
