In that action, Dwight Building Company (hereinafter Dwight) successfully moved to intervene as a party defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After a hearing, a judgment of foreclosure was rendered for the plaintiff and for Allied Electric Supply Corporation (hereinafter Allied), another lienor. From this judgment the defendants SNETCO and Dwight are appealing, raising questions with regard to both the constitutionality of the mechanic\u2019s lien statutes and the calculation of the lienors\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">In the trial court the parties stipulated to the following facts: On or about November 21, 1973, SNETCO and Dwight signed a contract under which Dwight agreed to serve as general contractor for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>construction of a building on property owned by SNETCO. On or about December 13,1973, Dwight in turn subcontracted with J ohnson Electric Company, Inc. (hereinafter Johnson) for the performance of electrical work on the construction project. Johnson withdrew from the project before completing its assigned work and has since been adjudicated bankrupt. Dwight, which had already paid Johnson for work done, contracted with two other electrical firms for the completion of Johnson\u2019s work and paid those firms accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">On August 8, 1975, seeking payment for material and services supplied to Johnson and for repairs of water damaged equipment, GESCO, a second tier subcontractor, filed a notice of intent to claim a mechanic\u2019s lien under General Statutes \u00a7 49-35 and a mechanic\u2019s lien under General Statutes \u00a7 49-33 on SNETCO\u2019s property. A copy of the notice of intent was mailed to Dwight as well as to SNETCO. A month later, on September 19, 1975, Allied, another second tier subcontractor, filed its own notice of intent and mechanic\u2019s lien on SNETCO\u2019s property, also seeking payment for material and services supplied to J ohnson.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the time both liens were filed, their combined total was exceeded by the amount SNETCO still owed Dwight; SNETCO thereafter withheld from Dwight the amounts claimed by GES-CO and Allied.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">In the subsequent trial of GESCO\u2019s action to foreclose its mechanic\u2019s lien on SNETCO\u2019s property, initiated on February 2, 1976, the defendants SNETCO and Dwight successfully challenged the claims of several potential lienors. The trial judge, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>however, upheld the claim of GESCO in the amount of $94,983.90 and the claim of Allied on its cross-complaint in the amount of $4960.90; they were also awarded interest. Only SNETCO and Dwight have appealed. They have raised three issues: whether the Connecticut mechanic\u2019s lien statutes deny procedural due process to a general contractor by failing to provide such a person with an independent right to a hearing; whether the trial court erred in finding that the property owner had agreed to pay for repairs to storm-damaged equipment; and whether the trial court erred in awarding interest to the lienors.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The defendants\u2019 constitutional challenge to our mechanic\u2019s lien statutes; General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 49-33 through 49-40a; rests on the argued inadequacy of access to a judicial hearing for a general contractor who wishes to contest the imposition of a lien on the real property of the owner whose land is being improved, repaired or developed. The defendants have no quarrel with the statutory protection now afforded to the landowner, either in principle or in its application to the facts of this case. They maintain instead that the general contractor is adversely affected by the imposition of a lien on the property of the owner, because the result of notice of a lien is invariably to freeze assets to which the general contractor would otherwise be entitled. Section 49-36 of the General Statutes measures the lienors\u2019 rights against the owner with reference to a lien-able fund created by payments owed to the general contractor under the prime contract at the time of notice. General Statutes \u00a7 49-36; <em>Seaman </em>v. <em>Climate Control Corporation, </em>181 Conn. 592, 596, 601-604, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>436 A.2d 271 (1980). This statute, the defendants claim, exerts substantial pressure upon the owner to withhold further payments from the general contractor once any mechanic\u2019s liens are filed. Therefore, the defendants argue, the general contractor has a sufficient economic interest in the imposition of such liens to merit an independent constitutional right to a hearing to challenge their validity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The trial court considered this argument and rejected it on the ground that \u201cthe statute authorizes a lien on the real propery of the owner, not on any funds of the owner, and clearly not on any property of the general contractor.\u201d Since withholding of funds upon notice of liens was authorized by the contract between SNETCO and Dwight, the court concluded that whatever action the owner might take upon the filing of liens was essentially contractual in nature. Hence Dwight was not constitutionally entitled to the same notice and protection that the statutes provided to the owner. The trial court therefore held that \u201c[t]he defendants have failed to meet their burden of establishing the invalidity of the statute beyond a reasonable doubt and that its effect on them adversely affects a constitutionally protected right which they have.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">In order to evaluate the defendants\u2019 renewed constitutional claim, it is important to review briefly the present Connecticut statutes governing mechanic\u2019s liens and the rights to notice and to a hearing that they contain. At present, a person filing a mechanic\u2019s lien must provide written notice to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>owner of the property attached; General Statutes \u00a7 49-34 ;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> any lienor other than the original contractor or a subcontractor whose contract has been approved in writing by the owner must also serve a notice of intent to file a mechanic\u2019s lien on the owner. General Statutes \u00a7 49-35.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Any owner of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>real estate may apply to the court for reduction or discharge of one or more mechanic\u2019s liens at any time and may, upon notice to all lienors and any other owners of the property, gain a prompt hearing. General Statutes \u00a7 49-35a (a).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendants concede that under this scheme the property owner\u2019s constitutional rights are fully accommodated. See <em>Roundhouse Construction Corporation </em>v. <em>Telesco Masons Supplies Co., </em>168 Conn. 371, 383, 362 A.2d 778, vacated, 423 U.S. 809, 96 S. Ct. 20, 46 L. Ed. 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>29 (1975), on remand, 170 Conn. 155, 365 A.2d 393, cert. denied, 429 U.S. 889, 97 S. Ct. 246, 50 L. Ed. 2d 172 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">The gravamen of Dwight\u2019s complaint is that there is no similar nnconditional right to a hearing for a general contractor. For Dwight, the only recourse is to use \u00a749-37 (a), which permits \u201cany person interested\u201d in the real estate to dissolve a mechanic\u2019s lien by substituting a bond with surety for the lien.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>The principal or surety on the bond may then apply to the court for a hearing on the validity or the amount of the lien. General Statutes $ 49-37 (b) (l).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, a general contractor, as a person interested in the real estate, may indeed obtain a hearing but only at the cost of a surety bond. <em>Henry F. Raab Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>J.W. Fisher Co., </em>183 Conn. 108, 116, 438 A.2d 834 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">The statutory requirement that any interested party other than the property owner must post a bond to obtain a hearing on a mechanic\u2019s lien raises serious doubts about the constitutionality of our statutory scheme. It is well established that deprivation of the use and possession of property without a hearing violates the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. <em>North Georgia Finishing, Inc. </em>v. <em>Di-Chem, Inc., </em>419 U.S. 601, 606, 95 S. Ct. 719, 42 L. Ed. 2d 751 (1975); <em>Fuentes </em>v. <em>Shevin, </em>407 U.S.</p>\n<p id=\"AVP\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>67, 86, 92 S. Ct. 1983, 32 L. Ed. 2d 556 (1972); <em>Society for Savings </em>v. <em>Chestnut Estates, Inc., </em>176 Conn. 563, 570, 409 A.2d 1020 (1979); <em>Roundhouse Construction Corporation </em>v. <em>Telesco Masons Supplies Co., </em>supra, 384-85. Courts in other jurisdictions that have considered the conditioning of an attachment hearing or dissolution on a bond are divided in their results. For cases rejecting a bond as excessively burdensome see, e.g., <em>Guzman </em>v. <em>Western State Bank of Devils Lake, No. Dak., </em>516 F.2d 125, 131 (8th Cir. 1975); <em>Mississippi Chemical Corporation </em>v. <em>Chemical Construction Corporation, </em>444 F. Sup. 925, 938 (S.D. Miss. 1977); <em>Hillhouse </em>v. <em>City of Kansas City, </em>221 Kan. 369, 376, 559 P.2d 1148 (1977); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Matovich, </em>172 Mont. 109, 114, 560 P.2d 1338 (1977); for cases accepting a bond as a procedural safeguard see, e.g., <em>Jonnet </em>v. <em>Dollar Savings Bank of City of New York, </em>530 F.2d 1123, 1130 (3d Cir. 1976); <em>Aaron Ferer &amp; Sons Co. </em>v. <em>Berman, </em>431 F. Sup. 847, 852 (D. Neb. 1977); <em>In the Matter of McLarty Industries, Inc., 2 </em>B.R. 68, 74 (N.D. Ga. 1979); <em>Unique Caterers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rudy\u2019s Farm Co., </em>338 So. 2d 1067, 1070-71 (Fla. 1976). In light of the year that may elapse before a lienor must either foreclose or forfeit his lien, the defendants have made out a strong prima facie case that our statutes may operate to deprive a general contractor of a prompt hearing. General Statutes \u00a7 49-39 ;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Roundhouse Construction Cor</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number><em>poration </em>v. <em>Telesco Masons Supplies Co., </em>supra, 380-81, 383. We are, however, persuaded that this is not the ease in which the defendants\u2019 argument may properly be raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">This ease poses difficulties for the defendants\u2019 due process claim because of the arena in which the defendants have chosen to vindicate that claim and the protagonists whom they have elected to enlist in the fray. It is fundamental that a party challenging \u201cthe constitutionality of a statute must prove that the statute has adversely affected a constitutionally protected right \u2018under the facts of his particular case and not merely under some possible or hypothetical set of facts not proven to exist.\u2019 <em>Hardware Mutual Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Premo, </em>153 Conn. 465, 471, 217 A.2d 698 (1966); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cuvelier, </em>175 Conn. 100, 111-12, 394 A.2d 185 (1978); <em>Gentile </em>v. <em>Altermatt, </em>169 Conn. 267, 307, 363 A.2d 1 (1975), appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 1041, 96 S. Ct. 763, 46 L. Ed. 2d 631 (1976); <em>Kellems </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>163 Conn. 478, 483, 313 A.2d 53, appeal dismissed, 409 U.S. 1099, 93 S. Ct. 911, 34 L. Ed. 2d 678 (1972); <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Rubinow, </em>157 Conn. 150, 152-53, 251 A.2d 49 (1968). Furthermore, a person contesting a statute\u2019s constitutionality has a heavy burden to establish its invalidity beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Roundhouse Construction Corporation </em>v. <em>Telesco Masons Supplies Co., </em>supra, 385; <em>Kellems </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>supra, 486; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Rubinow, </em>supra, 152.\u201d <em>Weil </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>185 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>495, 501-502, 441 A.2d 142 (1981). The constitutional right asserted here by the general contractor is the right to be heard, at any time, without having to post a bond, when payments otherwise due on a prime contract are withheld by the owner of the real property. The general contractor\u2019s dispute concerns a property interest in an account; see General Statutes \u00a7 42a-9-106 j<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and his natural protagonist should be the person claiming a superior right to that account, the owner of the real property. Yet the general contractor in this litigation seeks a determination of his constitutional rights in a lawsuit involving different property and different defendants. We are not persuaded that foreclosure of a statutory lien on the real property of the owner should be the testing ground for rights to an account. We are equally unpersuaded that subcontractors enforcing their mechanic\u2019s liens should be burdened with defending against the constitutional claims of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The defendants acknowledge, as they must, that the general contractor\u2019s property right to an account is not identical to the subcontractors\u2019 rights to a mechanic\u2019s lien on the owner\u2019s property. To bridge this gap in the respective property interests, they rely on language in <em>Seaman </em>v. <em>Climate Control Corporation, </em>181 Conn. 592, 604, 436 A.2d 271 (1980), in which this court explored the basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>upon which second tier subcontractors are entitled to mechanic\u2019s liens. We there spoke of a lienable fund, a fund \u201ccreated by payments owed to the general contractor.\u201d That fund, on subrogation principles, limits the totality of the mechanic\u2019s liens that may be asserted against the property of the owner. The fact that mechanic\u2019s liens are measured by and limited to this lienable fund does not mean that the mechanic\u2019s liens are liens <em>on </em>the lienable fund. In other contexts, we have long recognized a distinction between the object on which a statute operates and the measure of the statute\u2019s operation. See <em>Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Tax Commissioner, </em>178 Conn. 243, 247-48, 423 A.2d 883 (1979). So here we concur with the trial court that the filing of a mechanic\u2019s lien does not operate as a direct taking of property of the general contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">Nor can we agree with the defendants\u2019 argument that the filing of a mechanic\u2019s lien operates as an indirect statutory taking of the general contractor\u2019s property. It may well be prudent for an owner to protect himself from dual liability by refusing thereafter to make further payments from the lienable fund to the general contractor, but our statute does not compel such withholding. Although in <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Moomjian, </em>92 Conn. 476, 483-85, 103 A. 635 (1918), this court spoke of an owner\u2019s \u201cduty .. . to retain . . . moneys due the original contractor,\u201d the court itself clarified that language by noting that the governing statute, now General Statutes \u00a7 49-36,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> does not expressly prohibit additional pay-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>merits to the general contractor but only describes the consequences of such payments for the duties owed by the owner to the subcontractor lienor. In point of fact, since the prime contract between the owner and the general contractor in this case expressly authorized the withholding of payments when third party claims are filed,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> we cannot determine whether the owner\u2019s decision to withhold the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>lienable fund from the general contractor in this case was primarily an exercise of statutory rights or of contractual rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">The defendants are mistaken in their reliance on this court\u2019s recent decisions in <em>Seaman </em>v. <em>Climate Control Corporation, </em>supra, or in <em>Henry F. Raab Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>J. W. Fisher Co., </em>supra, to buttress their position that the present proceedings involve a taking of the general contractor\u2019s property. In <em>Seaman </em>we reviewed the history of Connecticut\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien statutes to conclude that a subcontractor is subrogated to the general contractor\u2019s claims against the owner in spite of an intervening contractor\u2019s default. <em>Seaman </em>v. <em>Climate Control Corporation, </em>supra, 601-605. We expressly declined to consider \u201c [h] ow the risk of defaulting first tier subcontractors should be allocated between the owner and the general contractor\u201d; <em>Seaman </em>v. <em>Climate Control Corporation, </em>supra, 606; and we nowhere postulated a reciprocal variant of the <em>Seaman </em>holding, that a general contractor is subrogated to the statutory rights of the owner when a subcontractor files a mechanic\u2019s lien. In <em>Baab </em>we held that a subcontractor is a \u201cperson interested\u201d in the real estate for the purposes of General Statutes \u00a7 49-37 (a) and may file a surety bond to dissolve a mechanic\u2019s lien. <em>Henry F. Raab Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>J. W. Fisher Co., </em>supra, 116-17. This holding, however, takes Dwight no further toward its goal, since <em>Baab </em>recognized a continued distinction between the rights of the owner and of other \u201cinterested parties\u201d when it held that only an owner may apply for a hearing without posting a bond under \u00a7 49-35. <em>Henry F. Raab Connecticut, Inc. </em>v. <em>J. W. Fisher Co., </em>supra, 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>In sum, although the defendants may well be right that the general contractor suffers economic injury as a consequence of the imposition of mechanic\u2019s liens on the property of the owner, we are not persuaded that an action to foreclose the mechanic\u2019s lien provides the proper forum for testing the general contractor\u2019s constitutional claims. Why should the subcontractor lienors defend constitutional claims arising not out of their conduct but out of the conduct of the owner of the real property? If the real issue is the propriety of the withholding of funds from the general contractor by the owner, why should that issue not be litigated between those parties instead? It would be inconsistent with the avowed remedial purpose of our mechanic\u2019s lien statutes, \u201cto furnish security for a contractor\u2019s labor and materials\u201d; <em>Seaman </em>v. <em>Climate Control Corporation, </em>supra, 597; see <em>H &amp; S Torrington Associates </em>v. <em>Luts Engineering Co., </em>185 Conn. 549, 555-56, 441 A.2d 171 (1981); to impose upon subcontractors the burden of litigating issues to which they are strangers.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">These questions bring into focus another reason why the present case is not the right vehicle for the adjudication of the constitutional rights of a general contractor. We note that, throughout these proceedings, both in the trial court and in this court, the defendants SNETCO and Dwight, the owner and the general contractor, have been represented by the same counsel. The record demonstrates then an apparent identity of interest between the owner and the general contractor which is fundamentally inconsistent with the constitutional claims which are now being asserted. If in fact there is no conflict between SNETCO and Dwight, then Dwight cannot have suffered any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>cognizable injury in this case. The defendants have conceded that SNETCO, as owner, was fully and correctly protected by the governing statutes. Under those statutes, SNETCO could have obtained a hearing at any time, without first having to file a bond. Dwight could have been made a party to such a hearing, either at its own request or that of SNETCO. Alternatively, Dwight might have asked SNETCO to initiate hearing proceedings in which Dwight might then join. Neither SNETCO nor Dwight availed itself of these opportunities to avoid the delays of which Dwight now complains.</p>\n<p id=\"Anu\">On this record, the relationship between the owner and the general contractor deprives the court of the necessary adversarial controversy in which their rights and duties inter se are best adjudicated. The defendants have acted as if SNETCO were a mere stakeholder, having no interests of its own, other than to avoid double liability to the mechanic\u2019s lienors and to the general contractor. Our reading of the statutes persuades us to the contrary. SNETCO, as <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Moomjian, </em>supra, indicates, bears independent responsibility for the lien claims of subcontractors on its property. It may, in the prime contract, shift to the general contractor some of the risks imposed upon it by statute. But the owner remains, vis-a-vis the subcontractors, a principal with nondelegable duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">The constitutional propriety of dealings between an owner and a general contractor should be adjudicated when there is a factual dispute to be adjudicated between them. We can envision a case in which a property owner relies on our statutes as the basis for withholding payment while a general contractor, the real party at interest, resists that with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>holding and seeks to question the validity of the lien. Under those circumstances, the constitutional issue will be ripe for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The defendants\u2019 second assignment of error challenges the amount of the lien claimed by the plaintiff GESCO. GESCO, in its notice of intent to claim a mechanic\u2019s lien and in its filing of its mechanic\u2019s lien, alleged that it had supplied materials and services to Johnson in the amount of $94,983.90. Of this amount, $11,913 represented services rendered in the repair of a piece of electrical equipment known as a switchgear. Despite the defendants\u2019 objection that repair costs were not a lienable item on this project, the trial court concluded that the $11,913 cost of repairing the switchgear was properly included in GESCO\u2019s mechanic\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision contains the following findings of fact with regard to the lienability of the switchgear repair costs: The switchgear was installed early in the job and GESCO was paid for it by Johnson. In the latter part of May 1975, the switchgear was flooded through no fault on the part of SNETCO, Dwight or GESCO. GESCO was contacted by representatives of Johnson and asked to do whatever was necessary to make the equipment serviceable. The field representative from SNETCO was on the job regularly and was aware of the problem with the switchgear. GESCO performed the necessary work on the equipment at a cost of $11,913, the reasonableness of which is not in dispute, and the machine is now in service. GESCO has not been paid for this work, although some time after June <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>23, 1975, Dwight paid Johnson a sum of money which included the $11,913 billed by GESCO to Johnson for the material and labor performed in repairing the switchgear.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The trial court concluded, on the basis of these findings, that since repair work in general is lien-able under General Statutes \u00a7 49-33; <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Rosenfield, </em>141 Conn. 188, 191-92, 104 A.2d 545 (1954); there was sufficient evidence of consent \u201cby virtue of an agreement with or by the consent of the owner\u201d to sustain GESCO\u2019s claim. The defendants do not challenge the legal principles on which the trial court relied but maintain instead that the court erred in finding a sufficient factual basis for the application of these principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The defendants\u2019 most cogent attack on the factual findings asserts that there was no evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that Dwight paid Johnson a sum of money which included the bill for the switchgear repairs. This payment was not a matter covered either in the pleadings or in the stipulation filed by the parties. Therefore if no evidence was introduced in support of this finding, as the defendants allege, the finding is clearly erroneous and must be stricken. Practice Book \u00a7 3060D. The exhibits filed as part of the record in this case do contain the prime contract between SNETCO and Dwight, but that contract supports the defendants\u2019 position because in it SNETCO disclaims responsibility for reimbursement of costs incurred in \u201cmaking good any damage to the property.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>GESCO has not challenged the admissibility of this contract nor contradicted the defendants\u2019 assertion that its provisions were incorporated by reference, as is customary, in the contracts of the first and second tier subcontractors. The only evidence that is properly before us suggests therefore that payment for repair costs would not have been authorized by any of the applicable written contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">GESCO proffers a tangential response to this attack on the trial court\u2019s finding that such a payment was nonetheless made, and inferentially authorized. GESCO asserts that the defendants may not on an appeal urge that a finding or conclusion is unsupported by the evidence without including in our record a transcript of the proceedings in the trial court. No such transcript has been filed by any of the parties in this case. Neither our statutes nor our rules of practice expressly require the filing of a transcript as a condition to the perfection of an appeal. Contrast, e.g., Fed. Rules of App. Proc., Rule 10 (b) (2).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In our rules, the closest analogy is found in relation to claims that a verdict should have been set aside, when a party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>asserting the absence of supporting evidence is permitted to \u201cstate that claim in his brief and submit no evidence . . . Practice Book \u00a7 3060U. Under that provision, the adverse party who is put to the expense of procuring and submitting substantiating evidence is entitled to recover costs unjustifiably caused by the claimant\u2019s posture. Our former practice, when a trial court prepared formal findings of fact and conclusions of law, similarly imposed upon the appellee the burden of printing evidence to show that no error was committed, <em>Hartford National Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>DiFazio, </em>177 Conn. 34, 39-40, 411 A.2d 8 (1979); <em>Engelke </em>v. <em>Wheatley, </em>148 Conn. 398, 411, 171 A.2d 402 (1961). In this case, the defendants, in their preliminary statement of the issues on appeal, gave GESCO timely notice that the repair item would be contested. GESCO therefore had ample opportunity itself to procure a transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">Those who take an appeal to this court indubitably bear the burden of persuasion that they have been aggrieved by error committed by the trial court. <em>Anonymous </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>168 Conn. 421, 430, 362 A.2d 532, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 935, 96 S. Ct. 294, 46 L. Ed. 2d 268 (1975); <em>Obermeier </em>v. <em>Nielson, </em>158 Conn. 8, 13, 255 A.2d 819 (1969); <em>Thorne </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>156 Conn. 619, 621, 238 A.2d 400 (1968). That burden never shifts to the appellee. But when the appellant puts into issue the sufficiency of the evidence to support a finding of fact by the trial court, our present rules permit the appellant to impose upon the appellee the burden of producing the evidence that is necessary for a decision by this court. See <em>Jennings </em>v. <em>Reale Construction Co., </em>175 Conn. 16, 19-20, 392 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>962 (1978); <em>Morningside Assn. </em>v. <em>Morningside Development, Inc., </em>172 Conn. 60, 64, 372 A.2d 141 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">In the absence of any evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding with respect to the disputed payment, we are obligated to conclude that the defendants have sustained their burden of showing that this finding was clearly erroneous. The only other available underpinning for the trial court\u2019s conclusion that SNETCO had consented to pay for repair of the switchgear was its factual finding that SNETCO\u2019s field representative was regularly on the job and aware of the problem with the switchgear. This finding alone is insufficient to establish consent. Although the provisions of a written contract can be waived by a subsequent oral agreement; see, e.g., <em>Brian Construction &amp; Development Co. </em>v. <em>Brighenti, </em>176 Conn. 162, 169-70, 405 A.2d 72 (1978); <em>Grote </em>v. <em>A. C. Hine Co., </em>148 Conn. 283, 286, 170 A.2d 138 (1961); <em>O\u2019Loughlin </em>v. <em>Poli, </em>82 Conn. 427, 432, 74 A. 763 (1909); see Corbin, Contracts \u00a71294; Calamari <em>&amp; </em>Perillo, Law of Contracts (2d Ed.) \u00a73-6; 1 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a789 (1981); the mere presence of a representative on the job site is not sufficient to establish either his authority to enter into such an agreement or his making of such an agreement in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The defendants are therefore entitled to prevail on their second claim of error. GESCO\u2019s judgment of $94,983.90 must be reduced by $11,913 to $83,070.90.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">The defendants\u2019 third and final claim of error urges us to hold that the trial court should not have awarded interest to GESCO and to Allied. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>trial court held that the lienors were entitled to interest from the time that their debts became due and payable, in 1975. Although it recognized the bona fides of the defendants\u2019 refusal to pay, the court nevertheless concluded that the defendants\u2019 retention of the moneys owed to the lienors was unlawful and thus wrongful. Invoking the general rule that the demands of justice in each case should determine the award of interest; see <em>Scribner </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, Inc., </em>169 Conn. 389, 405-406, 363 A.2d 160 (1975); <em>Cecio Bros., Inc. </em>v. <em>Feldmann, </em>161 Conn. 265, 274-75, 287 A.2d 374 (1971); the court determined that the prevailing parties were entitled to be paid when they filed their liens. The court specifically noted the length of time for which moneys had been withheld and the size of the sums involved. Earlier in its memorandum of decision, the court had found that all of the lienable work was done properly and in a timely fashion. Except for questioning the lienability of the switchgear repair, the defendants have never denied that the lienors performed in a good and workmanlike manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The allowance of interest pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 37-3 (now \u00a7 37-3a)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> is primarily an equitable determination within the discretion of the trial court. <em>Scribner </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, Inc., </em>supra; <em>Southern New England. Contracting Co. </em>v. <em>State, </em>165 Conn. 644, 665, 345 A.2d 550 (1974). To find an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>abuse of discretion here we would have to conclude that the seriousness of the defendants\u2019 constitutional challenge to the mechanic\u2019s lien statutes necessarily prevented their detention of the lienors\u2019 moneys from being wrongful. This we decline to do. Just as a claimant\u2019s entitlement to interest is not automatically defeated if the claim is unliquidated in amount; see <em>Scribner </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, Inc., </em>supra; so also the claim may, in the interests of justice to the claimant, survive a constitutional challenge. To find an abuse of discretion in this case, when the defendants had available to them the means for expeditious resolution of the lienors\u2019 claims, would be particularly unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">There is error in part, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to modify the judgment with regard to the plaintiff GESCO, so that the sum of $83,070.90 is the amount due the plaintiff on its mechanic\u2019s lien, with interest on that sum from the date of its filing. There is no error with respect to the judgment in favor of the defendant Allied Electric Supply Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b596-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 49-33 through 49-40a.
