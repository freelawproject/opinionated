The short answer to that question is \u201cno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">The facts are undisputed. On January 13, 1978, both parties were employed by the state of Connecticut and working on the campus of Southern Connecticut State College in New Haven. Patrick M. Musshorn, the defendant, while operating a truck owned and insured by the state, negligently caused the motor vehicle to back up, causing the plaintiff, David W. McKinley, to be struck by the tailgate and pinned to a guard rail. The plaintiff has not alleged that the defendant acted wilfully or maliciously. The plaintiff received workers\u2019 compensation benefits from the state for his resulting personal injuries. In addition, the plaintiff instituted this action against the defendant seeking damages for personal injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Upon its motion, tlie state was permitted to intervene in June, 1980 by the court, <em>Kelly J. </em>On November 21, 1980, the trial court granted the state\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, holding that the plaintiff\u2019s action against the defendant state employee was barred by the immunity granted to state employees by section 4-165 of the General Statutes. In his appeal from the dismissal of the complaint the plaintiff claims that the trial court erred in its construction of the three relevant statutes. He claims specifically that when injuries are caused by the negligent operation of a motor vehicle, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-293a and 52-556 supersede the immunity of a state employee from personal liability for injury \u201ccaused in the performance of his duties and within the scope of his employment\u201d provided by General Statutes \u00a7 4-165.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>An employee who has a right to benefits under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is barred from pursuing an action against his employer for damages for personal injuries.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Whether the right to workers\u2019 compensation also bars an action against a fellow employee for damages for personal injuries is a question of law. <em>Velardi </em>v. <em>Ryder Truck Rental, Inc., </em>178 Conn. 371, 375, 423 A.2d 77 (1979). General Statutes \u00a7 31-293a<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provides in part that if an employee has a right to workers\u2019 compensation benefits \u201con account of injury or death from injury caused by the negligence or wrong of a fellow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>employee, such right shall be the exclusive remedy of such injured employee . . . and no action may be brought against such fellow employee except for negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle . . . or unless such wrong was wilful or malicious.\u201d Clearly if the parties were fellow employees of an employer other than the state, the plaintiff\u2019s right to workers\u2019 compensation benefits would not bar his action against the defendant because the plaintiff has alleged negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle. Although the provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act apply to state employment,* ***<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the application of \u00a7 31-293a to state employees is drawn into question when it is compared with the specific immunity of state employees granted by General Statutes \u00a7 4-165. \u201cIn construing legislation, courts are required to reconcile apparently inconsistent provisions so far as that can be done.\u201d <em>Spring </em>v. <em>Constantino, </em>168 Conn. 563, 572, 362 A.2d 871 (1975); see <em>Hirschfeld </em>v. <em>Commission on Claims, </em>172 Conn. 603, 607, 376 A.2d 71 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 4-165 was intended to grant state employees immunity \u201cwhere and because the state may be sued . . . <em>Spring </em>v. <em>Constantino, </em>supra, 571. Because it abrogates the previously existing common law rights of redress against state employees, the statute must be strictly construed. <em>Spring </em>v. <em>Constantino, </em>supra, 570. \u201cWe have long recognized the common-law principle that the state cannot be sued without its consent. . . .\u201d <em>Sentner </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees of Regional Community Colleges, </em>184 Conn. 339, 342, 439 A.2d 1033 (1981); <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Meskill, </em>172 Conn. 615, 623, 376 A.2d 359 (1977). An individual having a liability claim for which a state employee is immune pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-165 may present it as a claim against the state to the claims commissioner. General Statutes \u00a7 4-165. \u201cWhen the claims commissioner deems it just and equitable, he may authorize suit against the state on any claim . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a74-160 (a). In addition to this waiver of sovereign immunity which is discretionary with the claims commissioner, some statutes expressly waive sovereign immunity with respect to specific kinds of claims. The state has expressly consented to be sued with respect to \u201cthe negligence of any state official or employee when operating a motor vehicle owned and insured by the state . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 52-556; <em>Fitzpatrick </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>18 Conn. Sup. 35, 36 (1952). General Statutes \u00a752-556 provides further that the victim of such negligence \u201cshall have a right of action against the state to recover damages\u201d for personal injury or property damage.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>Therefore, if the plaintiff has any right to proceed with a farther action, it would have to be against the state, not the defendant state employee.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant claims that this conclusion is superseded by the general language of General Statutes \u00a7 31-293a, permitting an action against a fellow employee who has caused injury by the negligent operation of a motor vehicle. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">This court considered a similar statutory conflict in <em>Edmundson </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>169 Conn. 630, 363 A.2d 1031 (1975). There, an employee of the city of Bridgeport sought damages from a fellow employee who negligently struck him while operating a truck during the course of his employment. Id., 631. The victim had received workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Id. This court found an irreconcilable conflict between General Statutes ^ 31-293a and \u00a7 7-465 (a)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>winch, provides that a municipal employee has no cause of action against a fellow employee for personal injury if the victim had a right to workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Id., 634. In holding that the statute which applied specifically to municipal employees prevailed over the statute which applied generally to employees, this court reasoned that \u201cif the legislature had intended [\u00a7 31-293a] to modify or repeal any part of \u00a7 7-465, it would have been a simple matter to have said so.\u201d Id., 634-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Similarly, the exception for actions alleging negligence in operating a motor vehicle which applies to employees generally was enacted subsequent to the statutory immunity granted specifically to state employees.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore, this court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Edmundson </em>is compelling, and we reject the plaintiff\u2019s claims to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">\u201cWe must presume that the legislature . . . acted in view of existing relevant statutes and with the intention of creating one consistent body of law ....\u201d <em>Budkofsky </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>177 Conn. 588, 592, 419 A.2d 333 (1979); see, e.g., <em>Caulfield </em>v. <em>Noble, </em>178 Conn. 81, 93, 420 A.2d 1160 (1979); <em>Engle </em>v. <em>Personnel Appeal Board, </em>175 Conn. 127, 130, 394 A.2d 731 (1978). However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>absent manifest intent to repeal an earlier statute, when general and specific statutes conflict they should be harmoniously construed so the more specific statute controls. <em>Edmundson </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 635. The exception granted by General Statutes \u00a7 31-293a to all employees must give way to the immunity granted specifically to state employees by General Statutes \u00a7 4-165.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b630-5\"> General Statutes \u00a74-165 provides: \"immunity of state officers and employees from personal liability.
