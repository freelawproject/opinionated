Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATb\">This matter involves a habeas corpus petition challenging the calculation of the plaintiff\u2019s statutory good time credits pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>snant to General Statutes \u00a7 18-7.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff has appealed from the judgment of the trial court, <em>L. Dorsey, J., </em>refusing to calculate the credits based on the aggregate of the plaintiff\u2019s consecutive and concurrent sentences. The court, instead, ruled that the plaintiff, upon whom the consecutive sentence was imposed after the concurrent sentences, was not yet \u201cheld,\u201d as required by \u00a7 18-7, under the consecutive sentence and therefore refused to aggregate the sentences pursuant to \u00a7 18-7. The court reasoned that the consecutive sentence was to be treated as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>separate and distinct from the concurrent sentences so as to preclude the plaintiff from the larger credits accorded to long term offenders under \u00a7 18-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The facts of this ease are not seriously disputed: On August 21, 1975, the plaintiff was sentenced to an effective term of imprisonment of not less than five nor more than ten years by the Tolland County Superior Court. Also on that date, the Hartford County Superior Court in a different case sentenced the plaintiff to a concurrent term of five to ten years imprisonment. On January 23, 1976, the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>was sentenced by the New Haven County Superior Court to an effective sentence of four to eight years \u201cconsecutive to any sentence he is presently serving.\u201d This consecutive sentence was imposed for a different crime and in a different case and has been treated as a separate and distinct sentence by the defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The plaintiff claims that if his two concurrent five to ten year sentences and one consecutive four to eight year sentence were aggregated into one continuous sentence of nine to eighteen years, he would be entitled to more good time credits pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 18-7 than he is presently receiving. This is so because \u00a7 18-7 provides for increased good time credits for the sixth and each subsequent year of a sentence which runs more than five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The plaintiff has also claimed that even if the defendant\u2019s computation of good time credit is correct, it violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, he states that there is no rational basis upon which to distinguish, for the purpose of awarding statutory good time credit, between an inmate serving a single nine to eighteen year sentence and an inmate serving consecutive sentences totaling nine to eighteen years.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">General Statutes ^ 18-7 provides the statutory scheme under which an inmate may earn a diminu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>tion in his sentence by maintaining good behavior and compliance with prison rules throughout his term of imprisonment. <em>Holmquist </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>168 Conn. 389, 392, 362 A.2d 971 (1975). \u201c \u2018[G-]ood time\u2019 is a commutation of a sentence, affecting an inmate\u2019s parole and discharge dates, thereby serving an important rehabilitative function by allowing an inmate the opportunity to earn an earlier release for himself. See <em>McGinnis </em>v. <em>Royster, </em>410 U.S. 263, 271, 35 L. Ed. 2d 282, 93 S. Ct. 1055 [1973].\u201d <em>Holmquist </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>supra, 394. \u201cThe purpose of the statutory good time award is to aid the rehabilitative process and to mitigate the severity of punishment by rewarding a prisoner for his good conduct.\u201d <em>DeSimone </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>404 F. Sup. 964, 967 (D. Conn. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">Under the present interpretation of \u00a7 18-7, if a sentence is imposed <em>at one time </em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>for two or more separate offenses, the inmate can aggregate the terms of imprisonment into one continuous term for the purpose of taking advantage of the increased rate of good time credits awarded for the later years of a long prison term. See <em>Moulthrop </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>129 Conn. 164, 168, 26 A.2d 789 (1942). Upon aggregation of the concurrent and consecutive terms of imprisonment for the purpose of comput<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>ing statutory good time credits under \u00a7 18-7, the proposition for which the plaintiff argues, an inmate could earn good time credit at an increased rate for the sixth and subsequent years if the total aggregated sentence exceeds five years. An inmate with a sentence of nine to eighteen years, imposed at one time, would earn the larger good time credits based on his sixth through eighteenth years.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The plaintiff was, however, separately sentenced to a four to eight year term of imprisonment to run consecutive to the five to ten year term he is presently serving. Because the defendant has treated the concurrent sentences and the consecutive sentence independently, the plaintiff\u2019s good time credit is calculated from the beginning of the concurrent sentences and again from the beginning of the consecutive sentence. As a result, the plaintiff, whose aggregated sentence, for all practical purposes, is also nine to eighteen years, can only earn the larger credits on that part of each sentence which exceeds five years. Clearly, the plaintiff is receiving less good time credit than an inmate serving a nine to eighteen year sentence imposed at one time only because his sentences were imposed at more than one time.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">\u201c[TJhis court will not ordinarily construe a statute whose meaning is plain and unambiguous. <em>Delevieleuse </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>184 Conn. 434, 438-39, 439 A.2d 1055 (1981); <em>Frazier </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>[176 Conn. 638, 642, 410 A.2d 475 (1979)] ; <em>Evening Sentinel </em>v. <em>National Organization for Women, </em>168 Conn. 26, 29, 357 A.2d 498 (1975). This rule of statutory construction does not apply however if, as in this case, a literal reading places a statute in constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>jeopardy. We are bound to assume that the legislature intended, in enacting a particular law, to achieve its purpose in a manner which is both effective and constitutional. <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>Connecticut Personnel Appeal Board, </em>170 Conn. 668, 674, 368 A.2d 20 (1976); <em>Whitfield </em>v. <em>Empire Mutual Ins. Co., </em>167 Conn. 499, 507-508, 356 A.2d 139 (1975); <em>Amsel </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>141 Conn. 288, 295, 106 A.2d 152, appeal dismissed, 348 U.S. 880, 75 S. Ct. 125, 99 L. Ed. 693 (1954).\u201d <em>Moscone </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>185 Conn. 124, 128, 440 A.2d 848 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The plaintiff is not attacking the constitutionality of \u00a7 18-7 on its face but, instead, is arguing that the trial court erred in finding that there was a rational basis for treating him differently under this statute because of the different times of imposition and the separate nature of his 1976 consecutive sentence. He argues that the word \u201cheld\u201d in the statute is not talismanic as the trial court found it to be in saying that because the defendant has not yet begun serving his consecutive sentence, he cannot be regarded as \u201cheld\u201d on this sentence under \u00a7 18-7. We must agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">We believe that the plaintiff is presently \u201cheld under more than one conviction. ...\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 18-7. Not only was he \u201cheld\u201d under the concurrent sentences imposed on August 21, 1975, but he was also \u201cheld\u201d under the consecutive sentence imposed on January 23, 1976. There is no question that his 1976 sentence was imposed \u201cconsecutive to any sentence he is presently serving.\u201d The mittimus issued by the New Haven Superior Court on January 23,1976, so states. \u201cThe mittimus is the warrant by virtue of which a convict is transported to and rightly held in prison. <em>Redway </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number><em>Walker, </em>132 Conn. 300, 303, 43 A.2d 748 [1945].\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Lenihan, </em>151 Conn. 552, 554\u201455, 200 A.2d 746 (1964). We have observed that a mittimus after conviction in a criminal case is similar to an execution after judgment in a civil case; it is final process and carries into effect the judgment of the court. <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Spiegel, Sheriff, </em>67 Conn. 349, 359, 35 A. 262 (1896).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 54-97 provided that \u201c [n] o person shall be committed to the Connecticut Correctional Institution, Somers . . . without a mittimus signed by the judge or clerk of the court which committed him, declaring the cause of commitment and requiring the warden ... <em>to receive and keep him </em>in the community correctional center . . . for the period fixed by the judgment of said court or until he is legally discharged; and such mittimus shall be sufficient authority to the officer to commit such person, and to the warden <em>... to receive and hold him </em>in custody . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Therefore, pursuant to this statute the plaintiff was \u201cheld,\u201d certainly for the purposes of \u00a7 18-7, by the warden of the Correctional Institution at Somers when the sheriff executed the mittimus issued by the New Haven Superior Court on January 23, 1976.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He was \u201cheld\u201d there upon execution of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>mittimus not only under the specific language of that process, but also because \u00a754-97 explicitly makes this mittimus, the validity or execution of which is not in question, \u201csufficient authority ... to the warden ... to receive and <em>hold </em>him in custody . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) This is true even though (1) the New Haven Superior Court sentence was consecutive to the previously imposed concurrent sentences and (2) it was not known exactly when the consecutive sentence would begin. In this case, we go no further than to hold that the plaintiff was \u201cheld\u201d under \u201cmore than one conviction\u201d under \u00a7 18-7, albeit imposed at more than one time, i.e., 1975 and 1976.* *****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Our construction of \u00a7 18-7, which fully addresses the claim of the plaintiff, makes it unnecessary for us to reach his equal protection claim. \u201c \u2018Constitutional issues are not considered unless absolutely necessary to the decision of a case.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Della-Camera, </em>166 Conn. 557, 560-61, 353 A.2d 750 [1974] ; 16 Am. Jur. 2d, Constitutional Law, \u00a7\u00a7 111, 113; see <em>Pi </em>v. <em>Delta, </em>175 Conn. 527, 534, 400 A.2d 709 [1978]; <em>Ashwander </em>v. <em>Tennessee Valley Authority, </em>297 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>288, 346-47, 56 S. Ct. 466, 80 L. Ed. 688 [1936] (Brandeis, J., concurring).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Onofrio, </em>179 Conn. 23, 37-38, 425 A.2d 560 (1979). Therefore, since we need not address the constitutional issue, we decline to do so. See <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Arafeh, </em>174 Conn. 464, 471, 391 A.2d 133 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the ease is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b553-4\"> At the time the petitioner\u2019s sentences were imposed, General Statutes (Rev. to 1975) \u00a7 18-7 read as follows: \u201cpowers and duties OP WARDEN. PUNISHMENT AND REWARD OP INMATES. The Warden shall manage the Connecticut Correctional Institution, Somers, subject to the direction of the commissioner of correction, and he shall keep all the prisoners employed in such labor as the commissioner orders, during the term of their imprisonment. He shall also keep a reeord of any punishment inflicted upon a prisoner, showing its cause, mode and degree, and a like reeord of the conduct of each prisoner. Any prisoner may, by good conduct and obedience to the rules of said institution, earn a commutation or diminution of his sentence, as follows: Sixty days for each year, and pro rata for a part of a year, of a sentence which is not for more than five years; and ninety days for the sixth and each subsequent year, and pro rata for a part of a year, and, in addition thereto, five days for eaeh month as a meritorious time service award which may be granted in the discretion of the warden and the commissioner for exemplary conduct and meritorious achievement; provided any serious act of misconduct or insubordination or persistent refusal to conform to institution regulations occurring at any time during his confinement in said prison shall subject the prisoner, at the discretion of the warden and the commissioner, to the loss of all or any portion of the time earned. Said commutation of sentence shall apply to any prisoner transferred from the Connecticut Correctional Institution, Somers, to the Connecticut Correctional Institution, Cheshire. When any prisoner is held under more than one conviction, the several terms of imprisonment imposed thereunder shall be construed as one continuous term for the purpose of estimating the amount of commutation which he may earn under the provisions of this section. The commissioner may employ prisoners outside the institution walls, within the state, under the charge of some officer of the institution. He shall provide for the prisoners suitable food and clothing and suitable implements and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>materials for their work, and shall provide for the relief of any siek or infirm prisoner, and the cost thereof shall be paid by the state from funds appropriated and available for such purpose. The warden shall superintend the labor and conduct of the prisoners, and, when requested, shall communicate to the commissioner any information in his knowledge respecting the prison.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">This statute was subsequently amended in 1976 by inserting the following language in the third sentence after \u201cAny prisoner\u201d: \u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment prior to the effective date of this act.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 18-7a, which was also enacted in 1976 and which is entitled \u201cGood conduct for prisoners sentenced on and after October 1, 1976,\u201d provides in part as follows: \u201c(a) Exeept as provided in subsection (b) any person sentenced to a term of imprisonment, on and after October 1, 1976, and while still serving such sentence whether such sentence is for a definite, indefinite or indeterminate term, and regardless of the institution wherein the prisoner is confined may, by good conduct and obedience to the rules which have been established for the service of his sentence, earn a commutation or diminution of his sentence in the amount of ten days for each month, and pro rata for a part of a month, of a sentence which is for not more than five years, and fifteen days for each month, and pro rata for a part of a month, for the sixth and eaeh subsequent year of a sentence of more than five years. In the case of an indeterminate sentence, such credit shall apply to both the minimum and maximum term. In the case of an indefinite sentence, such credit shall apply to the maximum term only. Any act of misconduct or refusal to obey the rules which have been established for the service of his sentence shall subject the prisoner to the loss of all or any portion of such credit by the commissioner or his designee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">For crimes committed after July 1, 1981, \u00a7 18-7a (b) now provides a new and more limited calculation of good time credit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b555-8\"> Tbe records supervisor at tie Connecticut Correetioual Institution at Somers did not calculate statutory good time on tie four to eigit years consecutive sentence on tie premise tiat is was not known wien tiis consecutive sentence would in fact commence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b555-9\"> Tie petitioner ias made no claim under tie equal protection clause of tie Connecticut constitution.

The term \u201cheld\u201d has been interpreted by the defendant and the trial eourt to embody this requirement. Both have stated that an inmate is not \u201cheld\u201d under a separately imposed consecutive sentence until that sentence commences at the termination of the sentence presently being served.
