Muller, Plaintiff and Respondent <em>v. </em>John T. B. Maxwell, Defendant and Appellant.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b363-6\">1. When the written terms of a sale of a lease of real estate for a period of fifteen years are, that \u201c the lessee will pay the auctioneer his fee of $10, for each year, being $150, in cash, this day,\u201d and the person purchasing, at the time of such purchase, signs a paper-writing, (at the foot of such written terms,) which states, that he has leased such real estate for the sum of $8150 per annum, and \u201c agrees to comply with the terms above set forththe auctioneer, (a lease of the premises having been made to, and accepted by such purchaser,) may maintain an action in his own name, against the purchaser, to recover such fees.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b363-7\">2. The purchaser, in such a case, by force of the terms of sale, and of his agreement to comply therewith, promises to pay the auctioneer\u2019s fees directly to the auctioneer. The grant of the lease to the purchaser, and his acceptance of it, are a sufficient consideration for the promise. The auctioneer is the actual party in interest, as promisee, and alone entitled to receive the fees, and may sue, in his own name, to recover them.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b363-8\">(Before Bosworth, Hoffman, Slosson, and Woodruff, J.

F. Mount, Jr., </em>for defendant, the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-14\">I. The written instrument, upon which this action is brought, is void, because\u20141. It is not subscribed by the parties by whom the lease was to have been executed; nor do their names appear therein. (2 R. S. 135, \u00a7 8, orig. edit.) 2. It expresses no consideration. 3. It is not mutual: the defendant could have no claim or right of action against the plaintiff. <em>(Champlin </em>v. <em>Parish, </em>11 Paige R. 405; <em>Mc Whorter </em>v. <em>McMahon, </em>10 Paige R. 386 ; <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>Hubbard, </em>4 Hill R. 351.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-15\">H. The contract is entire, and not divisible; and if void in part, it is void altogether. <em>(King </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>2 Hill R. <em>485; Thayer </em>v. <em>Bock, </em>13 Wend. R. 53.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>III. The agreement, if any, was made with the owners of the premises, and this action should have been in their name.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-5\">IV. If the instrument be divisible, and allowing one action thereon for the benefit of the lessors, and another by the plaintiff, for his fees, even then, the fulfilment, by the defendant, of one part, does not take the case out of the statute. '</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-6\">V. The instrument was not made valid by the subsequent fulfilment of any part of it. It had no reference to any future consideration, and if void at the time of its execution, it was void for all times: <em>a </em>fortiori, if the alleged undertaking with the plaintiff is to be considered as independent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-7\">VI. The payment of the plaintiff\u2019s fees is not one of the \u201cterms of the lease,\u201d expressed in the instrument.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-8\">VII. The services of the plaintiff were a past consideration when the defendant signed the instrument, and arose out of his engagement with his principal. The undertaking of the defendant, therefore, is to answer for the debt of another, and should express the consideration. (2 R. S. 135.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b366-9\"><em>Weelcs and De </em>Forest, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-10\">I. Upon the facts stated in the complaint, independently of the averment of an express promise, the defendant became liable to pay the plaintiff as soon as the lease was struck down to him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-11\">II. The complaint, in addition, sets forth an independent agreement, for sufficient consideration, made directly between the defendant and plaintiff, to pay the latter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-12\">III. The promise set forth is, to pay the plaintiff for his services as auctioneer, etc.; and, being for the benefit of the plaintiff, he is the proper party to sue upon it. <em>(Schemerhorn </em>v. <em>Vanderheyden, </em>1 Johns. Reports, 138; <em>Ellwood </em>v. <em>Monk, </em>5 Wend. 235 ; <em>Brewer </em>v. <em>Dyer, </em>7 Cushing, 338.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-13\">IV. Taking the entire complaint together, it appears that, before making the lease, it was well understood between the parties, that the person who received it was to pay the plaintiff his stipulated fees. The defendant, having accepted the lease upon this understanding, is bound to pay the $150, as part of the consideration-money.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b367-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>By the Court. Slossoh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ai2\">\u2014Whether the memorandum, annexed to, and forming part of the complaint, was a sufficient memorandum, within the statute of frauds, to bind the owner of the premises to make the lease, in pursuance of the sale at auction, it being signed neither by the owner nor by a duly authorized agent, is not a question which can be raised on this demurrer; since the owner has actually executed the lease to the defendant, upon the terms upon which the premises were bid off by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Had the memorandum been actually signed*by the owner, or by the plaintiff, as his lawfully authorized agent, it would, though not signed by the defendant, have bound the latter, and have created, in respect to the auctioneer\u2019s fees, a privity of contract between him and the plaintiff, which would have entitled the latter to sue for the fees, in his own name. <em>(Bleecker </em>v. Franklin, 2 E. D. Smith, R. 93.)</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">But the memorandum is actually signed by the defendant, and, by it, he expressly agrees to pay the auctioneer the fees for which he now sues. Whether this be treated as a stipulation with the owner, to pay the auctioneer, or with the auctioneer himself, in either case, the latter may sue for them in his own name.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">The argument, that the owner of the premises was not bound by the memorandum, and therefore, the defendant is not bound, is answered by the fact, before adverted to, that the owner has complied with the terms of it, and executed the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">The defendant cannot now object to its sufficiency, both parties having acted under it, and the defendant having received the benefit of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">Besides, the complaint alleges a distinct agreement, by the defendant, with the plaintiff, to pay the fees in question, for his services as auctioneer, and that the services were rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">This the demurrer admits. Sucha promise, would not be a promise to pay the debt of another, but an original undertaking of the defendant himself, and would be good, though not in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">In every aspect, the demurrer is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">The order must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-13\">Affirmed accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
