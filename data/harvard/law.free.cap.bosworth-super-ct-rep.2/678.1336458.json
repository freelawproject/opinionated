In such case, the general denial will be struck out, unless the defendant amends, by so modifying the general denial that it shall not deny allegations afterwards in the answer admitted.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b687-7\">(Before Woodruff, J.)</p>\n<otherdate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b687-8\">Special Term;</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A57\">April 28th, 1858.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b687-9\">Motion to strike out parts of the defendant\u2019s answer, or to make the answer more definite and certain.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b687-10\">The alleged defects in the answer sufficiently appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b687-11\"><em>A. Vanderpool, </em>for the plaintiff in support of the motion.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b687-12\"><em>J.

On the contrary, the Code permits a general denial, and we cannot therefore say that when such general denial is made we will direct it to be made specific.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-16\">The apparent uncertainty respecting the defendants\u2019 answer in this case results from the fact that having first denied all of the plaintiff\u2019s averments, the defendants proceed to admit some, and the plaintiff perceiving thereby that the first denial was insincere in some particulars, feels uncertain whether the defendants will insist upon their denial in other particulars when the trial shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>come on. The only mode which occurs to me, by which a plaintiff can avoid this embarrassment, is by verifying his complaint. The defendant will then be compelled to say upon his conscience whether the allegations are true.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">There is, however, no propriety in permitting two statements to stand in an answer which are, in terms, in direct conflict with each other. First, a denial of an averment, and second, an explicit admission of its truth. It tends to incumber the pleadings with inconsistencies, and no doubt may often render the real nature of the defence doubtful.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">The general denial, forming the first clause of the answer, must be struck out in this case, unless the defendants within ten days amend their answer so that that part of the answer shall not deny the allegations which in the subsequent portion of the answer are admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">Costs of the motion to the plaintiff $10\u2014to abide the event of the suit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
