That in the action in the Superior Court, he was, by the'laws of Massachusetts, prevented and precluded from setting up any defence to the ' action in which such judgment in the Common Pleas was rendered, and such judgment was .declared to be legal and valid, and of the same force and effect as if- the defendant had been personally served, or had appeared and defended the same, and he, the defendant, has never had an opportunity of being heard in or defending said action on the merits thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b588-7\">That the said Court of Common Pleas never had any jurisdib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>tion of this defendant, nor of the subject of the action, and the said Superior Court acquired no other or further jurisdiction, and both judgments are fraudulent and void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-5\">The action was brought to trial on the 16th of June, 1857, before Chief-Justice Duer and a jury, and the plaintiff gave in evidence a record of a judgment of which the following is a copy :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-6\">\u201c Judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-7\">\u201c <em>Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Suffolk, </em>ss:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-8\">\u201c To all persons to whom these presents shall come, Greeting : Know ye that among our records of our Superior Court of the County of Suffolk, it is thus contained:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-9\">\u201c <em>The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Suffolk, </em>ss: \u201cTo the</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-10\">Sheriffs of our several Counties, or their Deputies,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-11\">[Seal.] Greeting:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-12\">\u201cWe command you to attach the goods or estate of James H.

Bainbridge Smith, </em>for the defendant (appellant).</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-9\">I. The defendant, a citizen of this State, had judgment pronounced against him in a suit commenced in Massachusetts, while he was in this State, without notice, and without an opportunity of being heard, or making a defence. 1. An action, by the laws of Massachusetts, may be commenced in any of the Courts of that State, against a non-resident defendant, by leaving the summons at his last and usual place of abode. (Mass. R. S. 1836, p. 552, \u00a7\u00a7 44, 45; Mass. R. S. 1836, p. 566, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4.) 2. A judgment obtained by such service is valid; and, in an action upon such judgment, by the same laws, the want of personal service or notice, constitutes no defence, nor can the merits of the original action be inquired into. <em>(Hawes </em>v. Hathaway, 14 Mass. R. 233.) 3. On the other hand, a judgment recovered in another State against a citizen of Massachusetts, when sued there, if it appear he was not personally served with process within that State, is void, for want of jurisdiction. <em>(Hall </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>6 Pick. R. 232; <em>Ewer </em>v. <em>Coffin, </em>1 Cush. R. 23, 28.) 4. The Legislature of a State has no power to pass a law, by which the Courts of .that State can pronounce a judgment against a citizen of another State, without his having an opportunity of being heard. <em>(Oakley </em>v. <em>Aspinwall, </em>4 Comst. R. 513, 521, 522; <em>Ewer </em>v. <em>Coffin, </em>1 Cush. R. pp. 23, 28.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-12\">II. The judgments recovered in Massachusetts against the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>fendant were fraudulently obtained. The defendant, in his answer, sets up the facts specifically, and, on the trial, offered evidence in support of that defence, which was ruled out by the Court, and exceptions taken. <em>(Dobson </em>v. Pearce, 2 Kern. R. 156.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b595-5\">III. Any fact, which clearly proves it to be against conscience to execute a judgment, and of which the injured party could not avail himself at law, but was prevented by fraud or accident, unznixed with any fault or negligence in himself or his agents, will justify an interference by a court of equity. <em>(Dobson </em>v. Pearce, 2 Kern. 156, 165, and cases cited; 2 Story Eq. Jur. \u00a7\u00a7 887, 894, 896.) 1. The claim on which the judgments in Massachusetts were obtained was unfounded. 2. The defendant, without any fault or negligence on his part, has been deprived of the opportunity of showing the claim against him was unfounded. 3.. The answer sets up an equitable defence, and one which the defendant, in Massachusetts, could not avail himself of' at law. 4. The Court below rejected the evidence offered on the part of the defendant, on the ground that it would constitute no defence at law. 5. The distinction between actions at law and suits in equity, the jurisdiction of the respective courts, and their form of proceeding, are preserved in Massachusetts. (Mass. R. S. p. 500.) 6. The equitable relief prayed for by the defendant\u2014namely, to be allowed to prove the plaintiff\u2019s claim against him unfounded, and of which defence the defendant was at law deprived\u2014if granted, would not be inconsistent with the full faith and credit to which judgments of other States are entitled. <em>(Dobson </em>v. Pearce, 2 Kern. R. 156; <em>Pearce </em>v. Olney, 20 Conn. R. 544, 556.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b595-6\"><em>Cornelius A. PunJcle, </em>for the plaintiff (respondent).</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b595-7\">Among the respondent\u2019s points are the following:\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b595-8\">I. The defendant, having agreed that the plaintiff might take judgment against him, is now estopped from denying the validity of it. <em>a. </em>The stipulation of the attorney binds the party. (15 Wend. 380.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b595-9\">II. The judgment upon which this action is brought is conclusive in Massachusetts, upon the merits; therefore it is conclusive here. (Art. 4th, \u00a7 1, Con. IT. S.; Act of Congress I., H. S. Statutes at large, p. 122, ch. 37; <em>Miller </em>v. Duryea, 7 Cranch. 481; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number><em>Hampton </em>v. <em>McConnel, </em>8 Wheat. 234.) <em>a. </em>The general rule both in this country and in England is, that a question settled, or which might have been settled in a suit in a court of competent jurisdiction between actual parties, after trial will not be opened. (2 Parsons on Contracts, 118; <em>Henderson </em>v. Henderson, 2 Q. B 288; <em>Bruen </em>v. Hone, 2 Barb. 586 ; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Band, </em>13 Barb. 152, and cases cited; <em>Embry </em>v. Conner, 3 Com. 511; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>3 John. 157; <em>Emery </em>v. Greenough, 3 Dallas, 369, 372.) <em>b. </em>It will be presumed that all the defences the losing party had were made and were insufficient. (2 Parsons on Con. 118.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b596-5\">IH. This court cannot go behind the judgment sued on.

The true rule is that a judgment recovered in another State is conclusive in an action brought on it in this State as to all facts recited in the record, except those which go to show the jurisdiction of the court rendering the judgment; to wit, service of process on defendant personally, or his appearance in the action personally or by his attorney. <em>(Noyes </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>6 Barb. 613.) <em>a. </em>Where the record of the court of a sister State shows on its face that the court rendering the judgment had jurisdiction of the person of the defendant, and when such jurisdiction is not disproved, such record is, under the Constitution and laws of Congress, conclusive evidence of all and every other fact contained in it. It ranks as high as a domestic judgment and will be as conclusive as such a judgment upon the parties.
