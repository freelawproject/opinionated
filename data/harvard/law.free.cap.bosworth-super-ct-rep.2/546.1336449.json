B. was the owner of several contiguous lots, fronting on a public street, running to the corner formed thereby with an intersecting street, and, also, of the contiguous lots in the rear, fronting on the cross street; and for 40 years prior to his death, he had used an alley-way, running from such cross street, along the rear of the first-named lots, as a means of access and egress from and to the rear of such lots, upon the rear of one of which was a small house, let from time to time, to various tenants, who used the alley-way.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b554-10\">After the death of J. B. the premises continued to be so used for several years, and one of the lots was leased, by the heirs, for five years, and was described in the lease, as hounded northerly, in the rear, by an alley for the use of this lot in common with the lot adjoining This lease, by assignment, came to the plaintiff. Afterwards, during the term of the lease, partition was voluntarily made by such heirs, and in conveying the said lot to the one to whom it was allotted, it was described in the deed, as \u201c running to the southerly side of the alleyway, and thence southeasterly, along the said alley-way, 21 feet 10 inches,\u201d and it was conveyed, \u201ctogether with all and singular the appurtenances,\u201d etc. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>lot was thereafter, before the expiration of the lease, conveyed in the same termg by such grantee, to the plaintiff, the tenant in possession.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b555-5\">After the expiration of the lease, the defendant, a grantee of other of the heirs, closed the alley by an erection on the line of the cross street.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b555-6\">Held, in an action to compel the removal of the obstruction, and for damages,</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b555-7\">1. Ho easement was created, during the life of J. B., which would pass to the grantee of one of the lots by mere force of the word \u201c appurtenances\u201d in the deed from the heirs-at-law, so as to give such grantee a right to use the alleyway. Ho one can be said to have an easement in his own land, and no right of way could exist, as such, so long as the title to the alley and the contiguous lots, was vested in fee in the same person.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b555-8\">2. The conveyance made on the partition of the lots, describing one of them as running to the alley, and running along the alley, in connection with the actual use of such alley at that time, and for many years before, as a way of ingress and egress from and to such lot, are sufficient to show an intent to create the easement, and to confer the right of way on the grantee, who thereby acquires an easement in the alley, which, in turn, passes to his grantee.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b555-9\">8. Where a lot is conveyed which has a front bounding on a public street, the grantee does not take \u201c a right of way by necessity,\u201d through an alley lying at the rear of the lot, although there be on such rear a dwelling house, and the grantor has, for forty years, used the alley as a way of ingress and egress for his tenants in such house.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b555-10\">(Before Duer, Ch J., and Woodruff, J.)</p>\n<otherdate data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b555-11\">Heard, Oct. 23d, <em>1857;</em></otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AAP\">decided, March 6th, 1858.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A4N\">This action is brought to compel the defendant to remove from an alley-way running along the rear of the plaintiff\u2019s lot, No. 108 Division street, a- shed and other obstructions, erected by the defendant, at its outlet to Eldridge street, and to pay to the plaintiff damages for obstructing his use of such alley, as a passage for ingress and egress from and to the plaintiff\u2019s lot.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-13\">The defendant denied that the plaintiff had any right to use the alley, and set up title in himself in the alley in fee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-14\">The action was once tried in this court, and judgment was rendered for the plaintiff, but on appeal to the Court of Appeals, the facts proved were not deemed sufficient to establish a title to the alley or to the use thereof in the plaintiff, and a new trial was ordered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"APK\">The case then came on for trial before Mr. Justice Bosworth without a jury. The facts proved appear by a condensed statement of his finding upon the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b555-16\">The location of the plaintiff\u2019s lot

The Judge erred in finding, as a conclusion of law, that the deed of the 9th of January, 1847, to Lydia Foulke, from the other heirs and the widow of John Beekman, deceased, of lot No. 108 Division street, conveyed as an incident and appurtenance to the lot itself a right to the use of the alley-way, as it had been and was then used. 1. No such right existed as a way 'of necessity. (Opinion of Selden and Johnson, Court of Appeals.) Neither did it exist by prescription founded on an adverse use of more than twenty years. 2. To warrant a presumption of the grant of an easement, the use of twenty years must have been continuous and adverse. <em>(Colvin </em>v. Burnett, 17 Wend. 564; <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Vose, </em>19 Wend. 365.) 3. Neither did it exist by grant. (Opinion Judge Johnson, Court of Appeals.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-8\">II. The right could not have existed while the title to the lot and the alley-way was vested in the same person. (Coke Litt. 114, B.; <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>3 Taunt. R. 99 ; 2 Black, Comm. Ch. 11; <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>17 Mass. 443 ; Opinions of Justices Selden- &amp; Johnson, Court of Appeals; <em>Jackson ex dem Yates </em>v. <em>Hathaway, </em>15 Johns.

(Opinion of Judge Selden.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-10\">TV\". No existence of an easement in this case has been established. The deed to Mrs. Foujke describes the lot bounding it upon one -side \u201c along an alley-way,\u201d while in the conveyances of lot No. 110 Division street and No. 8 Eldridge street, the tenants of all of which, together with those of No. 108, had had the use of the alley-way during the lifetime of John Beekman, the alleyway is not referred to.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b562-11\">\"V. General words,, such as <em>\u201c </em>appertaining,\u201d \u201c belonging,\u201d etc., are not sufficient to pass the right of way upon a severance of the tenements. <em>(Whalley </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>1 Bos. &amp; P. 371; <em>Kooystra </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>5 B. <em>&amp; </em>Ald. 830 ; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Hathaway, </em>15 Johns. 447; <em>Staple </em>v. <em>Hayden, </em>6 Mod. 1; <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>17 Mass. 442.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b562-12\"><em>H M.

If the heirs of John.

The deed from the other heirs and the widow of JohnBeek man to Mrs. Fonlke, had the same effect; and the conveyance from her and her husband to the plaintiff, gives him the same right, and entitles him to the unobstructed use of the alley.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b563-6\">III. The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b554-11\"> Affirmed in the Court of Appeals, October, 1858. 18 N. T. R. 48.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b563-7\">By the Court. Woodruff, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aaj\">It is possible that the views expressed in the opinion given by Mr. Justice Selden, when this ease was before the Court of Appeals, and which are especially applicable to the case as now before us, might have been withheld, and yet the same judgment of reversal have been pronounced. In this sense a portion of his opinion may be deemed <em>obiter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">But that opinion was written with a view to the new trial which was ordered, and was evidently intended as a guide to this court in the further conduct of the cause. And bearing this in mind, we ought, perhaps, to presume that the observations he made had the sanction of the other members of the court, although not specifically adverted to by Mr.. Justice Johnson in his opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">If, therefore, we did not concur in those observations, we should hesitate very much before coming to a conclusion, based upon opinions opposed to that which may properly be regarded as our guide to a new trial, and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">But upon the whole case we concur with Mr. Justice Selden in the result at which that portion of the opinion to which we refer would have led him, had the case, as now developed, been before that .court.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">We observe, however, preliminarily, that the Court of Appeals must be deemed to have decided, that the plaintiff herein has no right of way, by necessity, over or through the alley, the obstruction of which he complains of. So far as that question is involved, the case has not been altered in any material particular. Nor has he a right of way founded in prescription, nor on an adverse user. Nor could the right of way exist as an easement while the title to the alley, and the title to the several contiguous <em>lots, </em>was vested in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>the same person. No one can be said to have an easement in his own land. And where an easement has existed, it ceases when the title to the easement and the title to the land are united in the same person.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">If, therefore, the easement exists, and is vested in the plaintiff, as the owner of one of the lots adjacent to the alley, it must have been created in some manner, subsequent to the death of John Beekman, who died seized of the whole of the premises in fee. But in determining whether or not the acts of John Beekman and his heirs were such that the conveyances by the heirs would operate, as between themselves and in favor of subsequent grantees, to create the easement and pass a right of way as an appurtenant to the several lots bounded thereon, the fact is of great importance, that the alley had been used as a way of ingress and egress to and from the several lots, for more than forty years prior to the death of John Beekman, in 1844, and continued to be so used until, and after the division of the property among his heirs, and thereafter, until the defendant, in 1848, made the obstruction which is the cause of the present action. And upon the rear of the lot now of the present plaintiff there was, during all this period, a dwelling house, the property of the tenant, the only access to and egress from which was through said alley-way from and into the public street, (Eldridge street) and the alley was used for such access and egress by the tenants and occupants of such house.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The opinion of Mr. Justice Selden, in the Court of Appeals, is explicit in regard to the effect and operation of such facts as these, followed by conveyances apt in form to transfer the right to a continuance of such a use.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">He <em>says:\u2014\u201c </em>The owner of several tenements may, of course, make such a disposition of their respective properties as he pleases. He may take, from either, any one of its qualities, or any use of which it is susceptible, and annex it to another; so that such quality or use shall become part and parcel of the latter, thus rendering the one tenement, <em>pro </em>tanto, subservient to the other; and there is no doubt, that where an owner has chosen thus to make an artificial distribution of the natural properties of\" two tenements, making use of the one as subservient to the other \u2014if, while this use and his ownership of both \u2022 tenements continues, he sell and convey the dominant tenement, with its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>appurtenances, there being, at the time, open and visible marks of such use, an easement, corresponding to the use, will be created, and will pass by the deed as an appurtenance. In this case, there was abundant proof of the use of the alley, in connection with the plaintiff\u2019s lot, for many years, with the consent of the owner of both tenements, and an apparent continuance of this use, up to the time of the conveyance by Foulke and wife to the plaintiff, accompanied by the necessary outward and visible marks of such use. But it does not appear that Foulke and wife were the owners of the alley when they executed the deed. The ownership by them of both tenements, was, of course, essential to the</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">creation of the easement as an appurtenance, at that time.....</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">It may, however, have been created upon some previous severance of the ownership of the two tenements, as upon the partition of the premises between the heirs of John Beekman, in which ease it would have passed, by the deed of Foulke and wife, as appurtenant to the lot.......As against Foulke and wife, the</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">plaintiff has shown, I think, a clear right to the use of the alley; but, as against the other heirs of Beekman, or their grantees, he has shown none at all. If either the title to the alley itself, or a right to its use, in connection with lot 108, was conveyed to Foulke and wife by the partition deed, then such right passed as an appurtenance by the deed to the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">The application of these views to the case, as exhibited on the second trial, is quite obvious. The, title to the alley and the several contiguous lots, was in the heirs of John Beekman; their deed to Mrs. Foulke is now produced, and is in the very words of the deed afterwards executed by Foulke and wife to the plaintiff. The latter deed, in connection with the previous user, and the continued outward and visible marks of such use, is, in the opinion quoted, deemed sufficient to have vested in the plaintiff the right of way, had Foulke and wife then owned both the alley and the premises described.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">By the same rule, the conveyance by the heirs, who did own both, must, in connection with the same extrinsic facts, be deemed to vest in Mrs. Foulke the right to the use of the alley, as an appurtenant to the premises granted; and the same, therefore, passed to the plaintiff, by the conveyance of the latter to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-10\">We are not inclined to rest this view of the effect of the deed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>to Eoulke and wife, upon the mere force of the word \u201c appurtenances,\u201d in that deed. The right of way did not exist, as an easement, so long as the title to the lot (108) and the alley were both vested in the heirs of Beekman; and if the alley was not mentioned or referred to in the deed, in any manner other than by the word \u201cappurtenances,\u201d we should deem it at least doubtful whether the Court of Appeals intended to hold, that the previous .use of the alley had so detached it from the other lots, or attached it to the plaintiff\u2019s lot, that it would pass by the mere force of that term. (1 Bos. &amp; Pul. 371; 5 Barn. &amp; Aid. 830; 1 Taunt. 206.)</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">But the conveyance to Eoulke and wife, describes the premises as'running \u201calong the said alley-way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">In <em>Herring </em>v. Fisher, (1 Sand. S. C. R. 344,) such terms were held to be sufficient to convey the fee to the centre of the road; and it was also held, that even if the point whence the boundary run along the road, was described as \u201c at the side of the road,\u201d (as, in the case before us, the precise line is described as running to the easterly side of the alley,) the same construction would prevail. And see <em>Badeau </em>v. <em>Mead, &amp; </em>Holmes, (14 Barb. 328;) and also, <em>Sizer, et ux, </em>v. <em>Devereux, </em>(16 Barb. 160,) and cases cited in these cases, respectively. <em>(Smiles </em>v. <em>Hastings, </em>24 Barb. 44.)</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">It is sufficient for the purposes of this case, that, by the deed from the heirs of Beekman, Eoulke and wife obtained the right to use the alley, as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
