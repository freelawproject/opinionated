Certain exceptions were taken by the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>fendant to his rulings, in rejecting testimony, which were not pressed on the argument, and which the Court, at General Term, thought were clearly untenable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-5\">The facts are these: The plaintiff intermarried with one Abraham Brower, in the month of August, 1848. On the 24th of March, 1849, her husband went to California, where he resided until 1851, when he returned to New York, and has lived with his wife, the plaintiff, ever since.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-6\">The plaintiff had, for many years prior to her marriage, kept a boarding-house, in Green street, and elsewhere. In May, 1849, she moved to Mulberry street, and took a lease of the premises, in her own name, for two years. Her husband was then absent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-7\">In August, 1849, one Thompson sold a piano to the plaintiff, for the sum of <em>$240. </em>The purchase-money was adjusted, by crediting him with a board-bill he had incurred with the plaintiff, of about $60, and an agreement, that he should board out the balance, which he did. The $60 had, no doubt, accrued for board after the marriage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-8\">The piano was used in Mulberry street, for the period that the plaintiff remained there, and was carried with her where she removed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-9\">About the 18th day of October, 1853, the Sheriff of the County of New York, the present defendant, received an execution upon a judgment obtained, in favor of L. &amp; J. R. Ingersoll, against Abraham Brower, the plaintiff\u2019s husband; and, under such execution, he levied upon the piano. The judgment was upon a debt contracted before the marriage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-10\">The testimony of John R. Ingersoll was taken, as to certain admissions of Mrs. Brower, the plaintiff, of having received money from her husband, in California, to pay for a piano, which is particularly stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b374-11\"><em>J. M. Van Cott, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b374-12\"><em>A. J. Vanderpoel, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b374-13\">By the Court. Hoffman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ao2\">A similar question to that which arises in the present case, has been before the Court, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>late cases of <em>Freeman </em>v. Orser, (5 Duer, 476,) and <em>Burger </em>v. White, (November Term, 1857, Ante p. 92.) Under what circumstances, property, resulting from the earnings and labor of a wife, can be exempt from seizure by the husband\u2019s creditors, is the point there and here raised. Whether the present case would be governed by the one or the other of those decisions\u2014whether it would fall within the general principle of the former, or the exception established in the latter, would require a careful analysis, of both, and comparison of the facts. We are not called upon to determine this question, for there is one point which compels us to send the case back for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The verdict was taken by consent, subject to the opinion of the Court, with liberty to dismiss the complaint. This course is permitted by the Code, when, upon a trial, the case presents only questions of law. In that case, judgment may be given at the General Term. (\u00a7 265.)</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">All this presupposes settled, or undisputed facts. It is contrary to the theory of a trial by jury, and unwarranted by the Code, to take a verdict, subject to the opinion of the Court, when facts are to be deduced from disputable or uncertain evidence.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">We do not understand, that the amendment made in 1857, to the 333d section of the Code, varies this rule. It directs a concise statement of the facts, upon which the questions or conclusions of law arose, to be prepared by the Court, (of course, at General Term,) and be filed with the judgment roll. But those facts must, we presume, have come before the General Term, ascertained and settled, or admitted in the usual manner, or be established by evidence to which there is no contradiction, and the force and effect of which is not doubtful. This statement is made \u201cfor the purposes of a review in the Court of Appeals,\u201d and for such purposes only. (Laws of 1857, chap. 723, \u00a7 11, as amended, sub. 2, and \u00a7 333, as amended.) It is not a statement of facts found by the Court upon doubtful or conflicting evidence, but a summary of the facts, in relation to which there is no doubt or dispute, out of which facts the questions of law arise, which the Court is called on to determine, and which alone they decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">Now, Ingersoll swore positively to admissions of the plaintiff, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>that she had received money ($250) from her husband in California, and that the piano seized, belonged to her husband. He also stated, that she said she had paid for the piano with money received from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Eow this would not be true, in fact, as the purchase was made in August, 1849, and the husband did not get to California until September. The witness fixes the conversation with the plaintiff to have be\u00e9n in 1850.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Yet it by no means follows, that she may not have said all that is deposed to, and still less, that the main fact, of a remittance to purchase a piano, may not have been admitted, and loosely spoken of, as having been applied to pay for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">This matter should have been submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">New trial ordered, costs to abide the event.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b375-9\"> <em>Cobb </em>v. <em>Cornish, </em>(16 KT.
