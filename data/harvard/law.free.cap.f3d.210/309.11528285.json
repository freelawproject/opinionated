Alvarez\u2019s notice of appeal was filed 11 days after the district court entered judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">Two of this court\u2019s sister circuits have held that a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion is not a civil postconviction action but a \u201cstep in a criminal case,\u201d the denial of which must be appealed within 10 days from the entry of judgment. <em>United States v. Ono, </em>72 F.3d 101, 102-03 (9th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Petty, </em>82 F.3d 809, 810 (8th Cir.1996); Fed. R.App. P. 4(b). As the Ninth Circuit stated, \u00a7 3582 is a criminal provision because, <em>inter alia, </em>it \u201cgoverns the imposition and subsequent modification of a sentence of imprisonment,\u201d and it refers to the statutes and rules governing the imposition of sentences. <em>See Ono, </em>72 F.3d at 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-13\">We agree with the reasoning of these decisions and adopt it as our own. The 10-day limit for filing a notice of appeal in a criminal case is \u201c \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Coscarelli, </em>149 F.3d 342, 343 (5th Cir.1998) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-15\">Rule 4(b)(4), Fed. R.App. P\u201e allows the district court to grant an additional 30 days in which to file a notice of appeal upon a showing of \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d or \u201cgood cause.\u201d The filing of an untimely notice of appeal within the 30-day period is customarily treated by this court in a criminal case as a motion for a determination whether excusable neglect or good cause entitles the defendant to an extension of time to appeal. <em>United States v. Golding, </em>739 F.2d 183, 184 (5th Cir.1984). Such a remand would be futile in this case because Alvarez\u2019s appeal is frivolous. He argues that he is entitled to a sentence reduction because Amendment 484 of the Sentencing Guidelines requires the district court to recalculate the amount of methamphetamine attributable to him so as to exclude \u201cwaste materials\u201d and \u201cintermediary solutions.\u201d Section 3582(c)(2) permits a district court to reduce a prison term when it is based on a sentencing range that has \u201csubsequently been lowered\u201d by an amendment to the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, </em>105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997). Amendment 484 became effective on November 1, 1993, more than four years before Alvarez was sentenced. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G., App. C, Amendm. 484. Alvarez\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion thus is not based on a sentencing range that has \u201csubsequently\u201d been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-16\">APPEAL DISMISSED FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
