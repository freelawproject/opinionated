The failure to print more than a small part of the testimony, none of a number of exhibits and but an extract from the trial court\u2019s \u25a0opinion makes it impossible for this Court to decide the correctness of the trial court\u2019s determinations on liability and damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Rule 828 b 1 requires the printed extract to . \u201ccontain such parts of the record as may reasonably be necessary for the determination of the questions presented by the appeal,\u201d including \u201c [s] o much of the evidence * * * as is material to any question the determination of which depends upon the sufficiency of the evidence * * The Court will not pass upon matter not printed in the extract since it is not readily available to each member of the Court. <em>McBurnie v. McBurnie, </em>214 Md. 210; <em>Lustine v. State Roads Commission, </em>217 Md. 274; <em>Silverman v. Ruddle, </em>234 Md. 353; <em>Prime Contractors v. M. &amp; C. C., </em>241 Md. 55. Rule 828 i provides that for violation of section b of Rule 828 this Court \u201cmay dismiss the appeal.\u201d We have concluded that this sanction should be invoked in this case. <em>Gmurek v.
