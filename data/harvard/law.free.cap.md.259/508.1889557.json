Pursuant to the request of the appellant, the trial court extended the time for transmitting the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>to May 1,1970. The record was actually transmitted April 28, 1970. Maryland Rule 825 b provides \u201cthe lower court shall not extend the time [for transmitting the record] to a day more than ninety days from the date after the first order for appeal is filed.\u201d The record was transmitted more than 90 days after the date the appeal was filed. It does not appear that the delay was occasioned by \u201cthe neglect, omission or inability of the clerk of the lower court, the court stenographer or appellee\u201d as specified in Maryland Rule 825 d. Accordingly, the appeal must be dismissed. <em>Goldman v.
