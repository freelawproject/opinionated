In doing so we shall indulge in still another comment in respect of infractions of Maryland Rule 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-14\">The Colstons live at 7400 Western Avenue in Chevy Chase. A little after 11 o\u2019clock on the night of 20 March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>1966 they heard <em>\u201ca </em>big thump in the front\u201d of the house, \u00bflumping out of bed they discovered instanter that the front end of a 1964 Oldsmobile Cutlass had breached their front door. The police were summoned and it was soon discovered that the intruder belonged to the appellant. David Isen, their next-door neighbor. In due course Phoenix paid the Colstons for the cost of the repairs and thereupon, by virtue of its policy of insurance, became subrogated to their rights. In July 1968 Phoenix sued David Isen. After routine discovery procedures it amended its declaration to make the appellant Mildred Isen a party defendant. In the amended declaration it alleged that. Mildred \u201cnegligently, carelessly and imprudently\u201d parked the car in such a manner that it \u201cdid freely and in an uncontrolled manner roll down an incline\u201d and strike theColston house. It alleged also that David \u201cnegligently, carelessly and imprudently\u201d permitted this to happen-The case came on for trial before Shook, C. J., without a. jury, on 24 February 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Phoenix called Walker Colston as its first witness. Ha-described the \u201cbig thump\u201d around 11:00 p.m. and the presence of the Isen car in his front door. He said he observed \u201cautomobile tracks\u201d coming \u201cdown the hill, apparently from our next-door neighbor.\u201d Mildred Isen, he. added, came over later, expressed regret and said not to-worry \u2014 they were insured. Counsel for Phoenix then called Mildred Isen \u201cas an adverse witness under Rule 35.\u201d We shall assume he had in mind Code (1965 RepL Vol.), Art. 35, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">She testified the Cutlass was in her husband\u2019s name and that she had his consent to use it. He was out of town at the time. It has an automatic transmission. She said when she parked the car \u201cin the circular driveway in front\u201d of the house \u201cabout 6:30 in the evening\u201d she \u201cautomatically put it in gear.\u201d What follows is an excerpt from, her testimony: . \u25a0</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-dA\">\u2022 \u201cQ.' Is it not -a fact on the- date of M\u00e1rch 20, ;13L966, you did not put the car in gear?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>\u201cA.

At that time did you turn your wheels toward the front of the house and away from the street?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-19\">\u201cA. 1 turned them toward the driveway, toward an exit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-20\">\u201cQ.

Isn\u2019t it a fact, Mrs. Isen, that at the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>you parked your car, March 20, 1966, you don\u2019t know whether you put the emergency brake oh your car or not? \u2019 . '</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-4\">\u201cA. I automatically do, sir. \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-5\">\u201cQ.

They wanted her to remove the car from the Colston property. She refused but she gave one of the officers her keys and he \u201chad no difficulty driving\u201d the car back to her driveway.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Except for several witnesses whose testimony dealt exclusively with the question of -damages Phoenix thereupon rested its case. What follows is an excerpt from the transcript of the record.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Mr. Montedonico [counsel for the Isens], do you want to come up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-10\">\u201c (Bench conference not reported.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-11\">\u201cTHE COURT : Motion for the defense is denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-12\">\u2756 * \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: I understand the Plaintiffs rest, * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-14\">\u201cMR.

MONTEDONICO: I rest my case arid \u25a0move for a directed verdict, as I did for the Plaintiff\u2019s case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-19\">\u201cTHE COURT: You gentlemen want to say .anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-20\">\u201cMR.

State Roads Commission, </em>240 Md. 525, 539 (1965), we pointed out that in actions tried by the court without a. jury a \u201cmotion for a directed verdict\u201d is not a proper-motion. We explained carefully and at length that Rule 535 \u201cwas designed especially for non-jury situations.\u201d' We noted in <em>Duck v. Quality Custom Homes, Inc., </em>242 Md. 609, 611 (1966), an appeal from the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, that Rule 535 had not been complied with. In <em>Southwestern Mines, Inc. v. P. &amp; J. Coat Company, Inc., </em>244 Md. 180, 184 (1966), we said \u201cthis-[a motion for a directed verdict] is not a proper motion.\u201d In <em>Lewis v. Germantown Insurance Company, </em>251 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Md. 535, 536-37 (1968), another appeal from the Circuit \u2022Court for Montgomery County, we chided the bar for its \u25a0disregard of the Maryland Rules, especially Rule 535. We \u25a0cited-nine cases in each of which some mention had been made of the bar\u2019s dereliction in this regard. In <em>Antietam-Sharpsburg Museum, Inc. v. William H. Marsh, Inc., </em>252 Md. 265, 267 (1969), we said, \u201cOnce again we remind both <em>bench </em>and bar that the motion for a directed verdict, in these circumstances, is improper. Maryland Rule \u2022535.\u201d (Emphasis added.) - Perhaps we should expect that there will always be some members of the bar who will \"be unaware of the Rules and our decisions concerning them but one would suppose that, by now, trial judges, being fully informed, would either reject or refuse to act upon such improper motions. That we have chosen once more to twit both bench and bar-in this regard should :not provoke speculation that we have done so for any reason other than to focus attention upon the Rules and to remind all hands that they are not guides to the practice \u25a0of law.but precise rubrics \u201cestablished to promote the \u2022orderly and efficient administration of justice and [that they] are to be read and followed.\u201d <em>Brown v. Fraley, </em>222 Md. 480, 483 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Because of its relevance to the instant case we shall .repeat what we said in <em>Lewis, supra: </em>. \u25a0 . .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIl\">\u201c* * * [Appellee] did not move to dismiss -Lewis\u2019 appeal and we have chosen not to do so nostra sponte. It must not be supposed, however, that the same degree of forbearance will be displayed, in the future, in respect of a similar disregard of the Maryland Rules.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 543.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">, Neither was there any such motion here but we have \u2022elected not to dismiss the appeal because we think Judge Shook should have refused to receive the Isens\u2019 motion for'-a directed verdict and. that, having done so, she should have required them to move to dismiss under Rule 535. And, since we are fully persuaded that \u201con. the facts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>the law * * * [Phoenix] has shown no right to relief\u201d we think a motion to dismiss should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">We have made it clear, we believe, that in cases where a motion to dismiss under Rule 535 has properly been filed, the trial judge should approach the testing of the legal sufficiency of the evidence produced by the plaintiff just as he would approach an appraisal of the evidence in a jury case upon the filing of a motion for a directed verdict. <em>Smith v. State Roads Commission, supra, </em>and <em>Allen v. Steinberg, </em>244 Md. 119, 122-23 (1966). He is required, therefore, in non-jury cases, to consider the evidence and all logical and reasonable inferences deducible therefrom in a light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Trusty v. Wooden, </em>251 Md. 294, 297 (1968); <em>Finneran v. Wood, </em>249 Md. 643 (1968); <em>Raff v. Acme Markets, Inc., </em>247 Md. 591 (1967). The trial judge should be mindful, however, that the words \u201clegally sufficient\u201d have significance. As Chief Judge Prescott said, for the Court, in <em>Fowler v. Smith, </em>240 Md. 240, 247 (1965):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-5\">\u201c* * * They mean that a party who has the burden of proving another party guilty of negligence, cannot sustain this burden by offering a mere scintilla of evidence, amounting to no more than surmise, possibility, or conjecture that such other party has been guilty of negligence, but such evidence must be of legal probative force and evidential value.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">In <em>Trusty v. Wooden, supra, </em>a jury case, the plaintiffs called the defendant Wooden \u201cas a hostile witness.\u201d When the plaintiffs rested their case Mrs. Wooden moved the court to direct a verdict in her favor. Her motion was .granted. What we said there is of interest here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOh\">\u201cIt is at once apparent that without Mrs. Wooden\u2019s testimony there is absolutely no evidence to show how the accident happened. Neither Cousins nor Trusty saw the car before it struck them. There is no evidence that either of them heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>it. The only other eyewitness, Olivia Neuman, was not called nor was the police officer who investigated the accident. Had appellants rested at this point the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>might well have come into play, in which case the defendant would have been obliged to go forward with the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 297.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">Since Phoenix has foregone reliance on <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>we must look to the evidence to see just what has been proved. Mrs. Isen said she \u201cdid put the car in gear.\u201d She \u201cturned the key off and put * * * [her] foot on the brake and went into the house.\u201d She did not remember whether or not she locked the car. She said she \u201cautomatically put the car in gear.\u201d She \u201cassumed\u201d she put on the emergency brake because it was \u201cjust automatic\u201d with her. She turned her front wheels \u201ctoward the driveway\u201d toward the exit \u201cgoing to the street.\u201d Her testimony also disclosed that four and one-half hours later she gave her ignition key to a police officer who drove the car back toller driveway; the car has an automatic transmission; the Isen property is higher than the Colston property. It was conceded at argument that the parking brake on the Isen car is applied by foot pressure and released by a lever operated by hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Phoenix admits that it is bound by Mrs. Isen\u2019s testimony unless it is contradicted or discredited. <em>Williams v. Wheeler, </em>252 Md. 75 (1969); <em>Trusty v. Wooden, supra. </em>But, it argues, Mrs. Isen\u2019s \u201ctestimony was self-rebutted.\u201d' We seem unable to grasp this argument. It is surely common knowledge that contemporary automobiles, with but few highly sophisticated exceptions, have either manual transmissions or fully automatic transmissions and that they have parking brakes which are set either by a lever operated by hand or a pedal operated by one\u2019s foot. Familiar to all is the fact that leaving a car, with a manual transmission, \u201cin gear,\u201d i.e., in either first or reverse gear, has a distinct braking effect. Equally familiar is the fact that, in cars with automatic transmissions, the mov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>ing of the selector to \u201cPark\u201d locks up the transmission so that the effect is much the same as leaving a car with a manual transmission in either low or reverse gear. Few indeed are the women who understand why these things are so and equally few are the ones who use the correct terms to describe the machinery and how it is operated. We entertain no doubt whatever that when Mrs. Isen said she \u201cput it in gear\u201d she meant that she moved the selector to the park position. Indeed she could not have meant anything else because as she came to a stop her selector must then have been \u201cin gear,\u201d i.e., in the drive position; had it not been she could not have gotten up the incline to her front door. Nor have we any doubt that when she said she \u201cput her foot on the brake\u201d she meant that she set the parking brake with her foot. To borrow a phrase from Chief Judge Fuld, of the Court of Appeals of New York, \u201cit would defy reason to hold\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that Mrs. Isen did not do the very same things any reasonably careful and prudent driver would have done in the circumstances, i.e., \u201cturn the key off,\u201d set the parking (\u201cemergency\u201d) brake and move the gear selector (\u201cput it in gear\u201d) to P (park). Had she not performed at least one of the second and third operations the car would have rolled off as soon as she stepped out. That nothing happened for more than four hours certainly confirms our understanding of what she meant. We have found nothing in the record suggesting that her testimony has been rebutted, contradicted or in any way discredited.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Phoenix, however, reminding us of our obligation to view the evidence, and especially the inferences deducible therefrom, in a light most favorable to it, seems to be saying that the evidence will support a finding that Mrs. Isen did <em>not </em>\u201cplace the car in gear\u201d and that she did <em>not </em>step \u201con the emergency brake.\u201d It seems also to be saying that the evidence will support a finding that she did not turn her front wheels toward the street because, it argues, had she done so her car would not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>barged into the Colstons\u2019 front door. We are indeed mindful of our duty to look upon the evidence in a light most favorable to Phoenix but this does not mean that we are obliged to torture the evidence or to attempt the deduction therefrom of illogical and unreasonable inferences. Phoenix complains because the Isens failed \u201cto show that the \u2018emergency\u2019 brake, if applied, would have held indefinitely\u201d and that \u201cthere was no testimony from the defendants [the Isens] as to any intervening causation.\u201d This seems incredibly ingenuous. Mrs. Isen was produced as a hostile witness. She was obliged to answer questions, nothing more. Phoenix, having spurned <em>res ipsa, loquitur, </em>had both the burden of proof and the burden of going forward with the evidence. It alone was saddled with the necessity of putting together a prima facie case. We think not only has it failed to do this but that, unwittingly perhaps, it has provided evidence from which an inference of intervening cause might arise. Mrs. Isen, asked if she turned her wheels toward the front of the house, said she turned them toward an exit going to the street. This was \u2022 not contradicted, nor discredited, nor rebutted and, absent any explanation as to why the car rolled down to the Colstons\u2019 front door rather than to the street, it would seem to be a permissible inference, in the, circumstances, that some third person, whether prankishly or maliciously, directed it that way. We wonder, as we did in <em>Trusty v. Wooden, supra, </em>why the police officer and the mechanic who repaired the Isen car were not produced as witnesses. They might have shed some light on its condition. That they were not called suggests the absence of any defect chargeable to the Isens.' Chief Judge Sobeloff in <em>Hickory Transfer Co. v. Nezbed, </em>202 Md. 253, 263 (1953), summed it up when he said, for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AfR\">... \u201cIn this case the plaintiffs themselves proved the details of the happening, foregoing reliance on <em>res ipsa loquitur; </em>and, having undertaken to prove the details, they failed to show negligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>on the part of the defendants. Indeed, they explained away the possible inference of negligence. Paradoxically, the plaintiffs proved too much and too little.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">\n<em>Judgment entered in favor of appellants against the appellee for the costs in this\u25a0 Court and below.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b593-6\">. <em>Derby v.
