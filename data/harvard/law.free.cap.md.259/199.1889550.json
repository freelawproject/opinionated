Polinger filed a counterclaim. The matter was removed to Dorchester County for trial where a finding was made in favor of A. &amp; A.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">A. &amp; A. appeals to us contending, (1) that it should have received judgment for even more, having particular reference to a claim for $9,328.42; (2) that the trial court failed to include interest in the judgment in favor of A. &amp; A.; and (3) that the trial court failed to direct the clerk to enter the judgment to carry interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">For procedural reasons we shall be obliged to dismiss the appeal. To avoid a further appeal to this Court we shall indicate our views relative to liability and procedure pursuant to Maryland Rule 885.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">On the matter of the additional claim of A. &amp; A. we adopt the pertinent portion of the opinion of Judge Mace in the trial court in which he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-12\"><em>\u201cI </em>find that by proposal dated March 24, 1965, plaintiff undertook to do certain masonry work on an Apartment-Hotel known as Highland House, located in Chevy Chase, Maryland, which was being constructed by the defendants. The proposal in the amount of $205,000 was accepted by defendants on April 7, 1965, although, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>were further discussions. At that time, the defendants inserted two paragraphs on the bottom of page two of the proposal relating to the setting of Cast Stone and the incorporation of certain conditions which appear on a printed sheet attached to the agreement. On May 13, 1965, at a meeting between the parties or their representatives, an additional two paragraphs were inserted at the bottom of page two of the proposal, and initialed by the parties. The paragraphs read as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\"><em>\u2018This Contract </em>for Seaboard Glazed tile is for furnishing the 1%\" thick 18\" x 24\" Ceramic Veneer Design Facing as shown on architects drawings No. 9, 15,16, 26, 27 dated 9/14/64.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-6\"><em>\u2018This contract </em>does not include a low fire glaze.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\">\u201cThe biggest item in dispute is Change Order No. 23, in the amount of $9,382.42, and is made up of the terra cotta wall facing panels referred to in the two quoted paragraphs. Plaintiff maintains that it is extra to the basic proposal, and defendants claim that it is included in the basic proposal and contract. It is conceded that plaintiff typed the two paragraphs, and that defendant inserted in ink the phrase \u2018for Seaboard Glazed tile\u2019, which appears as an interlineation in the first of the two paragraphs. Both parties took the position that the contract was clear and unambiguous in their respective favor. The Court, in an effort to throw additional light on the general intention of the parties, heard testimony and admitted documentary evidence relating to the circumstances and the actions of the parties concerning the terra cotta work. This evidence, while extensive and conflicting, does not change the findings of this Court as based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>on the contract itself, and within its four corners. It is conceded that the proposal of March 24, 1965, was the only contract between the parties. The two paragraphs in question each refer to \u2018this contract\u2019, and simply set forth the size of the terra cotta to be furnished, and by the insertion in ink by the defendant, the manufacturer\u2019s name. Nowhere, is there any reference to the tile as an extra, nor any indication that the two paragraphs are intended to comprise a separate contract for the tile. The first sentence of the basic contract provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Anc\">\u2018We propose to do <em>all of the masonry work </em>in accordance with the <em>Architectural Drawings identified as Sheet 1 thru Sheet 29 inclusive and Structural Drawings identified as Sheet SI thru S17, all dated September 14, 1964, </em>prepared by your Architect Berla &amp; Abel, <em>in accordance with Division 4 \u201cMasonry &amp; Cast Stone\u201d, </em>of the Specifications bearing no date, Section 4A paragraphs 1 thru 12, for the Apartment-Hotel, West Chevy Chase, Maryland, known as Highland House for Messrs. Milton &amp; Howard Polinger, being constructed by you at Wisconsin Avenue and High Street, West Chevy Chase, Maryland, for the sum of TWO HUNDRED FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS ($205,000.).\u2019 (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4O\">\u201cThe foregoing provision incorporates specific drawings which were in evidence, and which showed by drawing, and by written words, the specific location and the specific wall areas to be faced with terra .cotta veneer panels, along with the other masonry. work, describing, the terra cotta facing to be furnished, including the method of installing the same. This information is specifically set forth in Division 4 of the specifications.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASK\">\u201cWhen the evidence beyond the written con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>tract is considered, I reach the same conclusion. Defendants\u2019 Exhibit 3, which is a general estimate from plaintiff\u2019s records, clearly shows that in making a detailed cost estimate for the masonry work on the Highland House job, at the bottom of such estimate and after adding sums for overhead, profit, supervision, et cetera, a figure of $200,000 was arrived at following the computation. It is clear that there was, then, added the sum of $9,000 indicated as terra cotta work, and a total of $209,000 which, obviously, was rounded out to a final bid or proposal of $205,000, which final figure was circled in red on the document. This, of course, is the figure quoted in the basic proposal. The specifications, originally, called for 20x20xl%\u2019s terra cotta tile. A less expensive terra cotta panel, 18x24x1% was finally approved on May 13. It appears clear that by adding the two paragraphs in question, the plaintiff was protecting itself in the use of the less expensive panel, in lieu of that required by the specifications, and by inserting in ink \u2018Seaboard Glazed tile\u2019, defendants were assuring that the desired brand would be used. I find, therefore, that the claimed extra of $9, 328.41 [sic] was, in fact, incorporated in the basic contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Judge Mace was the trier of fact in this case. The cases of <em>City Pass. R. W. Co. v. Sewell, </em>37 Md. 443 (1873), and <em>Atlantic States v. Drummond and Co., </em>251 Md. 77, 246 A. 2d 251 (1968), are dispositive of the claim of A. &amp; A. that the trial judge erred in not including interest on the sums he allowed in the judgment he directed be entered in its favor. In <em>City Pass. R. W. Co. </em>our predecessors said :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">\u201cIt must be conceded that interest is not an inseparable and invariable incident of claims for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>money, or unliquidated accounts. \u2018It is recoverable as of right, upon contracts in writing to pay money upon a day certain; as upon bills of exchange and promissory notes, or on contracts for the payment of interest, or where the money claimed has been actually used, and upon bonds, etc., but in other cases, <em>it is a question entirely for the jury to be decided according to the equities of the transaction.\u2019 Newson v. Douglass, </em>7 H. &amp; J. 417; <em>Karthaus v. Owings, </em>2 G. &amp; J. 430.\u201d (emphasis in original) <em>Id. </em>at 452.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">In <em>Atlantic States </em>Judge McWilliams said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">\u201cOrdinarily the matter of interest is left to the discretion of the jury or the court sitting without a jury. In <em>Affiliated Distillers Brands Cory. v. R. W. L. Wine &amp; Liquor Co., </em>213 Md. 509, 516, 132 A. 2d 582 (1957), we said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">\u2018However, this general rule is subject to certain exceptions that are as well established as the rule itself. Among the exceptions are cases on bonds, or on contracts, to pay money on a day certain, and cases where the money has been used. If the contractual obligation be unilateral and is to pay a liquidated sum of money at a certain time, interest is almost universally allowed from the time when its payment was due. [Citing cases.] \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-8\">\u201cTo the same effect see <em>Mullan Contracting Co. v. International Business Machs. Corp., </em>220 Md. 248, 151 A. 2d 906 (1959).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 85.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">The trial court did not err in not including interest in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">We next pass to the contention of A. &amp; A. that there was error in not directing that the judgment bear interest from its date. An examination of the docket entries reveals a reference to the filing of the memorandum opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>ion of the trial judge. The next succeeding docket entry is an order for appeal to this Court. There is no docket entry reflecting entry of judgment <em>nisi. </em>Likewise, judgment absolute apparently was not entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">In <em>Merlands Club v. Messall, </em>238 Md. 359, 208 A. 2d 687 (1965), Judge Barnes said for the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">\u201cIt is well settled that in an action at law tried by the court, the judgment absolute is entered a) within 3 days after the judgment <em>nisi </em>has been entered, if no motion for a new trial has been filed, or b) upon the denial of that motion, if such motion has been filed,\u2014and is the \u2018final judgment\u2019 from which an appeal may be taken; any order for appeal filed prior to the entry of that judgment absolute is premature and without effect. <em>Md., Del. and Va. Ry. Co. v. Johnson, </em>129 Md. 412, 99 A. 600 (1916).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 362-63.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">Since there has been no judgment absolute, the appeal is prematurely taken and must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Maryland Rule 642 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-9\">\u201cA judgment <em>nisi </em>entered by the court following * * * trial by the court without a jury * * * shall be so entered as to carry interest from the date of the entry of judgment <em>nisi.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">Accordingly, upon the remand we have no doubt judgment <em>nisi </em>will be entered to carry interest in accordance with the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed, appellant to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
