The new statute, Code (1957, 1969 Repl. Vol.), included the following sections:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b22-10\">\u201cSubtitle III\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b22-11\">\u201cSec. 3-202. <em>Dower and curtesy abolished.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b22-12\">The estates of dower and curtesy are abolished.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b22-13\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b22-14\">\u201cSubtitle XII\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b22-15\">\u201cSec. 12-102. <em>Applicability.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b22-16\">Unless otherwise specifically provided in another section of another subtitle of this article, the provisions of this article shall apply as follows :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b22-17\">(a) Subtitles. . .III. . .shall apply to estates of decedents dying on or after January 1,1970.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b22-18\">The present appeal presents to us for resolution questions in regard to the constitutionality and effect of these sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-19\">The facts are not in dispute. The bill of complaint for declaratory judgment filed on February 11, 1970, in the Circuit Court of Baltimore City by appellees, Carol Joan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>Jacobs and Morton L. Silberman, plaintiffs below, against the appellant, Stanley James Silberman, alleged and the answer admitted the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">The defendant, Stanley J. Silberman, was the contract purchaser under two contracts for the sale of two fee simple parcels of land in Baltimore City, being two annual ground rents for $21.50 and $36.00 respectively. These contracts of sale provided for settlement on February 2, 1970. The plaintiff, Carol Joan Jacobs, a married woman, was married to her present husband prior to January 1, 1970, and had not been previously married. The plaintiff, Morton L. Silberman, was married to his present wife prior to January 1, 1970, and had not been previously married. The ground rents owned by the respective plaintiffs had been acquired by them prior to January 1, 1970. It had been stipulated between the parties that the ground rent owned by Carol Joan Jacobs was not acquired by her as part of her sole and separate estate and that the ground rents owned by both of the plaintiffs were acquired by their own funds prior to their respective marriages. At the time of settlement, the plaintiffs were ready, willing and able to settle, but the defendant refused to settle because the spouses of the respective plaintiffs would not join in the respective deeds of conveyance. The defendant advised the plaintiffs at the time of settlement that the joinder of the spouses of the respective plaintiffs was a necessary condition of the defendant\u2019s obtaining a title free from any claims of dower or curtesy, notwithstanding the purported abolitions of the estates of dower and curtesy by Section 3-202 of the new Article 93 enacted by Chapter 3 of the Acts of 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">Title insurance companies, which maintain offices in Baltimore City, have taken and continue presently to maintain the position that they will require the joinder of spouses to deeds of real property inasmuch as questions have been raised in regard to the validity and the application of Section 3-202. Attached as Exhibit B to the bill of complaint was a notice directed by the Title Guarantee Company to \u201cAll Title Examiners, Agencies and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>Approved Attorneys\u201d on December 19, 1969, stating that \u201cthe company will continue as in the past to require the signature of spouses after January 1, 1970 until such time as the Court of Appeals has construed the above section [Section 3-202] which we understand will be in the very near future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">The case because of its public importance was advanced for oral argument and was duly heard by Judge Perrott in the Circuit Court of Baltimore City on February 25, 1970. On April 23, 1970, the Circuit Court entered a decree declaring that the provisions of Section 3-202 are constitutional, valid and effective in regard to all fee simple properties owned by married persons on and after January 1, 1970, whether acquired by them before or after January 1, 1970, and that the joinder of spouses of the respective plaintiffs- was not required for them to convey a good and merchantable title to the ground rents. A timely appeal was filed to this Court from that decree. Judge Perrott filed a comprehensive and helpful opinion which we have carefully considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">Two basic questions are presented to us by the appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"AaG\">(1) Do the Constitutions of the United States and of this State prohibit the General Assembly of Maryland from enacting a statute abolishing inchoate rights of dower ?</p>\n<p id=\"b24-8\">(2) Does Section 3-202, which provides that the \u201cestates\u201d of dower and curtesy are abolished, abolish inchoate rights of dower, not normally considered to be \u201cestates\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b24-9\">In our opinion there is no constitutional prohibition preventing the enactment of Section 3-202 and, as properly construed, the statute effectively abolishes inchoate rights of dower. Thus, we shall affirm the decree of April 23,1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-10\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b24-11\">In our opinion, no provisions of either the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of the State of Maryland prohibit the enactment by the General Assembly of Maryland of a statute abolishing inchoate rights of dower.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>We should first consider the nature of dower at common law and in Maryland at the time the Act of 1969, Chap. 3 was passed and became effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">The history of dower is carefully traced by Professor George L. Haskins of the University of Pennsylvania Law School in Part 5 \u201cMarital Estates,\u201d Chapter 1 \u201cDower\u201d in 1 <em>American Law of Property </em>(1952) \u00a7 5.1 et seq. See also 3 Vernier, <em>American Family Laws </em>(1935) and Has-kins, <em>The Development of Common Law Dower, </em>62 Harv.L.Rev. 42 (1948). Professor Haskins points out that dower was long known in the English law and antedated the Norman Conquest in 1066. He states \u201c. . .its precise beginnings are lost in the dim antiquities of the Germanic law which prevailed in England before the Conquest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 5.2, p. 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">At the time of Littleton (c. 1475) see <em>Littleton\u2019s Tenures, </em>\u00a7 51, there were five species of dower in England: (1) dower <em>ad ostium ecclesiae, </em>where a man of full age, on coming to the church door to be married, endowed his wife with a certain portion of his lands; (2) dower <em>ex assensu patris </em>which was different from dower <em>ad ostium ecclesiae </em>only in being made out of the lands of the father of the husband and with the father\u2019s consent; (3) dower by common law, where the widow was entitled during her life to a one-third part of all the lands of which her husband was seised in law or in fact during coverture and which any issue she might have had might by possibility have inherited; (4) dower by custom, where a widow became entitled to a specified portion of her husband\u2019s lands as a consequence of some local or particular custom; and, (5) dower <em>de la pluis belle </em>(or <em>de la pluis </em>beale), where the widow on suing the guardian in chivalry for dower, was required by him to endow himself of the fairest portion of any lands she might hold as guardian in socage, and thus released from dower the lands of her husband held in chivalry. When military tenures were abolished, this form of dower was abolished also. See <em>Blackstone, Commentaries </em>(Lewis ed.), book 2, p. 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>The dower by custom was of a local nature and did not continue into the later common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">As Mr. Justice Swayne stated, for the Supreme Court of the United States, in <em>Randall v. Kreiger, </em>23 Wall. (90 U. S.) 137, 147-148 (1874) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-6\">\u201cDower by the common law was of three kinds: <em>Ad ostium ecclesiae, Ex assensu patris, </em>and that which in the absence of the others the law pre7 scribed. The two former were founded in contract. The latter was the creature of the law. Dower <em>Ad ostium ecclesiae </em>and <em>Ex assensu patris </em>were abolished in England by a statute of the 3rd and 4th William IV, Ch. 105. The dower given by law is the only kind which has since existed in England, and it is believed to be the only kind which ever obtained in this country.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">Dower was not a part of the feudal system of tenure but was rather a survival of more ancient concepts. It was inconsistent with the emphasis on succession to blood kin in the feudal system of tenure and \u201cit became a great clog to alienations, and was otherwise inconvenient to families\u201d as Sir William Blackstone stated. See <em>Blade-stone, Commentaries, supra, </em>p. 136. Professor Haskins observed in 1 <em>American Law of Property </em>(1952), Section 5.4, p. 631:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-9\">\u201cThe chief changes in the law of dower after Littleton\u2019s time were in the direction of devising expedients for defeating it. Because dower was one of the few restrictions on the free alien-ability of land, methods of defeating it were worked out by parliament, by the courts and by conveyancers. Briefly, it may be said that those methods were: (1) jointures created under the Statute of Uses; (2) trusts, out of which courts of equity refused dower; and (3) powers of appointment, under which a wife might be deprived of dower and yet the husband might have all the advantages of an estate of inheritance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>\u201cDower <em>de la pluis beale </em>was abolished in 1660, dower <em>ad ostium ecclesiae </em>and <em>ex assensu patris </em>in 1833. The Dower Act of 1833 empowered a husband to deprive his wife of common law dower by his express act. The Administration of Estates Act of 1925 abolished dower completely.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">In Maryland only dower by common law became part of the Maryland system of tenure. <em>Judge </em>(later Chief Judge) Prescott, for the Court, in <em>Lefteris v. Poole, </em>234 Md. 34, 38, 198 A. 2d 250, 252 (1964), defined dower in Maryland as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-6\">\u201cDower is a common-law right of a surviving widow to a life estate in one-third of the inheritable real estate owned by the husband during the coverture, which right, prior to the husband\u2019s decease, is said to be inchoate, and after his death it becomes consummate. <em>Chew v. Chew, </em>1 Md. 163, 172; Venable, <em>The Law of Real Property, Leasehold Estates in Maryland, </em>pp. 21, 22; 4 Kent Com. 35-72; <em>United States v. Certain Parcels of Land,, Etc., </em>46 F.Supp. 441 (D.C., D.Md.).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">See <em>Buchanan v. Deshon, </em>1 Har. <em>&amp; </em>G. 280, 289 (1827).</p>\n<p id=\"b27-10\">In <em>United States v. Certain Parcels of Land, </em>46 F.Supp. 441, 444 (D.Md. 1942), Judge Chesnut reviewed the applicable Maryland law in regard to dower and summarized the Maryland law as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-11\">\u201cNo Maryland partition or condemnation case has been found where an award for inchoate dower has actually been made. In two early Maryland partition cases, . . .it was intimated that such an allowance might possibly be made in a proper case; but the most significant Maryland decision is <em>Reiff v. Horst, </em>55 Md. 42, 47, 49. In that case the wife by agreement had released her inchoate dower in certain lands for a stipulated consideration. The court enforced the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>agreement but, in discussing the general question of compensation for inchoate dower, it was said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-5\">\u201c \u2018The interest of the wife in her husband\u2019s real estate is inchoate only during his life, it requires the husband\u2019s death to occur before it becomes a vested right. As this Court defines it in <em>Buchanan v. Deshon, </em>1 Har. &amp; G. 280, \u201cshe has no vested right, it is altogether contingent, depending upon her surviving her husband.\u201d In <em>Hawley v. Bradford, </em>9 Paige, [200], 201 [37 Am. Dec. 390], the Chancellor says: \u201cStrictly speaking, the wife has no interest or estate in the lands of her husband <em>during his life, </em>which is capable of being mortgaged or pledged for the payment of his debt. Her joining in a mortgage therefore merely operates by way of release or extinguishment of her future dower as against the mortgagor, if she survives her husband, but without impairing her contingent right of dower in the equity of redemption. If the mortgage be foreclosed in the life-time of the husband, she has no claim on the surplus proceeds of sale; but if her husband be dead when foreclosure takes place her dower right in the equity of redemption having then become consummate, she would be endowed of the surplus proceeds.\u201d 1 <em>Scribner on Dower, </em>478; <em>[Titus v. Neilsen], </em>5 Johns. Ch. 452. In the last cited case, Chancellor Kent says, it is very clear this is the law. It results from these authorities that the wife\u2019s inchoate right is not such a right as may be bargained and sold. Her deed does not pass any title. It operates only by way of estoppel or release. And any words of release would be as effectual as words of grant. She cannot convey it to a stranger. It is only released to the owner of the fee. * * * <em>Regarding her right, as the law does, during the husband\u2019s life, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number><em>as having no present value, as it is not the subject of sale, but only of release to the owner of the fee, we have no scale or standard for ascertaining its present worth </em>* * *.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-5\">\u201cI have not been able to find that this view of the nature of inchoate dower as expressed by the Maryland Court of Appeals in <em>Reiff v. Horst, </em>has been subsequently modified in any way. It was cited with approval in the recent case of <em>Roth v. Roth, </em>144 Md. 553, 555, 125 A. 400. In <em>Hopkins v, Magruder, </em>D. C. Md., 34 F.Supp. 381, Judge Coleman, in applying the federal gift tax statute * * * held that where a husband made a deed of gift to his wife of certain real estate, no deduction from the whole value thereof could be made on account of her inchoate dower for the computation of the tax. After stating the nature of inchoate dower in Maryland (34 F.Supp. page 383) he said, at page 384 of 34 F.Supp.: \u2018In short, we are being asked to place a value upon something, the present worth of which the Court of Appeals of Maryland has said can be ascertained by no scale or standard, <em>Reiff v. Horst, </em>55 Md. 42.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-7\">\u201cIt will thus be noted that the view of the Maryland Court of Appeals as to inchoate dower is that it has no present value and there is no scale or standard for ascertaining its present worth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-8\">(Emphasis in the opinion of the District Court.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">See also the informative review of Maryland statutes and cases by Chief Judge Bru\u00f1e, speaking for the Court, in <em>Kreamer v. Hitchcock, </em>207 Md. 454, 115 A. 2d 255 (1955); <em>Alexander\u2019s British Statutes, </em>p. 306 et seq., and Venable, <em>Law of Real Property and Leasehold Estates in Maryland, </em>p. 21, et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-10\">In <em>Key v. Key, </em>134 Md. 418, 421-423, 106 A. 744 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>(1919), our predecessors held that the Act of 1916, Ch. 325 which enlarged the share in real property of a surviving spouse, electing to take against a will, could be validly applied retroactively. Judge Briscoe, for the Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-5\">\u201cThe second objection that the Act is invalid because it disturbs and impairs existing and vested property rights is manifestly not tenable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-6\">\u201cThe language of the third section of the Act is clear and definite that the surviving husband or widow shall take as heir a certain share in lands, tenements or hereditaments, within this State belonging to the deceased spouse at the time of his or her death, though such deceased spouse die testate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-7\">\u201cThe statute it will be seen operates only upon property owned and belonging to a person at the time of his or her death, and does not in any way change or divest rights or estates in property already descended or vested, nor does it affect the enjoyment and ownership of property by the owner during his life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-8\">\u201cSimilar laws of this character have been held valid and constitutional, and approved by the Supreme Court of the United States in a number of cases and by the Appellate courts of the various states.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-9\">\u201cIn <em>Noel v. Ewing, </em>9 Indiana 38, the Supreme Court of Indiana in applying a statute of that State which provided that if a husband die, testate or intestate leaving a widow, one-third of his real estate shall descend to her in fee simple, held that husbands as a class were embraced in the language used, and that it included all those who sustained this relation at the date of the statute or might sustain that relation in the future. The Court said: \u2018Upon the dissolution of marriage by death the law applies. If persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>married before the Act were intended to be excepted the law would have been so written. It establishes the death of one of the parties as the future event on which it is to operate. It simply determines the legal effect of death as a future event on the rights of the surviving wife.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-5\">\u201cIn <em>U. S. v. Fox, </em>94 U. S. 315, the Court there said: \u2018The power of the state to regulate the tenure of real property within her limits, and the mode of its acquisition and transfer, and the rules of descent, and the extent to which a testamentary disposition of it may be exercised by its owners is undoubted. It is an established principle of law, everywhere recognized, arising from the necessity of the case, that the disposition of immovable property, whether by deed, descent or any other mode, is exclusively subject to the government within whose jurisdiction the property is situate.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-6\">\u201cIt is very apparent in the present case that there are no vested rights involved and the authorities in support of the validity of such legislation are too numerous and well settled to permit it to be disturbed at the present date. The cases and citations from the various text-writers upon the subject will be found cited and collected in the appellant\u2019s brief in the case of <em>Safe Deposit Co. v. Gittings, </em>103 Md. 494, and will be found to fully sustain the conclusion we have reached in this case. <em>Sturgis v. Ewing, </em>18 Ill. 176; <em>Brettun v. Fox, </em>100 Mass. 234 and <em>Randall v. Kreiger, </em>23 Wall. 148.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">It is thus seen that under the Maryland law the inchoate right of dower was not a vested right. It was only upon the death of the spouse that dower became vested. The spouse had no interest or estate in the other spouse\u2019s land prior to the death of that spouse which was capable of being mortgaged, pledged or sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">The Supreme Court of the United States has indicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>that inchoate rights of dower are within the control of the State Legislature and such rights are not protected from State action by the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">In <em>Randall v. Kreiger, </em>23 Wall. (90 U. S.) 137, 148 (1874), supra,\u2014cited with approval in <em>Key v. Key, supra </em>\u2014the Supreme Court sustained the retroactive application of a State statute permitting a wife to convey her inchoate dower interest by means of a power of attorney. Mr. Justice Swayne, for the Supreme Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-6\">\u201cDuring the life of the husband, the right is a mere expectancy or possibility. In that condition of things, the law making power may deal with it as may be deemed proper. It is not a natural right. It is wholly given by law, and the power that gave it may increase, diminish or otherwise alter it, or wholly take it away. It.is upon the same footing with the expectancy of heirs, apparent or presumptive, before the death of the ancestor. Until that event occurs the law of descent and distribution may be moulded according to the will of the Legislature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-7\">\u201cLaws upon those subjects in such cases take effect at once, in all respects as if they had preceded the birth of such persons then living. Upon the death of the husband and the ancestor the rights of the widow and the heirs become fixed and vested. Thereafter their titles respectively rest upon the same foundation, and are protected by the same sanctions as other rights of property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">The Supreme Court cited <em>Randall </em>with approval and followed it in <em>Ferry v. Spokane P. &amp; S. Ry. Co., </em>258 U. S. 314, 42 S. Ct. 358, 66 L. Ed. 635 (1922) in which that Court unanimously sustained a statute of Oregon which divested a non-resident wife of dower rights in property disposed of by her husband prior to his death. In sustaining this statute, Mr. Justice McKenna, for the Supreme Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>\u201cDower is not a privilege or immunity of citizenship, either state or federal, within the meaning of the provisions relied on. At most it is a right which, while it exists, is attached to the marital contract or relation; and it always has been deemed subject to regulation by each State as respects property within its limits. * * * Neither \u00a7 2 of Article IY nor the Fourteenth Amendment takes from the several States the power to regulate this subject; nor does either make it a privilege or immunity of citizenship. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-5\">\u201cThe further contention, based on the Fourteenth Amendment necessarily is, as counsel urge, that dower is \u2018fundamental and substantial,\u2019\u2014\u2018a property right, being, while inchoate, a chose in action, of which no citizen of the United States, wherever he (she) may be resident, can be deprived without \u201cdue process of law,\u201d and as to which every person is entitled to the \u201cequal protection of the laws,\u201d as provided in the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-6\">\u201cThe Court of Appeals considered this contention, and it is difficult to add anything to its opinion. It pointed out that the Oregon statute was taken from the laws of Michigan adopted in 1846 and sustained. The example of Michigan was followed in Wisconsin, Kansas and Nebraska and sustained by the courts of those States. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-7\">\u201cAnd Blackstone speaks of dower as having become \u2018a great clog to alienation,\u2019 and \u2018otherwise inconvenient to families.\u2019 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-8\">\u201cThe cases recognize that the limitation of the dower right is to remove an impediment to the transfer of real estate, and to assure titles against absent and probably unknown wives. And such is the purpose of the Oregon statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>and the means of executing the purpose appropriate, and a proper exercise of classification. It satisfies, therefore, the constitutional requirement of the equal protection of the laws; and we proceed to the inquiry whether the statute is otherwise valid. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-6\">\u201cThe granting of dower, therefore, is a matter of statutory regulation. It was so decided by the United States Circuit Court of Oregon in 1887 <em>(Thorburn v. Doscher, </em>supra), Judge Deady expressing it as follows: Tt rests with the Legislature to say what interest, if any, married persons shall have in the property of each other, as an incident of the relation between them. It may give or withhold dower altogether. Or it may for the security of titles, and the protection of innocent purchasers, provide that a non-resident woman whose very existence is probably unknown within the state, and is practically disavowed by the husband, shall not be entitled to dower of land which he had disposed of without her concurrence or consent, and ostensibly as a single man.\u2019 The law thus declared has been the law of Oregon for 65 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-7\">\u201cThere is a distinction between dower created by the parties and that given by law, and the latter \u2018is believed to be the only kind which ever obtained in this country.\u2019 <em>Randall v. Kreiger, </em>23 Wall. 137, 148. Expressing the power of the legislature over it, the court said: \u2018During the life of the husband the right is a mere expectancy or possibility. In that condition of things, the lawmaking power may deal with it as may be deemed proper. It is not a natural right. It is wholly given by law, and the power that gave it may increase, diminish, or otherwise alter it, or wholly take it away.

It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-7\">\u201cThat the bill would violate no provision of the Federal Constitution is settled by decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States [citing <em>Randall v.

Whiteley, </em>98 Md. 430, 56 A. 823 (1904) but, in our opinion, that case is clearly distinguishable from the present case. In <em>Harris </em>the question presented was in regard to the alleged retroactive effect of the Act of 1898, Ch. 457 which, in relevant part, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-5\">\u201c \u2018Every husband shall acquire by virtue of his marriage an estate for his life in one-third of the lands held or owned by his wife at any time during the marriage, whether by legal or equitable title, or whether held by her at the time of her death or not, but such estate shall not operate to the prejudice of any claim for the purchase-money of such lands, or other lien on the same; nor shall any conveyance of such lands by the wife alone bar such estate of the husband therein.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The wife had acquired a vested fee simple estate in certain lands from her deceased father prior to the passage of the Act of 1898, but creditors of the husband in 1903 filed a petition in a pending equity proceeding to subject the interest of the husband allegedly acquired in the wife\u2019s property by the Act of 1898 to the payment of his debts. The Chancellor dismissed the petition and his order was affirmed on appeal. It was held that (1) the Act of 1898 was not intended to operate retroactively and (2), in any event, it could not adversely affect the <em>vested rights of the wife </em>acquired prior to the passage of the Act of 1898. Judge Schmucker, for the Court, anticipated the very question presented in the present case when he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-7\">\u201cAssuming that the interest acquired by Mr. Whiteley in his wife\u2019s real estate at the time of his marriage in 1881, which under the Code of 1860 was a mere expectancy and not a vested estate, was subject so far <em>as he was concerned </em>to legislative control and might have been modified or diminished by subsequent legislation, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>does not at all follow that the Legislature had the power to increase or enlarge that interest if by so doing the wife\u2019s vested interest in her own estate would be correspondingly diminished. Mrs. Whiteley acquired her estate in her property by devise and not as an incident of her marital <em>status </em>or relation and she is entitled to the full benefit and protection of the proposition so strongly supported by the cases last cited. This Court has already held that even the husband\u2019s estate by the curtesy in his wife\u2019s realty, when it had become fixed by the birth of a child alive, was not impaired or affected by subsequent legislation regulating marital property rights although his curtesy was founded on and grew out of his marital relation. <em>Porter v. Bowers, </em>55 Md. 215; <em>Rice v. Hoffman, </em>35 Md. 344; <em>Hoffman v. Rice, </em>88 Md. 285. The principle there asserted applies with equal force to the estate of the wife in her realty which had become vested prior to the Act of 1898.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-7\">(Emphasis by the Court, 98 Md. at 442-443, 56 A. at 824.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">It was because the <em>wife\u2019s </em>rights were <em>vested, </em>that the Court indicated the legislature could not impair those rights retroactively by <em>expanding </em>the husband\u2019s interest in the land. In the instant case, as we have observed, the <em>inchoate </em>right of dower is not vested, a vested right not arising until the death of the spouse who owns the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">Judge Stockbridge, for the Court, observed the same distinction between inchoate and vested rights in considering the Act of 1910, Ch. 90 in <em>State v. American Bonding Co. of Baltimore, </em>128 Md. 268, 273, 97 A. 529, 531 (1916) when he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-10\">\u201cIn 26 <em>Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. </em>747, it is said, that the repeal of a statute in the absence of a saving clause necessarily divests and destroys all inchoate interests which have arisen under it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>while it leaves unimpaired those which have become vested. This is a succinct statement of the general rule which will be found applied in all of the cases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">It is also clear in the case at bar that the statute involved <em>was intended </em>by the General Assembly to have retroactive effect. The statute was prepared by the Governor\u2019s Commission to Study and Revise the Testamentary Laws of Maryland, of which the Honorable William L. Henderson, formerly a Chief Judge of this Court, was Chairman. Fortunately, the comment of the Commission in regard to the Act of 1969, Ch. 3, \u00a7 1, now Code (1969 Replacement Vol.), Art. 93, \u00a7 3-202, abolishing the estates of dower and curtesy, is published immediately after the statutory provision and clearly indicates that the statutory provision was to have retroactive effect. The comment is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-6\">\u201cThis provision has the effect of eliminating from the testamentary picture the traditional estates of dower and curtesy which were defined and regulated in former \u00a7\u00a7 328, 329, 334, 335, and 339 through 343, \u00a7\u00a7 33-37 and 138 (b) of Article 16, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 7, 12 and 13 of Article 45, and \u00a7 4 of Article 46. These estates no longer served any significantly useful purpose and in recent years were rarely availed of by a surviving spouse. The modern provisions of statutory shares of outright interests in the decedent\u2019s property seem to have replaced these ancient concepts. In addition, the intended protection of the estate of dower has often been nullified as a practical matter through the creation of a life estate with unrestricted power of disposition, the creation of a \u2018one cent\u2019 ground rent, or the acquisition of real estate by a wholly owned corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-8\">\u201cSince this abolition is effective as to estates of persons dying on or after January 1, 1970 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>(see Section 12-102 (a)), one practical effect will be that those who must handle real property conveyances on or after that date need not routinely obtain the signature of the grantor\u2019s spouse on an instrument conveying only the grantor\u2019s interest in real property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-5\">\u201cAmendments to \u00a7 18 of Article 27 and \u00a7 15A of Article 75 were also made in order to delete the references to dower therein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-6\">\u201cAs a result of the abolition of dower, the following hoary British statutes, printed in Alexander, A Collection of The British Statutes in Force in Maryland (1870) will no longer be applicable in Maryland: Magna Charta, 9 Henry III Ch. 7 (providing for the assignment of dower to a widow within 40 days after the death of her husband and establishing the inchoate right of dower as to all lands of which the husband had been seized at any time during coverture); 20 Henry III Ch. 1 (providing for damages collectible by a widow against heirs who have refused or failed to make an assignment of dower) ; and 13 Edward I Ch. 34 (extinguishing right of dower in the event of adultery). See also Steiner, Adoption of English Law in Maryland, 8 Yale L. J. 353 (1899) ; Sioussat, The English Statutes in Maryland, XXI Johns Hopkins Studies in Historical and Political Science 465 (1903).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-10\">The appellant also relies upon the decisions of <em>our predecessors </em>in <em>Hammond v. Piper, </em>185 Md. 314, 44 A. 2d 756 (1945) and <em>Marbury v. Bouse, </em>187 Md. 106, 48 A. 2d 582 (1946) involving a contingent remainder and a reversion respectively. In both cases it was held that the respective interests were not affected by the Act of 1916, Ch. 325, Sec. 1 which abolished common law rules of seisin or purchase as the basis for the descent of real property and provided that real property should descend in the same manner and proportion as personal property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>is distributed in intestacy. The appellant urges that inasmuch as the interest involved in those cases \u201cwas the expectancy of an heir,\u201d it is incongruous for this Court to protect that interest against the retroactive operation of the Act of 1916, Ch. 325 and not to protect an inchoate right of dower against the retroactive effect of the Act of 1969, Ch. 3. One fundamental distinction between the Act of 1916, Ch. 325, on the one hand, and the Act of 1.969, Ch. 3, on the other, is that the former Act was not intended to be retroactive\u2014as this Court determined in <em>Kernan v. Carter, </em>132 Md. 577, 104 A. 530 (1918) \u2014 whereas the Act of 1969, Ch. 3 is clearly intended to be retroactive. In short, no <em>constitutional issues </em>were involved in either <em>Hammond </em>or in <em>Marbury, </em>and, of course, were not passed on by the Court in those cases. Moreover, there are differences between rights of entry and possibilities of reverter and the inchoate right of dower in so far as vesting is concerned. For example, rights of entry and possibilities of reverter are considered to be present, vested property interests for the purposes of the rule against perpetuities. See Simes, <em>Future Interests, </em>Sections 506-507 and Reno, <em>Alienability and Transmissibility of Future Interests in Maryland, </em>2 Md.L.Rev. 89, 97 (1938). Then, too, the Act of 1908, Ch. 84 (see Art. 93, \u00a7 1-301) provided that rights of entry and possibilities of reverter are subject to disposition by will.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There are other differences which need not be explored in this opinion. We believe that there is no inconsistency between the result we have reached in the present case and that reached by our predecessors in the <em>Hammond </em>and <em>Mar-bury </em>cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">We conclude, therefore, that there are no provisions of either the Constitution of the United States or of the Constitution of Maryland which prevent the General As<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>sembly from retroactively abolishing inchoate rights of dower. We have seen that both early forms of dower based upon contract passed from the law many years ago and were never part of the common law in Maryland or indeed in this Country. There can be no contention \u2014 and there is none\u2014that there is any impairment by the State of the obligation of a contract as prohibited by Article I, Section 10 of the Federal Constitution. Nor is there any taking of property by the State without due process of law as prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution and which is also prohibited in this State by Art. 23 of the Declaration of Rights of the Maryland Constitution. The inchoate right of dower is not a <em>vested </em>right entitled to receive Constitutional protection. The action by the General Assembly in abolishing the estate of dower is not arbitrary, unreasonable or capricious, but, on the contrary, is based upon well considered reasons of public policy, many of which are outlined in the \u201cComment\u201d to Art. 93, \u00a7 3-202 already quoted. In addition to these factors, the modern uncertainty in many instances in regard to the validity of prior marriages or even of the status of present marriages leads to complications and difficulties in regard to the title of land and its alienability. These problems were largely unknown to the common law. The General Assembly could reasonably conclude, as have the legislatures of many of our sister States as well as Parliament, that the public interest required that the inchoate rights of dower and of curtesy be abolished retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">The final argument of the appellant is that, as a matter of proper construction, the language of the statute in question is not sufficiently broad to abolish inchoate rights of dower which are not usually referred to as \u201cestates.\u201d The appellant correctly points out that at common law there was no \u201cestate\u201d of dower until the husband had died and dower had been assigned to the wife. See <em>Rowland v. Prather, </em>53 Md. 232, 238 (1880) and 2 Tiffany, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number><em>Real Property </em>(3rd ed.), \u00a7 533. The General Assembly, however, was using the word \u201cestate\u201d in its general sense to include the inchoate rights of dower or curtesy. In <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>(4th Ed. 1951), p. 643 \u201cestate\u201d is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-5\">\u201c* * * \u2018estate\u2019 is constantly used in conveyances in connection with the words \u2018right,\u2019 \u2018title\u2019 and \u2018interest\u2019 and is, in a great degree, synonymous with all of them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">We note that in the Act of 1898, Ch. 457, \u00a7 7, Code (1965 Repl. Vol.), Art. 45, \u00a7 7, which created the husband\u2019s \u201cdower,\u201d the draftsman used the word \u201cestate\u201d in its creation, without mentioning any \u201cinchoate\u201d rights, but our predecessors indicated in <em>Collins v. Collins, </em>98 Md. 473, 480, 57 A. 597, 600 (1904) that this statute, together with the Act of 1898, Ch. 331 (in regard to the rights of a surviving husband in the estate of his wife) \u201chave practically made the marital rights of husband and wife the same so far as respects their property.\u201d Thus, the husband had his inchoate right of dower in his wife\u2019s real estate prior to her death by virtue of the Act of 1898, Ch. 457 as did the wife at common law in his real property prior to his death, notwithstanding the somewhat inartistic wording of the Act of 1898.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">In <em>Pressman v. Barnes, </em>209 Md. 544, 121 A. 2d 816 (1956) Judge Delaplaine, for the Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-8\">\u201cThe <em>cardinal rule </em>of statutory construction is that statutes should always be construed to effectuate the intention of the Legislature. * * * the proper course of construction in every case is to adopt that meaning of the words which best harmonizes with the context and promotes the policy and objects of the Legislature.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) (209 Md. at 558-9, 121 A. 2d at 823.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">As we have already observed, the \u201ccomment\u201d of the draftsman of the statute clearly indicates that the word <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>\u201cestate\u201d was used in its general and not in its narrow or technical sense and that it was intended that inchoate rights of dower and curtesy be abolished.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">More precise language could well have been used in the statute and there would seem to be little purpose in including \u201ccurtesy\u201d in the statute, as \u201ccurtesy\u201d was abolished by the Act of 1898, Ch. 457, \u00a7 7, see Code (1965 Repl. Vol.) Art. 45, \u00a7 7, and a husband\u2019s \u201cdower\u201d enacted in its place. The word \u201ccurtesy\u201d is surplusage in the Act of 1969, Ch. 3, but presents no difficulty inasmuch as it merely reaffirms what had been done by the Act of 1898, Ch. 457, \u00a7 7. As we observed in Note 1, <em>supra, </em>the identical language of the Maryland statute appears in the North Carolina statute. The same language has been adopted by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws for the Uniform Probate Code and approved by the American Bar Association, apparently with the intent to accomplish the abolition of inchoate rights of dower retroactively. In our opinion, it was clearly the intent of the General Assembly to accomplish this in Maryland by the statute in question. The language used, as properly construed, accomplishes this intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">\n<em>Decree affirmed, the appellant to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b36-10\">. It will be noted that North Carolina in 1959 enacted a statute which provides that, \u201cThe estates of curtesy and dower are hereby abolished.\u201d, Chapter 29-4. North Carolina General Statutes. The constitutionality of the statute has apparently never been tested.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b42-6\">. It may be observed that the policy of the common law against the alienability of rights of entry and possibilities of reverter rested upon the policy against champerty and maintenance\u2014see Evans v. Safe Deposit and Trust Co., 190 Md. 332, 345-56, 58 A. 2d 649 (1948) and not upon the insubstantiality of the interests themselves.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
