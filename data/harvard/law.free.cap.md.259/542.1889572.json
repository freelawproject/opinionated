Clarke, a member of the bar of Maryland (Clarke) and Central Cab Company, Inc., the appellant (Central), the insured under a policy issued by Bankers and Telephone Employees Insurance Company (Bankers) (2) did the evidence show a breach of that relationship- and (3) did the breach proximately cause damage to Central.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">Margaret P. Doyle was injured on December 3, 1965, while she was riding in a cab owned and operated by Central. She filed an action in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County against Central to recover $35,000 damages resulting to her from the alleged negligence of Yuan Yuan Chuh, the operator of Central\u2019s cab. Service of process in this action was made upon Lewis Levy, President of Central, on January 10, 1967, whereupon Mr. Levy mailed the papers to John Roane, Inc., the adjuster for Bankers. The insurance contract between Central and Bankers provided for the defense by Bankers of any legal action instituted against Central.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">Clarke, the appellee, on January 26, 1967, wrote to Bernard D. Lipton, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-11\">\u201cRe: Margaret P. Doyle v. Central Cab Co., Inc.

The president of Takoma-Langley Cab Company returned the copy to Clarke, whereupon Clarke threw the copy in the wastebasket.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">On April 10, 1967, Mr. Lipton wrote Bankers, as follows : '</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-8\">\u201cGentlemen:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azl\">\u201cI am the attorney for the plaintiff Margaret Doyle in the above cited case. Service was effectuated upon the Central Cab Company and I received a request from William H. Clarke, Esq. of Galiher, Stewart &amp; Clarke for an extension of time; until that firm could ..ascertain whether they were going to represent' the defendant. I have since heard from Mr. Clarke indicating that his firm would not represent .the defendant. Mr. Clarke also requested that I give your company some additional time to choose new counsel. This letter is to so advise you. For yo\u00fcr information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>the policy number is SAC 61799 and it is claim number 5B-40343.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-5\">\u201cUnless I hear from new counsel on or before April 25, 1967 I will presume your company has no intentions to proceed in this claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Bankers had been placed in receivership by the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County, Pennsylvania on March 30, 1967, the Insurance Commissioner of Pennsylvania having been appointed as Statutory Liquidator.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Not having heard from Bankers and no appearance having been entered for Central or any pleadings filed, the plaintiff Doyle on May 3, 1967, filed a Motion for Judgment by Default which was granted by the Circuit Court on May 16; the lower court then passed an order setting the case for an inquisition before a jury to inquire of the damages and costs. Central did not learn of this until August of 1967 when it received a notification from the Assignment Officer of the Circuit Court that an inquisition for damages was scheduled. On August 31, Central filed a motion to set aside the judgment by default; but at the' hearing on this motion on September 22, Central\u2019s motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">On May 15, 1968, a stipulation between the plaintiff Doyle and the defendant Central was filed in which, <em>inter alia, </em>it was stipulated that the Circuit Court should enter judgment in favor of the plaintiff against the defendant in the amount of $4,500.00 with costs of suit and interest from the date of judgment. Such judgment was entered by the Circuit Court on May 21 and was satisfied on October 8,1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">Thereafter depositions were taken, one of which was that of the driver of the Central Cab, Yuan Yuan Chuh, to which we will refer more fully later in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">The third party action of <em>Central v. Clarke </em>came on for hearing on January 9, 1970, before Judge Miller. In addition to the facts stated above Central called as a witness Roger W. Titus, a member of the Maryland Bar who prior to his admission to the Bar had been an adjuster for All<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>state Insurance Co. Mr. Titus was also 'Chairman of the Committee on Legal Ethics of the Montgomery County Bar Association. He had handled between 10 tb 20 cases for defendants insured by Allstate. In answer to a hypothetical question substantially incorporating the facts in the present case, Mr. Titus expressed the opinion that at the time the, insurance company sends counsel the file in the case, \u201can attorney-client relationship is established, unless I reject the file and send it back.\u201d He further stated that where counsel communicates with the attorney for the plaintiff and r\u00e9quests him not to take a default judgment because counsel is checking into the matter, the attorney-client relationship with the insured exists; and it was his opinion that there was a duty upon counsel to notify the insured of his withdrawal especially where he retained the file and <em>did not </em>return it to the insurance company for two months.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The trial court, at the end of all the testimony in the case, granted Clarke\u2019s motion for a directed verdict. The lower court, for the purposes of the motion, assumed that Clarke was retained and that there was an attorney-client relationship between Clarke and Central; but the lower court was of the opinion that there was no evidence of a breach of Clarke\u2019s professional duty, Central not having established \u201cwhat the standard of care is generally in this locality\u201d or in what manner Clarke \u201cbreached that standard of care.\u201d The lower court did not find it necessary, in view of its opinion in regard to the ground on which it ruled in Clarke\u2019s favor, to pass upon the question of whether Central had a meritorious defense in the Doyle action. Judgment for Clarke for costs against Central was duly entered on January 15, 1970; and Central filed a timely appeal to this Court from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">On appeal, Clarke, the appellee, earnestly argued that the lower court\u2019s assumption that an attorney-client relationship existed between Clarke and Central was in error and contended that no such relationship existed so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>that the judgment for Clarke for costs should be affirmed for this reason. We do not agree with this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Bankers, as the liability insurer, undertook to obtain counsel for the insured to defend the Doyle action. Counsel when so employed represents the insured as well as the insurance carrier and the attorney-client relationship is thus established between the insured and the attorney selected for the insured by the insurance company. This attorney-client relationship continued when Clarke retained the file and requested the plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s forebearance in taking a default judgment while he deliberated as to whether he would proceed further with the case. This attorney-client relationship was subject, of course, to later termination by Clarke if satisfactory arrangements, financial or otherwise, could not be made but only upon notice of such termination to his client, Central. Clarke, in effect, recognized the obligation to give notice of the termination of the attorney-client relationship by attempting to send to Central a copy of his letter of March 20, 1967, to Bankers. Because the copy of the letter was misdirected, it was not received by Central; and when the misdirected letter was returned to Clarke, he threw it into the wastebasket instead of redirecting it properly to Central. The obligation to notify Central of the termination of employment by Clarke was of particular importance in view of the prior correspondence with Lipton, as counsel for the plaintiff Doyle, his indulgence in regard to the entry of an appearance in the case and the filing of appropriate pleadings. Indeed, in the letter of March 20 from Clarke to Lipton, Clarke stated: \u201cI would like to suggest that you give the company some additional time so that they can choose <em>new counsel.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Although an agreement upon the amount of a retainer and its payment is rather conclusive evidence of the establishment of the attorney-client relationship, the absence of such an agreement or payment does not indicate conclusively that no such relationship exists. Indeed, the payment of fees is not a necessary element in the rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>tionship of attorney and client. The services of an attorney to the client may be rendered gratuitously but the relationship of attorney and client nonetheless exists. <em>Fort Myers Seafood Packers, Inc. v. Steptoe and Johnson, </em>381 F. 2d 261, 127 U. S. App. D.C. 93, 18 A.L.R.3d 974 (1967), <em>cert. denied, </em>390 U. S. 946, 88 S. Ct. 1033, 19 L.Ed.2d 1135. See 7 C.J.S. \u201cAttorney and Client,\u201d \u00a7 65 b, page 849.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">As aptly stated by Justice Frank of the Supreme Court of New York, Special Term, in <em>American Employers Ins. Co. v. Goble Aircraft Specialties, </em>205 Misc. 1066, 1075, 131 N.Y.S.2d 393, 401 (1954):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">\u201c. . . [T]here are not two standards, one applying to counsel privately retained by a client, and the other to counsel paid by an insurance carrier.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">See <em>Fidelity and Casualty Co. of New York v. McConnaughy, </em>228 Md. 1, 179 A. 2d 117 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">It seems clear to us that Clarke had a duty to notify Central when he finally decided some two months after originally receiving the Central file from Bankers that he would not go forward with the representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">It is well established that when an attorney terminates the attorney-client relationship he is obligated to give proper notice of such termination to the client. <em>Atilus v. U. S., </em>406 F. 2d 694 (5 Cir. 1969); <em>Zitomer v. Holdsworth, </em>200 F. Supp. 490 (ED. Pa. 1961); <em>Isser v. Berg, </em>38 Misc. 2d 957, 239 N.Y.S.2d 370 (1963); <em>Mambrino v. State, </em>30 Misc. 2d 990, 221 N.Y.S.2d 643 (1961); <em>Grittano v. Flannery, </em>21 Misc. 2d 91, 197 N.Y.S.2d 239 (1959); <em>Gosnell v. Hilliard, </em>205 N. C. 297, 171 S. E. 52 (1933); <em>MacDermid v. MacDermid, </em>116 Vt. 237, 73 A. 2d 315 (1950); <em>In re Estate of Coffin, </em>189 Iowa 862, 179 N. W. 123 (1920). See 7 C.J.S. \u201cAttorney and Client,\u201d \u00a7 110, page 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">We conclude that the attorney-client relationship existed between Clarke and Central as the trial court assumed for the purposes of the decision below. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Clarke contended below successfully and before us that Central did not offer sufficient expert testimony in the case to establish the standard of care in this case and hence has not proved a breach of any obligation owed by Clarke to Central. We do not agree with this contention and we are of the opinion that this error requires a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">There may well be cases where expert testimony is required in regard to whether the conduct of the attorney violates the standard of reasonable care or diligence in the particular situation. In our opinion, however, the present case is not one of those situations in which expert testimony is required. The failure of Clarke to notify Central of the termination of his employment thereby preventing Central from obtaining other counsel to appear and plead for it and thus avoiding a judgment by default against Central is such a clear violation of Clarke\u2019s duty as an attorney that the trial court should have ruled this as a matter of law. The situation in the instant case is analogous to cases involving medical malpractice in which a dentist pulled the wrong tooth, and our predecessors held in affirming a judgment for the plaintiff that there was no necessity for expert testimony to establish that a dentist should not pull the wrong tooth. <em>McClees v. Cohen, </em>158 Md. 60, 148 A. 124 (1930). The same rule applies in cases in which physicians have done an obviously negligent act such as accidentally amputating the wrong arm, or negligently leaving a sponge in a patient\u2019s body. <em>Rural Educational Ass\u2019n v. Bush, </em>42 Tenn. App. 34, 298 S.W.2d 761 (1956) and <em>Fredrickson v. Maw, </em>119 Utah 385, 227 P. 2d 772 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">In <em>Butts v. Watts, </em>290 S.W.2d 777, 779 (Ky. 1956), it was stated: \u201cThere is a limitation on the rule that expert testimony is essential to support a cause of action for malpractice where the common knowledge or experience, of laymen is extensive enough to recognize or infer negligence from the facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>See also <em>Johns Hopkins Hospital v. Genda, </em>255 Md. 616, 258 A. 2d 595 (1969) <em>holding </em>that expert testimony was necessary in that medical malpractice case involving a complicated operative technique in regard to heart surgery, but contrasting that case with medical malpractice cases of carelessly dropping a scalpel or knife on a patient causing him to be cut or dropping acid carelessly on the patient causing him to be burned.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Because we have found expert testimony not to be required by the facts in this case and that the lower court should have found as a matter of law that there was a breach of duty by Clarke, we do not find it necessary to decide the question raised by Clarke as to whether the expert testimony in itself was sufficient to establish the breach of duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Clarke urges that the decision of our predecessors in <em>Cochrane v. Little, </em>71 Md. 323, 18 A. 698 (1889), a malpractice action against an attorney in which it was held that there was no error in the admission into evidence of testimony of lawyers that the advice given by the attorney to the client was under the circumstances of the case, in their opinion, not such as a prudent careful lawyer, of ordinary capacity and intelligence would have given, or ought to have given, indicates that such expert testimony is <em>required </em>in <em>all </em>cases involving the negligent conduct of attorneys. In our opinion, the <em>Cochrane </em>case is not authority for such a proposition, but only holds that the admission of such evidence under the facts and circumstances of that case was not error. In <em>Cochrane, </em>the advice given the client by the attorney was in regard to a bond given in connection with a certain equity proceeding which advice wrongly stated the effect of giving a release to the only solvent principal obligor in the bond which release in fact caused all claims for reimbursement for the money paid by the surety to be relinquished. It is strongly indicated in the opinion in <em>Cochrane </em>that allegations in the declaration \u201cwould certainly be subject to the charge imputed to it of being founded in the want of ordinary skill or the want of reasonable care and dili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>gence on the part of the defendant.\u201d (71 Md. at 333, 18 A. at 701.) We perceive no inconsistency between the holding in, the <em>Cochrane </em>case and our opinion in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">In order for a client to recover damages against an attorney for negligent conduct of an attorney for failure to appear and defend a case, the client must show that injury proximately resulted to the client from this negligent act. The client must show that he had a meritorious defense to the plaintiff\u2019s action against him as otherwise th\u00e9 failure of the attorney to appear and defend would result in no prejudice or damage to the client. The negligent failure would be <em>damnum absque injuria. Kendall v. Rogers, </em>181 Md. 606, 31 A. 2d 312 (1943) states the rule requiring proximately caused damages; however, in <em>Kendall </em>such damages did exist. For cases where no damages were allowed in spite of the attorney\u2019s negligence, see <em>Pete v. Henderson, </em>124 Cal.App.2d 487, 269 P. 2d 78 (1954); <em>Lawson v. Sigfrid, </em>83 Colo. 116, 262 P. 1018 (1927) and <em>Kilmer v. Carter, </em>78 Cal. Rptr. 800 (1969). The trial court did not find it necessary to pass upon this element of recovery inasmuch as it found, erroneously in our opinion, that the failure to produce adequate expert testimony to establish the want of care prevented recovery by Central against Clarke in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">The attorney for the Plaintiff Doyle testified that in his opinion the $4,500.00 settlement \u201cwas a fair and reasonable settlement so far as the defendant was concerned.\u201d He thought the settlement was \u201cgenerous\u201d so far as the defendant was concerned. On the other hand, a reading of the deposition of Yuan Yuan Chuh, the driver of Central\u2019s cab, rather indicates that the sudden stop of the cab allegedly causing the Plaintiff Doyle to be thrown off the seat and be injured was unavoidable; and the Plaintiff Doyle had stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-8\">\u201c \u2018Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not your fault\u2019 * * * she said to me, \u2018Don\u2019t worry about it,\u2019 its not my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>fault, and she was very generous and gave me a big tip.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">We shall remand the case to the lower court for further proceedings in order that the issue of whether or not Central had a meritorious defense may be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\"><em>Judgment reversed and case remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion, the costs to abide the result in the Circuit Court for Montgomery </em>County.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
