They have brought into conflict the virtually identical \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses of two-automobile liability insurance policies. The generally accepted notion that this is a somewhat untidy area of the law has been succinctly articulated in 38 Minn. L. Rev. 838, 841 (1954) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-10\">\u201cDespite efforts by insurance counsel to draft explicit and litigation-proof terms in liability policies, especially in the \u2018other insurance\u2019 area,, litigation is all too frequently necessary to determine to what extent, if at all, each insurer must contribute in a double coverage case. The cause of litigation is not so often the ambiguity of the drafted policy in reference to the existence of other insurance as the conflicting clauses of the two applicable policies. Judicial interpretation of the conflicting clauses has not been uniform enough as yet to allow safe prediction of a certain result. Not only have interpretations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>the \u2018other insurance\u2019 clauses not been standard, but also the courts are not in agreement as to whether the \u2018other insurance\u2019 clauses ought to be the only controlling factors involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-4\">\u201cThe main approaches used by the courts to resolve the problem of the conflicting \u2018other insurance\u2019 clauses are four in number. They include: (1) holding the more specific insurer liable to the exclusion of the more general insurer; (2) holding the insurer of the primary tortfeasor primarily liable; (3) applying the \u2018other insurance\u2019 clause contained in that policy issued subsequent to the other policy; and (4) interpreting the clauses of the respective policies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">We shall approach the resolution of the problem now before us by undertaking to interpret the language of the two policies. Such an approach seems to be required by our holding in <em>Consolidated Mutual Ins. Co. v. Bankers Insurance Co. of Pennsylvania, </em>244 Md. 392 (1966). In that case Judge Barnes, for the Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">\u201cIn cases where two or more of the \u2018other insurance\u2019 clauses conflict, most courts resolve the problem of double coverage by attempting to reconcile conflicting clauses. This Court has followed this approach. <em>Celina Mutual Casualty Co. v. Citizens Casualty Co., </em>194 Md. 236, 71 A. 2d 20, 21 A.L.R.2d 605 (1949); <em>Citizens Casualty Co. of N. Y. v. Allied Mutual Ins. Co., </em>217 Md. 494, 144 A. 2d 73 (1958); <em>Zurich Insurance Co. v. Continental Casualty Co., </em>239 Md. 421, 212 A. 2d 96 (1964). This approach recognizes that the rights and liabilities of the different insurers involved should depend, as far as possible, upon the specific language of the policies. The relative liabilities of the insurers are contingent, in each case, upon the characterization of the \u2018other insurance\u2019 provisions as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>escape clauses, excess clauses or pro-rata clauses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aet\"><em>Id. </em>at 396.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">As we entered the \u201cSoaring Sixties\u201d Schapiro and Whitehouse, Inc. (Schapiro), owned three open flatbed trailers, two tractors, and one \u201cregular heavy duty truck\u201d all of which were used exclusively in the conduct of its rag business. The vehicles were insured by a policy issued by Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Company (Aetna) which provided, among other things, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-7\">\u201cI. COVERAGE A \u2014 BODILY INJURY LIABILITY-AUTOMOBILE :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-8\">To pay oil behalf of the Insured all sums which the Insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury, sickness or disease, including death at any time resulting therefrom, sustained by any person, caused by accident and arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of any automobile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-9\">\u201cCOVERAGE B \u2014 PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY\u2014AUTOMOBILE:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-10\">To pay on behalf of the Insured all sums which the Insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of injury to or destruction of property, including the loss of use thereof, caused by accident and arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of any automobile.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-11\">\u2756 \u2756 \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-12\">\u201cThe unqualified word \u2018Insured\u2019 includes the named Insured and also includes (1) * * * and (2) under Coverages A and B, any person while using an owned automobile or a hired automobile and any person or organization legally responsible for the use thereof, provided the actual use of the automobile is by the named Insured or with his permission, * * *. The insurance with respect to any person or organization other than the named Insured does not apply under division (2) of this insuring agreement:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>(a) with respect to an automobile while used with any trailer owned or hired by the Insured and not covered by like insurance in the Company; or with respect to a trailer while used with any automobile owned or hired by the Insured and not covered by like insurance in the Company;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-4\">(d) with respect to any hired automobile, to the owner, or a lessee thereof other than the named Insured, or to any agent or employee of such owner or lessee;\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Having decided in 1961 that it was better to rent tractors than to own them, Schapiro sold the two tractors and the truck. In April of that year it rented a tractor from Ryder Truck Rental, Inc. (Ryder). Ryder agreed to \u201csupply $100,000 property damage, $250,000/$500,000 public liability, fire, theft, comprehensive, and $100 deductible collision insurance.\u201d Compliance with its obligation in this regard was accomplished by a comprehensive liability policy issued by Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (Liberty), the pertinent provisions of which were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">\u201cIt is agreed that such insurance as is afforded by the policy for bodily injury liability under Coverage A and for property damage liability under Coverage B applies to any one or more persons or organizations, leasing an automobile from any named insured listed in the schedule below, subject to the following provisions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-7\">4. The insurance afforded to such lessee applies only to the maintenance or use of (1) the automobile so leased and (2) trailers owned by the lessee or for which he is legally liable, but only while any such trailer is attached to the leased automobile referred to in part (1) of this subparagraph.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>5. If the subject of any such leasing agreement is a trailer, no insurance is afforded any lessee while such trailer remains attached to any automobile for which there is no insurance under this endorsement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Both Aetna\u2019s policy and Liberty\u2019s policy contained the following provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-6\">\u201c(b) Automobile. Except where stated to the contrary, the word \u2018automobile\u2019 means a land motor vehicle or trailer as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">(1) Owned Automobile \u2014 an automobile owned by the named Insured;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-8\">(2) Hired Automobile\u2014an automobile used under contract in behalf of, or loaned to, the named Insured provided such automobile is not owned by or registered in the name of (a) the named Insured or (b) an executive officer thereof or (c) an employee or agent of the named Insured who is granted an operating allowance of any sort for the use of such automobile ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-9\">(3) Non-Owned Automobile\u2014any other automobile.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-10\">\u201cOther Insurance\u2014If the Insured has other insurance against a loss covered by this policy the Company shall not be liable under this policy for a greater proportion of such loss than the applicable limit of liability stated in the declaration bears to the total applicable limit of liability of all valid and collectible insurance against such loss; provided, however, the insurance under this policy with respect to loss arising out of the maintenance or use of any hired automobile insured on a \u2018cost of hire\u2019 basis or the use of any non-owned automobile shall be excess insurance over any other valid and collectible insurance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>On 11 May 1961 Wilbert Lee Cameron (Cameron), an employee of Schapiro, was driving the Ryder tractor, to which was attached one of Schapiro\u2019s trailers, north on the Reisterstown Road, in Baltimore County. Near Mount Wilson Lane the tractor-trailer combination collided with a Baltimore Transit Company bus. Several passengers, including Hazel Boulware, were injured and, of course, the bus was damaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Ryder and Liberty refused to protect and defend Schapiro and Cameron from the numerous claims filed against them. Aetna thereupon undertook to settle and did settle all of the claims except that of Hazel Boulware who thereafter filed suit in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. The trial of her case in the fall of 1963 resulted in a judgment of $10,610 against Schapiro alone and judgments in favor of Ryder and Cameron for costs. Aetna expended $27,576.13, including the payment of the Boulware judgment, in settling all of the claims arising out of the collision. It is agreed that this amount, which also includes counsel fees, is fair and reasonable. It appears to be conceded, also, that the proximate cause of the accident was Schapiro\u2019s negligence in the maintenance of the brakes on its trailer and that both Ryder and Cameron were free of any negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">In May 1964 Aetna sued Liberty to recover the $27,-576.13. Schapiro is a nominal plaintiff; Ryder is a nominal defendant. For reasons unknown to us the case was not tried until September 1969. In a long and comprehensive opinion the trial judge, O\u2019Donnell, J., concluded that Liberty must pay Aetna $27,576.13. Judgment in that amount was made absolute on 10 February 1970. Liberty\u2019s appeal to this Court was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The parties concede, as Judge O\u2019Donnell found, that Schapiro was covered by Aetna\u2019s policy even though its trailer was attached to Ryder\u2019s tractor and that Schapiro was covered by Liberty\u2019s policy also despite the fact that the hired tractor was coupled to the trailer insured by Aetna. Although without significance here there is a further concession that, absent Aetna\u2019s coverage of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>trailer, the clause in the Liberty policy, quoted above, would have provided Schapiro with coverage against the losses resulting from the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">The problem in the case at bar arises out of the pervasive nature of the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses which, if effective, would make each insurer liable for excess coverage only.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It will be noted that each clause has two parts. The first, up to the semicolon, is the standard pro rata provision; the second, the proviso segment, provides for excess coverage under certain conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Aetna contends that since Liberty is providing \u201cother insurance\u201d the (other insurance) clause in its policy becomes operative. Moreover, it argues, since the loss arose \u201cout of the use of a hired automobile\u201d (the tractor), the proviso segment comes into effect. Under the terms of its policy, then, says Aetna, it is an excess insurer only. Aetna admits, of course, that on its face its policy is \u201cother insurance\u201d in respect of the Liberty policy, thus making the Liberty \u201cother insurance\u201d clause potentially effective. But, argues Aetna, while the accident <em>may </em>be said to have arisen out of the <em>maintenance </em>of the trailer, it did not arise out of the <em>use </em>of the trailer, but rather out of the use of the tractor; since the tractor is not a \u201cnon-owned automobile\u201d nor is the trailer a \u201chired automobile\u201d under the Liberty policy, the accident did not \u201carise out of the maintenance of a hired automobile\u201d nor out of the \u201cuse of a non-owned automobile.\u201d The net effect, says Aetna, is that the excess clause in the Liberty policy is inoperative, leaving Liberty only the pro rata segment of its \u201cother insurance\u201d clause. Finally, Aetna argues, and with this we agree, when a pro rata clause clashes with an excess clause, the excess insurance is not \u201cother insurance\u201d as to the other (Liberty) policy and, in these circumstances, its pro rata clause makes it the primary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>insurer up to the limits of its policy. <em>Consolidated Insurance Co. v. Bankers Insurance Co. of Pennsylvania, </em>244 Md. 392 <em>(1966); American Surety Co. of N.Y. v. Canal Insurance Co., </em>258 F. 2d 934 (4th Cir. 1958). The trial court agreed with Aetna\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Liberty argues that Schapiro, as the insured proximately responsible for the accident, must look first to its own insurer (Aetna) for coverage. This, known as the \u201cprime tortfeasor theory,\u201d is not generally accepted, and, in the circumstances, we find it equally unacceptable. Liberty argues also that the accident did \u201carise out of the use\u201d of the trailer, which it insists was a non-owned automobile under its policy. And so, concludes Liberty, its \u201cother insurance\u201d clause, especially the excess provision, is fully operative.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Judge O\u2019Donnell observed, correctly we think, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">\u201c [i] f the accident had arisen out of the use of * * * [the] trailer while not attached to * * * [Ryder\u2019s] tractor then it could be said that the loss arose out of the use of a \u2018non-owned\u2019 automobile.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Then he declared, apparently assuming it to be beyond dispute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-8\">\u201cThe identity of the trailer as a single \u2018non-owned automobile\u2019 disappeared during the time it was attached to and indeed was operated in conjunction with the leased tractor\u2014an \u2018owned automobile\u2019 of Ryder <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">Thus he was able to conclude:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-10\">\u201cSince the accident arose out of the use of the hired tractor of Ryder Truck Rental and arose out of the use of the tractor-trailer unit, the coverage under the \u2018other insurance\u2019 provision in Aetna\u2019s policy must be considered excess insurance over any other valid and collectible insurance. Since the loss did not arise out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>of the use of any \u2018hired automobile\u2019 or the use of any \u2018non-owned automobile\u2019 (the tractor-trailer unit) the coverage under Liberty\u2019s policy must be considered primary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">We do not agree with Judge O\u2019Donnell that the identity of the trailer \u201cdisappeared\u201d during the time it was attached to the tractor. Both policies define \u201cowned automobile\u201d (which includes \u201ctrailer\u201d) as \u201can automobile owned by the named insured.\u201d Code (1957), Art. 66%, \u00a7 2 (a) (32), defined owner as \u201cany person, firm or corporation owning a vehicle or having the exclusive use thereof, under contract of purchase, lease, hiring or rental thereof, or otherwise.\u201d Under this definition, while Schapiro may be said to have \u201cowned\u201d the tractor, Rydier surely did not \u201cown\u201d the trailer. It had no proprietary interest in it. Code (1957), Art. 66%, \u00a7 23, required trailers to be separately licensed and they were separately taxed. The tractor and trailer did not always operate as a unit and they were registered in the names of completely different parties. It seems entirely clear that Schapiro \u201cowned\u201d the trailer; indeed Judge O\u2019Donnell agrees. But we see no basis for saying that Schapiro\u2019s property suddenly became Ryder\u2019s property simply because, as it moved over the highway, it was hitched to Ryder\u2019s tractor. Neither do we see any basis for saying that \u201cthe tractor-trailer unit\u201d was an automobile \u201cowned\u201d by Ryder. One might say that a <em>part </em>of it was owned by Ryder or that \u201cin a sense,\u201d or in a different context, ownership of the trailer would have to be attributed to Ryder, but in the circumstances of the case at bar it is not owned by Ryder and under the terms of Liberty\u2019s policy it must be a \u201cnon-owned\u201d automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Judge O\u2019Donnell in his opinion devoted considerable lineage to the notion that the accident arose out of the use of the tractor. He said, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">\u201cThe term \u2018use\u2019 is broader than the term \u2018operation.\u2019 Causal connection of the \u2018use\u2019 is not always essential * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>\u201cThe words \u2018arising out of\u2019 when used in such a provision in a policy are of broader significance than the words \u2018caused by\u2019 and are ordinarily understood to mean originating from, incident to, or having connection with the use of the vehicle. See Appleman, op. cit., Vol. 7, \u00a7 4317, citing <em>Red Ball Motor Freight v. Employers\u2019 Mut. Liability Ins. Co. of Wis., </em>189 Fed. 2d 374 (1951) (C.C.A., Tex.). Notwithstanding the finding that the negligent maintenance of the trailer\u2019s brakes was the cause of the resultant injuries and damages, the accident arose out of the \u2018use\u2019 of the White tractor while coupled with the trailer. The \u2018cause\u2019 of the accident is not determinative in fixing coverage since the accident and resultant loss arose out of the \u2018use\u2019 of the \u2018hired automobile.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">We agree that the accident did arise out of the use of the tractor but our doing so surely does not compel us to forget about the trailer and in this regard we find inappropriate the judicial prestidigitation Judge O\u2019Donnell employed to make the trailer disappear into the tractor. We cannot close our eyes to the simple and inescapable fact that the accident arose out of the use of <em>both </em>the tractor and Schapiro\u2019s negligently maintained trailer nor can we think of any reason why the one must exclude the other. We hold, therefore, in respect of Liberty\u2019s policy, that the accident arose \u201cout of the use of a non-owned automobile.\u201d The immediate result of our holding, of course, is to make Liberty\u2019s excess clause fully operative. Since Aetna\u2019s excess clause is also operative a question is presented which, until now, we seem never to have considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">We have not found any case presenting a genuine, clear-cut conflict of excess clauses, in which the court did not require some kind of proration of the loss between the insurers involved.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Since we too think Liberty and Aetna <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>should share the loss we must now determine the amount each should pay. We find the New Jersey court\u2019s approach to a similar problem to be most persuasive and singularly applicable to the instant case. We shall follow it and require the loss to be shared equally. In <em>Cosmopolitan Mutual Ins. Co. v. Continental Casualty Co., </em>28 N. J. 554, 147 A. 2d 529, 69 A.L.R.2d 1115 (1959), that court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-4\">\u201cHaving concluded that the plaintiff and the defendant should share in the amount of the settlement and expenses, the remaining question is what portion of that total each must bear. Continental argues that the parties should pro-rate their liability on the basis of the limits of liability of each policy. Neither policy expressly provides for this type of pro-rating where a hired or non-owned vehicle is involved. Cosmopolitan\u2019s policy provides for prorating in other circumstances. Continental\u2019s policy has no such provision in any case. It is commonly known that the cost of liability insurance does not increase proportionately with the policy limits. The cost of increased limits is relatively small when compared to the cost of minimum coverage. The manner of contribution urged by Continental has recently been rejected. Insurance Co. of Texas v. Employers Liability Assur. Corp. 163 F. Supp. 143 (D.C.S.D. Cal. 1958). In that case the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>pro-rated liability according to the premiums paid the respective companies. Although this latter test initially commends itself, upon reflection it appears that unless the insureds are in identical circumstances, there are too many variables affecting the premiums to permit them to form an adequate basis for an equitable adjustment, -e.g., fleet insurance. We therefore conclude that as both companies stand on an equal footing equity requires an equal apportionment of the amount of the settlement and expenses. The judgment will accordingly be modified so as to require Continental to pay one-half of the settlement and expenses.\u201d 147 A. 2d at 534.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-5\"><em>See also Ruan Transport Corp. v.

Since excess insurance provisions are mutually repugnant and as against each other are impossible of accomplishment, it has been argued that in such a situation neither insurer ought to be held liable, but since the acceptance of such a notion would leave the insured without coverage, no court seems to have been persuaded by the argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b384-7\">. Some courts have applied mechanical tests which prefer the specific over the general insurer, the tortfeasor over the innocent party, the owner over the lessee, and the prior over the later in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>surer. <em>See Cosmopolitan Mutual Ins. Co. v. Continental Cas. Co., </em>28 N. J. 554, 147 A. 2d 529, 69 A.L.R.2d 1115 (1959) and cases cited therein; 38 Minn. L. Rev. 838 (1954). A brief review of cases representing these views leads us to conclude that few if any involve the true excess-excess conflict facing us. Aetna argues that this case falls within the rule that as between an owner of an automobile insured with an omnibus clause and driver, whose policy covers the use of non-owned vehicles, the owner\u2019s insurer must pay when his insurance has an \u201cother insurance\u201d clause and the driver\u2019s insurance is \u201cexcess only\u201d with respect to non-owned vehicles. The cases and the writers support such a rule. <em>American Surety Co. of N.Y. v. Canal Ins. Co., </em>258 F. 2d 934 (4th Cir. 1958); <em>General Ins. Co. of America v. Western Fire &amp; Casualty Co., </em>241 F. 2d 289 (5th Cir. 1957); 8 Appleman, <em>Insurance Law &amp; Practice, </em>\u00a7 4914 at 400. But the instant case does not involve the clear cut owner-non-owner distinction. It involves policies where two \u201cnon-owner\u201d excess clauses are in direct conflict and the above rule has no application.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b386-7\">. We are well aware of the fact that of the jurisdictions which have faced similar problems the majority have prorated the loss according to the limits of the respective policies. We have rejected that view because we think the minority view, as expressed in <em>Cosmopolitan Mutual Ins. Co. v. Continental Casualty Co., </em>28 N. J. 554, 147 A. 2d 529, 69 A.L.R.2d 1115 (1959), and in the other cases we have cited, represents better reasoning. We agree with the New Jersey court that, while the policies compel proration according to policy limits in some \u201cother insurance\u201d situations, there is no such compulsion when the loss arises from the use of \u201chired\u201d or \u201cnon-owned\u201d automobiles. That the operative excess clauses are mutually repugnant does not obliterate the fact that the conditions which brought those clauses into play still exist. We think additional support for our alignment with the minority view is provided by <em>Ruan Transport Corp. v. Truck Rentals, Inc., </em>278 F. Supp. 692 (D. Col. 1968), in which the court held that an even split is the more equitable approach. We do not think the_ relationship between an insurer\u2019s total potential liability and his obligation to pay a given loss (for which he would have been fully liable but for the existence of the other insurer) is especially relevant, let alone sacrosanct, as some courts seem to believe. We prefer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>join the growing number of courts which \u201crecognize that the minority approach is more equitable and reasonable.\u201d <em>Ruan, supra </em>at 696. <em>See also State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Travelers Indem. Co., </em>301 F. Supp. 1131 (D. Col. 1969); <em>Continental Casualty Co. v. Travelers Ins. Co., </em>84 Ill. App. 200, 228 N.E.2d 141, 145 (1967); <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Union Ins., </em>181 Neb. 253, 147 N.W.2d 760 (1967). <em>Cf., Employers Mutual Casualty Co. v. MFA Mutual Ins.

Co., </em>9 Ohio Misc. 71, 221 N.E.2d 607, 615 (1965), all of which seem to recognize the equity of the minority view but were compelled for various reasons to apply the majority view.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
