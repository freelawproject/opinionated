We conclude that the Board has no interest or right that would give it standing to ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>peal. The statute which creates it gives it none. The case is indistinguishable from <em>Zoning Appeals Board v. McKinney, </em>174 Md. 551, 564, where it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">\u201cSince therefore the Board [of Zoning Appeals] * * * has no interest in [the appeal] different from that which any judicial or <em>quasi </em>judicial agency would have, which is to decide the cases coming before it fairly and impartially, [it] is in no sense aggrieved by the decision of the Baltimore City Court [overruling its decision] .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">See also <em>Mayor &amp; C.
