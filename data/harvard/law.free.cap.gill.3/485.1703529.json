And at the same time, the said <em>Peter Dickinson </em>produced to me the promissory notes and open account, on and by which the said <em>William Barnes </em>is so indebted; which is hereto annexed.

Latrobe for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-14\">This case presents a question of considerable interest, which is of almost daily occurrence in the State, and which it is important to have settled.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b494-15\">The plaintiffs residing in <em>Baltimore, </em>being creditors of the defendant, an absconding debtor, sent their account, with the affidavit required by the act of 1795, made before a justice of the peace of the city of <em>Baltimore </em>to <em>Westminster, </em>the late <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>domicil of die defendant, where application was made to a justice of the peace of <em>Carroll </em>county, for an attachment against the goods, &amp;c., of the defendant. The attachment was issued, and returned levied as per schedule.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-5\">The defendant then, by his counsel, moved to quash the attachment on the following grounds:</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-6\">1st. That the affidavit on which said attachment was issued is not taken before a justice of the peace, as is required in the act of Assembly in such cases made and provided.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-7\">2d. That the warrant to the clerk to issue said attachment, is not signed by the same justice of the peace, before whom said affidavit was made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-8\">3d. That said attachment, and the proceedings therein, are in many other respects informal and insufficient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-9\">The court having granted the motion to quash, the present appeal was taken.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-10\">The true question in the case is, whether the justice issuing the warrant, must be the justice before whom the affidavit is made?</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-11\">Here the affidavit was made by the creditor residing in <em>Baltimore, </em>before a justice of that city, and the warrant was issued thereupon by a justice of <em>Carroll </em>county, that county being the late domicil of the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-12\">The appellants\u2019 counsel insist, that this was the proper course to be pursued, and rely on the language of the act of Assembly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-13\">The appellee\u2019s counsel insists, on the other hand, that the affidavit should have been made before the same person by whom the warrant was issued: and that this not having been done, the attachment was properly quashed; and the appellee\u2019s counsel also relies on the act of Assembly to sustain his view.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-14\">The whole question, then, arises on the proper construction of the act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b495-15\">The act, section 1, declares, that \u201cthe creditor may make application to any judge of the general court, justice of the county court, or justice of the peace; and on oath or affirmation of such creditor made before any judge of the general court, justice of the county court, or justice of the peace of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>this State, or before' any judge of any other of the <em>United States,\u201d </em>(of the facts enumerated in this part of the section,) the said judge of the general court, justice of the county court, or justice of the peace, may issue his warrant, &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-5\">Now the real question is, to what do the words of reference, \u201c the said,\u201d refer? Do they refer to the judge, to whom the application was made, or the judge, &amp;c., before whom the affidavit was made? The appellants contend that they refer to the former. This it is thought, can easily be made plain.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-6\">Suppose that an account, proved before a judge <em>o\u00ed Louisiana, </em>was presented to a justice of <em>Carroll </em>county, and application made to him for a warrant for attachment thereon, could there be any question about his obligation to grant the warrant? Certainly not: because an affidavit before any judge of any other of the <em>United States, </em>is made sufficient by the express terms of the act. Applied to such a case, the act would be read, \u201cthe creditor may make application to a justice of the peace, and on oath or affirmation of such creditor, made before any judge of any other of the <em>United States, </em>the said justice of the peace may issue a warrant, &amp;c.\u201d There can be no doubt about this.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b496-7\">We see then, that the act does not provide, in the case of a foreign creditor, that he shall come to <em>Maryland, </em>and make oath of his claim before the justice to whom he applies for a warrant on attachment. He may make his affidavit before a judge, in his own State, and send it to <em>Maryland. </em>Why then should a creditor residing in <em>Baltimore </em>county, not be permitted to make his affidavit before a justice in <em>Baltimore </em>county, and send it to the <em>Carroll </em>county justice, as the foundation for the warrant.? Why should the foreign creditor have more favor than the domestic? Why should the foreign judge have more authenticity than the domestic? Why should a creditor living in <em>York, Pennsylvania, </em>be authorized to send an affidavit across the line to a justice of <em>Harford </em>county, and obtain a warrant for attachment, while a creditor in <em>Dorchester </em>county must, in person, go to <em>Harford </em>county to make affidavit of the truth of his account before the <em>Harford </em>justice? No reason whatever can be given for these distinctions: and yet, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>if the appellee is right, they exist in the law. But they do not exist in terms. They are the result of a construction, which we contend is erroneous. The error consists in making the words of reference, \u201cthe said,\u201d already mentioned, refer to the justice before whom the affidavit is made, instead of the justice to whom the application is made. In the act there is nothing to shew, that these are the same persons. The usual words of reference are not to be found. The language used is not, \u201cand on oath, &amp;c., before the said or the same judge,\u201d &amp;e., but, \u201cand on oath, &amp;c., before any judge,\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-5\">The section is made to appear involved, by the insertion of a description of the oath, which separates, <em>longo intervallo, </em>the relative from the antecedent. A careful reading of it, however, will shew, that the construction contended for by the appellants is the only one that can be properly given to it: and that it is not at all necessary that the affidavit should be made before the same justice, who is applied to for the warrant for the attachment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-6\">The third ground for the motion to quash, taken by the appellee in the court below, is too vague for consideration here. Only those questions made below, and inserted in the record, are proper for the consideration of this court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-7\">In the argument of the appellee\u2019s counsel, an objection is taken to the proceedings below, and it is alleged, that they are defective, because the averment, that <em>William Barnes, </em>late of the city of <em>Baltimore, </em>is justly, &amp;c., indebted, is not a sufficient averment that he is a citizen of <em>Maryland, </em>as required by the act of Assembly. Now, although this is a question not properly before the court, yet it may be stated, that the necessity of sueh averment was expressly done away with by the act of 1825, chap. 114, sect. 1.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-8\">For these reasons the counsels of the appellants insist, that the decision of the court below should be reversed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b497-9\">By W. P. Maulsr?y for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b497-10\">In this case, the affidavit of the creditors was made before a justice of the peace of the city of <em>Baltimore, </em>and transmitted to a justice in <em>Carroll </em>county, who issued his warrant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>clerk of <em>Carroll </em>county court, directing him to issue the attachment. The affidavit was made before one justice of the peace, and the warrant to the clerk, was issued by another. The act of 1795, chap. 56, sec. 1, provides, that on the oath or affirmation of a creditor, made before any judge of the general court, justice of the county court, or justice of the peace of this State, that the debtor is indebted, &amp;c., the said justice of the general court, justice of the county court, or justice of the peace, shall be authorised to issue his warrant to the clerk of the general or county court, directing him to issue the attachment. The language of the act is imperative. The same justice before whom the affidavit is made, and no other, is authorised to issue his warrant. Whatever the practice may have been, or whatever inconvenience may result from the necessity of an observance of the terms of the act of Assembly, those teims are so unequivocal j the language of the act is so clear and positive, that it cannot, I submit, be forced to yield, either to practice or convenience. The oath or affirmation may be made before any judge or justice of tire peace, and the said judge or justice of the peace, is authorised to issue his warrant to the clerk. In this case, the affidavit was made before <em>Mr. </em>Peale, a justice of the peace of the city of <em>Baltimore; </em>and the warrant to the clerk of <em>Carroll </em>county court, was issued by <em>Mr. Gore, </em>a justice of the peace for <em>Carroll </em>county. The act of 1795, is of that class of statutes which are to be strictly construed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b498-5\">The affidavit of the creditor in this case, made before a justice of the peace in the city of <em>Baltimore, </em>omits \u00abwholly the statement or allegation, that <em>Barnes, </em>the defendant, is a citizen of the State of <em>Maryland; </em>no such averment, that the defendant is a resident of the State, is made in any of the proceedings preparatory to issuing the attachment. The averment in the affidavit, that <em>William Bames, </em>late of the city of <em>Baltimore, </em>is justly and <em>bona fide </em>indebted, &amp;c., is not a sufficient averment, that the said <em>Barnes </em>is a citizen of the State of <em>Maryland, </em>to satisfy the requirement of the act of <em>Assembly. </em>For this cause, the attachment was properly quashed by the county court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>The warrant issued by <em>Mr. Gore, </em>the justice of the peace for <em>Carroll </em>county, to the clerk, directing the issuing of the attachment, does not contain a sufficiently distinct recital of the oath on which he granted the warrant. Even if he had proceeded to issue the warrant to the clerk, on the oath of the plaintiff, made before a justice of the peace of the city of <em>Baltimore, </em>he must, in his warrant, have distinctly recited the oath so made, by whom, before whom, &amp;c., and it is not sufficient to refer to that oath in the terms of, \u201cthe above oath;\u201d such a reference is too uncertain.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b499-5\">Magruder, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Amr\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">It is no reason for quashing an attachment, issued under the act of 1795, chap. 56, that the oath to be made by the creditor, was made before one justice of the peace, (of a different county;) and that another issued his warrant to the clerk of the county court, requiring him to issue the attachment. The oath may be made before \u201ca judge of any other of the <em>United </em>States,\u201d and in the case of <em>Smith against Greenleaf, 4 Harr. McHenry, </em>291, was made before a judge of one of the courts in <em>Massachusetts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">The act of Assembly is quite explicit. The creditor is to make application to \u201cany judge of the general court, justice of the county court, or justice of the peace;\u201d and when made to him, \u201cthe said judge of the general court, justice of the county court, or justice of the peace,\u201d is to issue his warrant. An affidavit is tobe produced to him, with the cause of action;\u2014 that affidavit, however, the law does not require to be made, before the judge or justice who issues the warrant, but before \u201cany judge of the general court, justice of the county court, or justice of the peace of this State;\u201d\u2014it is added : \u201cor before any judge of any other of the <em>United </em>States,\u201d\u2014who, of course, is not to issue the warrant for an attachment. The justice of the peace who issues the warrant, must be of the county in which the attachment is to be issued; the oath may be made before any \u201cjustice of the peace of this State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">If, therefore, the court in deciding this case, were confined to the reasons to be found in the record, this judgment would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>be reversed. It has been decided here, that in the case of a motion in arrest of judgment, the party appellant may, in this court, assign other grounds, than those which are to be found in the record; and for the same reason it seems proper, not to confine him, in cases of this description, to reasons filed with the motion to quash the proceedings. See, also, <em>Boarman vs. Israel and </em>Patterson, 1 <em>Gill, </em>372.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">This court thinks, that there is in the record a fatal objection to the proceeding by attachment, inasmuch as it does not appear, as the law requires, that the debtor was a citizen of the State. It is certainly not to be sustained, as an attachment against a non-resident, and it does not appear that he was a citizen of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
