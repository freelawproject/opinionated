The plaintiff to support the issue on his part, offered in evidence the following depositions, viz:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-6\">1. That of <em>George Moore, </em>taken for the plaintiff under the act of 1828, who deposed, that he had knowledge of the fishing shore called <em>Possum Nose, </em>rented by <em>Andrew Musgrave </em>from <em>Thomas James Bullitt; </em>that he docs not know whether there were any improvements on said fishery before said <em>M. </em>went there, and does not know what improvements said <em>M. </em>put thereon; that witness came on from home, which is at <em>Havre de Grace, </em>having work to do on the <em>Potomac, </em>some time in October or November 1841; that at that time witness and <em>Sell-man, </em>and <em>Crook </em>were in partnership, which ivas not then dissolved, and they then had it in contemplation to rent the <em>Possum Nose </em>fishery. Witness asked <em>Mr. Sellman </em>whether he had executed a lease with <em>Mr. Bullitt, </em>the defendant, or not, he stated that he had not; that he had seen the lease of old <em>Mr. B. </em>to <em>A. M., </em>which gave <em>M. </em>the power to remove all the buildings and improvements put on said fishery by said <em>M., </em>and as witness was going on, he authorised the witness to say to <em>Mr. B., </em>the defendant, unless he, said <em>B., </em>would purchase the improvement, or suffer them, (the witness and <em>Sellman, </em>and <em>Crook,) </em>to purchase them and retain out of die rent, they would have nothing to do with the shore. On the 9th of December then next following, as witness thinks, or thereabouts, it was however on the day the arbitration took place, witness called at <em>Mrs. Murdochs, </em>at <em>Dumfries, </em>where <em>Mr. B., </em>the defendant, was at the time, and repeated to <em>Mr. B. </em>the said conversation which had taken place between the witness and <em>Sellman. Mr. B. </em>stated that he had sued <em>M. </em>for a trespass, and that said <em>M. </em>owed him some rent, consequently they did not speak; that he, said <em>B., </em>authorised the witness to go and buy the property of <em>M., </em>put up by said <em>M. </em>on the <em>Possum Nose, </em>as low as witness could, and in case witness and <em>M. </em>could not agree, to leave it to two men, and if they could not agree, to call in a third person, as to the price, and that whatever they agreed, he, said <em>B., </em>would pay it; but, said he, recollect that whenever my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>claim for damages, and I expect to recover a good deal, and rent is settled, whatever remains I will pay it. Witness went down on the shore the same morning and saw <em>Mr. M. </em>and stated distinctly to <em>M. </em>the conversation which witness had had with <em>B. Mr. M. </em>said, \u201cI am perfectly satisfied to leave it to men, but I have done him no damage; I owe him some rent, which I have been always ready to pay him, but he distrained on my property before it was due. \u2019 \u2019 Witness and ilfr. <em>M. </em>went down to the fishery, and <em>Mr. M. </em>asked $1500 for the improvements, and witness offered him $500. Witness then told <em>M. </em>that it was impossible for them to agree, and that he supposed they would have to leave it to men, and <em>M. </em>said that he was perfectly satisfied to do so; -witness said that he was a stranger, and unacquainted with the men there, and wished to have a competent man on his side; that-witness would like to have witness\u2019 partner at the fishery above, being the <em>Marsh </em>fishery, <em>Zabul\u00f3n A. </em>Kanky, as one of the referees, but that he, said <em>M., </em>might object to said <em>Kanky </em>on that ground, that he was witness\u2019 partner. Said <em>M. </em>stated that he considered <em>Mr. K. </em>a gentleman, and that he had no objections to him, and that he, said <em>M., </em>would choose <em>Mr. Annass. </em>Witness and <em>M. </em>then both agreed, if the referees should not agree, to call in a third person, and whatever their decision might be, to abide by it. The referees, <em>Kanky </em>and <em>Anness, </em>did not agree, and they called in <em>Cockerill, </em>and the paper herewith filed and marked \u201cExhibit A,'\u201d is the arbitration which the said three- referees <em>K. A. </em>and <em>C. </em>signed; that the said paper marked Exhibit A,was prepared under the authority of <em>Mr. B, </em>the defendant, and unless it had been prepared, witness and <em>Bellman Crook </em>would not have rented said <em>P N. </em>fishery. <em>Bellman Crook, </em>witness being a silent partner with them, rented at the annual rent of $850, the <em>P. N. </em>fishery, <em>Btony Point </em>fishery and <em>Timber Branch </em>fishery, but only worked the <em>P. N. </em>fishery.Witness considers the rent very reasonable with the improvements, but would not have the <em>Possum Nose </em>fishery for one year for nothing, if the improvements mentioned in the arbitration had not been there. The other two fisheries, <em>Btony Point </em>and <em>Timber Branch, </em>witness considers as worth nothing in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>case-. After the conversation between <em>M. </em>and witness, <em>M. </em>took witness over the improvements on P. <em>N. </em>fishery, and put witness into possession, and said to him, \u201cmind, this is your property, I deliver it all over to you, and if it brans down, it is at your risk. \u2019 \u2019 Witness considered, that in receiving this property from <em>Mr. M., </em>he took charge of it under the authority he derived from <em>Mr. B. </em>That he purchased the said improvements for <em>Mr. B., </em>and not for <em>S. C. </em>and himself; that witness signed the agreement endorsed on Exhibit A, and that in signing said agreement as <em>George Moar\u00e9 </em>Company, he considered himself as acting as the agent of <em>Mr. </em>B., the defendant; that witness, when he went down to P. <em>N. </em>fishery, offered <em>Mr. M. </em>$500 for the improvements, but, on account of the snow, was unable to ascertain their extent and value; that afterwards, when he came to know them fully, he considered the value put on them by the arbitrators as low enough. <em>Mr. B. </em>was on the ground on the day of tire arbitration, but witness does not know whether he talked to the arbitrators, or went over the buildings and improvements. That witness has heard the deposition of <em>Nicholas Suter </em>in this cause, and that all the improvements mentioned in said deposition, by said <em>Nicholas Suter, </em>existed when witness went to <em>Possum Nose </em>fishery, and the other places, as he has above mentioned; that a high freshet in 1842, carried away sixty feet of the shed at <em>Possum Nose, </em>which witness saw there when <em>Settman Sp Grook </em>took possession of the shore, and which, in consequence, <em>Mr. Suter </em>could not have seen; that witness collected as many of the boards of the said sixt}^ feet of shed as he could find, and put them away; that two of the houses are covered with shingles, with the exception of about three feet on one end of one of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-5\">2. <em>Nicholas Suter, </em>a witness for the plaintiff, also, proved various repairs and improvements put up on the <em>Possum Nose </em>fishery from 1835 to 1843, necessary to a fishery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-6\">3. <em>John Rogers, </em>also a witness for the plaintiff, gave evidence of his improvements; and that in 1839, ihe buildings and improvements on <em>Possum Nose </em>fishery were complete, and the best on the river for a rented shore. Witness has followed the fishing business nearly twenty-four years, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>improvements, in his opinion, would be worth full two years rent of the unimproved property. During the space between 1836 and 1839, the whole character and condition of the shore aforesaid, was m\u00fcch' improved by <em>Mr. Musgrave, </em>so as to increase its value as a fishing property. While witness was there, he did not observe any wood-cutting going on; did not see any wood carried off. A field or two near the shore was enclosed with pine poles, barely enough for a fence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-5\">4. <em>Henry Moore, </em>a witness for plaintiff, also proved similar facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-6\">5. <em>Thomas M. Davidson </em>also proved, that he never had any conversation with <em>Mr. Bullitt </em>relating to said shore, but was present at a conversation between said <em>Bullitt, </em>the defendant, and said <em>Musgrave, </em>the plaintiff, about the paying for the improvements on said shore. It was about one year ago, either in last February or last March. Witness and <em>Mr. Musgrave </em>were going down <em>Pratt </em>street together, and they stopped into <em>Mr. Butts' </em>hotel; they went in, and <em>Mr. Bt\u00edllitt </em>was sitting there behind the stove, <em>Mr. Musgrave </em>went up to him and slapped him on the shoulder, and asked him how he was. Some little conversation took place between them, and at last <em>Mr. Musgrave </em>said to him, \u201cI think it very hard <em>Mr. Bullitt, </em>that I cannot get paid for my property. \u2019 * <em>Mr. Bullitt </em>replied, that their lease would expire in about two years; he then began to talk about Mr. <em>George Moore's </em>fishing the place, and the character of the place. <em>Mr. Musgrave </em>said again, that he thought it very hard that he could not get paid for his property, and Mr. <em>Bullitt </em>said, \u201cyou must and shall be paid for your property,\u201d and told <em>Mr. Musgrave </em>that his property was still there. The conversation all this time was concerning the said fishery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-7\">The exhibit marked A, referred to in the aforegoing depositions, is as follows, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-8\">Report of Mr. Wm.

Moore &amp; Co.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-10\"><em>John P. </em>Phillips, for the defendant, testified, that he was counsel for <em>Alexander C. Bullitt </em>in two cases of attachment or distress for rent, in the county court of <em>Prince William, </em>against <em>Andrew Musgrave, </em>and was also counsel for said <em>BtdliU </em>in three actions of covenant in the circuit superior court of law and chancery of <em>Prince William </em>county, and in an action on the case in the same court; all of the said cases were in the name of said <em>Bullitt, </em>in his own right, or as administrator of the late <em>Thomas J. Bullitt, </em>of Maryland, and involved questions under two leases, made by the said <em>Thomas J. Bullitt, </em>in <em>his life </em>time, <em>to </em>said <em>Andrew Musgrave, &amp;c. </em>The papers in the said cases in the county and superior court, will shew the objects of each suit, better than I can explain them here. At the May term of the circuit superior court of law and chancery for <em>Prince William </em>county, 1842, <em>Alexander C. Bullitt </em>was in attendance upon that court, and he did authorise me to compromise and settle his differences with said <em>Musgrave, </em>arising under the said leases. 1 did converse with said <em>Musgrave </em>at the time of the term of the court aforesaid, on the subject <em>of his </em>controversies with said <em>Bullitt, </em>with a view to cany out a compromise between them, which 1 understood said <em>Musgrave </em>to be anxious to effect. The terms of the compromise, as T understood it, was, that the said <em>Bullitt </em>should dismiss all his suits against said <em>Musgrave, </em>except one, and lake a judgment on that one against said <em>.Musgrave, </em>for the sum of $452.13, with interest from the first day of May 1842, and the costs of that suit; and that thereupon, all matters of difference between said <em>Bullitt </em>and said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number><em>Musgrave, </em>arising upon said leases, were ended and settled. I certainly considered <em>Mr. Bullitt </em>and <em>Mr. Musgrave </em>as having by that compromise, settled all differences between them arising upon said leases. I do not now recollect that I heard of any other matters between them, except some small accounts for money, rent, &amp;c., which were included in the settlement. I understood the parties as being desirous to settle all their differences, and I have no doubt that was the understanding of both parties at the time. I certainly should not have advised <em>Mr. Bullitt </em>to dismiss his suits against <em>Mr. Musgrave, </em>and leave <em>Musgrave </em>at liberty to set up any claim he might malee against <em>Bullitt. </em>After the compromise was agreed upon, and before judgment was entered up, <em>Musgrave </em>paid to <em>Bullitt </em>the sum of $300 in cash, and the judgment was entered up for the residue of said sum, being $152.13, with interest and costs as aforesaid. In the conversations on the subject of the compromise, the claims of said <em>Musgrave </em>under the lease for the fishery shore, were alluded to; he set up in those conversations, all his claims, as I understood him, under the lease. I recollect the plank, &amp;c., which, under the lease, he was to have a right to remove, were alluded to. I considered, and as already stated, I believe <em>Mr. Musgrave </em>considered the compromise as a full settlement of all his demands against <em>Bullitt, </em>and all <em>Bullitt's </em>demands against him under said lease. I do not know the character of <em>Mr. Musgrave's </em>suit against <em>Mr. Bullitt, </em>and therefore cannot say that I know any thing further, which would be of any service to the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-5\"><em>Joseph S. Farrow </em>also proved, that during the May term of the circuit superior court of law and chanceiy of <em>Prince William </em>county, in 1842, and after <em>Musgrave </em>and <em>Bullitt </em>had compromised their differences, I heard <em>Musgrave </em>say that drey, the said <em>Musgrave </em>and <em>Bullitt, </em>had settled their affairs or business, and that he was glad of it; drat he had to pay several hundred dollars, some three or five hundred dollars, and further said deponent saith not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-6\"><em>Washington S. Norville </em>also proved that he was at the May term of the superior court of <em>Prince William </em>county in 1842, in company with the plaintiff, <em>Musgrave, </em>who desired me to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>endeavor to bring about a compromise of the several suits pending between the plaintiff and defendant, for damages for cutting wood and for rent; die said plaintiff authorized me to propose to die defendant, that if he would dismiss his suits for damages for cutting wood, he, the said defendant, might <em>take </em>judgment for his rent,- and it should end their legal controversies in <em>Virginia,\u2022 </em>and fully discharge all claims and demands of every nature whatever, which the plaintiff had against the defendant under dealings in <em>Virginia. </em>I was not present when any conversation took place between the plaintiff and <em>John P. Philips, </em>nor was I present when the final arrangement was made between the parties as to their differences above referred to. I heard the plaintiff say, on the day of the compromise, fhat he would sue the defendant in Baltimore, and I am under the impression that he' made this declaration before the compromise was made. I never heard the plaintiff say any filing about such a suit afterwards. Acting as a constable of <em>Prince William </em>County, I received an attachment issued by a magistrate of said county, a copy of which, marked A, is hereunto annexed as a part of this answer; under which, on the date of said warrant, I went upon the premises leased by <em>Bullitt </em>to Musgrave, and seized the property mentioned in my return thereon, but did not remove' it;1 it was suffered to remain in the care of <em>Musgrave\u2019\u2019s </em>manager, and three days afterwards was surrendered, upon <em>Musgrave </em>suing out a writ of replevin. I heard <em>Bullitt </em>say he was afraid <em>Musgrave </em>would remove the property before the rent became due, but any declaration as to his intentions against <em>Musgrave, </em>further than to make his rent, I did not hear. I have been on the premises, assisted by a gentleman, <em>Mr. Henry </em>Ohapman, measured the plank claimed by the plaintiff, and find, by calculation, to amount to about, fifteen thousand feet, and do think it worth, at the expiration of the lease, not more than fifty cents per hundred feet; that it is now in rapid* state of decay. At the request of the defendant, I have been-over the land embraced in the lease, to ascertain as near by judgment, the quantity of wood cut from the land; I judge about one thousand cords; was worth at die time to defendant one dollar per cord, standing, it being near the river banks. 1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>think the wood was worth, at that time, one thousand dollars; the fence made by Musgrave, was of poles. I think that a large portion of wood carried away would have made rails; could have been applied to farming purposes. I further state, that at the time I levied warrants of distraint and attachment, the said plaintiff acknowledged that he was indebted to <em>Bullitt </em>after crediting some orders drawn on tire plaintiff, which said <em>Bullitt </em>directed to allow if he paid the remainder of the rent. At the time of the compromise, the only item in dispute was the suit for the trespass on terms of the lease, and damages for breach of covenant. I think the fishing shore occupied by Musgrave, when rented, if it had been put up to the highest bidder, would have rented for $1000 or $1200.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-5\">And also the following leases :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-6\">Memorandum of an agreement made and entered into this 16th August 1836, between <em>Thomas J.

The said <em>Bullitt </em>agrees to let and demise unto the said <em>Musgrave </em>and the said <em>Williams, </em>for and during the term of five years, to commence on the 1st day of January next, a parcel of land, belonging to the said <em>Eullilt, </em>lying and being in <em>Prince William </em>county, in the State of <em>Virginia, </em>in a neck between the river <em>Potomac </em>and <em>Quantico </em>creek, that is to say,the arable and woodland only, contained wdthin the following limits, with the exceptions hereinafter mentioned: Beginning, ifcc.

In case of failure of rail timber, within the lines aforesaid, during the said term, after the discreet consumption thereof, the said <em>Musgrave </em>and <em>Williams </em>are at liberty to procure rail timber for the use of the said farm out of the other woods of the said <em>Bullitt. </em>Signed,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ASq\">The defendant also proved, that <em>M.y </em>between 1S38 and the spring of 1841, cut and sold wood off <em>of </em>said land, to a value amounting from $2000 to $2750; the plaintiff proved that such cutting was known to the agent of <em>T. J. B., </em>in his, <em>B\u2019s </em>life time, and to die defendant, after said Thomas\u2019 death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-6\">The plaintiff then offered in evidence the following depositions, taken under a commission, viz:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-7\">The deposition of <em>John W. Tyler </em>stated, that he knew of several suits between the parties, to wit: Two attachments and four other suits. Two of the latter suits were brought against <em>A. Musgrave </em>and <em>Jno. W. Williams, </em>one by <em>Alex. C. Bullitt, </em>in his own right, and the other as representative of <em>Thos. J. Bullitt; </em>the third was an action to recover $100, claimed to be due the estate of <em>Thos. J. Bullitt, </em>from <em>A. Musgrave, </em>and die fourth was brought by <em>Alex. C. Bullitt, </em>to recover a rent of $500. That he was the attorney of <em>A. Musgrave, </em>in the suits alluded to in his previous answer, and the defence made to one of the attachments was, that die attachment was defective, which was sustained by the court, and the attachment was quashed. The defence to the other rvas, that the amount claimed had been paid, and there was in the progress of the cause a judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>ment in <em>Musgrave\u2019s </em>favor for costs. Deponent says, that he does not recollect particularly the courts at which the attachments were ended. The other suits spoken of wore in the circuit superior court of Jaw and chancery for <em>Prince William, </em>and were settled, as deponent believes, at the May term 1842, of said court, under the following circumstances: During the court, there were some general propositions for compromise, and having- been informed by <em>A. Musgrave </em>that the suits for damages for cutting and carrying away wood, <em>&amp;c., </em>was vexatious and frivolous, and that he had a receipt for the $100 claimed in another suit, and that he owed the rent, subject to some offsetls; there was a proposition made to take judgment given for the rent, if the plaintiff would dismiss the other suits. This proposition ivas not acceded to, and there seemed to be no probability of a compromise. 'When the cases were called in their order on the docket, the judge of the court refused to set in the cases, on the score of his being a relative of the plaintiff, and directed them to be sent to another judicial circuit. After it was ascertained that no judgment could be had for the rent during that term of the court, and that increased trouble and expense would be incurred by the removal of the causes, the proposition for compromise was renewed, and it was finally agreed that judgment was to be given for the rent claimed, subject to offsetts agreed on by the parties, amounting to a small sum, and that the other three cases were to be dismissed; agreed, which was accordingly done. The deponent cannot tell the motives or inducements to the settlement, further than his answer may disclose. The deponent says, that he knows of no agreement, contract or promise, on the part of said <em>Mus-grave, </em>to abandon any action or cause of action in <em>Baltimore, </em>or elsewhere, that he had against said <em>Bullitt, </em>in consideration of <em>Bullitt\u2019s </em>dismissing the suits aforesaid, in <em>Virginia. </em>The deponent says that he was tire attorney of said <em>Mus-grave, </em>and certainly never heard of any terms or conditions as mentioned in the foregoing interrogatories, and thinks that a client would usually mention such matters to his counsel if they existed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>The deponent says, that the copies from the order book of the court, marked A and B, and hereto annexed and certified by the .clerk, shews the terms of the settlement as deponent understood it. The judgment for $152.13, with interest from 1st May 1842, being the balance of rent of $500, after paying down the sum of $300 in money, or thereabouts, and .allowing the offsetts. The deponent saj^s, that <em>A. Musgrave </em>conferred with him both before and after the compromise, as \u25a0 to bringing suits for damages against <em>A. C. </em>Bullitt, and also as to the expediency of suing him in <em>Maryland </em>or in Virginia, and finally .concluded, as a matter of convenience to himself, to bring file suits in <em>Baltimore, Md., </em>and further this deponent saith not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b52-5\">A\u2014Virginia.

M., </em>in die town of <em>Dumfries, </em>touching <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>their differences in <em>Virginia, </em>and endeavored to effect a settlement of the same, but failed. The difficulty seemed to arise out of matters of account, and X heard nothing said about damages for trespass committed by <em>Musgrave. </em>I have lived for the last .six or eight years within four miles of the farm and fishery rented by <em>Mr. Musgrave </em>of <em>Mr. Bullitt, </em>and have had frequent opportunities of observing the manner in which the same was managed, and hesitate not to sa.y that 1 was surprised when I heard that, <em>Mr. Bullitt </em>had instituted proceedings against <em>Mr. Musgrave for </em>damages on account of trespass committed by him. When <em>Mr. Musgrave </em>took the property alluded to, it was of little value comparatively, and when he left, it possessed as much character as any of a similar description in this whole section of country, and in my estimation, this change is ascribable in a great measure, to <em>Mr. Musgrave\u2019s </em>judicious and prudent management. The conversation above alluded lo, took place prior to the middle of May J 842, and subsequent to the valuation of <em>Musgrave\u2019s </em>property on <em>Bullitt\u2019s </em>fishery by <em>Richard Anniss, 2f.

The first has reference to the admissibility of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-12\">The plaintiff offered to read in evidence a commission returned on the 22nd of August 1843; but the defendant objected to all such parts of it as went to show that <em>Musgrave, </em>by his fanning of the land leased by the defendant\u2019s father to him, benefitted it for tire defendant, or his fatiier. By die depositions of several witnesses taken under this commission, it was proved, that the farming of the land had been so conducted as to benefit the defendant. This constituted the portion of the evidence sought to be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>The action was in <em>assumpsit, </em>and was brought to recover the amount of an award, signed by arbitrators on the 29th <em>of </em>November 1841: the defence to this action consisted of evidence offered on the part of the defendant, to show that the claim on. the award was compromised and released by a,n agreement, entered into between the parties in <em>Virginia, </em>inMay 1842. And the defendant, for the purpose of inducing the jury to believe that such arrangement as was insisted upon by him had been made, offered proof, without objection, that the plaintiff had cut upon the demised premises between 1838 and the spring of 1841, and sold off the premises wood to the value of from $2000 to $2750. The defendant deemed the proof of a claim to damages for trespass, in cutting the wood to so great an amount as $2000 or $2700, as important to show that it was improbable claims to such an extent, over and beyond his claims for rent, would be compromised for so inconsiderable a sum as that for which judgment had been entered. Whether lilis evidence was admissible or not, we are not called upon to determinej but the evidence objected to is wholly inadmissible, unless upon some ground it could be considered as an answer to the alleged trespass in cutting the wood: for whether the land had been well tilled or not, or had been cultivated so as to benefit the defendant, were not questions in issue before the jury. No claim could be set up by the lessee for voluntarily farming the land in a more beneficial manner than the lease required. Nor could the evidence, upon any view of it, be considered as furnishing any answer to the alleged trespass. It could not have any tendency to diminish, or mitigate the damages. We, therefore, think the testimony objected to was wholly inadmissible, and that it should, consequently have been rejected by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">It has been urged by the appellant, that the court below not only decided the evidence objected to by him, to be admissible, but that all the evidence taken under the commission was admissible, and proceeding on this assumption, various objections have been urged to different portions of the evidence. But we have not considered the court below as deciding any other question than the specific question raised, and which we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>examined. The court, it is trae, did permit the whole of the evidence to be read to the jury, after disposing of the particular objection raised, and this it was their duty to do, as no other objection was taken than that which has been adverted to. It was not the duty of the court to point out objections to the admissibility of other portions of the evidence taken under the commission, but they might well await the action of the complainant in relation, thereto, and if no other objection was urged, the court only performed their duty, in allowing the commission, and the evidence taken under it, to have been read to the jury. Since the act of 1825, ch. 117, no point can be insisted upon by the appellant which was not raised in the court below, and we cannot act on a question which shall not appear to have been presented to the county court. Believing the only point decided by the county court, to have been the question raised on the particular evidence objected to, we cannot entertain the appeal in relation to the objections urged to other portions of the evidence, taken under the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The plaintiff, in the second <em>bill of </em>exceptions, prayed the court\u2019s opinion to the jury, that if the juiy believe the evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s witness, <em>George </em>Moore, in relation to the agreement of reference, also given in evidence, and executed by the plaintiff, and <em>George Moore &amp; Co., </em>dated 29th Nov. 1841;; and the report and award made under said reference, also dated 29th Nov. 1841; and if they believe the said reference and' report, and award was made, as stated by the said witness, Moore, that then the plaintiff is entitled to recover the amount of such award, unless the jury shall also find from the evidence' in the case, that afterwards it was agreed by, and between the' plaintiff and defendant, that the amount so due to the plaintiffs, in virtue of said reference and award, should be considered as-compromised, and released by the arrangement made in <em>Virginia </em>in May 1842, mentioned in the evidence of the witness,. <em>Jno. W. Tyler, </em>and fire other witnesses, testifying in regard to-said arrangement, under the commission to <em>Virginia.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">There are fatal objections to the instruction prayed. Facts are assumed which should have been submitted to the jury. Thus, (he question of notice, was a fact to be found by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>jury. There was abundant evidence to show notice; but the prayer is not put on the hypothesis of notice, and no matter what the jury might believe on the subject of notice, they would have been bound by the instruction granted, to have found for the plaintiff, if they believed the evidence of <em>Moore, </em>in relation to the reference, report, and award, provided they further believed that no compromise had been made, as mentioned in the instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The nature of the enquiry by the arbitrators, was such as to render notice necessary. By the agreement between the parties, of the 16th of August 1836, <em>Musgrave </em>had liberty to remove such materials as he might supply towards the buildings, other than those from the woods of <em>Bullitt, </em>so far as it could be done without exposure of, or injury to the materials towards the said buildings, obtained out of the woods of the said <em>Bullitt. </em>It was the purchase of these materials by the one, and the sale by the other, which was the object of the reference. Had notice been given, it is fair to presume, that evidence might have been adduced, to show that injury might arise from the removal of some of the materials furnished, within the meaning and terms of the contract. At all events, the judgment of the arbitrators might have been influenced or enlightened, by the adduction of evidence on the part of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">It was, moreover, a question of fact to be determined by the jury, whether matters had not been awarded upon, which had not been submitted by the parties, for, if such matters had been included in the award, which could not be separated from the matters referred, the award would be inoperative and void, unless indeed what had been done by the arbitrators, had after-wards been ratified by the party, to be affected by such award.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">There was evidence that buildings had been erected on <em>Stony Point </em>by <em>Musgrave, </em>and the award finds for repairs on the <em>Stony Point </em>shore.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">The reference agreed upon was to value the property on the <em>Opossum Nose Fishery </em>only; and if repairs were valued, which had been put up on <em>Stony Point Fishery, </em>such repairs were not within the submission. It is true this enquiry would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>immaterial, if, after the appraisement had been made, the defendant had ratified the same. But the instruction does not require the jury to enquire into the fact, whether there had been a subsequent ratification of the award, in case of any excess; hut the jury are instructed to find the amount of the award, if they believe the evidence of <em>Moore </em>in relation to the reference and award, and if they believe the reference, report, and award were made, as stated by <em>Moore. </em>Now this instruction is silent as to any evidence in relation to the endorsement on the award signed by <em>Musgrave </em>and <em>Moore Sf Co.; </em>and if that had been put to the jury, on their belief of the evidence of <em>Moore </em>on that subject, still it would not follow, that the jury must find the amount of the award for the plaintiff, for <em>Moore </em>does not prove any communication with <em>Bullitt </em>in relation to such ratification, or that any power was imparted to him otherwise than by the original power. He does not directly prove his authority, but only states that, what he did, he considered he was doing, as agent of <em>Bullitt, </em>the defendant. It was but his opinion, which to besure, had been admitted as evidence to the jury, without objection; and if the jury had believed he had truly stated his belief, it still was not imperative upon them as to the fact, whether authority had been imparted to him by <em>Bullitt </em>to ratify the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">But in addition to the above objections to the instruction given by the court below, there is another which, to our minds, is conclusive. The award is rvholly uncertain, and therefore void; and if all other objections were waived, it could not furnish the basis of the instruction granted. The design of <em>Bullitt </em>was to purchase, and <em>Musgrave, </em>to sell the materials, which, by the terms of the lease, the latter had the right to remove. If the sum awarded, the purchase money, is to be paid, it should sufficiently appear what were the articles appraised, so that the vendee might obtain a title. In this respect, we consider the award uncertain; certain articles are particularized, but some are not, but are included under an <em>et cetera. </em>These terms must mean something, but what, can only be left to conjecture. The parties ought not to be left to speculation; and we could not sanction an award so indefinite.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>We consider these questions as all necessarily raised by the prayer offered., and must presume they were brought to the attention of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED AND PROCEDENDO AWARDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
