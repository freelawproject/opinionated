It was not an assignment of the title; it was symbolical delivery, perfected by acceptance, equivalent to actual delivery. 24 <em>Pick., </em>42. 1 <em>Taunt., </em>459. 14 <em>East., </em>308. 5 <em>John.

It was never intended to apply to such transactions, nor to assignments consummated by delivery. It was not intended by the act to do more than require recording, where the right of the assignee rested in action, as distinguished from possession, either in himself or his agent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b416-9\">By the Court\u2014\u25a0</author>\n<p id=\"Ahd\">judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
