The breach assigned in this latter plea, was, that in April 1837, S. <em>T. </em>and <em>M. B., </em>as administrators of <em>Levin Boone, </em>passed an account of the said administration, by which there remained due to the estate of <em>L. B., </em>the sum of $907.82, and that the said administrators died, without completing their administration, or proceeding further therein, leaving debts and legacies unpaid, to the amount of $1000, and still due and unpaid; that letters <em>d. b. n., </em>had been granted \u00a1to the said <em>W.

Burch, </em>being one of the sureties on the bond. The defendant pleaded performance and <em>plena administravit. </em>The plaintiff replied, setting forth the death of <em>Levin Boone; </em>the claim of <em>John Boone </em>under his will; the amount of the property that had come to the hands of the administrators; the balance due the estate, &amp;c.; and avering a sufficiency of assets in the hands of the defendant to pay the claim. The defendant rejoined, denying the averments of the replication, and also filed a demurrer, to which there was a joinder by plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-8\">At this stage of the pleadings, the plaintiff asked leave to withdraw the joinder in demurrer, which was granted. The plaintiff then moved the court to strike out the use of <em>John T. Boone, </em>and to enter the cause, for the use of <em>Wm. II. Tuck, administrator de bonis non cui testamento annexo, </em>of said <em>Levin Boone; </em>and for leave to amend the pleadings, for the purpose of filing an amended replication. This replication sets out:\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-9\">1st. The death of <em>Levin Boone; </em>the appointment and qualification of his administrators; the amount of estate that came to their hands; the balance due the estate on their settlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>with the court; their death, leaving this balance unadministered; the granting of letters <em>de bonis non, </em>to <em>W. II. Tuck; </em>and that said balance is payable to him, as unadministered assets of the deceased, &amp;c.; and</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-5\">2nd. That the defendant had assets of his testator to pay this claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-6\">The court overruled this motion, and <em>nonprossed </em>the case, under a rule upon plaintiff to join in the defendant\u2019s demurrer. The plaintiff appealed, and will contend:\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-7\">1st. That the <em>administrator de bonis non, </em>was entitled to sue the bond, and should have been substituted as <em>cestui que use, </em>in the place of <em>John T. Boone.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-8\">2nd. That the amended replication, being offered in connection with the motion to change the use, and shewing the right of the <em>administrator de bonis non </em>to sue, the amendment should have been allowed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-9\">The act of 1798, chap. 101, sub chap. 14, sec. 2, confined the administration <em>de bonis non, </em>to \u201cassets not converted into money, and not distributed or delivered, or retained by the former administrator under the court\u2019s direction.\u201d The act of 1820, chap. 174, sec. 3, enlarges the powers and duties of <em>administrators de bonis non, </em>and extends them, in effect, to every other description of property belonging to the deceased\u2019s estate, at the death of the first administrator, whether it consist of bonds, notes, accounts, evidence of debt or money; and authorises the <em>administrator de bonis non </em>to sue the bond of his predecessor, for their recovery.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b399-10\">The replication filed, in connection with the motion to change the use, shews, that all the property of the deceased was sold by the first administrators, and that no final account was passed on his estate. Whether the proceeds remained in their hands, in bonds or notes, or in money, the amount was payable to the <em>administrator de bonis non. </em>It is obvious, under this act, that he is the proper person to receive and disburse these outstanding assets, whether they be payable ultimately to creditors or legatees, and that the bond may be sued for his use,' all questions of fact, of course, being reserved for trial upon the pleadings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>The next enquiry is, whether there was error in the court\u2019s refusal to change the use? The general rule is, that a public bond may be sued by any person interested in the recovery. <em>Kiersted et al., vs. State, use Sundry Persons, </em>1 <em>Gill &amp; John., </em>231, and the cases there cited. The same principle is recognised in the case of the <em>State vs. Dorsey et al., </em>3 <em>Gill &amp; John., 75. </em>In that case, a suit was commenced in the name of the State, for the use of the levy court of <em>Baltimore </em>county. Pending the action, that court became extinct, and another corporation was created in its stead. This fact was pleaded in bar of the action. The court, in their opinion, assimilate the case to a suit on a private bond, entered for the use of a third person. They say, <em>\u201cwe </em>can perceive no reason why, in the case of a public bond, with die privilege secured to any person interested to bring suit upon it, there should be any difference. In either case, the suit must be in the name of the obligee.\u201d \u201cThere is no necessity, for the puiposes of the suit, to enter the use, whether it is brought for the benefit of an individual or a corporation; nor, if entered, does it make any difference to the defendant how it may vary or change, as to the person asserting the same right. It does not affect his defence, nor can any change of the use become a fit subject of plea. The declaration or replication assigns the breach, and discloses the use, or for what the suit is brought, and the defendant being thus advised, makes his defence accordingly. The judgment is in the name of the State, and will be for the use of whoever is entitled to the beneficial interest.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b400-5\">The appellant contends, that this authority is conclusive. The cases, in principle, are the same, though the question is raised in a different form. In that case it was presented by plea;\u2014here it arises on motion. But with this the defendant has no concern. He must look to the State as the legal plaintiff. The <em>cestui que use </em>is not considered a party to the action, for any purpose, except as a security for costs. The defendant could not be taken by surprise. The court would not allow that. For if the motion had been granted, and the use entered, the court would have continued the cause, or granted time for the defence. It is not contended, that mere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>amendments of pleadings are proper subjects of appeal. But in this case, the replication was filed with the motion to strike out and change the use, for the purpose of shewing the court, that the <em>administrator de bonis non </em>had an interest in the bond, and might put it in suit; or avail himself of the pending action, as being \u201centitled to the beneficial interest;\u201d and not being denied, or in any manner called in question in the court below, it must, itself, be considered as evidence of all it contains. It must be conceded, that the law of amendments in pleading, was administered with unusual vigor in this case. <em>Mr. </em>Evans, in his work on <em>Practice, </em>page 248, says : \u201cModem judges lean so universally in favor, of amendments, that we scarce remember a question made, whether an amendment was proper, except in the case just mentioned; and none in modern times, in which the amendment was not permitted.\u201d The plaintiff first filed a replication, proposing to recover on the interest that <em>John T. Boone </em>was supposed <em>to </em>have in the estate of <em>Levin Boone. </em>On the argument of the demurrer to that replication, the court intimated, that <em>John T. Boone </em>had no title; but that the right to sue, was in the <em>administrator de bonis non. </em>The plaintiff having withdrawn the joinder in the demurrer, moved to substitute the <em>administrator de bonis non, </em>as the equitable plaintiff, and to be permitted to conduct the pleadings according to the interest of die administrator. This the court refused, because the suit was not brought in the name of the State, for the use of the <em>administrator de bonis non. </em>Now, if the motion had been granted, and the case had gone ultimately against the defendant, the propriety of changing the use, with all other questions on the record, might have been revised on his appeal. But, by refusing the motion, the court summarily decide the whole controversy, and adjudge, that the State cannot prosecute the case for the use of any person, but the first <em>cestui que use. </em>If it is the entry of the use, and not the assignment of the breaches, that shews the right to sue; and if a person cannot recover as beneficial plaintiff, unless the use be entered when the writ issues, it follows, that if no use be entered at that time, no recovery can be had in that suit. This is certainly a conclusion against the opinion in <em>State vs. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number><em>Dorsey et al., </em>3 <em>G. J., </em>93, where it is said, the use need not be entered at all. Two suits for greater caution might have been instituted at the same time, one in the name of the State, for the use of <em>Boone, </em>as legatee, and the other for the use of the <em>administrator de bonis non. </em>But it is more convenient and less vexatious, to have one suit in which the pleadings may be so varied, as to allow a recovery in any aspect in which the State may shew a right to recover. And since the decision of the case of <em>State vs. Dorsey et al., </em>there can be no objection successfully made to this course, for there the writ issued for the use of one corporation, and judgment was rendered for the use of another. This is more than a question of amendment of the pleadings. The motion to change the use, was the only mode in which the rights of the <em>administrator de bonis non </em>could be brought before the court. It involved the question of his right to sue the bond, and when decided for the defendant, the case was gone. Any judgment which finally disposes of the case, and settles the right of a party to recover, is the proper subject of appeal, whether the decision be for or against the recovery. When the motion was overruled, the case stood as if there had been no joinder in the demurrer. The State was laid under a rule joinder, and for not complying, judgment of <em>nonpross. </em>was entered. If the plaintiff had joined again in the demurrer, it would have been, in the face of the intimation of the court, against the right of <em>John T. Boone </em>to sue the bond; so that the only r\u00e9medy was an appeal from this judgment on a new suit on the bond, for the use of the <em>administrator de bonis non. </em>Relying on the case in 3 <em>G. &amp; J., 75, </em>the appellant preferred the appeal <em>to </em>a second suit on the bond, then barred by limitations.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-5\">It is submitted, that the court will reverse the judgment of <em>nonpross., </em>and the judgment rejecting the motion to change the use, &lt;fcc., as made by the appellant, and send the cause to the county court on a <em>procedendo.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-6\">The record seems to shew, that the defendant rejoined and demurred to the replication at the same time. This is evidently a mistake in tire record. The defendant must have withdrawn his rejoinder before he entered the demurrer. I have no distinct recollection of the fact, but such is my impression.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>By T. S. Alexander for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-5\">The writ, in this case, was issued in the name of the State of Maryland, endorsed at the instance and for the use of <em>John T. Boone, </em>against the executor of a surety for <em>Singleton Townshend </em>and <em>Maria Boone, </em>on the bond given by them for the performance of their duties as administrators, with the will annexed, of <em>Levin Boone, </em>deceased. The replication to the plea of general performance states, that the testator bequeathed the residue of his estate to his wife, the said <em>Maria Boone, </em>for life; and after her death, to <em>George Boone </em>and <em>Nicholas Boone, </em>to be equally divided between them, and to the heirs lawfully begotten of their bodies; and for want of such heirs, to <em>William Boone </em>and <em>John Boone, </em>and their heirs and assigns, as tenants in common. That <em>George Boone </em>and <em>Nicholas Boone, </em>died in the life time of <em>Maria Boone, </em>without heirs of their bodies; and that <em>William Boone, </em>also, died without issue; whereby the said residue devolved on the said <em>John, </em>at whose instance and for whose use this action is brought. That the goods and chattels of the testator in the hands of his administrators, after payment of all debts and particular legacies, amounted to the sum of $1000; which was distributable to the said <em>Maria Boone </em>; and that the said <em>Maria </em>has lately died. And the breach assigned, is the non-payment of that residue to the said <em>John. </em>The defendant demurred to this replication. And thereupon <em>the </em>plaintiff moved the <em>court, \u201cto </em>strike out the use of <em>John T. Boone, </em>and to enter this cause for the use of <em>William H. Tuck, administrator de bonis non, </em>with the will annexed, of the deceased <em>Levin Boone,\u201d </em>and for leave to amend \u201cthe replication, by stating in substance, that the original administrators had sold the personal estate of their testator, \u201cand had passed an account of their administration ; by which there remained due to the said estate, after allowing certain disbursements, the sum of $907.02; \u201d and that the said original administrators died, \u201cwithout completing their administration, or proceeding further therein, after passing said account, and leaving unadministered the said balance; and leaving debts and legacies unpaid to the amount of $1000.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-6\">The court overruled the motion, and die plaintiff appealed from said decision.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Whereupon the defendant prays, the plaintiff may be required to join in demurrer with him. The rule was accordingly laid. <em>But,u </em>the said plaintiff being solemnly called, comes not, neither is its writ, aforesaid, against the said defendant further <em>prosecuted; </em>but makes default.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-5\">A judgment of <em>non suit </em>is therefore entered, and the plaintiff appeals from this judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-6\">This case is therefore before this court, on appeals from two distinct judgments; the one interlocutory, overruling the motion to amend the writ and replication 5 and the other final, entering judgment of <em>non suit. </em>And the question is, whether in the rendering of those judgments, or either of them, there is error, which may be corrected on those appeals, or either of them?</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-7\">On an appeal from a judgment of <em>non suit, </em>the appellant cannot complain of error in the original record. He is required to shew mistake in entering up the judgment. 2 <em>Bing. </em>326. <em>Evans vs. Sweet, in </em>9 <em>Engl. Com. Law Rep. </em>420. And in <em>Kempland vs. Macauley, </em>4 <em>T. R. </em>436, where a writ of error was brought on a judgment of <em>non-suit, Butter, </em>justice, remarked, <em>(f </em>here it is apparent, that there can be no error, of which the plaintiff can avail himself: for if the record were manifestly erroneous, the plaintiff, who has made default by suffering a <em>non suit, </em>can never have a judgment afterwards in his favor.\u201d In this State, since the act of 1825, <em>chap. </em>117, error in the judgment is to be shewn, only where it has been entered after demurrer, or motion in arrest of judgment. 5 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>102, <em>Sasscer vs. Walker. </em>No point or question relating to, or involved in the final judgment of <em>non suit, </em>is presented by the record, shewing die default of the plaintiff. Hence it may be affirmed with confidence, that in this State no appeal will lie from a judgment of <em>non suit.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-8\">2. If an appeal will lie from a judgment of <em>non suit, </em>it is clear, upon the preceding authorities, that the appellant must shew error in the proceedings anterior to the judgment, and on which the judgment was founded. He must show there was no legal default on the part of the plaintiff. F-or the existence of default is the only point concluded by the judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>Now in this case, the record states, that being solemnly call - ed, the plaintiff came not; but made default. And therefore it was considered, that it take nothing by its writ. The record is conclusive, that the plaintiff was called, and did make default; and the judgment was entered, because of the failure of the plaintiff to answer when solemnly called. In this, as in every other stage of the cause before verdict, the plaintiff has the option of abandoning his suit. The plaintiff determined his option, by standing mute when regularly required to speak. The judgment, then, was the legal effect of his own voluntary act.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-5\">The argument filed on the part of the appellant, attempts to connect the judgment of <em>non suit, </em>with the anterior proceedings. And because he could not answer the law of the demurrer, and the court would not permit an amendment of the pleadings, it is supposed, the plaintiff had no other alternative but to <em>non suit </em>his action. This is not so; he might have joined in demurrer. If the judgment had been against him, and if the refusal of the court below to permit an amendment, may be reviewed in this court, then, by an appeal from the judgment on demurrer, he might have corrected all errors, not only in the judgment itself, but in the refusal of the court to permit the proposed amendment; and likewise, in all other anterior proceedings. This ought to have been his course, if he intended to question the proceedings of the court below. I have already said, that he had the option of submitting to a <em>non suit. </em>If he had permitted a judgment to be entered against him on demurrer, he must, as an equivalent for his chance of reversing that judgment, have given to the defendant an equal chance of concluding further litigation by affirming the judgment. By submitting to a <em>non suit, </em>he retained his right to commence a new action. Thus it appears, that the <em>non suit </em>was the consequence of a proceeding on the part of the plaintiff, advisedly adopted:\u2014adopted with the view of avoiding the evil of an unfavorable judgment against him on this record. He withdrew his cause from the court below, voluntarily, for the purpose, it may be, of renewing the litigation in another form. Is he at liberty to retract his election ? Or can he impose on this appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>late jurisdiction, the duty of determining questions, on which no judgment was pronounced by the court below?</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-5\">Let us again assume the judgment was entered, because of the failure of the plaintiff to join in demurrer, in compliance with the rule laid for that purpose. His default, in fact, will be established by the record. And the only subject for enquiry, will be, whether the rule was regularly laid ? It was a regular sequence from the demurrer; unless the progress of the action was intercepted, by the entiy of the appeal from the judgment,' overruling the plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend. To that appeal, as a supersedeas, there are two conclusive objections : <em>First, </em>the judgment was interlocutory; and from an interlocutory judgment no appeal will lie. The appeal was, therefore, to say the least of it, premature. <em>Second, </em>no bond was given to prosecute that appeal; and a bond is necessary to stay execution, even of a final judgment. Either of those reasons would be sufficient to show, that the cause was to progress after the appeal, in the same manner, precisely, as if no appeal had been entered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-7\">Again, let us associate the judgment of <em>non suit, </em>with the refusal of the court to permit an amendment of the pleadings. Was there error in such refusal, which this court may correct?</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-8\">I insist:\u20141st. That an appeal will not lie, in any case, from the refusal of the court below to allow an amendment. 2d. That in this particular case, the court acted rightly, in overruling the motion made for amendment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-9\">1. The motion for amendment is addressed to the discretion of the court of original jurisdiction; and it is a general rule, that the discretion of tire inferior court is not to be controlled on appeal. An appeal will not lie, from an order granting or refusing a new trial. <em>5 H. &amp; G., </em>174, <em>Anderson vs. the State. </em>2 <em>H. </em>&amp; <em>G., </em>79, <em>Wall vs. Wall. </em>Nor from the refusal of the court to strike out a judgment by default. 6 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>151, <em>Hawkins vs. Jackson. </em>Or grant a continuance. 6 <em>Cranch, </em>206, <em>Marine Ins. Co. vs. Hodgson. </em>Nor the allowance or disallowance of an amendment. 11 <em>Wheat., </em>280, <em>Chirac vs. Reinecker. </em>Other cases, illustrative of the general rule, may be found collected in 2 <em>United States Digest, </em>160. It is conceded by the argument filed on the other side, that the refusal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>the court to allow an amendment, is not, ordinarily, a subject of appeal. But this case is supposed to be taken out of the operation of the general rule, by the circumstance, that the motion was accompanied by a replication, which showed another title in some other person, to commence another action on the same bond. The peculiar fitness of this argument, as the basis of an exception to the general rule, is not perceived. No injury was done to this other person by rejecting his application; since, by his own showing, he may put the bond in suit for his own benefit. In every instance, the amendment is to be allowed for advancement of justice. In every case, the court may require to be informed, of the particulars of the amendment, and of the probability of sustaining the amended case by evidence. And where such statement is not called for, it ought to be assumed, that the motion to amend involves a grave question of law. There is not, therefore, such peculiarity in the present case, as is suggested. In <em>Anderson vs. The State, </em>the motion for a new trial was founded on a supposed misdirection of the court to the jury. But tire appeal was dismissed. A yet stronger case was brought up, some years ago, from <em>Charles </em>county. The defendant, I believe, excepted to an opinion, expressed by the court during the trial. The verdict being against him, he moved for a new trial, on some ground connected with the conduct of the jury. The court refused to entertain the motion, unless he would abandon his exception. He appealed. His counsel here, admitting, that an appeal would not ordinarily lie, from the refusal of the court below to grant a new trial, insisted, that the court was bound to receive and consider his motion; that the <em>Constitution </em>secured to him the benefit of a <em>fair </em>trial by an <em>impartial </em>jury; and that if he considered himself aggrieved by the ignorance or partiality of the jury, it was the bounden duty of the court to <em>listen </em>to a temperate statement of his grievance. The error assigned in this case, was not in the exercise of discretion by the court below, but in its refusal to excercise its discretion. And, I presume no one would hesitate to say, that the conduct, or rather, misconduct of the court, was flagrant and inexcusable. Yet this court held, it was incompetent to administer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>relief. The whole jurisdiction over the subject, was confided to the county court, and with the exercise, or refusal to exercise its discretion, this court could not interfere. Now the case to which I refer, is infinitely stronger than the case before the court. In the former case it is clear, that a constitutional right of the suitor was violated; a constitutional d\u00fcty of the court was disregarded. In the present case, there is nothing to show that the court below did not exercise a sound judicial discretion, in refusing the proposed amendment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b408-5\">2. Let us assume, that the refusal of the court to suffer the amendment, is a proper subject for revision, and that the record discloses all the facts and circumstances, by which the correctness of tire decision of the court below, is to be tested. Is there error in that decision upon the record ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b408-6\">In this country amendments are liberally allowed, more so than in <em>England. </em>But there must be some limits, beyond which, an amendment cannot be extended. In an action brought by <em>A </em>against <em>B, </em>there cannot be an amendment, which would warrant a judgment in favor of <em>G </em>against <em>D. </em>And in an action of ejectment, it would be against principle to admit the lessor of the plaintiff to recover damages for an <em>assumpsit. </em>The act of 1809, <em>chap. </em>153, to which our practice is to be traced, allows such amendments, as may bring the merits of the question between the parties fairly to trial. The parties are not to be changed; nor can the question be changed. Such modifications of the pleadings, and other proceedings are to be allowed, as will fairly present the original question, as between the original parties. The original writ cannot be amended. It is not a part of the pleadings, nor of those other proceedings, which may be amended under the provisions of the above act. To alter the writ would be to alter the question between the parties, <em>7 H. &amp;. J. </em>257, <em>Stoddert vs. Newman; </em>and therefore, where the party originally founded his cause of action on a testamentary bond, he was not permitted to amend, by relying on a guardian\u2019s bond. 4 <em>Gill &amp; Johns., </em>385, <em>State vs. Green.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b408-7\">Assuming then, that the person at whose instance, and for whose use the action is brought, is the party plaintiff; and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>the replication discloses the question to be tried, it would be against principle, and the provisions of the act of 1809, to admit the substitution of another <em>cestui que </em>use, claiming under another title. To avoid this conclusion, it is argued, that the State is the party plaintiff, and that the writ discloses the question at issue between the parties. If this was so, then one recovery on the testamentary bond would bar any other action on the same hood; which is against experience. Again, we are told that there is a complete analogy between the case of an action on a private bond, brought in the name of the obligee, for the use of another, and of an action on a testamentary bond, brought in the name of the State, for the use of a legatee, or other party interested in the administration; and that as the use entered in the one case may be altered or amended, pending suit, without prejudice to the plaintiff \u2019s right of recovery, a like alteration may be made in the other case. These positions derive color from dicta, which are to be found in the opinion of the late chief judge, in 3 <em>Gill &amp; Johns. </em>75, <em>State vs. Dorsey. </em>It is the exclusive province of this court to determine, how far it is bound by opinions expressed by the judge, charged to deliver its judgment, where such opinions are not material to the judgment, or are used for illustration and argument merely. <em>We </em>have high authority for affirming, that &lt;c an opinion given in court, if not necessary to the judgment given of record, but that it might have been as well given if no such, or a contrary opinion had been broached, is no judicial opinion.\u201d If I can show then that the <em>dicta </em>relied on, were not called for by the circumstances of the case, and were unnecessary to the determination of the points which were really before the court, I may, without the imputation of intentional disrespect to this court, venture to state the ground on which I would question the authority of those <em>dicta. </em>Vide, <em>Ram on Legal </em>Judgment, 36. What then was the question in the case of the <em>State vs. Dorsey ? </em>An <em>action </em>had been brought on a collector\u2019s bond in the name of the State, at the instance and for the use of the levy court of <em>Baltimore </em>county, at that time the fiscal representative of the county; and the members of which were appointed by the executive. Pending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>the suit, an act was passed changing the name of the levy court, into that of commissioners of <em>Baltimore </em>county; and transferring the power of appointing commissioners from the executive to the people. The question was, whether the suit could be continued by the commissioners? And the affirmative of this question was to be sustained, by showing, that the commissioners were, in law, identical with the levy court\u2014 succeeding to the same functions, rights, and liabilities; and enforcing the same legal title, for the benefit of the same constituencjr. They were the successors of the levy court, in being at the time the action was brought; bearing to the levy court a relation as intimate, at the least, as the heir to his ancestor, or the executor to his testator Here was the argument conclusive on the subject. All therefore, that ensues, in relation to the analogy between an action brought on a private bond, in the name of the obligee for the use of another, and an action brought on a testamentary bond for the use of one interested in the administration; and to the necessity for and the effect of an entry of the use, are <em>mere prolata, </em>not concluding to the judgment, or material to its correctness.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b410-5\">I shall now proceed to show, that whilst there may be points of agreementbetween the two c\u00e1ses, there are also points of difference; and that the learned judge in his opinion quoted by the other side, has not expressed himself with his accustomed caution and accuracy. In the first place, the learned judge is in error, in supposing there is similarity in the nature of the interest to the <em>cestui que uses' </em>in the two cases. An assignment of a private bond, conveys no legal interest to the assignee. It operates, simply as a power irrevocable, to the assignee to receive the money; and to sue in the name of the obligee for its recovery. There is no law requiring the use to be entered on the docket or record; and the entry is only made as notice to all parties of the beneficial interest of the assignee. It is, by \u2022motion, addressed to the equity of the court, that the rights of the assignee are enforced. On the other hand, the act of \u25a01798, chap. 101, confers on the party, aggrieved, by the \u2022conduct of the executor, a legal right .to put his bond in suit. And the act of 1794, chap. 54,^ sec. 10, directs the clerk, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>before issuing the writ (in any suit on a testamentary bond,) to endorse thereon the name of the party, at whose instance, and for whose use the suit is instituted. The endorsement of the use is thus made a part of the writ. A writ issued by the clerk, without the endorsement, would be merely void, or at the least voidable, as irregularly issued. It is incorrect therefore to say, that \u201cthere is no necessity for the purposes of the suit to enter the use.\u201d The duty is imperative.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b411-5\">Again, the learned judge is in error, in running parallels between the form and effect of the proceeding in the two cases. And first, as to form. In the case of a private bond assigned, the writ issues in the name of the obligee; the declaration counts on his title, and the pleas attempt to bar his title. The assignment is not noticed in any part of the record. Payment to the assignee must be pleaded as a payment to the obligee. A release by the assignee, could not be pleaded at all. In the case of a testamentary bond, the declaration or replication must show title in the person, at whose instance and for whose use the action is brought; and every plea or rejoinder affects to bar that title. In every stage of the pleading, the title of the <em>cestui que </em>use, (improperly so called,) is affirmed or denied. The title of the State, is recognised as technical only. Then, again, as to the effect. To an action on a private bond by the obligee, for the use of <em>A, </em>the defendant may plead a recovery in an action, formerly brought by the obligee, simply, or for the use of <em>B. </em>A recovery, in one action, concludes the question of title, and extinguishes the right of action in the bond. But a recovery on a testamentary bond, in the name of the State, at the instance and for the use of <em>A, </em>cannot be pleaded in bar of a second action on the same bond, in the name of the State, at the instance and for the use of <em>B. </em>Nay, a recovery by <em>A, </em>counting on his title as a creditor, would not bar a second action on the same bond, in which he would count on his title as legatee. A recovery on a testamentary bond, concludes only the person at whose instance, and for whose use, the action was brought, and in respect only of the title in question, by the pleadings in that action. With this brief explanation of the grounds of objection to the <em>dicta, </em>expressed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>the learned judge, in 3 <em>Gill &amp; John., </em>I conclude, that in an action on a testamentary bond, the endorsement is an essential part of the writ; that the person, at whose instance, and for whose use the action is brought, is the party plaintiff; that the title of that person, as disclosed by the pleadings, is the question at issue between the parties; and, consequently, that the act of 1809, neither authorises nor allows a substitution of one name for another in the endorsement of the writ, nor an amendment of the pleadings, for the purpose of raising a new question on a title, in which the person, at whose instance, and for whose use the writ was issued, has no interest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b412-5\">I have thus attempted to show, that the court had no authority to allow the amendment asked for. I will next endeavor to prove, that the authority, if it existed, ought not to have been exercised. Every suit brought, should have a definite object. The plaintiff should state his cause of action with such certainty, as to enable the defendant to decide, whether he would admit or contest it. It would be wrong to permit the plaintiff to bring his neighbor to answer one charge, which is groundless, and then recover against him for a cause, which perhaps, he would not have denied. Whatever may be our practice in this respect, there must, in principle, be some limit to this right of amendment. If it can be shown, that the action was really brought to recover a bond for $500, given in 1840, would it be right to permit the plaintiff to recover on a bond for $1000, given in 1842? After the defendant has successfully defended himself against Boone, at whose instance, and for whose use the suit was brought, would it be right to subject him to further litigation in this same suit, at the instigation of <em>Tuck, </em>who claims a distinct right in a different character? <em>Boone, </em>as residuary legatee, claims the clear balance remaining, after a complete administration. <em>Tuck, </em>as administrator, claims the proceeds of the estate, as in the hands of the original administrators, unadministered. It is not even shown, that <em>Boone </em>has any beneficial interest in the result of <em>Tuck's </em>action. On the contrary it is averred, that the debts and particular legacies outstanding, will absorb the entire estate. A suit brought by <em>Boone, </em>in his own right, and for his own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>benefit, is, therefore, to be continued by <em>Tuck, </em>for the benefit of other persons. Is there equity in this demand, in respect either of <em>Boone </em>or the defendant? Will the court say, that our right to recover the costs incurred by us, in resisting <em>Boone's </em>claim, shall abide the event of the new litigation in which we are to be engaged with <em>Tuck ? </em>Or, in the event of our ultimate recovery, will the court restrain us from levying our entire costs from <em>Boone </em>?</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b413-5\">If this court is to revise the discretion of the county court, it will notice every circumstance which may have inlluenced the judgment of the court below. It will notice that <em>Mr. Tuck, </em>the present <em>administrator de bonis non, </em>was the attorney who sued out the original writ, for the benefit of <em>Boone. </em>We have the guarantee of his established character, that the writ was advisedly issued, and after evidence, satisfactory to him, that the estate had been duly administered. Is it possible that he, being the <em>administrator de bonis non </em>at the time, would have yielded the right to <em>Boone, </em>without due examination? If the force of this inquiry is sought to be evaded by the suggestion, that his letters were granted after the commencement of this suit, I reply, that the title which is to continue this action, must have existed at the time the action was commenced. My own suspicion is, that the letters were granted after commencement of this suit, and after the court had decided, that the residue vested in interest and possession of the residuary legatee for life; and that the remedy of the legatee in remainder, was to be asserted by action against her representative. An administration <em>de bonis non </em>was then resorted to, in tlxe hope that the defendant might be unable to prove a technical administration, which woutd exclude the technical title of the present administrator. There is no affidavit of merits. There is no pretext of merits set out in the record. Having defeated one title, another rises up, as it were out of the ruins of the first. If we defeat this other, what security have we that a third claimant will not present himself in the person of a creditor? and a fourth in the person of a particular legatee? <em>Interest reipublicce ut sit firms litium. </em>Let this false clamor cease. Give us the costs of the defence we have already made. If any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>should feel disposed to renew the contest, we shall then be the better prepared to meet him.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b414-4\">By the Court\u2014\u25a0</author>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
