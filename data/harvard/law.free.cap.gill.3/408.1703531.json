These debts were assigned by <em>R </em>to <em>B, </em>in 1806, and by him to <em>N, </em>in 1812. In 1822, <em>G, </em>and two of his children, executed a bond to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number><em>N, </em>for the sum of, &amp;c. the mortgage debt. This sum was composed of the two principal debts, with interest added from tlieir dates, after allowing various credits for interest, to the time of the assignment to <em>B, </em>in 1806, and then with interest on the aggregate as principal, allowing intermediate credits less than the interest, to the date of the second assignment to JV, in 1812; at which time, the interest was again added to the principal, and interest upon that aggregate to 1822, when the_ bond to JV, was given for the whole sum. The bill charged a concurrence of the three children of <em>G, </em>in the bond of 1812, and as to the one who did not sign it, there was a decree, <em>pro confesso. </em>Helo : that as in 1806, interest had accrued on the mortgage debt, there was no objection to converting it into principal at the time of the assigment to <em>B; </em>and as interest had accrued to him, there was no objection in converting it, also, into principal, at the time of the assignment to JV, and that, therefore, the bond taken in 1822, was not usurious, and was evidence of the debt due under the mortgage, which would not be reduced by excluding the interest, or the interest added to the principal.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AQD\">Where interest has once accrued, it becomes a debt, and there is no longer any objection to an agreement <em>inter partes, </em>that it shall be considered principal, and carry interest.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b417-5\">Defensive averments in an answer, not responsive to a bill, unsupported by proof,- are disregarded at the hearing.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b417-6\">Upon a decree <em>pro confesso, </em>it is an established principle, that the allegations of the bill are to be received as true, as to those parties against whom the decree passed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b417-7\">Where a bill charged, that a complainant was entitled to the mortgage debt, with interest thereon, this averment authorises the recovery of the debt, with either simple or compound interest, as appears to be just upon all the circumstances of the case.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b417-8\">Appeal from the Oourt of Chancery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b417-9\">This cause was before this court at June term 1837, and is reported in 9 <em>G.

This attempt to secure by the original mortgage, more than the principal therein mentioned, with legal interest thereon, the auditor submits, is contrary to the terms of the said mortgage, and illegal; and the complainant is entitled to claim, as a lien on this estate, only the principal mentioned in the mortgage, with the interest thereon; and the rights of the complainant under the bond, it is also submitted, are not impaired by this opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-5\">In account No. l,the defendants are charged with the principal debts secured by the mortgages of 1791, and 1805, and with simple interest thereon; and are credited with the payments to <em>Thomas </em>Buchanan, in 1807 and 1808, as proved before the auditor. The balance due by this account, is $3080.69.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-6\">In account No. 2, the defendants are charged with the principal debts, as before stated, and with simple interest thereon, from dates in the year 1807, which are arbitrarily assumed. The balance due by this account, is $1893.29.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-7\">In account No. 3, the defendants are charged with the principal debts, as before stated, and with simple interest thereon, to 22nd April 1822: credits are given for the payments made to <em>Mr. Buchanan. </em>The balance is then converted into principal, and interest charged thereon to the present time. The balance due by this acount, is $5218.54.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b422-8\">In account No. 4, the defendants are charged with interest, from arbitrary dates in 1807, to a day in 1823.

Because said accounts, Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4, in so far as they differ from his account, No. 5, are not supported by any proof whatever; and on the contrary, are directly opposed by the evidence in the cause. The said statements assume arbitrary periods for the commencement of the account; and the proof being, that a settlement was had on the 22nd April 1822, and a balance was then struck, and acknowledged to be due by the parties, under their <em>seals;\u2014-first, </em>by their bond, dated 22nd April <em>1822;\u2014secondly, </em>by their agreement or admission, under seal, dated 26th January 1825.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-8\">2. Because the auditor, in his account No. 6, has entirely disregarded the aforesaid settlement and admissions, under seal, and by his report has charged the parties with an attempt to secure, by said instruments, a greater sum than is really due, and has declared such attempt to be illegal. 'Whereas, there is no evidence, whatever, in the cause, tending in any manner to draw into question, the fairness and lawfulness of the aforesaid settlement; and in opposition to the aforesaid views of the auditor, this exceptant insists :\u20141st. That the aforesaid settletlements being wholly unimpeached, furnish conclusive evidence of the extent of this exceptant\u2019s claim, as stated in account No. 5. 2nd. That the decree, <em>pro confesso, </em>against <em>Geoge Fitzhugh, Jr., </em>and <em>Mary Fitzhugh, estop </em>the said parties from denying the correctness of the settlements aforesaid; and no evidence, whatever, has been furnished by <em>Daniel D. Fitzhugh, </em>in support of his averment, that more was allowed to be due by said settlement, than in fact was due.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-9\">3. That the fact, that the principal debts, with simple interest thereon, from the dates mentioned in the mortgage, to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>day of the settlement, (22nd April 1822,) do not equal the sum which is admitted to be due by the aforesaid bond and agreement, is by no meens conclusive to shew, that the party has attempted to secure to himself, the payment of a larger sum than is legally secured by the deed of mortgage. It was perfectly competent for the parties at any intermediate time or times, to add the interest to the principal, and to allow interest on the compounded sum. And it will be evident, by calculation, that in fact the interest was compounded at the date of the assignment, by <em>Mrs. Dulany </em>to <em>Mr. Buchanan, </em>(11th December 1806,) and again, at the date of the assignment by <em>Mr. Buchanan </em>to <em>Mr. Neth, </em>(2d March 1812.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-5\">From the report of the case in 9 <em>G. Sp </em>Ji, 51, it appears that the appellants insisted, there was no evidence of the authority of <em>William Cooke, </em>as attorney for <em>Rebecca Dulany, </em>to assign her claims to <em>Thomas Buchanan. </em>But assuming the existence of such authority, it is conceded by their succeeding .points, that die appellee was to be treated as assignee of the two debts, of \u00bff230 and JM00; and it is then attempted to be shewn, that the interest of <em>George Fitzhugh, the elder, </em>in the premises decreed to be sold, never was charged or chargeable, with the debt of JAOO; that the bond and agreement to compound the interest, and make it a charge upon the whole property, could only bind the parties thereto, and could not bind others, whose debts are secured by the same mortgage, or a subsequent mortagee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b424-6\">The court decided, that there was sufficient evidence of the legal assignment of <em>Rebecca Dulany's </em>claims, to the person under whom the appellee derived his title; and that by force of the bond and agreement, stated, the interest of <em>George Fitzhugh, the elder, </em>in the premises decreed to be sold, was well charged with the payment of both debts, and the arrear of the interest thereon. But because of various defects in the proceedings, the court waived the consideration of the question, how far the agreement to compound interest on those debts could bind others than the parties thereto, and remanded the cause to the Court of chancery, \u201cfor the purpose of amending (he pleadings, making <em>Upton Scott, </em>if living, or if dead, his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>legal representative or representatives, a party or parties defendant; and that such further testimony be taken therein, and other proceedings had under the Chancellor\u2019s direction, as shall be necessary for determining the cause upon its merits. \u2019 \u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b425-5\">Pending the appeal, <em>George Fitzhugh, the elder, </em>died.

That the respondent says he believes, the defendants, <em>Mary </em>and <em>George, the younger, </em>had no knowledge of the details of the settlement, nor of its correctness or propriety. That the respondent did, at die tim\u00e9, object to signing said bond, but was finally induced to do so at the earnest request and solicitation of his father, who represented that the mortgage would otherwise be immediately foreclosed, and the estate probably sacrificed. That the said bond, was in fact, executed by <em>George, the elder, </em>and not by <em>George, </em>the son. That some time before the execution of said bond, at the request of his father, (who had then reached an advanced age,) this defendant assumed the control and management of the farm, and that every payment thereafter made to the said <em>Le\u00edais Neth, </em>was in fact, made by the respondent from the proceeds of the farm, and that no payment was ever made by <em>George, the younger, </em>except as agent of respondent.- That before the execution of said bond, he never did agree with' said <em>Neth </em>to compound the interest on said mortgage debt, and he has no knowledge whether the sum mentioned in said bond, was made and arrived at by compounding the interest on the said mortgage debt, or how otherwise, the said sum was arrived at. He utterly denies that he ever did agree with the said <em>Neth to </em>compound interest on the said debt, unless such agreement be contained in said bond or in the instrument of writing marked D, and avers his belief, that the sum in said bond mentioned, could not be made by compounding interest on said mortgage debt, from the date of the assignment thereof to said <em>Neth, </em>up to the date of the execution of said bond. He further states, that whilst the said mortgage debt was held by <em>Thomas Buchanan, </em>the annual interest thereon claimed was $107.79, or thereabouts, and that said interest was fully paid to said <em>Buchanan, </em>up to the 31st March 1810. That the agreement, exhibit D, was executed by him at the request and solicitation of his father, in like manner as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>exhibit C had been previously executed, and without any examination by him into the correctness of the debt, therein said to be due, and that said exhibit was executed by <em>George, the elder, </em>and not by <em>George, </em>the son; and he concludes by averring, that the said exhibits were made and delivered for the purpose of securing the payment of money upon a usurious and unlawful contract, whereby there was assured to said <em>Neth, </em>for the forbearance of said money, above the rate of $6, for the forbearance of $100 a year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-5\"><em>Mary Fitzhugh, </em>by her answer, admits the execution of the deeds, marked A &amp; 11.

This statement assumes, that <em>Neth </em>was the assignee of both of the debts of <em>George Fitzhugh to Rebecca Dulany, </em>as described in the mortgage deed of 27th April 1805, and that the amount of those was conclusively ascertained by the bond executed on the 22nd April 1822.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-16\">And the appellants, in opposition to this decree, and contending for its reversal, will insist:</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-17\">1st. That the evidence does not establish, that <em>Neth </em>was assignee of more than the JAOO debt mentioned in said mortgage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-18\">2nd. That even if <em>Neth </em>is admitted to have been assignee of both debts, could not by any computation of them, with simple interest, up to the date of said bond of 22nd April 1822, have amounted to the sum mentioned in said bond; and that the said sum could only have been made out as the amount of the debts then due, by charging illegal and usurious interest.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>3rd. That the said calculation in 1822, of the amount due, could not be sustained even by compounding, at the periods of the assignment to <em>Buchanan </em>and Neth, as also at the date of said bond, (April, 1822;) and that, even if it could, there is no evidence of any agreement on the part of the appellees, or any of them, to compound at the period of the assignment by <em>Mrs. Dulany </em>to Buchanan, or of the assignment by <em>Buchanan </em>to <em>Neth, </em>nor any right in said assignees respectively, to have the debt compounded at the period of said assignments, or of either of them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-5\">4th. That there was no agreement to compound, at the period when the said bond of 22nd April 1822, was executed on the part of the appellees, or any of them, and if there were, it could only be binding as an agreement to convert the interest into principal, at that date, so as to make the compounding operate prospectively; and that any agreement at that period to compound retrospectively, as between the mortgagor and mortgagees, is illegal and usurious, and so oppressive to the mortgagees, that equity will relieve them from it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-6\">5th. That the amount of the debt, as ascertained by said bond of April 1822, could only have been made out by the exaction of illegal and usurious interest, or by such compounding of the debt as the law regards as oppressive, as between mortgagor and mortgagee, and the appellees are entitled to be relieved against it, at least to the full extent of the usury or exaction, and to have the mortgage debt ascertained, either by computing them with simple interest down to the present period, or if there be proof of any agreement, then by computing them with simple interest down to the period of such agreement, if any, and with simple interest from that period forward on the compounded sum.</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-7\">6th. That as to the appellee, <em>George Fitzhugh, Jr., </em>the evidence shows, that there never was any agreement on his part to compound, nor any pretence of right to compound; and that, notwithstanding the order for decree, <em>pro confesso, </em>against him, the decree, as to him at least, was erroneous and must therefore be reversed, either generally, or as to him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>7th.

That the title of his intestate, <em>Neth, </em>as assignee of the entire interest of <em>Rebecca Dulany, </em>under the deeds of 1791 and 1805, is established by the order of this court, passed on the former appeal, and independently of that order, is clearly made out by the pleadings and proofs in the cause.</p>\n<p data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-7\">2.

The assignment was made in 1806. It has been acquiesced in, and recognized by the appellants, from that time, until the filing of their notes in this court, a period of more than thirty years. They have for about twenty-five years, continued, from time to time, to pay to the said assignee, and those claiming under him, interest due on the <em>debts </em>assigned. <em>Daniel D. Fitzhugh, </em>one of the appellants, in his answer, in express terms, admits the assignment of the <em>debts </em>due to the said <em>Rebecca Dulany, </em>to <em>Thomas Buchanan; </em>and three, of the four appellants, by a bond and agreement, under their hands and seals, the first dated in 1822, the second in 1825, by necessary implication, and also in the said agreement, in express terms, admit the assignment and its validity, and in like manner make the same admission in 1835, in their instructions to the auditor to state the accounts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>It is seen, then, that the objection raised by the counsel for the appellants, on this question, presupposed, that <em>Neth </em>was the assignee of both the debts; and that such was the extent and character of the assignment, was held by the court as an unquestionable proposition. It is manifest, indeed, that <em>Rebecca Dulany </em>became, by force of the mortgage deed of the 27th April 1805, the holder of the two debts; and it is equally clear, we think, that the entire interest of <em>Mrs. </em>Dulany, passed to <em>Judge </em>Buchanan, by the assignment of tire 11th December 1806; and that all the interest of <em>Buchanan, </em>was communicated to <em>Neth, </em>by the assignment of the 2nd March 1812.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The next question presented for our consideration, is that which respects the computation of interest, by converting it into principal, at the dates of the assignments, already referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The right of the appellee\u2019s intestate to the interest, as compounded by the auditor, stands on the settlement of the 22nd April 1822, the bond of 1822, and the agreement of the 26th January 1825.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">It is perfectly clear, as a legal proposition, that the holder of the mortgaged debt, was entitled to compound interest, on the principles adopted by the auditor, as against those parties who executed or assented to the papers, to which we have just adverted.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\"><em>Coote, </em>in his work on mortgages, 438, says:</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">\u201cWhen interest has once accrued, it becomes a debt. There is no longer, therefore, any objection to an agreement <em>inter partes, </em>that it shall be considered principal, and, therefore, carry interest. Indeed, it would be injurious to the mortgagor to establish the contrary, as it would remove an inducement to the mortgagee\u2019s permitting his principal to remain, and, consequently, equity has recognised such agreements; but there must be no extortion on the part of the mortgagee, or, otherwise equity will interpose to the relief of the mortgagor.\u201d The same proposition is maintained in <em>Brown vs. Barkham, </em>1 <em>P. W., </em>654. <em>Mowry vs. Bishop, </em>5 <em>Paig., </em>98. 1 <em>Johns. Ch. Rep., </em>13. 3 <em>Ohio R., </em>17.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">But, the doctrine announced by the Court of Appeals, on this question, renders the production.of authorities unnecessary. They say :\u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>\u201cThe 9th ground which is relied on by the appellants, for reversing the decree, is thus stated, because the mortgagors cannot, by any agreement, compound the interest on the principal debt, and render the whole a charge upon the lands, to the prejudice of those whose debts are secured by the same mortgage, and of the <em>Bank of Maryland, </em>a subsequent mortgagee. The first branch of this proposition has not been, and cannot be contended for; if by debts, secured by the same mortgage, is meant debts which are subsisting liens upon the mortgaged premises, and are obnoxious on the part of the plaintiff, if otherwise conflicting with his claim, to no other bar to their recovery, than that arising from the compounding of interest.\u201d And again they say :</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">\u201cThe point raised by the appellant\u2019s seventh ground, under the insufficient proofs in the cause, cannot be resisted. To bind the interest of <em>George Fitzhugh, Jr., </em>in the mortgaged premises, for the interest compounded at the dates of the assignments of the mortgage debts to <em>Buchanan </em>and <em>Neth, </em>his concurrence in the making of such assignments, must be proved, or his subsequent ratification of, or assent to such compounding, must be shewn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">An examination of the record will show, that tho defendants, <em>Mary </em>and <em>Daniel D. Fitzhugh, </em>admit by their answers, the execution of the instruments of 1822 and 1825, and as the defensive averments advanced by those defendants, for the purpose of extricating themselves from the operation of those papers, are not responsive to the bill, and are entirely unsupported by proof, they must be disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">The position occupied by <em>George Fitzhugh, Jr., </em>is different from that held by his co-defendants. The decree was taken against him <em>pro confesso, </em>and this being so, it is an established principle, that the allegations of the bill are to be received as true, so far as he is concerned. 10 <em>G. &amp;. J., </em>65. 1 <em>Hop. R., </em>476.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">As the bill charges, that <em>Lewis Neth </em>was the assignee of both of the debts in controversy, and that the agreement and bond of 1822 and 1825, were executed with the knowledge and consent of <em>George Fitzhugh, Jr., </em>those facts must be considered as proved against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>A point was raised by the counsel for the appellants, preliminary in its character: \u201cThat there is no averment in either of the complainant\u2019s bills, of an agreement or agreements, to compound between the complainant, or those whom he represents, and the defendants, or those whom they represent, and that, therefore, all evidence tending to show a compounding in point of fact, was inadmissible; the want of the proper averment in the bill having been excepted to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The bill charges, that the complainant\u2019s intestate was entitled to the mortgage debt, <em>with interest thereon; </em>and it was contended by the counsel for the appellants, that this averment did not authorise the introduction of the testimony, on which the appellee relies, as authorising his claim to compound interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">To this proposition we cannot consent. Under the averment, to be found in the bill upon this subject, the complainant was entitled to recover his debt, either with simple or compound interest, as might appear to be lawful and just upon all the circumstances of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">It follows from the views thus expressed, that we concur in opinion with the Chancellor, and think that his decree must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">decree affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
