J.) decreed:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-8\">The bill seeks for a sale of the real estate of <em>Thomas Stallings, </em>deceased, in order that the' proceeds thereof may be distributed among his heirs at law, of whom <em>Mrs. Chaney, </em>the wife of <em>David Chaney, </em>is one; which is resisted by <em>Lloyd Stallings, </em>one of the defendants, on tile ground, that before the institution of the suit, he, the defendant, pufchased of the complainants all then interest in the estate of the said <em>Thomas Stallings, </em>their father^ and that, therefore, they have no right to call for a sale of the estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-9\">The contract for a sale of the interest in the estate of <em>T. S., </em>and proof of the payment of part of the purchase money by <em>L. S., </em>may be seen by looking into the proceedings, and need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>here be more particularly referred to. It may be admitted, that the contract, or agreement entered into by <em>Chaney and wife </em>with <em>L. S, </em>on the 26th April 1830, was void as it respects <em>Mrs. Chaney. </em>Yet it by no means follows, that it was not a binding contract in regard to <em>C., </em>himself, who was competent to contract for the sale of their interest in the estate of <em>T. S. </em>which decended to his children, as stated in the complainant\u2019s bill. The reason why the contract was void in regard to <em>Mrs. C., </em>is, that she was a <em>feme </em>covert, who, in contemplation of law, could make no binding contract, and whose contracts consequently, are considered, both at law and in equity, as void and inoperative, and such as will not be enforced against her; but the husband has no such privilege, and although he can make no contract which can bind the wife\u2019s estate, unless it be by dec cl, duly executed and acknowledged, pursuant to the provisions of the act of Assembly, in such cases made and provided, yet he may make a contract for the sale of his wife\u2019s real estate, which would he binding on himself, and which the law would enforce against him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-5\">In this case, <em>C. and wife </em>agreed to sell her interest in her father\u2019s estate to the defendant, <em>L. </em>$., who paid them about $500, part of the purchase money, and yet <em>C. </em>is prosecuting a bill for the sale of <em>T. S\u2019s </em>real estate, for the sale of which to the defendant, <em>L. S., </em>he has paid him about $500, as before remarked; now, although this payment cannot affect, <em>Mrs. C\u2019s </em>right or title to the land in question, in case she should survive her husband, yet her husband cannot be permitted to sustain such a suit in the face of his agreement,, under the circumstances of the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-6\">If such a claim should be sustained, would it not be to allow him to keep his wife\u2019s estate, and also the purchase money, which the defendant has paid for it, and would not such a state of things be abhorrent to justice?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b337-7\">If <em>C. and wife </em>are entitled to the land, notwithstanding the agreement and payment aforesaid, let them prosecute their suit at law, where, perhaps, they may be entitled to recover the possession of the land, the legal title to it not having been conveyed by them to the defendant. But, this is an application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>to equity, and if the claim is in violation of equity and justice, how can it receive the sanction of this court? To get over this difficulty, the complainants contend, that the defendant failed to make his payments punctually at the times specified, and that, consequently, the contract ought not to be enforced against them, as time was made an essential part of the contract, and was an inducement with them to make it. Now, suppose this to be the true construction of the agreement, and that the court would not enforce it against tire complainants, after the failure of the defendant to make the payments at the periods fixed. upon by the contract, still it does not follow, that the complainants are entitled to recover in this case. What if the payments had been punctually made by the defendant, could the complainant, in that case, be entitled to the decree of this court? and yet it is apparent, that in such case, the rights of <em>Mrs. C. </em>would not be affected by it; and in the event of her surviving her husband, she would be entitled to recover, because the agreement, although binding on her husband, was, nevertheless, void as to her. But the defendant did not pay the whole of the purchase money, agreeably to the stipulations of the contract. He paid only part of it, say about $500, which the complainant, <em>David Chaney, </em>received, and still retains; and surely, if he could not claim a decision of this court for a sale of the land, in case the whole of the purchase money had been paid, because it would be iniquitous to sustain such a claim, it follows, that he is equally precluded, on principles of justice, from recovering under the circumstances of the case, whilst he retains the $500 which have been paid him. Shall he be permitted to affirm and disaffirm his contract, <em>uno fiatu9 </em>Even at law, such a proceeding could not be tolerated, much less in this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-5\">If <em>C. </em>contends, that the failure of the defendant to pay the purchase money at the times stipulated, released him from the \u25a0 obligation of the contract, and that he was no longer bound by it, he ought to have refunded, or at least offered to refund, what had been paid by the defendant on the contract. He has, however, done no such thing. He retains the paymeut made to him, and seeks to recover the whole of the land, as if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>no payment had been made to him. Now, is this just or equitable?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-5\">On a sale at law, the vendee, if he claims to rescind the contract, must restore, or, at least offer to restore, the articles purchased, before he can resist the claim of the vendor. The vendee will not be permitted to retain the things purchased, and at the same time defeat the vendor of the purchase money; and the converse of the proposition holds equally good. A vendor who has received part of the purchase money from the vendee, cannot rescind the contract of sale for any supposed default of the vendee, in not complying with the terms of sale, unless he shall have refunded, or, at least, offered to refund the payments made to him, and thereby put the vendee in the condition he was in when the contract was made. If such be the rule at law, how much stronger is it in equity, where the court professes to act on equitable principles, and whose decisions ought to have the sanction of equity and justice. Here, the defendant paid <em>C. </em>about $200 in cash, and gave him a negro woman, valued at $300, in all about $500, in part payment of the land. The negro woman <em>C., </em>sold for $500, and he retains the whole, and has not refunded, nor offered to refund a cent of it before the institution of the suit. What if the defendant had paid the whole of the purchase money, <em>Mrs. C. </em>would not have been any more bound by it than she is at present; but could her husband, in such case, be permitted to sustain a bill in equity, against his own contract for a sale of the land ? To sustain such a proceeding would be, to countenance dishonesty and fraud, which could not be tolerated in any court of justice. Now, if <em>Chaney </em>had a right to rescind the contract, because it was not punctually fulfilled by the defendant, surely he ought not to withhold what the defendant had paid on the contract; but before the institution of the suit, it was his duty to have refunded, or, at least, offered to refund what had been paid him. This would have been honest and just between the parties, and had he done so, would have removed the barrier, which now exists, to the relief prayed by the bill. The complainants come into court, and ask its interposition in their favor, but before the court will interpose, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>will take cave that injustice is not done to the defendant. Let them do justice to him before they ask for a decree against him. This court, in doing justice to the complainants, will not be unjust to the defendant. The dismissal of the bill, will not impair the rights of <em>Mrs. C., </em>but prevent her husband from doing injustice to the defendant. She may, if she survives her husband, recover her portion of her father\u2019s estate, and her heirs at law may do the same. Ey marriage, a husband gains a title to the rents and profits of his wife\u2019s real estate during the continuance of the coverture, except where he becomes tenant by the curtesy, in which latter case, he acquires a title to her estate during his life, 2 <em>Bl. Comm., </em>434; and chancery will not interfere with the marital rights of the husband over his wife\u2019s real estate, so long as he maintains her to the best of his ability, they living together. <em>Vaughan vs. Buck, 7 </em>Jurist, 388, <em>July No. of the Laio IAh., </em>237.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-6\">In regard to <em>C., </em>tiren, it was <em>quasi, </em>a sale of his own estate, for although the fee was in the wife, yet the property was his during the coverture; and if he could not vacate the sale of his own estate, without a repayment or tender of what had been paid by <em>Stallings, </em>on the purchase of it, neither can he in this cas\u00e9, for he was competent to sell it during the coverture, and if he could not vacate the sale of his own estate, without a repayment or tender of what had been paid by <em>Stallings, </em>on the purchase of it, neither can he in this case, for he was competent to sell it during the coverture, and the purchaser had a right to hold it for that period, with which right, equity will not interfere. The property was liable to be sold for <em>O\u2019s </em>debts, and if it had been sold under a <em>Ji. fa. </em>against him, the purchaser could not be rightfully disturbed by <em>Chaney and wife </em>during the coverture. For these and other reasons that might be suggested, the court is of opinion, that the bill cannot be sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-7\">On the 26th day of April 1837, this court dismissed die bill in this case, from which there was an appeal to the Court of Appeals, which remanded the cause to this court, with instructions, that the bill should be amended, so as to make it an application to the court for a sale or division of the land, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>the la.w of descents. This has been done, and .other proceedings had, as will appear by the record. It is .contended by the complainants, that the decree of the Court of Appeals is conclusive of their right to recover, and that this court has nothing left to it but to carry the decree into effect. If this court thought that the Court of Appeals intended to decide, definitively, the rights of the parties, there would not be a moments hesitation on our part to act in conformity to the views of the superior tribunal, whatever might be our own impression of the subject; we know it would be our duty to do so, and it. would he always highly gratifying to us to have the instructions of that high tribunal as our guide, in deciding controversies before us; so far, however, from deciding on the merits of the case, the Court of Appeals emphatically say, \u201cthat the substantial merits of the cause will not be determined by the reversing or affirming the decree of <em>Allegany </em>county court, setting as a court of equity, and that the purpose of justice will be advanced by remanding the said cause for further proceedings.\u201d The Court of Appeals, then, did not decide the cause on its merits, hut decided, that the complainants had misconceived their case, and remanded it under the provisions of the act of 1832, ch. 320, to this court, for the purpose of amending the pleadings, and causing such other proceeding to be had, under the direction of this court, as should be necessary for determining the cause upon its merits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-5\">On the 12th day of October 1844, decreed, that the complainant\u2019s bill be dismissed, with costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-6\">From this decree the complainants appealed to this court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b341-7\">The cause was argued before Archer, C.

If the interest or claim be such as a court of equity will specifically enforce, the remedy must be sought by the proper process of the Chancery court. For any other contract in relation to the land, the ordinary remedies at law, or in equity, as the case may require, will be open to tire party entitled.
