Because the same are no liens upon the land sold by the trastee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-14\">2. That the claims are barred by limitations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-15\">The claimants then gave proof, that <em>C. Winchester, </em>the tenant in possession, promised to pay the taxes aforesaid, within two or three months of his death, in 1839.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b453-16\">It was admitted, that during <em>Mr. Winchester's </em>time, there was always personal property of said <em>Winchester, </em>sufficient to pay these taxes; and that he died in <em>August </em>1S39; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>there was personalty sufficient for the payment of the tax bills upon the property, at the time the taxes became due, and for a long time afterwards; and that a judgment was recovered in <em>Baltimore </em>county court, in the name of <em>The Mayor and City </em>Council, on the 6th September 1S36, for the taxes of 1833, which is yet unsatisfied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-5\">On the 13th October 1843, the county court, (Magruder, A. J.,) decreed as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-6\">No petition has been filed in relation to these claims; but the question as to the liability of the fund in court, arising from the proceeds of sale of real estate, and that estate being the property upon which these taxes were imposed, has been submitted after argument for decision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-7\">It was conceded by the counsel, who argued in support of the right to claim against the fund for these taxes, and an admission of that fact has since been filed, that there was at all times, from the date of the imposition of those taxes, until the death of the late <em>George Winchester, </em>a sufficiency of personal property on the premises, which could be made liable for the payment of them, and it thence follows, necessarily, that there is no ground to charge the land with the payment of those taxes, <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore vs. Ann Chase, 2 Gill Sf John., </em>381, unless the act of 1840, chap. 63, can be construed to extend to taxes laid before its passage, and to be intended by the legislature, to operate retrospectively.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-8\">It is not meant to deny the right of the legislature to have passed such an act, provided they had clearly so expressed such intention; but in the absence of any such expression, we must adhere to the rule adopted by the courts in the exposition of statutes, that they are to be construed to apply only to cases after their passage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-9\">As the law stood, when those taxes were imposed, there could be no lien upon the land, because there was at all times a sufficiency of personal property on the premises, to satisfy the amount of taxes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b454-10\">The claims, then, must be disallowed, as against the fund in court, and the claimants must pay the costs arising upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>their proceeding in this cause, for the recovery of the same out of that fund, and the clerk is to tax the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-5\">From this decree the claimants appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-6\">The act of 1840, ch. G3, declared, that <em>The Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>may and shall have full power to provide, by ordinance or otherwise, for the prompt collection of taxes due to the city of <em>Baltimore, </em>\u00e1nd to that end, may and shall have power to sell real, as well as personal property, any thing in any act of Assembly to the contrary notwithstanding.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b455-7\">The cause was argued before Archer, C.
