The defendant appeared, and after oyer of the writ, pleaded <em>nul tiel </em>record, and limitations, in which latter plea it was alleged, \u201c(hat the judgment, aforesaid, in the writ of <em>scire facias, </em>aforesaid mentioned, was had and recovered against him, the said defendant, on the \u2014 day of \u25a0-, and not after;\u201d and \u201cthat,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-12\">The plaintiff replied there was such a record, and demurred specially to the second plea, on which issues in law were joined.

The allegation, in which the blanks are left, forms a customary part of such a plea, and cannot be regarded as a wholly immaterial part of it. It is repugnant to nothing which precedes or succeeds it; and is an appropriate allegation in connection with the judgment to which it relates. The omission to fill up the blanks in question, we therefore think, formed a fit subject for a special demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
