Ellicott </em>filed his petition, alleging, that in March 1839, <em>William E. George </em>died, leaving a last will, devising his estate to all his children; but directed, that if his son, <em>Philip T. George, </em>desired to carry on the business in which the testator was engaged, he should have his whole real and personal property for that purpose, being accountable to his brothers and sisters for their shares; and constituted <em>Eliza </em>George, <em>P. T. George, </em>and said <em>Benjamin H. Ellicott, </em>his executors; that the two latter only qualified, and gave as securities, <em>Samuel, Andrew, </em>and <em>J. H. Ellicott; </em>that <em>P. T.

Ellicott, </em>alleged, that he did not insist, that the estate of his intestate must be held as security, for the faithful performance, by the executors, of <em>W. E. G., </em>for their duties as such, but that such view of the responsibility of the estate of his intestate is taken by others; that he has been informed that able counsel are of that opinion; that a distribution of his intestate estate has not been made, is to be attributed, exclusively, to the circumstances stated in the petition, and this answer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b448-7\">A second petition was filed by <em>John D. Early and wife, </em>legatees and distributees of <em>William E. George, </em>alleging, that they had not been paid, and that a large balance was due them; drat they have sued the executors of <em>W. E. G., </em>and their securities, for die money due them; that their action was then pending; that the estate of <em>Samuel Ellicott </em>was still liable to them.

George, </em>their, and each of their heirs and assigns, share and share alike.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-6\">\u201cIt is further my will and desire, that my real estate, and personal estate, shall not be sold, but that the value of the personal property and estate, and debts, shall be ascertained in the usual manner, and by appraisement, and the value of my real estate by my executors.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-7\">\u201cIt is further my will, that if my son, <em>P.

T. G., </em>to carry on his father\u2019s business, and take the estate at the appraisement under the will, dated 8th August 1839, was filed in the Orphans court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-10\">It was admitted, that the debts due from <em>W. E, George, </em>were paid by his executor, <em>P. T. G.; </em>that the debts due from <em>Samuel Ellicott </em>were paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-11\">The Orphans court, (Kemp, C. J., and Reabel, A. J.,) decreed, that the said <em>P. T. G., </em>having made his election under his father\u2019s will to take his estate, the testamentary bond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>on that estate was not responsible to his <em>children; </em>that no part of the estate of <em>Samuel Ellieott, </em>ought to be retained to meet liability on that bond, and that <em>N. H.

H. Ellieott, </em>administrator, appealed to this court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b450-6\">The cause was argued before Archer, C. J., Dorsey, Magruder and Martin, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b450-7\">By R. Johnson for the appellants, and</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b450-8\">By G. L. Dulany for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b450-9\">Magruder, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ajoj\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">This was an application by the defendant, one of the representatives of <em>Samuel Ellieott, </em>to order the administrator of the latter, to make a distribution of his estate. The administrator appeared, and in his answer objects to the distribution, upon the ground, that his intestate was security in the bond given by the executors of one <em>William E. George, </em>and as such, may be answerable to a large amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-11\">Upon the same ground, the distribution of the estate of <em>Samuel Ellieott, </em>is resisted by one of the children, and a legatee of the said <em>George. </em>Upon no other ground is the distribution opposed. Indeed, it is admitted, that all other claims against <em>S. Ellieott, </em>except to a very inconsiderable amount, have been discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-12\">The will of <em>George </em>is introduced into the record, which also furnishes evidence, that <em>Philip T. George, </em>the executor, has accepted of the estate, upon the terms mentioned in that will. This court is of opinion, that the children of <em>William E. George, </em>have no claim on the bond given by his executor, and, therefore, the matters stated in the answer, furnish the executor with no reason for delaying to distribute the estate of the said <em>Samuel Ellieott.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b450-13\">DECREE AFFIRMED WITH COSTS.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
