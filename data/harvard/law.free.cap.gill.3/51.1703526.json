That on the 1st August 1831, the said <em>George Torrance, </em>for the use of a certain <em>Wm. Fulford, Wm. Borman </em>and <em>Alexander Berman, </em>instituted an action of debt in <em>Baltimore </em>county court against <em>J. A. B., W. B. jB., E. S. B., </em>and <em>R. S.

That after the contract aforesaid, between the said <em>Eliza S.

That afterwards, to wit, on the 7th May 1834, die said <em>William </em>and <em>Alexander Borman </em>having taken the place of the said <em>William Fulford, </em>as endorser upon the said promissory note of <em>George Torrance </em>for $11,000, the said <em>William Fulford </em>and <em>George Torrance </em>assigned to the said <em>William </em>and <em>Alexander Borman, </em>said mortgage of the 13t\u00edi August 1830, from said <em>George Torrance </em>to <em>William Fulford, </em>and also a certain other mortgage of the 21st August 1829, herewith filed as a part of this bill for property acquired by said <em>Torrance, </em>whether from his fadier or mother, or both, die object of which mortgages was to secure the said debt of $11,000. That on the 30th November 1831, the said <em>Torrance, </em>for die purpose of securing another sum of $7,500, by him borrowed from the said <em>Willia/m </em>and <em>Alexander Borman, </em>executed another mortgage to them of his undivided fifth in the said <em>Warren Factory </em>and appurtenances, also subject to his bond of conveyance, to the said <em>Eliza 8.

L., A. L. </em>and <em>W. F. </em>filed their hill on the equity side of <em>Baltimore </em>county court, a court of full, complete and competent jurisdiction in the premises, against the said <em>G.

T. </em>to the said <em>Lormans </em>and <em>Fulford, </em>as hereinbefore mentioned, for the purpose of paying the debt due to the complainants in said last mentioned hill; that to this bill the said <em>G, T. </em>immediately appeared, and voluntarily came into the said <em>Baltimore </em>county court, and confessed the said bill, and consented to a decree for the sale of the property therein referred <em>to. </em>That thereupon, a certain <em>Philip T.

Co., </em>were by order of court, on die 13th May 1835, admitted <em>nisi </em>defendants to said bill; that thereupon the said <em>Dawson </em>and the <em>Warren M. Co. </em>answered the said bill, also agreed to a sale, and that the proceeds thereof should be brought into court to abide the decision thereof. That on the 1 Oth October 1835, a decree was passed in said cause by <em>Baltimore </em>county court, that the property in the proceedings mentioned be sold, and that upon payment of the purchase money, the trustee appointed to make such sale should convey to the purchaser or purchasers thereof, his, her, or their heirs, the property and estate to him, her, or them sold, free, clear, and discharged from all claims of the parties thereto, complainants and defendants, and those claiming by, from, or under them, or either of them; and the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>trustee was thereby ordered to bring into the said court the money arising from said sale to be distributed under the direction of <em>Balti/more </em>county court. That afterwards, to wit, on the 16th January 1836, the trustee, under the decree of the 10th October 1835, proceeded to make sale of the property, ordered to be sold thereby, and, in fact, sold the said one-fifth part of the <em>Warren Factory </em>and its appurtenances, and the title and interest of the said <em>G. T. </em>therein, for the sum of $7000, to the <em>Warren Manufacturing </em>Company, by the said <em>Frederick Dawson, </em>and sold certain other property to the amount of $10,230, to the said <em>William Lorman </em>and <em>Alexander Lorman, </em>by the name of <em>William Lorman Sf Son. </em>That the gross sum of such sales amounted to $17,230, and on the 26th February 1836, said sales were finally ratified and confirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b64-5\">And now your complainants show, that instead of the proceeds of said sales being distributed in due course of law and equity, by <em>Baltimore </em>comity court, according to the reservation of the decree of the 10th October 1835, and the proceeds of the property sold by <em>G. T. </em>to <em>E. S. B., </em>applied as they should have been, to the extinguishment of the debt due by her to <em>T., </em>on her bond of April 1839, and which he had assigned to the said <em>Lorman </em>and <em>Fulford, </em>who were merely his sureties and creditors, with notice of the equities of the said <em>E. S. B., </em>and to that extent, to the relief of the said sureties of the said <em>E. S. B., </em>on her bond to <em>T., </em>and instead of applying the proceeds of the other part of said property, in payment of the debt due by said <em>T. </em>to <em>F. </em>and <em>L., </em>and in relation to which, these complainants charge, that the said <em>L. </em>and <em>F. </em>had a prior right and lien over and before the said <em>Dawson </em>and the said <em>Warren M. Co., </em>as assignees of <em>John T. Ban', </em>and that it ought in equity, to have been applied to the debt of the said <em>Totrance, </em>due <em>Lorman </em>and <em>Fulford, </em>and in fact, the said <em>William </em>and <em>Alexander Lorman, </em>and <em>Frederick </em>and <em>Philip T. Dawson, </em>instead of permitting the sales of the said <em>Torrance's </em>property, to be distributed according to the due course of equity intercepted the same; and on the 26th February 1836, agreed that the sum of $10,130, and no more, should be applied to the payment of the sum then due on the said mortgages, exhibited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>with the bill in <em>Baltimore </em>county court, and that for the remaining balance due on said mortgage, the said <em>William </em>and <em>Alexander Lorman </em>should look to certain property of <em>James A. Buchanan, </em>in or near to the town of <em>Wheeling, </em>in the State of <em>Virginia, </em>which had been attached under a judgment assigned to said <em>W. </em>and <em>A. Lorman, </em>by <em>G. T., </em>as a further security for said mortgage debt; and the said P. <em>T. </em>and P. <em>D. </em>agreed, that they would never, in any manner, interfere with the said property of <em>J. A. Buchanan, </em>near <em>Wheeling; </em>and it was also further agreed, that the balance of the said proceeds of sale, in the hands of said trustee, should be applied under the direction of that court, without any other or further Claim whatever, being made thereto, or to any part thereof,- by them, or either of them, and that the said P. and P. <em>Dawson </em>should hold the said balance free,- clear and discharged from all and every claim thereto, by the said <em>William </em>and <em>Alexander Lorman; </em>or either of them; that upon the final audit of the said proceeds,- by <em>Baltimore </em>county court, the sum of $10,130 was awarded to the said <em>William </em>and <em>Alexander Lorman, </em>and the sum of $6432.15, to the <em>Warren Manufacturing Company; </em>and that it also appears by the auditor\u2019s report in said cause, that the equity of redemption of the said <em>George </em>Torrance, remaining after the execution of his mortgages to said <em>W. </em>and <em>A Lorman, </em>had been sold to to the said <em>Warren M. Co., </em>and said Company entitled to the balance of the proceeds after payment of said <em>Lorman\u2019s </em>debt, and <em>that </em>on the 26th'March 1836, the said audit and distribution of the proceeds was finally ratified by <em>Baltimore </em>county court; that afterwards, the said <em>T. </em>filed his petition in <em>Baltimore </em>county court, objecting to the allowance of the said sum of $6422.15\" to the <em>Warren M. </em>Co.,- and thereupon, <em>W. </em>and <em>A.

B., </em>and being well aware that the said <em>James A. </em>Buchanan, and the complainants in this cause, were the sureties of the said <em>Eliza 8. B., </em>and therefore interested in the application of the proceeds of the one undivided fifth part of the <em>Warren Factory, </em>to the payment of the said <em>T\u2019s </em>debt to <em>W. </em>and <em>A. L., </em>and <em>F., </em>to the end that the right and title of the said <em>G.

By the contract of the defendants the sales were paid to <em>Dawson, </em>in extinguishment of liens due from <em>Torrance. </em>A new bargain is struck in opposition to the securities, and it took from them property on which they might properly rely,</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b76-8\">David Stewart, for the appellees,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AT-\">in support pf the decree insisted:</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b76-9\">1. That tbe purchaser, under the decree of <em>Baltimore </em>county court, if in truth he acquired any interest in the premises attempted tp be sold, purchased the same with notice of the agreement between <em>Torrance </em>and <em>Eliza, </em>S., <em>Buchanan, </em>and took subject to the equities of the latter arising out of that agreement. The heirs of the latter may, therefore, enforce a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>specific execution of the agreement as against the purchaser under the decree, on paying the balance of the purchase money due on the agreement to the persons entitled thereto.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b77-5\">2. That the mortgages from <em>Torrance </em>to <em>Fulford </em>and <em>Lorman, </em>under which the sale was professedly made, assigned merely parcels of the purchase money due from <em>Eliza 8. Buchanan </em>to <em>Torrance, </em>on the agreement between them, as indemnities to the said assignees against liabilities they had assumed for <em>Torrance, </em>with the benefit of the vendor\u2019s lien on the property sold by <em>Torrance </em>to <em>Eliza 8. Buchanan.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b77-6\">3. That the sale made under the decree of <em>Baltimore </em>county court could, therefore, operate only as an assignment of so much of the purchase money due from <em>Eliza 8. Buchanan </em>to <em>Torrance, </em>as was equivalent in value to the proceeds of sale made under the- decree, or at the extent to the balance due on the mortgages, for satisfaction of which the sale was made. The right to demand payment of the residue of the original purchase money yet exists in <em>Torrance, </em>or <em>Lorman </em>as his assignee of the judgment stated in the proceedings.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b77-7\">4. That if the agreement is to be rescinded at all, it ought to be upon the equitable conditions of payment by the complainants, as representatives of the purchaser, of interest on the purchase money, during the time the possession of the premises remained in the hands of the original purchaser, and an equivalent in value for deterioration of the property during the continuance of such possession.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b77-8\">5. That the decree in <em>Virginia </em>was an appropriation of the property decreed to be sold in payment of this debt, and the vendor is entitled to the benefit of this decree, since the value of the property so appropriated, together with the proceeds of sales subsequently made, are not equal to the balance of purchase money yet due.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b77-9\"><em>E. 8. .B </em>bargained with her* partner and co-shareholder, <em>Torrance, </em>and so became sole proprietor of the <em>Warren Factory. </em>Upon that purchase she was in default $19,344, at the time of the judgment on the bond, which was payable by instalments. The property was mortgaged subj ect to her contract, and it was assigned to <em>Lorman, </em>liable to the same incumbrance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>There was no original inherent defect in the title of <em>Torrance. </em>It was free from all exception, and the mortgage gave notice of <em>Buchanan's </em>equities. The proceedings in equity <em>by Lorman, </em>were not against <em>Buchanan. </em>A purchaser may presume the court has investigated the title of parties, <em>Bennett vs. Hamill, </em>2 <em>Sch. &amp; Lef., 577, </em>and there is no right to question a sale from a title not in issue, nor in any way affected by the decree, <em>Haines et al. vs. Beach, </em>3 <em>J C. R., </em>459. The court makes no warranty. It is only the title of parties whieh is sold. The purchaser only taires that. <em>Brown vs. Wallace &amp; Mitchell, </em>4 <em>G &amp; J., </em>492. <em>Miss B. </em>was not affected by that sale, it only transferred the vendor\u2019s lien. The purchaser might be forced, by <em>Miss B., </em>to transfer the title to her, A purchaser, with notice, is bound by the agreement, and must perform it. On the question of notice, he cited <em>Ghiselin and W. vs. Fergusson, </em>4 <em>H. &amp; J, </em>522. <em>Champion vs. Brown, </em>6 <em>J. C. R., </em>398. <em>Graves vs. Graves, </em>1 <em>A. K. Marshall, </em>165. <em>Broadwell vs. King, </em>3 <em>B. Munroe, 451. Wadsworth vs. Windell, 5 J. C. R., </em>224, 229. The mortgage to <em>Lorman, in terms, </em>gave notice of <em>E. 8. B's </em>right. The advertisement of sale gave it; the deed of the trastee so conveyed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b78-5\">On the fourth point he insisted, that the parties to the original purchase must be placed in <em>statue </em>quo, and on this point he cited <em>Bullock vs. Bemiss, </em>1 <em>A K. Marsh., </em>433. <em>Brockenbrough and Taylor vs. Blythe's Ex'rs, </em>3 <em>Leigh., </em>619. <em>Williams vs. Rogers, 2 Dana., </em>375. <em>Turner vs. Clay, </em>3 <em>Bibb, </em>53. <em>Bumpus vs. </em>Platner, 1 <em>J.

The obligee had a right to sell <em>Miss B's </em>bond, as much as any other part of his estate. It was not to be dormant in his hands, and unavailable,, and hence proceedings to enforce it are not to be disturbed..</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b79-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>T.

Their third point relies on a mistake in the application of the fund arising from the sales of the <em>Warren Factory </em>under a decree, which is no ground of complaint against the decree itself. If they seek the application of that fund to theiriselves, they admit the validity of the decree. The law of the <em>second </em>point of the appellant is denied.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-6\">What is the justice <em>of </em>this case, the morality of this bill? <em>Torrance's </em>title is <em>not </em>questioned. He sold his interest, one-fifth of the factory, to <em>Miss B., </em>on ten years credit, payable by instalments, and put her in possession. She relinquished to the purchaser under <em>Lorman's </em>decree in 1836. She paid nothing for use and occupation, nor for interest, and the factory now is valueless. Her representatives propose to sponge off the price and interest, and return the property in a dilapidated condition. If they had proposed to pay for use and occupation, there might be something in it. Then as to the pretext for setting aside the sale: they say, we cannot give them the thing we contracted to give them. Then, how stands the case. Torrance, a creditor for $60,000, with a lien on the property, makes a public sale; and discloses his contracts. All the mortgages disclose his right. He practices no injustice. <em>Lorman </em>sells his title; such as he had, no more, it is subject to <em>Miss Buchanan's </em>contract. The purchaser is affected with notice of all that appears in the record of the cause, in which the decree for a sale was obtained.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-7\">It is not true that the property was placed beyond <em>Miss B's </em>reach. She refuses to pay the purchase money; refuses to pay the assignee of her bond. <em>Lorman </em>seeks his right; he falls upon an unskilful attorney, who instead of proceeding by execution on the judgment at law, in <em>Baltimore </em>county court, files a bill, and the vendee improperly surrenders the possession, under \u00e1 decree to which she was no party. This surrender is now wielded as a defence to her contract of purchase; is in fraud of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b79-8\">Then can the contract be rescinded? <em>Torrance's </em>title was originally good, a supervening defect is now relied on to defeat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>it- Can <em>Miss B. </em>get a legal title? The vendor is a trustee for the vendee; a purchaser from vendor is a trustee with notice, and must execute the trust. <em>Lorman </em>might have sought a foreclosure, and cut off <em>Torranc\u00e9. </em>But he takes a decree for a sale. He sells. Does the purchaser take any better title than <em>Lorman </em>had? Not at all. <em>Miss B </em>had a right to demand a title on payment. Then who is entitled to the balance of the purchase money. The delinquent purchaser should only be indemnified. The bill does not shew who is entitled to the purchase money. <em>Lorman </em>purchased a debt from <em>Dawson, </em>who bought the estate, and it would be a fraud on <em>Dawson </em>to claim the whole estate. The vendor may extinguish his lien, and still claim the purchase money <em>Aymar vs. Bill, 5 John. C.

The parties must be reinstated; <em>Torrance </em>is entitled to his land: to something'for dilapidation. It was a flourishing manufactory when sold. To put us back in 1845, will not repay us. The property should be restored to its original condition. It is like a covenant to repair or to rebuild There must be compensation for seven years use of the estate. There was no actual fraud, and <em>Miss B. </em>must respond as tenant in possession. <em>Frisba vs. Hoffnagle, </em>11 <em>John., </em>50. <em>McCay vs. Carrington, 1 McLean, </em>61 <em>Garnett vs. Macon, </em>6 <em>Call, </em>368.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-6\">As to the <em>Virginia </em>decree,, it is conclusive, it is in <em>rem., </em>if no defence could be maintained to it in <em>Virginia, </em>none could be here.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b80-7\">By Reverdy Johnson,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AN\">in reply:</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b80-8\">On the former appeal, <em>Buchanan vs. Torrante, </em>11 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>342, only two objections were taken,- and it was remanded to cure those defects. The equity of the case was not denied, and upon this appeal, the general principles involved since the defects of the first were cured, are not changed. <em>Torrance </em>consented to a decree for a sale, and <em>Dawson </em>bought clear of all the parties to the cause, and all persons claiming under them.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>The purchaser took free of <em>Torrance's </em>title, took an absolute title, and then came the agreement to divide the proceeds, irrespective of these complainants. The court, in the former case, under the act of 1832, ch. 302, sect. 6, necessarily assumed, that the sale to <em>Miss B. </em>ought to be rescinded, or they would not have remanded the cause. That act required them to look at the justice of the case, and no relief could be granted, without determining that the sale should be rescinded. That is not now an open question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-5\">The surety of tile purchaser cannot be made to pay where there is a failure of consideration. The rule of equity cannot be denied as to an entire failure. <em>Garnett vs. </em>Macon, 6 <em>Call., </em>367, 368.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-6\">A vendor calling for specific performance, must be able to grant such an estate as he agreed to give. What is the cloud over the title here? We cannot demand title until 1839, nor he demand the principal of the purchase money. At the time stipulated for compliance, the vendor must he able to comply. How is this objection met? 'What will the purchaser, under <em>Torrance's </em>decree, say to us? I have bought out all his interest in the land. In 1835, he had the legal title, it, was sold, and <em>Torrance, </em>could not comply with his bond to convey. Gan this defendant answer us by saying, we may get the title from the purchaser, under the decree, or that possibly or probably, we may get it. Will <em>Torrance's </em>deed give a full title? Who is to decide that? Will the purchaser do it favorably to us? No. He will say he will not, and may rely on his decree. He may rely on the presumptions of the decree. This court cannot disturb his possession, without a bill. We might,, perchance, recover it. Then is a vendee to pay for land, which he must go into equity against strangers, to compel a title to be given to him, after he has parted with his money? To relieve us from this difficulty, <em>Borman </em>should have made these complainants parties, as <em>Torrance's </em>vendee, but that bill disregards us altogether. As respects <em>Torrance, </em>the property is gone, and that entitles us to satisfaction of the judgment at law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-7\">Then, what does equity impose on us? If, is said, account for rents and profits. It must appear, that the vendee has, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>might have received them. Possession of the estate is not stated in the bill in answer. Defects in answers are not cured by the act of 1832, ch. 302. No averment in answer of receipts of profits. If we are to account, how are we to account? The vendee here, is not to account for interest, but if for any thing, only for what he has made. This is a principle of justice. It was a ruinous concern. There can be no claim for interest where the debt is gone. The cause cannot be remanded twice to make a better case. There is no proof of dilapidation. Difference in price, is no proof of bad management. The possession is gone, which is the fault of the vendor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b82-5\">As to the proceedings in <em>Virginia, </em>we are entitled to have the judgment at law entered satisfied, and the sale rescinded. The defence was not disclosed to the <em>Virginia </em>court. <em>E. </em>S. <em>Buchanan </em>not a party there. Then as the party claiming the <em>Virginia </em>land resides in <em>Maryland, </em>his conscience may be affected here. No jurisdiction over the land, but there is full, over his person. Where a personal remedy may be decreed, or the subject matter is here, this court may act. <em>Lorman is </em>in no belter situation than <em>Torrance. </em>If against equity to take <em>B\u2019s Maryland </em>lands, it is equally so to take his <em>Virginia </em>estate. Having lost the remedy in <em>Maryland </em>against the vendee, his sureties cannot be pursued in <em>Virginia.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b82-6\">Archer, O. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"At3\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">The complainants seek to vacate a sale made by <em>George Torrance </em>to <em>Eliza S. Buchanan, </em>of one undivided fifth part of the <em>Warren Factory, </em>on the 16th day of April 1829, on which day she executed her bond for the purchase money, and to enjoin the defendants from proceeding to collect the amount of the purchase money. Suit having been instituted in <em>Baltimore </em>county court on this bond, judgment was confessed by the defendants on the 12th of December 1832, and proceedings having been instituted in the superior court for the county of <em>Ohio, </em>in the State of <em>Virginia, </em>as a court of equity, to subject certain funds and lands of the obligors in the bond to sale for the payment of the said judgment, and a decree having passed thereon, and certain portions of the property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>having been sold, <em>the </em>bill further prays, that the defendants may be enjoined from further proceeding upon their decree in the superior court of chancery, for the county of <em>Ohio, </em>in the State of Virginia, that the sale reported in said cause of <em>James Buchanan\u2019s </em>land may be vacated, and the said <em>William </em>and <em>Alexander Jjorman </em>enjoined from receiving a conveyance for-said land, or in any manner alienating or disposing of the same; or that the said <em>William </em>and <em>Alexander Lorman </em>may be decreed to hold the same in trust for the heirs of <em>James A. Buchanan, </em>or his assigns, and for general relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">It appears, from the bill, answer and exhibits, in the case, that after tire contract of sale made by <em>Torrance </em>to <em>Eliza Buchanan, </em>that Torrance, on 13th of August 1830, mortgaged his interest in the property sold to <em>William Eulford, </em>to indemnify him as endorser for <em>Torrance </em>to the extent of $11,000, and on tlie 30th of November 1831, he mortgaged the same property to <em>William, </em>and <em>Alexander Lorman, </em>to secure the payment of i!p7500. These mortgages, on their face, were declared to be subject to the operation and effect of, as well a bond executed by <em>Torrance </em>to <em>Eliza Buchanan, </em>on 20th April 1829, for the conveyance to her upon the terms therein expressed of the aforesaid one undivided fifth of the <em>Warren Factory, </em>as of a mortgage of said interest, in connexion with other property executed by <em>Torrance </em>to <em>Fulford, </em>on 13th of August 1830. On the 17th of May 1834, <em>William Fulford </em>and <em>George Torrance </em>executed an assignment of the mortgage of the 13th of August 1830, to <em>W. </em>and <em>A. Lorman. </em>On the 12th of May 1835, <em>W. </em>and A. <em>Lorman </em>filed their bill in <em>Baltimore </em>county court against <em>George Torrance </em>for a foreclosure and sale of the property thus mortgaged. To this bill <em>Eliza Buchanan </em>was not made a party, but the defendant, <em>Torrance, </em>voluntarily appeared, confessed the facts in the bill, and consented to a decree. On the 10th of October, <em>Baltimore </em>county court decreed a sale. On the 28th of January 1836, the trustee appointed to sell the mortgaged premises reported the sale to the court, and the same was, by the court, on <em>the </em>26th of February 1836, finally ratified and confirmed. On the 1st of July 1836, <em>John Glenn, </em>the trustee, in pursuance of the decree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>conveyed to the purchaser the one undivided fifth of the <em>Warren Factory, </em>thus sold to the purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Anterior to the above decree in <em>Baltimore </em>county court, <em>P. F. Dawson, F. Dawson, </em>and the <em>Warren Manufacturing Company, </em>alleging that <em>John T. Barr </em>had recovered a judgment against <em>George Torrance, </em>which was assigned to them, prayed to be, and were, by the court, made parties; and in then-answer to the bill of <em>W. </em>and <em>F. Borman, </em>allege, that the complainants have other securities for their debt, consent to a sale, and pray that the money may be brought into court to abide the decision of the court. The proceeds of sale amounting to $17,230, were distributed, $10,130, to <em>W. </em>and <em>A. Borman; </em>to the <em>Warren Factory, </em>$6422.15, by an agreement between <em>W. </em>and <em>A. Borman, </em>and P. <em>F. Dawson </em>and <em>F. Dawson, </em>filed on the 11th March 1836. By this agreement no more than $10,130 was to be applied to the payment of the mortgages exhibited in the cause; and it was agreed, that for the remaining balance due on said mortgages, <em>W. </em>and <em>A. Borman </em>were to look to certain property of <em>James A. Buchanan, </em>in or near the town of <em>Wheeling, </em>which had been attached, &lt;fcc.; and in consideration of $1000, P. <em>F. </em>and <em>F. Dawson </em>agree, that they will never interfere with <em>Buchanan\u2019s </em>property in <em>Viringia, </em>and <em>W. </em>and <em>A. Borman </em>agree, that the balance of the proceeds of sale shall be paid to P. <em>F. </em>and <em>W. Daioson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Anterior to these proceedings in <em>Baltimore </em>county court, as a court of equity, to wit, on the 12th of December 1832, <em>Torrance, </em>for the use of <em>Fulford, W. </em>and <em>A. Borman, </em>had obtained a judgment in <em>Baltimore </em>county court against the securities of <em>Eliza Buchanan, </em>who had survived her, for the purchase money. And, also, anterior to said proceedings in <em>Baltimore </em>county court, as a court of equity, <em>George Torrance, W. </em>and <em>A. Borman, </em>and <em>W. Fulford </em>filed then bill in the superior court of law and equity for <em>Ohio </em>county, in the State of <em>Virginia, </em>against the securities of <em>Eliza Buchanan, </em>on her bond for the purchase money, alleging the execution of the bond, the judgment in <em>Baltimore </em>county court, that it was paid, and praying to subject the lands of <em>J. A. Buchanan </em>to sale, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>the payment of the said debt; and that funds in tbe bands of certain debtors of lire said <em>J. A Buchanan </em>should also be condemned for tbe payment of tbe said judgment. On the 6th of November 1835, the superior court for the county of <em>Ohio </em>decreed, that <em>Jumes </em>A. <em>Buchanan </em>should pay to the complainants in that proceeding, on a day named, the sum of $24,744, with legal interest until paid, and costs, tbe said sum being tbe amount then found to lie due on the bond of <em>Eliza </em>Buchanan, that a certain tract of land in tbe bill mentioned should be sold to pay tbe amount decreed, unless within tbe time specified, the said amount should be paid, and that tbe debtors of <em>James A. </em>Buchanan, who had been made parties, should pay to the complainants tbe sums in their hands belonging to him, and that as to the residue of tire lands mentioned in <em>the </em>proceedings, the bill should be retained for future decree; and as to the other defendants, the bill was dismissed. A sale under tbe decree was accordingly effected on the 30th day of July 1836, and tbe said <em>William </em>and <em>Alexander 'Lorman </em>became tbe purchasers. No further proceedings appear to have taken place in the <em>Virginia </em>court in the above case.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The complainants insist, that <em>Torrance, </em>by his acts, since the contract of purchase and sale, has disabled himself from complying with bis contract, in making a title to his vendee, and that as by sucb acts tbe consideration upon which the bond has been given has failed, the contract of sale should be rescinded, and that die judgment obtained upon the bond given for tbe purchase money should be perpetually enjoined.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">A vendee of an estate, in an unexecuted contract, is entitled to have that for which be contracts before be can be compelled to part with tire consideration bo agreed to pay. Tbe ability of the vendor to convey should exist, when bis duty, by the contract, arises to convey, or at the time of a decree for a conveyance, where time is not of the essence of the contract. And we conceive it to be equally clear, that a vendee is <em>not </em>bound to take an estate fettered with incumbrances, by which he may be subjected to litigation to procure bis title. These principles are so obviously just, that they must be considered as resting at the foundation of every well regulated system of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>The admissions and facts in the cause show, that mortgages were, after the contract of sale, executed to secure to the mortgagees the payment of $18,500; that a bill was filed to sell the mortgaged premises to pay the mortgagees, and that a decree passed to sell the same, and the trustee was directed by the decree to convey to the purchaser the right of the mortgagor and mortgagees, which was executed by a sale in January 1836, and a deed accordingly executed to the purchaser in July 1836; in strict conformity with the terms of the decree. To this decree the vendor voluntarily consented, and assented to part with his title There can be no doubt but that this decree and sale operated to extinguish the vendor\u2019s title, and to pass it to the purchaser. The argument which has been urged, that these mortgages and this decree only operated to pass so much of the purchase money due to <em>Torrance </em>as these mortgages called for, cannot be sustained, because, by the deeds themselves, the legal title passed to the mortgagees, and the mortgagees do not seek to subject to sale so much of the debt due to <em>Torrance </em>from <em>Eliza Buchanan </em>as would extinguish the mortgages, but they ask that the land mortgaged shall be sold to pay the amount of their lien, and the decree follows the prayer of the bill, and tire assent given by the answer of <em>Torrance, </em>and directs the land to be sold, and all the rights of the complainant and defendant to be conveyed, upon a compliance with the terms of sale to the purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">It thus appears, that when the contract of sale had ripened into maturity, <em>Torrance, </em>the vendor, by his \u2022 own consent, as evinced by his acts, and by his answer to the bill in equity, had stripped himself of every vestige of title, legal or equitable, in the land he had sold, and was, himself, in consequence of these proceedings, in no condition to comply with his contract to convey, and had no legal capacity to enforce a re-conveyance of the title to him, so that he might comply with his contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">It is true, that <em>Eliza Buchanan </em>was no party to these proceedings, and was, therefore, in no manner bound by them; and that she might, perhaps, have been competent, by applying as much of the purchase money as would have fully indemnified the purchaser, on the institution of proceedings in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>chancery have coerced a conveyance upon the ground, that the mortgages were originally made subject to her contract of purchase, and that the purchaser under the decree in the county court took his title with notice <em>of </em>this condition and agreement. But although this may be so, it by no means relieves the case from the difficulties which surround it. - For <em>Eliza Buchanan, </em>the vendee, was in <em>no </em>manner bound to take a title thus em barrassed, and to embark in a lawsuit against an adversary claimant, to obtain that, by delay, by perhaps expensive and protracted litigation, which, by the principles of law applicable to her contract, she had stipulated to -have without delay, and without expense or litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">It has been argued that the complainants could, at all events, be only entitled to relief by averring a readiness to comply on the part of the vendee. If the vendee had gone into equity to compel a specific execution of the contract, she must have averred a compliance, on her part, with the terms of the contract, or to have offered to pay the purchase money. But this bill seeks a rescission of the contract, on the ground of a want of title, and a payment, or offer to pay, was unnecessary. To have paid the purchase money could not have strengthened the equity of the complainant. \u201cChancery requires no act to be done in vain: it therefore, could not require the payment of the purchase money in this case, or an offer to pay it after the defects in the title had become known,\u201d <em>McLean, It. </em>86.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">The case of <em>Hart and Blight, </em>3 <em>Monroe, </em>273, has been cited by the appellees as a case analogous to this. But it will be found, from an examination of that case, that the vendor, at the time when the conveyance was to have been made, was in a condition to comply with his contract, and had, for a year afterwards, his title unembarrassed. It was the fault of the vendee that he had not, by paying the purchase money, put himself in a condition to demand a specific execution of the contract; and having been in default in complying with his contract, but for which he could have had a conveyance, it was conceived that he was not entitled to enjoin the collection of the purchase money, and that he should be diiven to his remedy against, the vendor, or against the purchaser under the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>But in the case before us, long before the stipulated time for the completion of the payments of the purchase money, and more than three years before the vendee could have called for the conveyance of the title, the vendor had parted with his title, and was utterly unable to comply with his contract to convey the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">If we are correct in the above views, the consideration' for the contract having wholly failed, Torrance, or his assignees, who stand in his stead, ought not to be allowed to recover the purchase money for the land sold, and as the judgment in the county court, sought to be stayed, was obtained on the bond for the purchase money, the defendants ought to be perpetually enjoined from instituting any proceedings to enforce its payment</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The complainants conceiving that a perpetual injunction on the judgment obtained in <em>Baltimore </em>county court ivould furnish them with inadequate relief, if the defendants were permitted to reap the fruits of a decree, obtained against <em>James A. </em>Buchanan, seek further to enjoin them from proceeding to execute the decree obtained in November 1835, in tire superior court of law and equity for <em>Ohio </em>county in the State of <em>Virginia.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">At the time of this decree, an equity existed on the part of the present complainants, to relief. The property sold was then encumbered with the mortgages to <em>Fulford </em>and <em>W. </em>and <em>A. Lorman; </em>the bill of the mortgagees had been filed in <em>Baltimore </em>county court, and a decree had been obtained to sell the mortgaged premises with the consent of <em>Torrance, </em>to satisfy these liens. Had these defences, which then all existed, been brought by way of defence to the notice of the court of equity in <em>Virginia, </em>we are bound to believe, that no decree would or could have passed against <em>James A. Buchanan, </em>until the estate sold should have been relieved from its embarrassments; and until the vendor, by so doing, could have shown himself in a condition to have passed the title to the vendee or her representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">That the court in <em>Virginia </em>possessed jurisdiction of the case decreed upon by them, has not been, and could not be denied. The decree must be considered as conclusive, as to the merits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>upon the equities existing anterior to the decree, and as having all the efficacy of a domestic judgment or decree, and it could not there be examinable upon any ground of equity existing prior to the decree; and as it could not, upon such ground, be examinable in Virginia, we are legally incompetent to examine it here. But if an equity has arisen subsequent to die decree, which would make it inequitable in the defendants to enforce that decree upon such new and subsequent ground of equity, not existing at the time of the decree, the law, as we apprehend, would fully justify the complainants in demanding the interposition of this court, in restraining the defendants from enforcing the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">When the decree in <em>Virginia </em>was passed in Nov. 1835, the period had not arrived, when by the terms of the contract, <em>Torrance </em>was bound to convey the land sold to the vendee. Ho had until 1839 to fulfil his part of the contract; although he had created incumbrances on the estate, he might have removed them, and although a decree had in October 1835, passed in <em>Baltimore </em>county court for the sale of the land, which by contract he was to convey, it was in his power to have prevented the sale, by paying the costs of the chancery suit, in <em>Baltimore </em>county court, and the liens for which the land had been decreed to be sold. This, however, he did not do, but suffered the decree to be executed by the sale of the land in January 1836, which event occurred after the decree of the superior court of <em>Virginia, </em>by which event occurring after said decree, he had effectually placed it, out of his power, either to convey, or to procure the title to the land he had contracted to convey.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Leaving out of view, therefore, all the acts of <em>Torrance </em>anterior to the date of the decree in <em>Virginia, </em>as upon this branch of the subject, not properly examinable, being foreclosed by the decree, the fact of the sale afterwards, by which he has disabled himself from complying with his contract, has created a new ground of equity in the complainants, which calls upon this court for the exercise of its restraining authority. This, however, can only be accomplished through the person of the defendant, who is within the jurisdiction of this court, and will not enable the court, as prayed by the complainants, to vacate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>any of the proceedings which have taken place under the <em>Virginia </em>decree. The defendant ought, therefore, to be enjoined seeking to enforce his decree, from accepting a conveyance of the lands purchased under said decree,- or if he has obtained a title, he ought to be decreed to reconvey the same to the heirs of <em>James A. Buchanan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">From the views we have taken of this case, the contract of purchase must be rescinded; and it is insisted,- that it should be upon the condition of paying to the vendor interest on the purchase money, and an equivalent in value for the deterioration of the property, during the continuance of the possession of the vendee.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">For any deterioration of the property sold by the improvidence, or culpable negligence of the vendee, her representatives should be answerable, but not otherwise. 2 Dana, 375.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">If the vendee were put in possession of the land, for all the time it was occupied by her, or her agents, she should be made' to account for the rents and profits. It has been contended, that interest should be allowed for the use of tire land, instead of rents and profits. The general rale may be, that when the purchaser is let into the possession and the perception of the rents and profits, he ought to pay interest on the purchase money; the buyer, being the owner of the land, must rest satisfied with the rents and profits, and the seller, the owner of the money, is entitled to interest. But as there is, generally, a great disproportion between the rents and profits, and tire interest of the purchase money, there would be no propriety in applying the rule to a case where the sale was rescinded. In such a case, a court of equity could never treat the vendor as entitled to the purchase money, or consider the vendee as the owner of tire land. These views will be found to be sanctioned by 3 <em>Leigh \u00a1 </em>647, 648; a different rule would seem to have prevailed in some of the States, 2 Dana, 375; but we cannot adopt the principle of that case, because we think it would operate injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">There is, however, iro legal evidence in the case, going to' shew the possession of the vendee, or its duration, or whether the deterioration of the property proceeded from casualty or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>negligence, or the value of the rents and profits, and therefore again remand the cause to the court of Chancery, that evidence may be taken on these subjects, in order that justice may be effectuated between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">CAUSE remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
