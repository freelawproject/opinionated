It was mailed for <em>St. Louis, </em>and an endorsement by <em>S, </em>forged, when it was passed to <em>B </em>of <em>Illinois, </em>for value, <em>bona fide ; </em>that house remitted it to if of <em>New York, </em>who remitted it to W of <em>Baltimore, </em>customers of, who deposited it with the <em>Merchants Bank </em>for collection, and obtained a credit for it in account, on the 2nd November. On the 4th, the <em>Marine Bunk </em>paid it to tho <em>Merchants Bank. </em>On the 21st, the former institution discovered the forgery, immediately gave notice to the latter bank, and demanded its payment. Between the 2nd and 18th November, <em>W </em>had always to his credit with the <em>Merchants Bank, </em>a larger sum than the amount of the certificate. On the 19th it was less, but on the 20th, 2lst and 22nd, it was again greater. There were daily transactions deposites and checks, by <em>W, </em>with and on the <em>Merchants Bank. </em>The <em>Marine Bank </em>having paid the certificate to the real payee, brought an action against the other bank, which it had also paid previously, to recover back the amount of the certificate.

Slrodtmann, </em>to whose order said certificate was made payable, was personally unknown to the officers of said hank, had never been among its customers, and never had any previous transaction with the bank. The hand-writing of <em>Strodlmann </em>was unknown to the officers of the bank, but it is admitted, that after the deposite was made, <em>Philip Littig, Jr., </em>Cashier of the <em>Marine Bank, </em>received from a brother-in-law of <em>J. Strodtmann, </em>a signature <em>of-Strodlmann, </em>as he stated at the <em>time, </em>which the said cashier pasted in the signature or firm book of the bank, but without informing any of the clerks of the bank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>that he had done so, nor was it, in his opinion, material, according to the usage of that hank, as certificates are usually given for the use of persons at a distance, as payees, whose signatures it is not the practice of the hank to obtain. It is admitted, that the signature of <em>J. Sirodimann, </em>pasted in the signature book as aforesaid, was genuine, and that the officers of said bank had access to said signature book, as well as to all the other books of the bank. The certificate was, on the 20th September 1839, enclosed by--in a letter directed to <em>St. Louis. </em>It was never received by said <em>Strodtmann, </em>but fell into the hands of some other person who forged thereon the endorsement of said <em>Strodtmann, </em>and passed it for a valuable consideration to <em>B. Godfrey Co., </em>of <em>Alton, </em>in the State of <em>Illinois, </em>who endorsed and transmitted to <em>Howes, Godfrey and Robinson, </em>of <em>New York, </em>who also endorsed and transmitted it to <em>Weld and Jenks </em>of <em>Baltimore, </em>who kept an account with the <em>Merchants Bank of Baltimore, </em>in which' account they were credited with this certificate on the 2nd day of November 1839, as cash, or endorsing and delivering said certificate to said bank. On the 4th November 1839, the <em>Merchants Bank </em>presented said certificate for payment at the <em>Marine Bank, </em>and obtained the amount thereof. On the 21st of November ensuing, the forgery was discovered upon the complaint of the brother-in-law of <em>Strodtmann, </em>that said certificate had never come to hand, although an unusually long time had elapsed since its transmission. Immediately upon the discoveiy, and upon the same day, the <em>Marine Bank </em>gave notice to the <em>Merchants Bank </em>of the forgery, and demanded a return of the money paid to tire <em>Merchants Bank </em>as the bearer of the certificate, the <em>Marine Bank </em>having since and before the institution of this suit paid <em>J. Strodtmann, </em>the payee of said certificate, the amount thereof. The question is submitted to the court upon the foregoing statement of facts, whether the <em>Marine Bank </em>is entitled to recover from the <em>Merchants Bank </em>the amount so paid.

Godfrey Co. </em>for sale, by and in possession of a young man introduced to me by <em>George W. Fox, </em>whose name was <em>John Strodtman. </em>The firm of <em>B. Godfrey Sf Co. </em>purchased said check on the 8th October, A. D. 1839, from <em>Mr. John Strodtman </em>aforesaid, and gave him for same one and a half per cent, premium, paying him two hundred dollars cash, and the balance in two notes of hand, payable forty days from the 8th of October 1839, and due on the 17th and 20th November 1839, which said notes were paid by said firm of <em>B. Godfrey Sf Co. </em>I knew a person by the name of <em>John Strodtman </em>in October 1839, who had resided with <em>Mr. George W. Fox, </em>near <em>Alton, </em>but who stated he was then residing in <em>St. Louis. </em>I do not know when he left <em>Alton, </em>or where he is now residing. I was first informed that the first endorsement on the back of said check was a forgery, through a letter from <em>Messi's. Howes, Godfrey </em>and <em>Robinson </em>to <em>B. Godfrey Sf Co., </em>dated New York, 29th November 1839, and received by them on the 13th December, A. D. 1839, about which time said letter was seen by me. Neither myself nor the firm of <em>B. Godfrey Sf Co., </em>to my knowledge, had any notice that said endorsement was a forgery at the time of the purchase of said check by said firm. To my knowledge, the purchase of, and payment for said check by <em>B. Godfrey Sf Co., </em>was a <em>bona fide </em>transaction. The firm were very careful in such purchases, and in this instance became satisfied that the interest in the check was really vested in the party offering it for sale. To the cross-interrogatory on the part of the plaintiff, he deposeth and saith, I first saw the check on or about the Stir day of October 1839, at the time it was offered for sale to <em>B. Godfrey Sf Co., </em>and in the possession of <em>Mr. John Strodtman. </em>I was at that time a partner in the house of <em>B. Godfrey Sf Co. </em>Said certificate was purchased by said firm of <em>B. Godfrey Sf Co., </em>and the agreement for price, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>the payment for the check, were made in <em>Alton, </em>as stated by me in my answer in chief. I had no previous acquaintance, nor had <em>B. Godfrey Sf Co. </em>any previous dealings with the seller of said check. He was recommended by <em>Mr. Fox </em>as a correct man, <em>Mr. Fox </em>himself being a man of respectable character. I do not now recollect whether I heard what <em>J. Strodtman\u2019s </em>business was at the time of the purchase of the chock. The answers to the interrogatories in chief have been given on my personal knowledge, my recollection has been refreshed by recourse to the books of <em>B.

He shewed me a letter which he said was from his sister, written in <em>German, </em>and directed to him, advising him not to dispose of the certificate at less than its value. Said firm of <em>B. G. j' Co. </em>did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>purchase said check from <em>John Strodtman, </em>sometime in the autumn of 1839; said firm gave for said check one and a half per cent, premium. If I remember right, they gave $200 cash, and the balance in notes at 40 days. <em>S. </em>lived with me from March 1839, to September 18th, 1839. I resided about two miles and a half from <em>Alton. </em>After he left me he went to <em>St. Loads </em>to reside, and said he was going to buy a farm in <em>Missouri </em>after he received the money from his sister. I did not see him again until he came back with the check, sometime in the month of October following. As he came to me for advice, I told him there were merchants in <em>Alton </em>who were doubtless in want of eastern funds, and accordingly introduced him to- <em>B. Godfrey \u00f3y Co. </em>He was a farmer; I know not where he now is. I know of no other man by the name of <em>J. </em>or <em>John Strodtman </em>or <em>Strodtmann. </em>It was several months <em>after </em>he sold the check before I was informed that the name of <em>J. Strodtman </em>was a forgery. I was told by <em>Mr. </em>Gilman, one of the house of <em>B. Godfrey 6y Co. I do </em>remember that a man called at my house some months after the transaction, who said he was the real <em>John Strodtman, </em>making enquiry of me for the man who had worked for me by the name of <em>John Strodtman. </em>He wished to get information where the latter was, and said his real name was <em>Andrew, </em>if I remember right.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-5\">Deposition, <em>James Robinson </em>for the defendants. I have before seen the certificate marked A. I first saw it on or before the 23rd October 1839. It was received from <em>B. Godfrey 6y Co., hy IJ., G. Sy R. </em>It was enclosed in a letter from <em>B. Godfrey fy Co., </em>dated 9th October 1839, (being the letter hereto attached, marked C,) which was received by <em>H., G. &lt;Sy R.; </em>said letter was answered, (a copy of which letter is hereto attached, marked D.) The endorsement of <em>B. Godfrey Sy Co., </em>on said certificate, I am well acquainted with, and have no doubt of its being genuine. The endorsement on the certificate of <em>H., G. and R. </em>is genuine; I am a member of the firm and wrote it myself. The firm of <em>B. G. Sy Co. </em>was established in the year 1839, at <em>Alton, </em>in the State of <em>Illinois, </em>and <em>H., G. and R. </em>was established at the same time in the city of <em>New York; </em>they did correspond and do business with each other during said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>year. The character in which <em>H., G. and R. </em>received said certificate, was that of a remittance against a large indebtedness which then existed against <em>B. G. Co., </em>and which indebtedness was caused by the purchase of goods for their account, the acceptance and payment of their drafts, and the payment of their notes and other business transactions, and said certificate was passed to their credit in account. <em>H., G. and R. </em>did pay said <em>B. G. 6f Co\u2019s </em>note to <em>Goodwin, Fisher and Spencer, </em>for $483, the day following the receipt of said certificate, say on the 24th of October 1839, which payment I do believe was made in consideration of the funds they expected to be realized of said certificate, and I do not think said $483 would otherwise have been paid. The account marked E is a statement of the account between Hie two firms, from the 23rd of October 1839, down to the 15th February 1844, which shews the debt existing when said certificate was received, and the balance due at the present time with interest thereon. Said certificate was remitted by <em>H., G. and R. </em>to <em>Weld and Jenks, </em>of <em>Baltimore, </em>on the 31st October 1839, in the letter marked B of that date; said letter was written by me. Said certificate was remitted to <em>W. and J. </em>for the purpose of collection, and providing them with funds which they were advised to pay on <em>H., G. and R\u2019s </em>account to <em>Capt. Barze, of </em>barque <em>Isabella, </em>and which they did pay out of the funds so collected from said certificate, to the amount of about $166. The notice of the first indorsement of <em>J. Strodtmann </em>on said certificate being a forgery, was first received by <em>H., G. and R., </em>between the 23rd and 25th of November 1839, from <em>W. and J., </em>by letter dated tire 22nd November 1839, being the letter marked F. <em>H., G. and R. </em>gave notice of the forgery to <em>B. G. &lt;$f Co., </em>on the 29th November 1839, by letter, of which a copy is marked G. I stood in the relation of partner in the concern of <em>H., G. and R., </em>in October and November 1839, and have remained in same relation since, except for one year from April 1840, and am now a partner. <em>B. G. Sf Co. </em>failed about the 23rd October 1839; first note of their\u2019s which to my knowledge was protested, was on that day. My knowledge of the time <em>B. G.

Strodtmann </em>on the back of the certificate of deposite, issued subject to his order by the <em>Marine Bank, </em>is a counterfeit. The circumstances are these: <em>Mr. Joel Vickers, </em>of this city, deposited the money in the <em>Marine Bank, </em>in the name and for the benefit of <em>Mr. J. Strodtmann, </em>the <em>Marine Bank </em>giving a certificate of deposite, payable to the order of <em>J. Strodtmann, </em>on return of said certificate of deposite. We deposited it in the <em>Merchants Bank </em>on or about the 2nd of November instant, and that bank, in course of their usual exchange of checks and settlement of balances, sent said check in to <em>Marine Bank </em>the next morning as usual, and the amount thereof was duly passed to <em>Merchant Bank\u2019s </em>credit in settlement. JkTr. <em>Joel Vickers, </em>who made the deposite in <em>Marine Bank, </em>has just \u25a0received a letter from <em>J. Strodtmann, </em>dated <em>St. Louis, Missouri, </em>November 11,1839, in which said <em>Strodtmann </em>advises of not having received any certificate of deposite, the receipt of which letter here has led to this developement. On comparing the endorsement of die certificate with <em>J. Strodtmann\u2019s </em>signature, in his letter, diere appears no similarity. The <em>Marine Bank </em>did not know the signature of <em>J. Strodtmann, </em>never having taken it. It is customary to draw the money for checks on other banks, or have the checks endorsed by the teller before depositing said checks. Our clerk took this certificate of deposite to the <em>Marine Bank, </em>before depositing it in <em>Merchants Bank, </em>and asked the teller if it was necessary to have it endorsed like any ordinary check. The teller took the certificate, looked at it, and returned it to the clerk, saying it was not necessary to have it endorsed. We have, of course, assured the <em>Merchants Bank </em>we will hold them harmless in the premises, and we will look to you to make good that assurance. We wait your orders what course to pursue in regard to the <em>Marine Bank. </em>The <em>Marine Bank </em>demand of the <em>Merchants Bank, </em>that the amount be refunded; the matter stands open, waiting our action. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>The endorsements are <em>J.

The same was made payable to the order of <em>J. Strodtmann, </em>and by him endorsed. On the 31st October, we sent the same to our friends, <em>Weld </em>and <em>Jenks, </em>of <em>Baltimore, </em>to collect and pass to our credit, intending to draw for it as favorable opportunities offered. <em>Weld </em>and <em>Jenks </em>collected the certificate through the <em>Merchants Bank, </em>where they keep their account, on or about the 2nd instant. On the 22nd instant, they advised us of having received notice from the <em>Marine Bank, </em>that the name of <em>J. Strodtmann </em>was a forgery, and the <em>Marine Bank </em>demands a return of the money from the <em>Merchants Bank, </em>and the <em>Merchants Bank </em>from <em>Weld </em>and <em>Jenks; </em>the latter write to us for instructions. It appears that <em>Mr. Joel Vickers, </em>who made the deposite for <em>Mr. J. Strodtmann's </em>benefit, has received a letter from the latter, dated <em>St. Louis, </em>November 11, in which he says he has received no certificate of the kind; upon which information it is concluded, that the signature is a forgery; we have refrained so far from giving any direction to change the position of the draft, on account of our not knowing what would be the proper course to take. We have made several inquiries, but find it to be such a novel case, that hardly any one can venture an opinion with any degree of certainty. <em>Mr. Shipman, </em>however, thinks that the <em>Marine Bank </em>should have the amount refunded, and then hold it, (the original deposite,) subject to the order of the proper owner. We shall be glad to have your advice upon the subject as early as possible, and in the meantime, we shall endeavor to not move in the matter, without it may be actually necessary, or without we may become convinced of the proper course to pursue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-8\">We remain, &amp;c.,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-9\">(Signed,) Howes, Godfrey &amp; Robinson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number><em>Alton, 17th December, </em>1839.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AR\">\n<em>Messrs.

It was on the 8th October he sold the certificate to you, and if there be any thing wrong about it, it must be that there are two <em>J.

Strodtman </em>thereon, was a forgery, and which was the first notice witness had, that said endorsement was a forgery, and that the party interested claimed a new certificate, and inquired as to the course the <em>Merchants Bank </em>would pursue; to this witness replied, that the defendant would certainly settle it, for that he, (the witness,) conceived it both legally and morally bound to refund the amount, but that <em>Weld </em>and <em>Jenks, </em>who deposited it, would be consulted, and their and witness\u2019 decision made known. That a messenger was sent to those gentlemen, and <em>Mr. Jenks, of </em>that firm came, and after being made acquainted with the circumstances, and the opinion of the witness, of the liability of the defendant to to the plaintiffs, and by consequence his to the defendant, he, (the said <em>Jenks,) </em>promptly differed in opinion, and stated that he did not consider the defendant or himself, legally or morally bound to return the amount. That said <em>Jenks </em>and the witness differed so widely in their views, that witness advised him, <em>Jenks, </em>to consult his counsel, and on being informed that he was out of town, witness proposed to send for the counsel of defendant, who witness was sure would confirm his views; this was agreed to, and witness accordingly sent for <em>Mr. Brown, </em>who appeared on the morning of the same day, and on relating the facts of the case to him, <em>Mr. Brawn </em>said that witness was wrong, and <em>Mr. Jenks </em>right. That witness then stated what had taken place between him and <em>Mr. Smith, </em>including his, witness\u2019 promise to settle the amount of the certificate; and further said, it would be necessary for <em>Mr. Brown to go </em>over to the <em>Marine </em>Bank, and state to the said bank, that witness was in error in regard to the obligation of the defendant to refund. That witness also requested <em>Mr. Jenks </em>to acquaint the proper officers of tire <em>Marine Bank </em>with his, <em>Jenks\u2019, </em>unwillingness that the defendant should refund the amount of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>certificate until after he should hear from his <em>New York </em>correspondents; from whom the certificate had been received. The said witness further testified, that in any engagement he had with <em>Mr. Smith, </em>he had regard, and he thinks express reference to the assent of <em>Messrs. Weld </em>and <em>Jenks, </em>whom he considered bound to defendant, if latter was bound to the plaintiffs, and that if those gentlemen objected, he could not pay it, and that he certainly made no promise to <em>Mr. Smith </em>after their objection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-5\">The defendant then further proved, by <em>George William Brown, </em>that upon being sent for by <em>Mr. Sprigg, </em>as proved by that witness, he gave the opinion as counsel of the defendant, that it was not legally bound to refund the amount of the certificate to the plaintiffs, and that <em>Mr. Brume, </em>who was upon that <em>day </em>president pro tem., in the place of <em>Mr. Swan, </em>who was out of town, agreed with witness in this opinion; that upon his, (witness;) giving this opinion; ho went over on the morning of the same day; at the request of <em>Mr. Sprigg, </em>to the <em>Marine </em>Bank; and informed the president of the plaintiffs, and witness thinks also the cashier, that <em>Mr. Sprigg </em>was in error as to the liability of the defendant,' and further, witness gave the plaintiff\u2019s president, and he thinks cashier, notice not to send in the certificate in the exchange lists upon the following morning, as the defendant; as then advised; would not pay the same. The same witness also testified; that he met at the <em>Marine Bank, Mr. Jenks, </em>of the firm of <em>Weld Jenks, </em>who, while witness was in said bank; came there for the same purpose with himself, and on coming out of said bank, witness also thinks he met with <em>Mr. Smithy </em>to whom he made the same communication.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-6\">The defendant then further proved, by <em>Richard Dorsey, Jr., </em>that in 1839, he was runner of the defendant, and that it was then the daily practice of the runners of the banks, to take to the other banks; a list or statement of the items, with the vouchers, upon which the banks so sending claimed a credit, and at the other banks to which these were taken, they received from the tellers thereof a list and vouchers, upon which credit was claimed by them, and that the balance of these items were struck, and if not objected to by either party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>before 11 o\u2019clock on the morning of the day on which the exchange was made, the balance struck was considered settled; that sometimes, according to the practice, the runner of the defendant would go to the bank of the plaintiffs, and make with the teller of that bank the exchanges, and sometimes the runner of the <em>Marine Bank </em>would come to the <em>Merchants Bank, </em>and make with the teller of the latter bank the exchanges; that it was the practice for the teller of the one bank, and the runner of the other, at the bank where the exchange was made, to substract the items of credit claimed by the one bank, from those claimed by the other upon the lists, and for the officer of the bank, against whom the balance appeared, to enter the balance in a book kept for that purpose, and for the runner, upon returning to his own bank, to take with him this substruction and result, together with the vouchers obtained at the other bank, for the examination of his own teller, and if the statement of credits was not objected to by 11 o\u2019clock in the morning of the same day, the account was considered closed. The same witness also testified, that it was not the duty or business of the runners to examine the vouchers presented to them for credit at their bank, or to consider their correctness; that this was the business of the paying tellers, and that he, the witness, had no authority, while he was runner of the defendant, to bind it to the payment of money. The same witness further proved, that upon the morning of the 23rd of November 1839, after the exchanges had been made between the plaintiffs and defendant, in accordance with the usage of the banks, as proved by the witness, the certificate of deposite, given in evidence, was delivered to the pa}dng teller of the defendant, <em>Mr. Gill, </em>together with the other vouchers, upon which the <em>Marine Bank </em>claimed credit. That <em>Mr. Gill </em>on seeing said certificate, immediately objected to receiving it, and to allow the credit claimed for it, and sent the witness to the <em>Marine Bank, </em>with the message, that he, (the said teller,) could not receive it. That witness carried said certificate to the teller of the <em>Marine Bank, </em>and demanded the amount thereof, but received for answer from said teller, that <em>Mr. Sprigg </em>had told <em>Mr. Littig </em>or <em>Mr. Smith, </em>that it might be returned in the check list to the <em>Merchants Bank. </em>That witness then returned to <em>Mr. Gill, </em>with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>the certificate, and told him what <em>Mr. Miller </em>had said. That <em>Mr. Gill </em>gave the certificate back to the witness, and told him to tell <em>Mr. Miller, </em>that the <em>Marine Bank </em>must pay it, and that <em>Mr. Sprigg </em>could settle it with the <em>Marine Bank </em>himself. That witness accordingly returned the certificate to <em>Mr. Miller, </em>and obtained the amount for which credit had been refused, in order that <em>Mr. Gill </em>might adjust his account.

That witness wrote in pencil mark, the \u201cnot\u201d upon said check lists opposite to said credit, to signify that he did notallow the same, and sent <em>Mr. Dorsey, </em>the runner, back with said certificate to the plaintiffs, to demand the amount of it from <em>Mr. Miller. </em>That <em>Mr. Dorsey </em>returned from the <em>Marine Bank, </em>and brought word from its oiEcers, that <em>Mr. Sprigg </em>had said that it should he settled in this way; to this witness returned for answer by <em>Mr. Dorsey, </em>that this might be, but that witness could not receive it and allow the credit, and that the money must be paid. That the money was accordingly paid, and that these things took place before 11 o\u2019clock of the said 23rd of November839. The said witness also proved, that by the custom of the banks, the tellers have until 11 o\u2019clock of each day, to examine the items and vouchers upon which the other banks claim credit, and that by the custom, they may object to any items so claimed until that hour. That when any item is objected to, or not allowed, it is the custom to send the runner for the money to tire amount of the item claimed, and when the money is thus obtained, the item is permitted to stand in the list and the account; but if the item is a large one, it is more usual to correct the item which gives more trouble. The same witness proved the practice of making exchanges between the banks, in the mode stated by the witness, <em>Dorsey, </em>and tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>tified to the duties of the runners and tellers of banks, as givers in evidence <em>by </em>the same witness, <em>Dorsey.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b124-5\">The defendant then gave in evidence, the account between the defendant and <em>Messrs.

It is true, that the hypothesis of the third, fourth, and fifth prayers, each of them, present the fact, that on the 19th day of November 1839, <em>Weld </em>and <em>Jenks </em>had drawn out of the <em>Merchants Bank </em>all the money which stood to their credit, with the exception of $57.77; but it is equally true, that there was evidence to the jury, that on the 22nd day of November 1839, the day on which the forgery was discovered, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>demand made on the <em>Merchants Bank </em>to refund the money, there was standing to the credit of <em>Weld </em>and <em>Jenks, </em>on the books of the <em>Merchants Bank, </em>a balance of $6696.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">It could not be successfully contended, that if at the time this forgery was discovered, and the demand made on the Mer. <em>chants Bank </em>to refund to the <em>Marine Bank </em>the amount paid on the certificate, <em>Weld </em>and <em>Jenks </em>had withdrawn from the <em>Merchants Bank </em>the balance standing to their credit; that the <em>Merchants Bank </em>would not then have been holders of the certificate <em>bona fide, </em>and for value. <em>Fulton Bank vs. Ph\u0153nix Bank, </em>1 <em>Hall's Rep., </em>573. But, if <em>Weld </em>and <em>Jenks </em>had received credit on the books of the <em>Merchants Bank </em>for the amount of the certificate, that entry was not conclusive upon the <em>Merchants Bank, </em>they were not concluded thereby from correcting their account when the forgery was discovered, on the 22nd November 1839, if they had funds of <em>Weld </em>and <em>Jenks' </em>in their possession, adequate to that purpose. It was, as it stood, evidence; <em>prima facie </em>against the <em>Merchants Bank, </em>but not conclusive. <em>Garland vs. Salem Bank, </em>9 <em>Mass. Rep., </em>408.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The county court erred in rejecting the defendant\u2019s sixth prayer, as there was no evidence in the cause, of the payment by the <em>Merchants Bank </em>to the <em>Marine Bank </em>of the certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">We are also of opinion, that the county court erred in refusing the defendant\u2019s seventh prayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">\u201cThe cashier of a bank, possessing no incidental to make any declarations binding the bank, not within the scope of his ordinary duties: so if the cashier of a bank should promise to pay a debt which the corporation did not owe, and was not liable to pay, or should admit forged bills of the bank to be genuine, the bank would not be bound by such promise or admission, unless it had authorized or adopted the act.\u201d <em>Storey's Com. on Agency, page </em>104, <em>sec. </em>115 <em>and Gloucester Bank vs. Salem </em>Bank, <em>17th Mass. Rep., </em>1.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">From the view which we have taken of the opinion given by the Court of Appeals, on the former trial of this cause, we are of the opinion, that the <em>Merchants Bank </em>cannot, in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>case, successfully resist the recovery hy die <em>Marine Bank, </em>and therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"183\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b134-5\">Archer, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Am9\">delivered the following dissenting opinion:</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">I am of opinion there ought to be a <em>procedendo </em>in this case. If the <em>Merchants Bank </em>was entitled to retain the money which was paid to it on the forged certificate, by the <em>Marine Bank, </em>provided the <em>Merchants Bank </em>could show, that she was a <em>bona fide </em>holder, and for a valuable consideration, I cannot conceive upon what principle she can be precluded from reposing on the title of die <em>Alton House, </em>which according to the proof, was a fair and <em>bona fide </em>holder for a valuable consideration, and when the subsequent holders were either acting as agents in the collection, or were <em>bona fide </em>holders for a valuable consideration, having no notice whatever of the forgery, or of any fact that could put them upon the enquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">It is my opinion that the Court of Appeals never meant to decide any proposition opposed to these views, and I account for die peculiar phraseology of the court\u2019s opinion when the case ivas in this court before, from the fact, that in die case then stated, the <em>Merchants Bank </em>neither set up, or offered to set up the title of the <em>Alton House, </em>the <em>New York House, </em>or the title of <em>Weld and Jenlcs, </em>but rested solely on her own tide.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">The money, when received by the <em>Merchants Bank </em>was, in my judgment, received for the benefit of the <em>bmm fide </em>holder for a valuable consideration of this certificate, and that she bore the character of agent in the transaction, an agency merely of collection, and to deny the <em>Merchants Bank </em>the legal right to retain the money is in effect to say, that n\u00f3 matter in what condition, or under what circumstances the forged draft was taken; such holder, if he endorses the draft, even for collection, shall lose the money, although the same shall have been paid on presentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
