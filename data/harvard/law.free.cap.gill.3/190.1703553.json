Turner. </em>1 ** \u00a1/</p>\n<p id=\"b201-11\">The contract was execui^Toy <em>Philijp*Turner, </em>and was in these words:</p>\n<p id=\"b201-12\"><em>\u201ci </em>have this day, 23rd January 1838, had a settlement with <em>Mrs. Eleanor W. Turner, </em>administratrix of <em>Henry Turner, </em>and have received all my right, title, claim and interest, in and to the personal estate of <em>Henry Turner, </em>of his administratrix, <em>Eleanor W. Turner, </em>and I do hereby bind myself to indemnify the said <em>Eleanor W. Turner, </em>against any and all losses that may accrue, from a suit now pending between <em>Lewis E. Turner and Mrs. Eleanor W. Turner, </em>administratrix of <em>Henry Turner, </em>the said suit having been instituted against <em>Eleanor W. Turner, </em>as administratrix of <em>Henry Turner, </em>who was security for <em>Josiah Turner, </em>on his guardian\u2019s bond, from which there was a balance due to the said <em>Lewis E. Turner.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-13\">The declaration contained only one count upon the indemnity, and alleged, that <em>Lewis E. Turner </em>obtained a judgment against <em>the </em>plaintiff\u2019s testatrix, and thereby recovered a large sum of money; and that Ihe plaintiff\u2019s testatrix, in her lifetime, had also thereby, been put to great charges, and forced to lay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>out and expend other large sums of money, for defending the said suit. The issue was joined on the plea of <em>non assumpsit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">At the trial of the cause, the plaintiff having proved the contract of indemnity, offered to read in evidence to the jury the short copy of a judgment, in the name of the State of <em>Maryland, </em>for the use of <em>Lewis E. Turner, </em>against the plaintiff\u2019s testatrix, as administratrix of <em>Henry Turner, </em>rendered in <em>St. Mary's </em>county court, the 16th March 1839, <em>on aivard, </em>for the sum of $609.70, with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">The defendant then offered to prove, that <em>Eleanor Turner, </em>the defendant in the judgment, died on the 19th of June 1838: for the purpose of showing, that the judgment was a nullity, having been rendered against a dead person. The court refused to allow the defendant to give such evidence to the jury, but permitted the judgment to be read in evidence by the plaintiff. To this refusal by the court, the defendant excepted, and this forms the subject of the <em>first </em>exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">By the 11th. section of the act of Assembly of 1785, ch. 80, it is provided, \u201cthat all causes, referred by consent of parties and rule of court, shall be continued until an award is returned, and if the death of either of the parties happen before an award is returned, and judgment thereon, such cause shall not abate by the death; and upon reasonable notice to tire persons succeeding to the interest of, or representing the deceased in the matter or thing in contest, and not being a minor, the arbitrators shall proceed to a determination, and return then-award; upon which, judgment may be entered by the court, and such judgment shall be good and sufficient in law, notwithstanding the death of either of the parties. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">The judgment read in evidence by the plaintiff, was rendered upon an <em>award, </em>and it is seen that the power to enter a judgment of this character, is conferred upon the court, by the express terms of the 11th section of the act of 1785, ch. 80, <em>non obstante, </em>the death of either of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">The validity of the judgment could not, therefore, be affected in any manner, by the death of <em>Mrs. Eleanor Turner, </em>and we think, the evidence offered by the defendant, to prove that fact, was properly.rejected by the court, as irrelevant and immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>The plaintiff having offered in evidence the contract of indemnity, and the judgment of the 16th of March 1839, already adverted to, proposed to prove, that the executor of <em>Eleanor Turner, </em>the plaintiff in the action, after her death, paid the amount of the judgment recovered against her, to <em>Lewis E. Turner, </em>the plaintiff in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The defendant objected to this evidence; but the court suffered it to go to the jury. And the question presented in the <em>second </em>exception, is, whether this testimony was admissible under the pleadings in the cause?</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\"><em>We </em>are of opinion that it was not. It is a settled principle, governing in the production of evidence, that it must correspond with the allegations of the declaration, and be confined to the point in issue. A late writer, on the law of evidence, says:</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">\u201cThe pleadings at common law, are composed of the written allegations of the parties, terminating in a single proposition, distinctly affirmed on one side, and denied on the other, called the issue. If it is a proposition of fact, it must be tiled by the jury upon the evidence adduced. And it is an established rule, which we state as the first rule, that the evidence offered must correspond with the allegations, and be confined to the point in issue.\u201d <em>Gr. E., 58.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">In the case of <em>Clarke against the State, use Darnall, </em>8 <em>G. </em>125, the Court of Appeals say: \u201cThe rejoinder had placed the issue entirely on the collection and receipt, by <em>Richard Hall, </em>of the money claimed as guardian, for his ward; and all the aforegoing evidence intended to establish the fact, of his having discharged himself of liability, by the payment of the sum proved to be in his hands, to a successor, legally qualified to act, was foreign to the issue, and was, therefore, inadmissible proof.\u201d The same proposition is announced by the court, in the case of the <em>Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland Steam Navigation Company, against Dandridge, </em>8 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>313.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">Testing, then, the question of the admissibility of the evidence, by this familiar rule, the only enquiry that can arise, is, whether there is to be found in the declaration in this case, any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>averment, that the judgment rendered against <em>Eleanor Turner, </em>was paid by the executor?</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">An examination of the declaration will show, that there is no such allegation. The only averment connected with the loss to which <em>Mrs. Turner </em>had been subjected, in consequence of the suit depending between her and <em>Lewis E. </em>Turner, and against which she was to be protected by the contract of indemnity, \u201cwere charges to which she had been put, and money which she had been forced to pay,\u201d <em>in her lifetime; </em>and that there is, between an allegation of this bind and proof of the payment of the judgment, after her death, by her executor, a fatal <em>variance, </em>is a proposition too clear for dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\"><em>We </em>think, therefore, that the opinion of the court below, as expressed in this exception, is erroneous, and must be reversed. But as the evidence would be admissible in a different form of pleading, we shall order <em>ajorocedendo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">JUDGMENT REVERSED AND PROCEDENDO AWARDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
