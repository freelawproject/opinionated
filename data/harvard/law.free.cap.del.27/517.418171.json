There is no Delaware statute prescribing the nature and service of process for the bringing of a corporation into court in criminal cases. My suggestion for the practice would be to have the copias issued against the corporation and served upon the corporation in the same manner as is provided by the General Corporation Law for the service of summons.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-13\">The court has an inherent right to frame any appropriate writ to complete its jurisdiction. <em>U. S. v. Kelso </em>(D. <em>C.) </em>86 <em>Fed. </em>304.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-14\">In New Hamsphire, the practice was followed of bringing the corporation into court by writ of summons, following the common law analogy of the old writ of <em>venire, </em>and following the long-established practice in the colony and State of New Hampshire. <em>Boston, etc., R. R. Co. v. State, </em>32 <em>N. H. </em>215.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b527-15\">But in Indiana where the only sort of writ that could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>issued by the court, under the Indiana statute, was a writ that contemplated the arrest of the defendant, the court held that service of a summons upon a corporate defendant in a criminal case was service of an improper writ under the Indiana statute; the only sort of a writ authorized by the statute being a warrant. <em>State v. Ohio, </em>23 <em>Ind. </em>362.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-5\">The Indiana case is interpreted to the effect that a warrant should be issued. 5 <em>Thomp. on Corporations, par. </em>5651; 10 <em>Cyc. </em>1233 <em>(b).</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-6\">The Delaware statute conferring jurisdiction upon the Court of General <em>Sessions,(Revised Code, p. </em>702, <em>c. </em>94, \u00a7 3), providing, \u201cThe said judges, or any of them, may issue writs, or precepts, under the seal of said court, to any sheriff, or other officer, of any county in the state, to take any person indicted,\u201d etc., is similar to the Indiana statute referred to in the above Indiana case, in that the only process authorized by the statute to be issued by the Court of General Sessions is a process that contemplates the seizure of the body of a defendant\u2014that is to say, a warrant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-7\">A warrant is \u201clegal process\u201d. <em>Savage v. Oliver, </em>110 <em>Ga. </em>636, 36 S. <em>E. </em>54, 56; <em>People v. Nevins, </em>1 <em>Hill (N. Y.) </em>154, 169-170; <em>State v.

Co., </em>108 <em>Mo. </em>588, 18 S. <em>W. </em>286, 293, 32 <em>Am. St. Rep. </em>624.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b528-12\">The General Corporation Law (22 <em>Del. Laws, c. </em>394, \u00a7 48) provides that \u201clegal process\u201d shall be served on corporations as therein provided. Therefore there is no objection to the court\u2019s issuing the writ, that is, the copias, or, as it is sometimes called, the bench warrant, the only writ that is authorized by the statute, and having it served upon the corporation in the manner provided in the General Corporation Law for the service of \u201clegal process\u201d.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b528-13\">Conrad, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"AySn\">The court orders that a copias be issued for the corporation, to be served upon it in the same manner as a writ of summons is served under the provisions of the General Corporation Act, and also a copias be issued against the personal defendant in the customary form.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
