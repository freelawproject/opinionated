Wiggins brought bags of stolen money to the house where the defendants lived, and buried them or any of them upon the pre-mises, where they were afterwards found by the police officers, without assent, acquiescence, or participation of either of the defendants, the defendants should be acquitted on the charge or indictment of receiving or concealing the coin. If, however, the defendants or either of them knew the money was stolen and was buried in their yard by Homer C. Wiggins, or the facts and circumstances with which they were conversant were such as to reasonably charge them with further concealing or preventing the discovery of the stolen coins by proper authorities or persons, then they may be held, under the statute, constructively to have concealed the same and be found guilty if you believe the evidence warrants it.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The jury disagreed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
