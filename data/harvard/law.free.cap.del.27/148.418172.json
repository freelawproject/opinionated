Warren, </em>2 <em>Marv. (Del.) </em>225, 43 <em>Atl. </em>91, it was held that an appeal will lie from a judgment of nonsuit and for costs rendered by a justice of the peace if the record shows the disallowance of a claim exceeding five dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">The court said: \u201cThe meaning of \u2018defalked\u2019 is a lopping off, or a reduction, to some extent, of a claim which is proved,, whether it be from, a claim made and proved by the plaintiff, or from a set-off made and proved by the defendant. The word \u2018 defalked \u2019 implies proof of an alleged claim, proof of some amount from which the defalcation is to be made * * * so that when it may appear * * * sufficiently, in legal contemplation that the plaintiff has stated the amount of his claim in his cause of action before the justice, and the justice, after hearing the proofs and allegations on both sides, has rendered a judgment in favor of the defendant for costs, and thus rejected the claim of the plaintiff, in the language of the statute, disallowed his claim, to an amount exceeding five dollars; in such case an appeal will lie to this court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">In that case, the justice, after having heard the parties, their proofs and allegations, etc., entered a nonsuit and gave judgment against the plaintiff for the sum Of three dollars and forty cents, costs of suit. In other words there was an appearance of the parties and a hearing on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> In the case now before the court, the plaintiff failed to appear, and judgment of nonsuit and for costs was entered against him for nonappearance. Is such a judgment a disallowance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>the plaintiff\u2019s claim, which exceeded five dollars, within the contemplation of the statute?</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">In <em>Bowne v. Johnson, </em>1 <em>Doug. (Mich.) </em>185, it was held that the legal effect of plaintiff\u2019s failure to appear was an abandonment of his action which operated as a discontinuance of the action, and that an appeal would not lie from a judgment entered on the voluntary abandonment by the plaintiff of his action.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">In the <em>Pepper-Warren case, supra, </em>the plaintiff suffered an involuntary nonsuit. In the case before us the nonsuit may be said to be voluntary, and as between the two kinds of nonsuits, the courts have always distinguished. 6 <em>Ency. PI. &amp; Prac. </em>828.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">As was said in the case of <em>Schulte v. Kelly, </em>124 <em>Mich. </em>330, 83 <em>N. W. </em>405, if the plaintiff fails to appear, \u201cneither the opposite party nor the justice is responsible for it, and he stays away with the full knowledge of the legal consequences. The merits of his case are in no way compromised. If he is unavoidably absent, the misfortune is his, rather than another\u2019s, and usually his right to bring another action is ample protection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">Our opinion is that the statute does not contemplate an appeal from a judgment of nonsuit rendered, as in this case, for failure of the plaintiff to appear. We adhere to the <em>Pepper-Warren case, </em>in holding that the statute authorizing appeals from justices of the peace implies the necessity of some proof of an alleged claim, and a disallowance thereof by the justice, in whole, or part, to an amount exceeding five dollars. The case before us, the plaintiff failing to appear and make some proof of his claim, does not, therefore, come within the requirement of the statute, and the plaintiff\u2019s remedy is not by appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">The appeal is dismissed and it is ordered that the record be remitted to the justice, and judgment is given the respondent for costs. \u25a0</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
