Bennett, of Cedar Creek Hundred in the County of Sussex aforesaid on the thirteenth day of March in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and eleven, at the county aforesaid, did then and there wilfully and unlawfully trespass upon the lands of the said Mary S. Clendaniel, situate in Cedar Creek Hundred aforesaid and did then and there make direct and immediate injuries to her said lands by cutting or felling certain trees standing or growing in the soil and attached to the freehold of the land of her the said Mary S. Clendaniel without her consent first had and obtained.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-6\">March 20, 1911, David B. Bennett, the defendant, appeared and did say \u201cthat the place wherein the above trespass is alleged is the freehold of Alice Bennett, the defendant\u2019s wife, under whom he claims and prays that this cause may be tried in the Superior Court, and thereupon J. Harry Reed, and J. Wilbur Hammond became bound to the plaintiff in the sum of one hundred dollars that the damages and costs which she may recover in said court shall be satisfied.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-7\">Whereupon the justice certified the record of the action to this court for trial, under <em>Section </em>4, <em>Revised Code </em>768.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-8\">The case was pleaded to issue as other causes in this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-9\">When the plaintiff had rested, counsel for defendant moved for a nonsuit upon the following grounds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-10\">1. That the plaintiff had not proved a paper title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b151-11\">2.

Hill, </em>1 <em>Harr. </em>335.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The plaintiff is in possession of her farm, lying on the public road, shown on the plot in evidence, to the north line of said road. The deed for her farm describes the line between it and the Bennett farm as being on the \u201cnorth side\u201d of said road. Contention is made for the defendant that the \u201cnorth side\u201d of said road means the \u201cnorth edge\u201d thereof, making the latter the division line between the two farms. The plaintiff contends that said line extends beyond the north edge of the road to the cleared land of the Bennett farm, embracing a strip of woodland lying between the road and the line of the Bennett land.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">It is this strip of woodland which represents the land in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Besides the paper title shown, the acts of possession relied upon by the plaintiff are that some years ago Bennett was about to cut timber on the disputed premises and the husband of the plaintiff ordered him off and forbade his cutting any of the timber; that on two occasions a few loads of dirt were hauled from the northerly side of the road for filling in around plaintiff\u2019s carriage house; and that a son of the plaintiff, in the lifetime of his father, cut some rat poles on the <em>locus in quo, </em>apparently without the knowledge or order of the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">It is shown that Bennett some twelve years ago without let or hindrance of the plaintiff, or her husband, the then owner of the farm, erected a wire fence between his cleared land and the northerly side of said road for the purpose of pasturing, and that the fence was thereafter maintained for said purpose to, and since, the time of the alleged trespass which was committed on that portion of the said strip of woodland lying between said fence and the cleared land of Bennett, who was, ac the time, by reason of said fence, in possession thereof which has not been divested by any acts of occupancy shown on the part of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"ABU\">There is, in this case, no question of mixed possession, or joint occupancy.</p>\n<p id=\"AAgo\">The plaintiff having failed to show any actual possession, she cannot have a recovery in this action, and a nonsuit is ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
