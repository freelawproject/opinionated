Brown, the plaintiff, against the Mayor and Council of Wilmington, the defendant, to recover damages for personal injuries which he alleges he sustained by being run into and knocked down by an automobile driven and operated by one of the defendant\u2019s servants. In support of this action the plaintiff claims, that on the evening of April 20, 1912, he was walking southwardly with a throng of people on the roadway of King Street, near the westerly curb thereof, between Third and Second Streets in the City of Wilmington; that while in the exercise of proper care and caution on his part, the defendant, by its servant, drove its police patrol, being an automobile or auto car, down the street upon which he was lawfully and carefully walking, at a high and dangerous rate of speed, without giving to him any warning of its approach, and thus negligently and recklessly ran \u25a0 into and upon him, causing the injuries for which he now seeks damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">The defendant denies liability in this action and maintains that instead of its servant running its police patrol into thu plaintiff, the plaintiff in fact ran into the police patrol, and that if the injuries to the plaintiff were the result of negligence, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>negligence was not that of the defendant, but was the negligence of the plaintiff himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">It is admitted that the Mayor and Council of Wilmington, the defendant, owned and through its servant, operated the motor vehicle, known generally as a police patrol, at the time the plaintiff received his injuries. Such being the case, the acts of the driver of the patrol become the acts of the defendant, and negligence on his part in operating the machine, if any, becomes the negligence of the defendant, for which the defendant may be held liable in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> It is admitted that King Street, upon which the accident in question occurred, is a public road or highway. A public highway is open in all its length and breadth to the reasonable, common and equal use of the people, on foot and in vehicles. The owner of an automobile has the same right as the owner of other vehicles to the use of the highway, and like them he must exercise care and caution for the safety of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">A traveler on foot has the same right to the use of the public streets of a city as a vehicle of any kind. In using any part of the streets all persons are bound to the exercise of reasonable care to prevent collisions and accidents. Such care must be in proportion to the danger or the peculiar risks in each case. Where one undertakes to pass another on the highway, going in the same direction, he must take reasonable care to exercise that right, so as not to injure another, and is liable for the consequences of his negligence. It is the duty of the person operating an automobile or any other vehicle, upon the public streets of a city to use ordinary care in its operation, to move at a rate of speed reasonable under the particular circumstances and cause it to slow up or to stop if need be, where danger is imminent and could, by the exercise of reasonable care, be seen or known in time to avoid accident. Greater care is required at street crossings and in the more crowded streets of a city than in the less obstructed streets in the open or suburban parts. There is a like duty of exercising reasonable care on the part of the pedestrian. The person having the management of the vehicle and the traveler on foot are both required to use such reasonable care as the circumstances of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>case demand, an exercise of greater care on the part of each being required where there is an increase of danger. The right of each must be exercised in a reasonable and careful manner, so as not unreasonably to abridge or interfere with the rights of the other, and both are bound to the reasonable use of all their senses for the prevention of accident, and the exercise of all such reasonable caution as ordinarily careful and prudent persons would exercise under like circumstances. <em>Grier v. Samuel, </em>86 <em>Atl. </em>209, 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The basis of this action is negligence. The negligence charged by the plaintiff to the defendant, is not that it was operating its police patrol at a rate of speed in excess of that allowed by statute, for by the statute the speed of motor vehicles used by the police in the performance of duty, is exempted from the limits prescribed for motor vehicles generally. <em>(Laws of Delaware, Vol. </em>25, <em>c. </em>120, \u00a7 14.) The negligence charged to the defendant is simply that it operated its police patrol at a high and dangerous rate of speed, when considered with regard to the place and the circumstances of the occasion, and without giving the plaintiff timely warning of its approach, whereby and by reason of which he was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> If the defendant\u2019s servant, at the time of the accident, was operating its car at a high and dangerous rate of speed under the circumstances, or failed to give the plaintiff timely warning of its approach, by reason of which the injuries were inflicted, and the plaintiff at the time was on his part in the exercise of due care and caution, and free from negligence that contributed to the accident, the servant of the defendant was negligent, the defendant is liable, and your verdict should be for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\"><bracketnum>[3-5]</bracketnum> If the negligence of the plaintiff, however, contributed to and entered into the accident at the time the injuries were received, he cannot recover, even though the defendant was also guilty of negligence, because in such case the plaintiff himself would be guilty of contributory negligence. <em>(Simeonev. Lindsay, </em>6 <em>Penn. </em>224, 227, 65 <em>Atl. </em>778.) Voluntary intoxication of the plaintiff may be considered by the jury in determining whether at the time of the accident he was taking such care of his safety as would be required of a reasonably prudent man under the circumstances. <em>(Heinel v. Peoples Ry. Co., </em>6 <em>Penn. </em>431, 67 <em>Atl. </em>173.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>The plaintiff, however, wouldlhejerititlgd^Ofregpypr potwith#*ii\u00a3l&gt; ing there had been some neghgepeejoii hig[past,ci| i\u00edcivyg&amp;t\u00edas \u00aefegr ligence of the defendant alomitet&amp;w^th.eLPfMtoatscdf iia^dir ate cause of the accident, in stheipwptedscif f^twiShgtaMtngigjijLy previous negligence of the plaintiffiplhb/ delpniant\u00edjCpuM yhqye prevented the accident by the use-pfj\u00edyjd\u00e1nMy.gtidffpgspnabfeae&amp;f\u00a9) <em>Simeone v.
