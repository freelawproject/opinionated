Lawson is defendant in the judgment below. A forthwith summons issued, and was returned, served personally, the return of service being verified. The defendant failing to appear, the justice after having heard the proofs and allegations of the plaintiff, rendered judgment against the defendant by default in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Under <em>Section </em>2, <em>Chapter </em>99, <em>Revised Code, </em>as amended (24 <em>Del. Laws, c. </em>241), summons may be issued returnable forthwith, if the justice shall be satisfied by the oath of the plaintiff that there is danger of his losing the benefit of his process by delay. The affidavit made in this case is \u201cthat <em>Landreth L. Layton </em>personally appeared before William A. Warrington, a justice of the peace,\u201d etc., \u201cand made oath in due form, and deposeth and saith that the defendant is justly indebted to <em>him </em>in the sum of $196.04, and <em>he </em>has just cause to believe there is danger of losing the benefit of <em>his </em>process by delay.\u201d While the affidavit is signed by Landreth L. Layton, treasurer for Layton and Layton, Incorporated, it was made by Landreth L. Layton, individually, in which he deposes that the defendant is indebted to him, not to the plaintiff corporation, and that he personally and not the plaintiff believes there is danger of losing the benefit of his process by delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">By <em>Chapter </em>241, <em>Volume </em>24, <em>Laws of Delaware, </em>said <em>Section 2, Chapter </em>99, <em>Revised Code, </em>is amended by adding after the word \u201cplaintiff\u201d and before the word \u201cthat\u201d the following words: \u201cor, if the plaintiff be a corporation, by the oath of any officer of said corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">Without taking up the several, assignments of error, we will confine our consideration to the fourth, which is: \u201cFor that the plaintiff did not make oath that there was danger of its losing the benefit of its process by delay.\u201d The provision of the statute, making the required oath of the plaintiff necessary in case of a summons returnable forthwith, is mandatory, before a judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>by default can be entered. When the action is by a corporation, it is necessary that the oath be made by some officer of the corporation. It is obvious that the affidavit filed in this case was not made by any officer of the plaintiff corporation for and on behalf of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">We therefore order that the judgment below be reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
