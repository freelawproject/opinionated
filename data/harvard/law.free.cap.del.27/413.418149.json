Verdict for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b423-17\">At the trial a witness was produced by the defendant and testified that he saw the defendant shoot the turkeys, belonging to the plaintiff, which were at the time in a field occupied by the defendant. The question \u201cWhat was growing in that field?\u201d was then asked the witness. Objection to the question was made by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, on the ground of its immateriality, whereupon counsel for the defendant stated that the defendant admitted the killing of the turkeys, but claimed that the killing was justified for the reason that they were on his property destroying grain.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AQd\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>In support of his contention he read the following, from the case of <em>Harrington v. Hall, </em>6 <em>Penn. </em>72, 63 <em>Atl. </em>875: \u201cThe defendant justifies the killing of a dog, whosever it was, on the day in question, because, as he claims the dog was at the time of the shooting in the act of killing one of a flock of turkeys then upon his premises. We say to you that if you find under the evidence that the defendant himself, or his son, under the father\u2019s directions, did kill the plaintiff's dog under such circumstances, it was justifiable and the plaintiff would not be entitled to recover.\u201d</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b424-6\">Rice, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"A81\">We think in this case, under the circumstances as stated by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, the matter covering which inquiry is made is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">We do not' question the soundness of the law as stated in the case cited, where the killing was necessary to protect animal life, the property of the defendant, but in the present case we think it was neither necessary nor justifiable to kill the turkeys in the protection of grain. The defendant might have impounded the turkeys or brought an action for damages to his property, if any, caused by the fowls.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">We therefore sustain the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"A1I\">Thereupon counsel in the case conferred, and stated that judgment should be entered in favor of the plaintiff for an agreed amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-14\">Verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
