Under the statute service cannot be made by leaving a copy; it must be personal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b465-16\"><em>Section </em>1 provides that: \u201cNo insurance compahy, corporation or association organized under the laws of any other state, or any foreign country, shall directly or indirectly issue policies, take risks, or transact business in this state, until it shall have first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>appointed in writing the Insurance Commissioner of this State to be its attorney in this state, upon whom all lawful process, in any action or proceeding against it, may be served with the same effect as if the company, corporation, or association existed in this state. Said power of attorney shall stipulate and agree on the part of the company, corporation, or association, that any lawful process against the same which is served on said attorney shall be of the same legal force and validity as if served on the company, corporation, or association, and that the authority shall continue in force so long as any certificate of membership, policy, or liability remains outstanding against the company, corporation, or association, in this state. A certificate of such appointment, duly certified and authenticated, shall be filed in the office of the insurance commissioner, and copies certified by him shall be sufficient evidence.

The statute expressly provides how service shall be made in the absence of the insurance commissioner, and that is, upon some person in the office designated by the commissioner. Upon such person process may be served, and manifestly the statute means that it shall be personal service. Moreover, service by copy can only be made by authority of statute, and no such authority is given expressly or by implication.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
