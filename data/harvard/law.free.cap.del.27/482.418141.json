Wiggin. There was a judgment for plaintiffs, and defendant brings certiorari (No. 30, January Term, 1914), commanding the justice of the peace to send up record of judgment. Alias citation (No. 12, March Term, 1914). Exceptions filed. There was no appearance for one of the defendants. The return upon the original citation was: \u201cCited personally William Massey, Isaac Massey, an infant, and Daniel Massey, his father and next friend, December 15, 1913, and <em>non est inventus </em>as to David Massey.\u201d The return upon the alias citation was: \u201cCited personally William Massey and Daniel Massey, February 26, 1914, and <em>non est inventus </em>as to David Massey and Isaac Massey.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b493-11\">The exceptions coming on to be heard, counsel for plaintiff called the attention of the court to the fact that David Massey, one of the defendants, had not been cited, and that as to said defendant there had been two returns of <em>non est inventus, </em>and inquired whether the court would hear the exceptions without full service of citation.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b493-12\">Boyce, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"AzM\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The citation should be served upon the defendant, or defendants, on or before the return day of the writ. Where there are two or more defendants, the citation should be served upon each of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-13\">In this case one of the defendants has not been served. In appeals from justices of the peace, this court has held two returns of <em>non est inventus </em>equivalent to a service; and where there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>failure of personal service of the citation accompanying a writ of error, the Supreme Court will on two returns of <em>non est inventus </em>hear and determine the writ <em>ex parte. Vandergrift v. Page, </em>5 <em>Harr. </em>439.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Applying this practice to a proceeding by certiorari, this court will on failure of personal service hear and determine the exceptions on two returns of <em>non est inventus. </em>1 <em>Woolley, Del. Prac. </em>\u00a7 909.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\"><bracketnum>[2, 3]</bracketnum> Two of the exceptions: (1) \u201cThat the record does not disclose that the summons stated the <em>hour </em>for the defendants\u2019 appearance; (2) that the record does not disclose that either of the parties to the action resided within the territorial jurisdiction of the justice of the peace before whom the action was brought, \u2019 \u2019\u2014 are fatal.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">The last exception is applicable to cases in New Castle County. <em>Revised Code </em>(1893) <em>p. </em>723 (16 <em>Del.
