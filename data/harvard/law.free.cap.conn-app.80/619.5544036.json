On appeal, he claims that the court abused its discretion in denying his petition for certification to appeal from the dismissal of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The petitioner\u2019s statement of issues and his brief are limited to that single claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The record is clear, however, that the court granted his petition for certification to appeal. Although the petitioner\u2019s sole claim is unfounded in the record, we will review the entire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>record and the briefs to determine whether the judgment of the court should be reversed on its merits. See <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>80 Conn. App. 142, 145, 832 A.2d 1216 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">\u201cFor the petitioner to prevail on his [underlying] claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, he must establish both that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that there is a reasonable probability that, but for the counsel\u2019s mistakes, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>White </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>58 Conn. App. 169, 170, 752 A.2d 1159 (2000), citing <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984). After reviewing the record and briefs, we conclude that the petitioner has failed to sustain his burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b647-12\"> Although the petitioner briefed only that issue, his brief does address, to some extent, the merits of his underlying claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
