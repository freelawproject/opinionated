On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) remarked in the presence of the jury as to the victim\u2019s competency to testify, thereby bolstering the credibility of her testimony, (2) restricted the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of several of the state\u2019s key witnesses, (3) issued an inappropriate jury instruction with respect to the victim\u2019s in-court identification of the defendant as the perpetrator, (4) demonstrated a lack of impartiality in its treatment of the victim and the defendant, (5) allowed the state to make improper remarks in its closing argument and (6) denied the defendant\u2019s motion to unseal the victim\u2019s confidential records.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">The following facts were adduced at trial. For several years, up to and including October, 2000, the victim, bom April 25, 1996, often accompanied her father to an Orthodox Jewish synagogue.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> During that period of time, the defendant volunteered at the same synagogue on the Sabbath and on holidays, performing various tasks that Orthodox practice prohibits followers from performing, including operating electrical appliances. When the victim would accompany her father to the synagogue, she would not partake in the religious services, but would instead play in the backyard of the synagogue where she occasionally had exposure to the defendant. On some of those occasions during the summer months of 2000 up to and including October 15, 2000, the defendant engaged in sexual intercourse with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>the victim, to wit, digitally penetrating her anus, penetrating her vagina and causing her to perform fellatio on him. At the time of the sexual abuse, the victim was four years old. Soon after the sexual abuse of October 15,2000, the victim disclosed the abuse to various members of her family, and the matter was then referred to the local police, a pediatrician and a social worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">In a two count amended information dated March 11, 2002, the state charged the defendant with sexual assault in the first degree and risk of injury to a child. A jury trial commenced on April 2, 2002, and, on April 10, 2002, the jury found the defendant guilty on both counts. On May 24, 2002, the court imposed a total effective sentence of fifteen years incarceration, execution suspended after twelve years with ten years probation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant appeals from the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The defendant\u2019s first claim is that the court improperly remarked in the presence of the jury about the victim\u2019s competency to testify such that the court appeared to vouch for the credibility of her testimony. Specifically, the defendant asserts that the court declared to the jury its findings following the victim\u2019s competency hearing and, on at least four additional occasions during defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of the victim, repeated that finding in the presence of the jury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree that the court\u2019s remarks were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>improper and deprived the defendant of his right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">The first challenged remark arose at the conclusion of the court\u2019s voir dire of the victim to determine her competency to testify.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court announced its finding to the jury, stating: \u201cI find a fundamental ability [in the victim] to recognize that it\u2019s wrong to not tell the truth in her own manner of speaking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Subsequently, during cross-examination of the victim, defense counsel posed a question as to her knowledge of what it means to tell the truth. The court interjected: \u201cI think I\u2019ve already been satisfied that the oath administered is sufficient to put me on notice that she understands the nature of telling the truth and penalty could follow for not telling the truth, as she has learned in the common experiences of life. There will be no need to further inquire on that subject.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Later in the same cross-examination, defense counsel posed a question to the victim about an out-of-court statement she had made concerning what it meant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>tell the truth. Following an objection by the state, the court stated: \u201cWell, I can assure you of one thing, Fve already made that determination, and you have inquired, bringing my attention to that function of the court, and I have so indicated it to you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">Defense counsel again attempted to question the victim as to her out-of-court statement. Counsel asked: \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell the lady at the hospital you did not know what it meant to tell the truth?\u201d Following an objection by the state, the court stated: \u201cLet me point out to you that while that may be true at that time and place, <em>my determination of her telling the truth and the ability to do so is made at this time and place. </em>And, that would be sufficient for this court\u2019s purposes at this time.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Finally, the defendant challenges the following statements made by the court during defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of the victim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-8\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: When you said this morning in court that Fredo touched [you], [were] your mom and dad there, too, at the same place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-9\">\u201c[The Victim]: There, too?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-10\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: I\u2019m going to object. . . . I\u2019m certain she, the witness, five-and-a-half years old, doesn\u2019t know what that question means. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-11\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, if the form is unacceptable at this point, and is continuously obstructing my cross-examination\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-12\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: She\u2019s a five-and-a-half year old girl\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-13\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: I would submit that [the victim] is incompetent to testily.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-14\">\u201cThe Court: Well, I\u2019ll make that decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>\u201c[Defense Counsel]: If that question is not understandable, then I would submit that this witness is incompetent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-4\">\u201cThe Court: And, if I determine the contrary, then I am, what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-5\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Your Honor, if you wish me to proceed, I\u2019ll proceed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-6\">\u201cThe Court: Of course, you must proceed, you have to defend your client, but do so within the rules. Do you have another question?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">The defendant contends that those remarks conveyed to the jury the court\u2019s opinion not only that the victim was capable of telling the truth, but that she was, in fact, telling the truth. The defendant further contends that the aggregate effect of the court\u2019s remarks was to bolster the victim\u2019s credibility improperly and to undermine the defendant\u2019s right to have all issues of credibility independently determined by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">We begin by noting the well established rule that \u201c[w]hile the competency of a witness is for the trial court to evaluate, the credibility of a witness is for the jury to determine.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Morant, </em>242 Conn. 666, 682, 701 A.2d 1 (1997). It is, therefore, fundamental that the court cannot vouch for the credibility of the state\u2019s witnesses. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Camerone, </em>8 Conn. App. 317, 325-27, 513 A.2d 718 (1986). Furthermore, \u201c[d]ue process requires that there should be no [statement during the trial] that appears to reject a defendant\u2019s credibility and implies judicial support of a prosecution witness\u2019 testimony. . . . The trial court should never assume a position of advocacy, real or apparent, in a case before it, and should avoid any displays of hostility or skepticism toward the defendant\u2019s case, or of approbation for the prosecution\u2019s. ... A fine line separates proper and improper judicial conduct and the judge must strive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>to appear impartial and detached.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pharr, </em>44 Conn. App. 561, 569-70, 691 A.2d 1081 (1997). \u201cAny claim that the trial judge crossed the line between impartiality and advocacy is subject to harmless error analysis.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>78 Conn. App. 264, 275, 826 A.2d 1238, cert. denied, 266 Conn. 902, 832 A.2d 66 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The essential inquiry is whether the court\u2019s remarks appeared to imply judicial support of the victim\u2019s credibility, thereby intruding on the function of the jury to itself determine her credibility. We conclude that the remarks had such an effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">This court has stated that \u201c[j]udges in this state . . . are given wide latitude to comment fairly and reasonably upon evidence received at trial, but the court must refrain from making improper remarks which are indicative of favor or condemnation .... Even though a judge may take all reasonable steps necessary for the orderly progress of the trial, he must always be cautious and circumspect in his language and conduct.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hardwick, </em>1 Conn. App. 609, 611, 475 A.2d 315, cert. denied, 193 Conn. 804, 476 A.2d 145 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Admittedly, the judge\u2019s comments were neither overtly partial toward the victim nor explicitly supportive of her testimony. The measure of any improper influence on the jury, however, must be assessed with an eye toward the authoritative position of a judge presiding over a trial and the corresponding propensity of the jury to look to the judge for guidance in its consideration of the case. Indeed, this court has recognized that \u201c[t]he influence of the trial judge on the jury is necessarily and properly of great weight . . . and jurors are ever watchful of the words that fall from him. . . . These admonitions and cautions are prompted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>the truism that a jury has a natural tendency to look to the trial judge for guidance, and may find it even where it is not intended.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Pharr, </em>supra, 44 Conn. App. 569-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Central to a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial is the right to have issues of fact and credibility decided by the jury. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>187 Conn. 199, 210, 445 A.2d 314 (1982). Here, the court\u2019s remarks, viewed in the aggregate, taken together with their fair implications, worked prejudicially on the defendant because they conveyed to the jury the court\u2019s own notions on matters solely within the jury\u2019s province. In so doing, the court trespassed both on the jury\u2019s function as sole arbiter of credibility and the defendant\u2019s right to a trial in which the jury\u2019s exercise of that function is not impeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Our cases hold that when error is of constitutional dimension, it is reversible unless the state proves the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Lopes, </em>supra, 78 Conn. App. 275. The state has not sustained its burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">This is not a circumstance in which \u201cthe evidence against the accused is so overwhelming that we can conclude as a matter of law that the jury\u2019s verdict was not influenced [by the trial court\u2019s comments].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cohane, </em>193 Conn. 474, 485, 479 A.2d 763, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 990, 105 S. Ct. 397, 83 L. Ed. 2d 331 (1984). Quite to the contrary, because of the absence of any scientific, medical or corroborating eyewitness testimony linking the defendant with the criminal activity with which he was charged, the jury\u2019s acceptance of the victim\u2019s testimony was the only basis on which a guilty verdict could have been returned. By effectively vouching for the victim\u2019s credibility, the court detrimentally undermined the defendant\u2019s theory of the case, which was, quite simply, that her testimony was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>reliable. On the basis of the foregoing, we conclude that it is likely that the jury\u2019s verdict was influenced by the court\u2019s remarks. We accordingly find that the state failed to sustain its burden of proving that the court\u2019s improper remarks were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Related to and reinforcing our determination that the court\u2019s remarks were not harmless was the court\u2019s refusal to allow defense counsel to engage in meaningful cross-examination of the victim, which could have elicited impeachment evidence that may have diluted the prejudicial impact of the court\u2019s remarks. Of the five remarks the defendant challenges on appeal, three of them were made by the court following attempts by defense counsel to question the victim as to her ability to tell the truth and, in particular, as to a prior inconsistent statement the victim had made that she did not know what it meant to tell the truth. In ail three instances, the court precluded defense counsel from questioning the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Our Supreme Court has underscored the importance of cross-examination as to a minor victim\u2019s competency, particularly when, as here, defense counsel did not otherwise have an opportunity to challenge the competency of the victim\u2019s testimony. See <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>211 Conn. 555, 565, 560 A.2d 426 (1989). In <em>James, </em>our Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of General Statutes \u00a7 54-86h,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the child victim competency rule, against a claim that it violates the right to confrontation by preventing defense counsel from challenging the competency of a child victim. Recognizing that \u201ccompetency is closely related to credibility\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>supra, 565; the court reasoned that a child sexual assault victim is still subject to cross-examination like any other witness and that any questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>defense counsel may have asked at a competency hearing could be asked during cross-examination. Id. Although it is not certain that the prohibited cross-examination in this case would have elicited information capable of mitigating the harm caused by the court\u2019s remarks, the court\u2019s refusal to permit that line of questioning compounded the impression created by the improper remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Further reinforcing our determination that the court\u2019s remarks were not harmless was the court\u2019s jury instruction on the issue of the victim\u2019s in-court identification of the defendant as the perpetrator. The court\u2019s instruction directed the jury to accept as reliable the victim\u2019s in-court identification of the defendant as the person who had sexually assaulted her and thereby foreclosed jury consideration on the issue of identity. In so instructing the jury, the court effectively vouched for the credibility of the victim\u2019s testimony on the identity of the perpetrator and compounded the damage of its earlier remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">The inappropriateness of the court\u2019s instruction is made apparent by the victim\u2019s obvious difficulty identifying the defendant in court. During the state\u2019s case-in-chief, counsel and the victim entered into the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Okay . . . turn around and look at me if you can, please. . . . [D]o you know somebody by the name of Fredo?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-9\">\u201c[The Victim]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-10\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Okay. Do you see Fredo in the courtroom today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-11\">\u201c[The Victim]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-12\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Are you sure?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-13\">\u201c[The Victim]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>\u201c[The Prosecutor]: If you stand up and look around, would that help you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">\u201c[The Victim]: Mm-hmm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: . . . [I]f you could, could you stand up for me, please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-8\">\u201c[The Victim]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-9\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: And, Your Honor, with the court\u2019s permission, if she could come down. (The witness stepped off the witness stand.) . . . Okay ... I want you to look at everybody in the court \u2014 stand right here if you can. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-10\">\u201c[The Victim]: Right here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-11\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Right there. Stay right there. I want you to look around the courtroom and tell me if you see anybody that you recognize as Fredo?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-12\">\u201c[The Victim]: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t see Fredo. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-13\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: . . . [I]f you could just look around the entire courtroom\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-14\">\u201c[The Victim]: I don\u2019t see Fredo.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-15\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Okay. Look over here as well on the other side of the courtroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-16\">\u201c[The Victim]: You mean right there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-17\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: I\u2019m not telling you anything. Do you see anybody in the courtroom that looks like the person that you know as Fredo?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-18\">\u201c[The Victim]: Fredo? No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-19\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Are you sure?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-20\">\u201c[The Victim]: No. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Again . . . could you look around the courtroom please?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-4\">\u201c[The Victim]: Maybe the hair was gray.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Maybe what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">\u201c[The Victim]: Maybe the hair was gray.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Whose hair was gray?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-8\">\u201c[The Victim]: Maybe it was Fredo\u2019s hair was gray.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-9\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Okay. Come over here if you can. Stand right here. [The victim was brought to the center of the courtroom.] Now . . . you were just saying something a moment ago about maybe the hair was gray. Whose hair were you talking about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-10\">\u201c[The Victim]: Maybe was that guy right there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-11\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Which guy was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-12\">\u201c[The Victim]: Look, the gray hair up top.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-13\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Could you go to the person in the courtroom who you\u2019re talking about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-14\">\u201c[The Victim]: Talking about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-15\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Who was the person with the gray hair that you\u2019re talking about right now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-16\">\u201c[The Victim]: Right there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-17\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: If you could go over to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-18\">\u201c[The Victim]: Next to the desk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-19\">\u201c[The Prosecutor]: Could you go over to that person right now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-20\">\u201c[The Victim]: Is he named Fredo?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>\u201c[The Prosecutor]: I\u2019m asking \u2014 well, I\u2019m not saying anything to you, but can you go to the person, can you point to the person that you\u2019re speaking of. . . . Your Honor, may the record reflect she\u2019s pointing to the defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">\u201cThe Court: It may so indicate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">That dialogue not only demonstrates the victim\u2019s difficulty in identifying the defendant, but perhaps more troubling is that it casts serious doubt on whether her responses could accurately be characterized as an identification of the defendant as the perpetrator. The excerpt raises the question of whether the victim was pointing to the defendant to identify him as the perpetrator or simply to clarify that he was the person about whom she asked the prosecutor: \u201cIs he named Fredo?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">Notwithstanding the uncertainty surrounding the victim\u2019s identification of the defendant, the court not only refused to charge the jury on the issue of identity, but instructed the jury not to consider the issue at all. The court instructed: \u201cAnd you\u2019ve heard argument and argument about whether or not the identification of the accused is an issue here. I\u2019d like to bring some commonsensical approach to that. . . . The question is, is this the gentleman who was identified as being named Fredo, Alfredo, is he the one at the synagogue on the dates and times in question. . . . There isn\u2019t any question that he\u2019s identified to be the person there. What happened there and whether he did these things is another issue, but don\u2019t get caught up in is [this] the man. That issue is not one that the jury should spend any time on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">That instruction implicitly validated the credibility and the sufficiency of the victim\u2019s in-court identification of the defendant as the perpetrator and enhanced the prejudicial impact of the court\u2019s earlier remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>We also reject the argument advanced by the state that the court\u2019s curative instruction rendered the remarks harmless. The court instructed the jury: \u201cI made a cursory examination to determine whether she was aware of where she was. I made no determination that she could be determined by me for your benefit; I didn\u2019t find that she\u2019s truthful or not. That is for you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">As a general matter, \u201c[t]he jury is presumed, in the absence of an indication to the contrary, to have followed the instructions of the trial court.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Chance, 236 Conn. 31, 51, 671 A.2d 323 (1996). Although our appellate courts have always given great weight to curative instructions in assessing claimed errors; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>200 Conn. 544, 552, 512 A.2d 884 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Fernandez, </em>198 Conn. 1, 17, 501 A.2d 1195 (1985); our courts have also recognized that \u201ca curative instruction is not inevitably sufficient to overcome . . . the impact of prejudice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Fernandez, </em>supra, 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Although it is not possible to determine with precision what prejudice a court\u2019s remarks might have on a jury, the likelihood here of prejudice to the defendant\u2019s case is apparent. In view of the significance of the remarks to the central issue in the trial, i.e., the victim\u2019s credibility, and the absence of corroborative evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt, the claimed curative instruction was not likely to have neutralized the court\u2019s remarks nor proscribed their prejudicial impact on the jury\u2019s assessment of the victim\u2019s credibility. As we are persuaded that the prejudicial impact of the court\u2019s remarks \u201chas probably overborne reasonable juror conscientiousness,\u201d we cannot accept the claimed efficacy of the curative instruction. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">We conclude, therefore, that the court\u2019s remarks, particularly when coupled with the restriction of the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>dant\u2019s cross-examination of the victim, improperly bolstered the credibility of the victim\u2019s testimony in violation of the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial and that the court\u2019s curative instruction did not render the comments harmless. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">Although the defendant raised additional claims on appeal, we need not address them inasmuch as our holding with respect to the court\u2019s improper remarks is dispositive. We choose, however, to address the defendant\u2019s claim regarding the court\u2019s denial of his motion to unseal the victim\u2019s confidential records because that issue is likely to recur at retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">The defendant claims that the court improperly denied his motion to unseal the victim\u2019s confidential records in.violation of his rights to due process and to a fair trial. Specifically, the defendant asserts that records generated by the department of children and families and an educational institution attended by the victim may contain information probative of past sexual abuse in the victim\u2019s family, alternative sources of knowledge of sexual language and conduct, and the victim\u2019s testimonial capacity. The defendant claims that the court\u2019s refusal to permit access to the records violated his rights to due process and to a fair trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">On March 14, 2002, the defendant filed a pretrial motion requesting that the court unseal the victim\u2019s confidential records. Following an in camera inspection of the records, the court denied the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">\u201cWhile we are mindful that the defendant\u2019s task to lay a foundation as to the likely relevance of records to which he is not privy is not an easy one, we are also mindful of the witness\u2019 legitimate interest in main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>taining, to the extent possible, the privacy of her confidential records.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>52 Conn. App. 708, 722, 728 A.2d 15, cert. denied, 249 Conn. 911, 733 A.2d 233 (1999). On review, we must determine whether the trial corut\u2019s decision constituted an abuse of discretion. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">This court, on appeal, has the responsibility of conducting its own in camera inspection of the sealed records to determine if the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to release those records to the defendant. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Tyson, </em>43 Conn. App. 61, 70, 682 A.2d 536, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 933, 683 A.2d 401 (1996). We conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">\u201cThe linchpin of the determination of the defendant\u2019s access to the records is whether they sufficiently disclose material especially probative of the ability to comprehend, know and correctly relate the truth ... so as to justify breach of their confidentiality .... Whether and to what extent access to the records should be granted to protect the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation must be determined on a case by case basis. \u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>supra, 52 Conn. App. 723. \u201c[W]hen the trial court has reviewed the records in camera, access to the records must be left to the discretion of the trial court which is better able to assess the probative value of such evidence as it relates to the particular case before it . . . and to weigh that value against the interest in confidentiality of the records.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">We have carefully examined the challenged records and conclude that the court reasonably could have found that they contained no information that is probative of past sexual abuse in the victim\u2019s family, alternative sources of knowledge of sexual language or conduct, or the victim\u2019s testimonial capacity. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>ingly, the court did hot abuse its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to unseal the victim\u2019s confidential records.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b484-7\"> Though the defendant set forth seven separate issues on appeal, we combine the two issues pertaining to the court\u2019s jury instruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b484-8\"> In accordance with our policy of protecting the privacy interests of the victims of sexual abuse, we decline to identify the victim or others through whom the victim\u2019s identify may be ascertained. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-86e.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b485-7\"><em> </em>On the count of sexual assault in the first degree, the defendant was sentenced to a term of fifteen years incarceration, execution suspended after twelve years with ten years probation. On the count of risk of injury to a child, the defendant was sentenced to a term of ten years, to run concurrently with the sentence for sexual assault in the first degree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b485-10\">The defendant\u2019s second and third claims on appeal are, respectively, that the court impermissibly restricted cross-examination of the victim and issued an inappropriate jury instruction as to identification of the defendant. Inasmuch as our analysis of the court\u2019s remarks implicates defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of the victim and the jury instruction, we address those matters, but do so without specifically reaching the merits of those claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b486-7\"> We note for clarity the scope of the defendant\u2019s claim on appeal. Although the need for a hearing to determine the victim\u2019s competency was obviated by the child witness competency rule; see General Statutes \u00a7 54-86h; the defendant does not challenge the court\u2019s decision to conduct such a hearing. Additionally, the defendant clarified at oral argument before this court that he also does not challenge the trial court\u2019s determination to conduct the hearing in the presence of the jury, even though he specifically requested that the hearing be conducted outside the presence of the jury. Although courts in other jurisdictions have held that it is reversible error to conduct a competency hearing in the presence of the jury; see, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>554 Pa. 559, 566, 722 A.2d 643 (1998); that issue has not yet been addressed in Connecticut. As the defendant here takes issue only with the court\u2019s remarks about the victim\u2019s competency and not the circumstances surrounding the competency hearing, we do not address that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 54-86h provides: \u201cNo witness shall be automatically adjudged incompetent to testily because of age and any child who is a victim of assault, sexual assault or abuse shall be competent to testify without prior qualification. The weight to be given the evidence and the credibility of the witness shall be for the determination of the trier of fact.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b491-8\"> See footnote 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
