We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On April 26, 1999, Chong Hong was employed as a front desk clerk at the West Haven Hotel (hotel) at 7 Kimberly Avenue in West Haven. After Hong ate dinner in the hotel kitchen with the victim, Josephine Lee, and another employee, he went to his room to rest before the start of his shift. At some time before 9 p.m., he heard a banging on his door and ran out to investigate. Hong went to the front desk and saw that it was unattended. Hong called the police and then was informed of an incident that had occurred upstairs in the room of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">The door to the victim\u2019s room was open, and Hong entered. He observed the victim lying on the floor, bleeding extensively from wounds on her face and head. Hong asked the victim what had happened, and she replied, \u201cIt\u2019s Vinny.\u201d Hong observed a great deal of blood in the room, and heard the victim \u201cmoaning and groaning\u201d as they waited for the police and medical personnel to arrive. An ambulance arrived, and the victim was taken to a hospital. The victim subsequently died as a result of her injuries.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>William Bruneau, a patrol officer with the West Haven police department, had received a report of a robbery at the hotel. Bruneau did not go to the hotel, but instead was dispatched as a perimeter officer. Bruneau received a description that the suspect was a white male wearing a green shirt. Bruneau observed the defendant, a white male wearing a green shirt, attempting to enter the backseat of a taxicab. After blocking the taxicab with his police vehicle, Bruneau approached the defendant while removing his weapon from its holster. The defendant immediately threw his hands in the air and said, \u201cI\u2019m the guy you\u2019re looking for. Don\u2019t shoot. Don\u2019t hurt me. I won\u2019t resist.\u201d Bruneau handcuffed the defendant and noticed that the defendant\u2019s hands were covered in blood, and that it appeared that the defendant had wiped blood onto his chin and down the front of his shirt. The defendant was placed in the backseat of the police vehicle, and kept repeating that he would not resist and that he was \u201cthe guy you\u2019re looking for.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Bruneau learned that the defendant might have been carrying a knife, so he took the defendant out of the vehicle to determine if, in fact, the defendant was in possession of a weapon. At that time, the defendant stated: \u201cMy name is Vinny. Vinny Ferraiuolo. I don\u2019t have a knife, I beat her with my hands.\u201d The defendant repeated that statement while Bruneau patted him down. No weapon was found, and the defendant was placed back in the police vehicle. The defendant continued to talk in the backseat, stating that \u201cyou [Bruneau] got to understand. You\u2019d do the same thing I did.\u201d The defendant stated that he had lent $60,000 to the victim and that she had stolen that money. Bruneau instructed the defendant to be quiet and transported him to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">James Sweetman, a detective with the West Haven police department, asked the defendant if he wanted to discuss the incident, and the defendant stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>he did not. A short time later, the defendant indicated that he wanted to give a statement regarding the victim. Sweetman advised the defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and the defendant initialed and then signed a waiver form indicating that he was waiving those rights. Sweetman then asked the defendant about the homicide at the hotel, and the defendant verbalized the entire incident. The defendant stated that he repeatedly had struck the victim in the head with a golf club and a metal roller. Golf clubs and the metal roller were recovered from the victim\u2019s room and were covered in the victim\u2019s blood. Sweetman then set up a computer terminal and asked the defendant to repeat his statement so that it could be typed. Sweetman allowed the defendant to read the typed statement and asked the defendant if he wanted to make any changes. The defendant declined to make any changes. The statement was printed, and the defendant reviewed it again and then signed it.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>The jury found the defendant guilty of murder, and the court sentenced him to an effective prison term of sixty years incarceration.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly admitted into evidence needlessly cumulative autopsy slides of the victim. Specifically, the defendant argues that the court abused its discretion in admitting seventeen color slides of the victim, some of which showed the same injuries and some of which did not show any injuries to the head or face at all. The state contends that it was within the court\u2019s discretion to admit the slides into evidence. The state also argues, in the alternative, that even if the court acted improperly in admitting the slides, such error was harmless. We agree with the state with respect to both arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">At the outset, we set forth the legal principles that guide our review of the issue. \u201cThis court has consistently held that photographic evidence is admissible where the photograph [or slide] has a reasonable tendency to prove or disprove a material fact in issue or shed some light upon some material inquiry. . . . [Moreover] [t]here is no requirement . . . that a potentially inflammatory photograph be essential to the state\u2019s case in order for it to be admissible; <em>rather, the test for determining the admissibility of the challenged evidence is relevancy and not necessity. . . . </em>Thus, although irrelevant evidence of a gruesome character is inadmissible, [t]he prosecution, with its burden of establishing guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, is not to be denied the right to prove every essential element of the crime by the most convincing evidence it is able to produce.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Satchwell, </em>244 Conn. 547, 574-75, 710 A.2d 1348 (1998); C. Tait, Connecticut Evidence (3d Ed. 2001) \u00a7 11.17.1, p. 816; see generally annot., 37 A.L.R.5th 515 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">\u201cA potentially inflammatory photograph may be admitted if the court, in its discretion, determines that the probative value of the photograph outweighs the prejudicial effect it might have on the jury. . . . The determination of the trial court will not be disturbed unless the trial court has abused its discretion.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>227 Conn. 101, 111, 629 A.2d 402 (1993); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>206 Conn. 300, 314-15, 537 A.2d 1021 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>69 Conn. App. 576, 594, 795 A.2d 597 (2002). With the foregoing legal principles and standard of review in mind, we now address the specifics of the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">At the defendant\u2019s first trial, the state made an offer of proof outside the presence of the jury with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>to twenty-two color slides that had been taken at the direction of Edward T. McDonough, the state\u2019s deputy chief medical examiner. Seventeen of the slides were of the victim, and five were of objects taken from the victims\u2019 room, specifically, the golf clubs and the metal roller.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The defendant objected to the introduction into evidence of some of the slides. Specifically, he argued that they were repetitious and that there would be a prejudicial impact on the jury. The defendant also argued that the slides, in particular the pictures of the victim\u2019s head, were \u201cgory.\u201d He did not object to some of the slides being shown to the jury. The state argued that all the slides were necessary to prove the element of intent. Furthermore, the state noted that the different angles depicted in the various slides demonstrated the details regarding all of the lacerations and wounds to the victim\u2019s head and face. The court agreed with the state and overruled the defendant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">During his second trial, the defendant filed a motion in hmine that sought to preclude the admission of the slides into evidence on the ground that their prejudicial effect on the jury outweighed their probative value. During argument on the motion, the defendant conceded that he did not have any additional case law to support his motion or that would change the ruling from the first trial. The court adopted the ruling from the first trial and denied the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">During McDonough\u2019s testimony, the defendant renewed his objection to the slides. He objected to each and every slide because they were excessive, repetitive, had no probative value and were introduced for the sole purpose of prejudicing the jury. The court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection. McDonough stated that the slides would be helpful in illustrating how he had per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>formed the autopsy and how the injuries were inflicted on the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">McDonough then described to the jury each of the slides. He explained that the first few slides were pre-liminaxy photographs of the victim\u2019s body as she first arrived at his office. Those slides were used primarily for identification purposes. McDonough then showed slides that depicted the various lacerations to the victim\u2019s face and head. Some of the slides showed wounds that had been sutured, and others showed the same wounds without the sutures. McDonough noted that the slides demonstrated that the wounds had been caused by an instrument with an edge, such as a golf club, as opposed to a flat surface. He also explained that the victim suffered more than ten lacerations as a result of multiple blows.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">In his brief, the defendant first argues that the five slides that depicted the victim\u2019s body as it arrived at the medical examiner\u2019s office were needlessly cumulative.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He contends that although it may have been proper for the court to admit one of those slides, to admit all of them into evidence, particularly those slides of the lower half of the body, was improper. He further argues that the before and after slides showing the same wounds with and without sutures was improper and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>that only the slides of the wounds without evidence of medical intervention should have been admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">At the outset, we note that our Supreme Court has stated that \u201cphotographs of a corpse have been held properly admissible in prosecutions for homicide in spite of a claim that they constitute merely cumulative evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Piskorski, </em>177 Conn. 677, 701, 419 A.2d 866, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 935, 100 S. Ct. 283, 62 L. Ed. 2d 194 (1979); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>194 Conn. 376, 385, 481 A.2d 1277 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hanna, </em>150 Conn. 457, 461, 191 A.2d 124 (1963). Furthermore, we have stated that \u201c[e]ven photographs depicting gruesome scenes that may prejudice the jury are admissible, so long as, in the court\u2019s discretion, they are more probative than prejudicial. ... A court may exclude relevant evidence \u2018if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of <em>unfair </em>prejudice. . . .\u2019 Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 4.3.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>supra, 69 Conn. App. 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">In the present case, the slides were used to help explain the autopsy procedure and assist McDonough in describing his observations. As he stated in his testimony: \u201cNo matter how good my descriptions of any injury might be, it certainly is easier or complementary to see them in photographic form.\u201d The slides also were relevant to the issues of intent and cause of death. The slides, therefore, were the most convincing evidence that the state was able to produce and assisted the state with its burden of proving every essential element of the crime of murder beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 111-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">It is clear that the state was entitled to have the jury view some of the slides. What is less clear is whether it was proper for the court to admit into evidence all of the slides that depicted the victim\u2019s body and did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>not show any of the wounds from the defendant\u2019s attack or all of the repetitive slides of the wounds with and without sutures. As we have stated, we are bound to review the defendant\u2019s claim under the abuse of discretion standard. If our standard of review were broader, we may well have reached a different conclusion, i.e., that the slides of the victim\u2019s body and wounds were so repetitive in nature that their prejudicial impact on the jury outweighed their probative value. We agree with the Supreme Court of Washington, which stated: \u201cProsecutors as well as trial courts must exercise then-discretion in the use of gruesome photographs. The statement that the State had the right to prove its case up to the hilt in whatever manner it chose, must be read to mean only that the State may present ample evidence to prove every element of the crime. . . . Prosecutors are not given a carte blanche to introduce every piece of admissible evidence if the cumulative effect of such evidence is inflammatory and unnecessary.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Crenshaw, </em>98 Wash. 2d 789, 807, 659 P.2d 488 (1983). Nevertheless, we are constrained by our standard of review. As we stated in <em>Sanchez: </em>\u201cThe fact that we may be able to conclude that a photograph was not relevant does not mean that other reasonable persons might . . . conclude otherwise.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>supra, 69 Conn. App. 594. In accordance with the principle that the trial court is afforded broad leeway in determining whether the probative value of the slides outweighed their prejudicial effect, even in a close case, we cannot conclude that the court abused its discretion in admitting all of the slides into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">Even if we were to assume arguendo that the court abused its discretion in admitting into evidence all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>slides, we would conclude that such error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">We have stated that \u201c[u]nder the current and longstanding state of the law in Connecticut, the burden to prove the harmfulness of an improper evidentiary ruling is borne by the defendant. The defendant must show that it is more probable than not that the erroneous action of the court affected the result. . . . Furthermore, [t]he ruling of the trial court in order to constitute reversible error must have been both incorrect and harmful. . . . The question is whether the trial court\u2019s error was so prejudicial as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, or, stated another way, was the court\u2019s ruling, though erroneous, likely to affect the result?\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lewis, 67 </em>Conn. App. 643, 653-54, 789 A.2d 519, cert. denied, 261 Conn. 938, 808 A.2d 1133 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">In the present case, the defendant was found near the hotel soon after the attack on the victim. He was wearing clothing that matched the description of the perpetrator. When Bruneau handcuffed the defendant, he noticed that the defendant\u2019s hands were covered in blood that later was determined to belong to the victim. The defendant made an oral confession and subsequently signed a written statement that stated he killed the victim in a manner consistent with the evidence; that is, he repeatedly struck the victim\u2019s head and face with an edged instrument. Finally, we note that the victim identified her attacker as \u201cVinny.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">In light of the overwhelming evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt, we agree with the state that even if we were to conclude that the court abused its discretion in admitting all of the slides, such error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">The defendant also claims that the court improperly admitted into evidence his signed <em>Miranda </em>waiver form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>and written statement. Specifically, the defendant argues that the court in his second trial simply adopted the ruling from the first trial regarding the authentication of the waiver form and the two page confession, and ignored the testimony from a handwriting expert, which was not available at the first trial. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">The following additional facts are necessary for the resolution of that issue. During the first trial, a hearing regarding the defendant\u2019s waiver form and the statement was held outside the presence of the jury. Sweetman testified that he had interviewed the defendant at the police station. Initially, the defendant refused to make a statement, but he soon changed his mind. Sweetman advised the defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and filled out a waiver form. Sweetman stated that the defendant had read the form sentence by sentence and placed his initials after each sentence, indicating that he understood the particular right he was waiving. Sweetman testified that he observed the defendant sign the bottom of the form. The defendant objected, stating that he never initialed or signed the waiver form. The court overruled the defendant\u2019s objection and admitted the waiver form into evidence as a full exhibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">The state next offered the statement into evidence, and the defendant objected. Sweetman testified that he took the defendant\u2019s statement regarding the events that occurred at the hotel. Sweetman asked the defendant questions and typed his responses on the basis of the defendant\u2019s narrative. The defendant was given the opportunity to make changes to the statement both before and after the statement was printed. The defendant then signed the statement in the presence of Sweetman and Walter S. Casey, a detective sergeant in the West Haven police department. Sweetman and Casey both testified that they were 100 percent certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>that the defendant had made and signed the statement. The defendant again objected on the ground that he never had read or signed the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The court heard argument with respect to the admissibility of the statement. The court noted that the signature on the statement was not similar to the signature found on the motions that the defendant had filed in court. The court then ruled that the statement was admissible because any discrepancies between the signatures pertained to the weight of the evidence rather than to its admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">At the second trial, the court reviewed the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the waiver form and the statement, as well as the transcript and ruling from the first trial. The court ruled that the evidence was admissible and that the order from the first trial would not be disturbed. The court further explained that it was aware that a handwriting analysis had been performed, but did not know the results.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The handwriting expert, James Streeter, testified that he had examined the signature on the waiver form and the statement, and compared them to the known signature of the defendant. Streeter . was unable to verify that the signature on the waiver form and statement belonged to the defendant. Streeter also stated that he could not eliminate the defendant as being the author of the signatures on the waiver form and statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">At the outset, we set forth the applicable standard of review. \u201cThe trial court\u2019s ruling on the admissibility of evidence is entitled to great deference. . . . [T]he trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility ... of evidence. . . . The trial court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters will be overturned only upon a showing of a clear abuse of the court\u2019s discretion. . . . We will make every reasonable presumption in favor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling, and only upset it for a manifest abuse of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Moody, </em>77 Conn. App. 197, 204, 822 A.2d 990, cert. denied, 264 Conn. 918, 827 A.2d 707 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">\u201cAuthentication is ... a necessary preliminary to the introduction of most writings in evidence. ... In general, a writing may be authenticated by a number of methods, including direct testimony .... Both courts and commentators have noted that the showing of authenticity is not on a par with the more technical evidentiary mies that govern admissibility, such as hearsay exceptions, competency and privilege. . . . Rather, there need only be a prima facie showing of authenticity to the court. . . . Once a prima facie showing of authorship is made to the court, the evidence, as long as it is otherwise admissible, goes to the jury, which will ultimately determine its authenticity. . . . The only requirement is that there have been substantial evidence from which the jury could infer that the document was authentic.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Berger, </em>249 Conn. 218, 233, 733 A.2d 156 (1999); see also Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 9-1; C. Tait, supra, \u00a7 9.6.1, p. 761 (\u201c[a] writing can be authenticated merely by proof of the signature of the writer. . . . Such proof can be provided by testimony of ... an eyewitness who saw the writing executed\u201d [citations omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">The defendant claims that the signatures on the waiver form and statement had not been properly authenticated and that it was therefore improper for the court to admit them into evidence, particularly in light of the inconclusive expert opinion. That argument, however, confuses the admissibility of the signatures with the weight to be afforded to them. In the present case, Sweetman testified that he observed the defendant initial and sign the waiver form. Furthermore, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>stated that he saw the defendant sign the statement. Additionally, Casey testified that he witnessed the defendant sign the statement and that he attached his signature to the document.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">We find that such testimony was substantial prima facie evidence from which the jury could infer that the document was authentic and therefore admissible. It was for the jury, as the trier of fact, to determine how much weight to afford the waiver form, the statement and the expert opinion. We conclude, therefore, that the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting into evidence the signed waiver form and statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b550-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a provides in relevant part that \u201c[a] person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b551-8\"> See <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.
