Walker, appeals from the judgments of conviction, following a jury trial, of two counts of aggravated sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70a (a) (1), four counts of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (1), two counts of kidnapping in the first degree with a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92a, four counts of kidnapping in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (A), threatening in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-62 (a) (2), criminal possession of a weapon in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-217, two counts of credit card theft in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-128c (a), three counts of fraudulent use of an automatic teller machine in violation of General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 53a-127b, two counts of illegal use of a credit card in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-128d and one count of larceny in the sixth degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-125b. The defendant fled the state prior to the completion of trial. He was sentenced by the trial court in absentia to a total effective term of fifty years incarceration, suspended after thirty-two years, with twenty years probation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendant asserts that the court improperly denied his motion for a mistrial, claiming that events that transpired during the trial prejudiced the jury. We affirm the judgments of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">The facts relating to the defendant\u2019s claim are as follows. Following the state\u2019s case-in-chief, the trial judge informed the parties that one of the jurors, L,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> had informed the courtroom clerk that she had received, in the mail, an anonymous letter and a news article concerning the defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial judge thereafter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>called L into the courtroom outside of the presence of the other jurors and questioned her about what she had received. L stated that she had read the letter, but that she did not read any part of the news article, opting instead to let her husband review it because she did not know if it contained \u201ca threat.\u201d She stated, however, that her husband informed her that the article did not include any threatening material and that she asked her husband to refrain from relating any other information about the article to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The trial judge asked L whether the letter would influence her ability to serve as a juror. L responded that it would not. The prosecutor asked L whether she had any doubt that she \u201ccould still decide the case for both sides fairly and impartially.\u201d L responded: \u201cDefinitely. I mean, it could have come from anybody. For all I know, it could have come from you, it could have come from the defendant\u2019s attorney. It could have come from family members. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">The defendant\u2019s attorney also questioned L. The following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>\u201c[Defense Counsel]: The sentence, \u2018Don\u2019t let that confirmed rapist go free,\u2019 doesn\u2019t have any effect?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-6\">\u201c[The Witness]: Not to my knowledge that he is a confirmed rapist, so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-7\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: So, as far as you are concerned, this was just a crank letter that you cross off as a crank letter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-8\">\u201c[The Witness]: Exactly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-9\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Which may or may not be accurate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-10\">\u201c[The Witness]: Exactly, because I don\u2019t even know any facts about his previous history. I\u2019m just here to decide the facts that are given to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-11\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Did you discuss these letters\u2014 Did any of you discuss these letters on your way in this morning or after you got together this morning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-12\">\u201c[The Witness]: The jurors asked who got a letter. That was it. Some\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-13\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Sorry?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-14\">\u201c[The Witness]: We all had obviously a letter. We noticed some did, some did not. So, we asked, \u2018Did everybody get a letter?\u2019 We did not discuss the contents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-15\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Did anybody have any speculation about as to where the letter came from or who the letter came from?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-16\">\u201c[The Witness]: No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-17\">After the court and the attorneys questioned L, the court instructed her to put the items mailed to her aside and not to let them influence her in deciding the case. The court brought each juror, outside the presence of their fellow jurors, into the courtroom and, along with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>the attorneys, questioned each juror concerning the anonymous letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Juror M similarly stated that she had received a mailing containing a letter and a news article. M stated that she had read part of the news article before handing it to her husband. M represented that she did not believe that she could be \u201ccompletely objective\u201d in deciding the case and expressed her concerns that she might experience \u201cramifications\u201d were she to vote one way or another in the case. M further represented that she did not think she would be able to put the information aside and decide the case on the basis of the evidence presented at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Another juror, E, stated that she also received the same letter and news article. She recounted that she read only the first line of the letter, which stated, \u201cdear concerned citizen,\u201d and that she then handed it to her husband, who instructed her not to read it and to show it to the court. E further stated that the jurors had acknowledged that certain of them had received letters, but that the jurors had not discussed the contents of the letters. E stated that the letter would not affect her jury service and her ability to follow the court\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">The defendant\u2019s counsel questioned E and the following colloquy transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-9\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Did it frighten you at all to be receiving a letter about this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-10\">\u201c[The Witness]: I don\u2019t think I would say frightened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-11\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Concern? Concern you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-12\">\u201c[The Witness]: Yes, concerning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-13\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Do you have any speculation\u2014 don\u2019t tell me what they are. Do you have any speculation or guesses about\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>\u201c[The Witness]: I\u2019m trying not to even think about it because I just don\u2019t want to go there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: And you can be as fair as you should be to my client and to the state?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-7\">\u201c[The Witness]: I will try my hardest to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-8\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Do you have any reservations about it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-9\">\u201c[The Witness]: No. I will try my best to do what I feel is right, and that\u2019s usually what I do. I try to do my best.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-10\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Okay. What you feel is right based on the evidence that is presented in this courtroom, not on evidence that is sent to you in the mail anonymously?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-11\">\u201c[The Witness]: Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-12\">The court next questioned juror T, who stated that the letter and news article had been mailed to his home, as well. He stated that his wife had opened the envelope containing the items and showed him the letter, which he read. The court asked T if he recalled the contents of the letter. T responded: \u201cHere\u2019s what I recall. \u2018Don\u2019t let this rapist go free. Your duty,\u2019 something like that, \u2018friends of the victim.\u2019 \u201d T further represented that after his wife told him that there was an article about the case, he told her not to read it to him, to put it back in the envelope and that he would bring it to the court\u2019s attention. The court asked T whether he could decide the case on the basis of the evidence he hears in court and not let the items mailed to him affect his verdict. T responded affirmatively. The court asked T if he had \u201cany question\u201d about his ability to disregard the items mailed to him. T responded that he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-13\">Defense counsel then questioned T, and the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>\u201c[Defense Counsel]: \u2018Don\u2019t let that rapist go free.\u2019 That doesn\u2019t have any affect on you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-6\">\u201c[The Witness]: It struck me as being either from someone very dumb or someone dumber, trying to act dumb. The letter. I don\u2019t understand where it came\u2014 I don\u2019t know what that letter is all about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Did it bother you to have a letter come to your house about this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-8\">\u201c[The Witness]: Well, I know that when we did the voir dire \u2014 when we went through voir dire, I thought when we gave names and addresses. So, I figured that\u2019s how it came to my house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-9\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Names and towns, but\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-10\">\u201c[The Witness]: Pardon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-11\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Names and towns. This is not going to have any affect on how you view this case or how you view the testimony, or what you think about things in this courtroom that are said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-12\">\u201c[The Witness]: That letter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-13\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-14\">\u201c[The Witness]: No. I mean obviously someone is saying he\u2019s a rapist, he\u2019s saying he isn\u2019t. Why\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-15\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: I\u2019m asking you. If you\u2019re saying it doesn\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t have any affect on how you listen to the testimony, on how you view what the state says and how you view what I say, and what evidence there is, if you\u2019re saying that\u2019s the case then\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-16\">\u201c[The Witness]: I don\u2019t think it will affect what the state says or what you say. So, to have an open mind, some idiot sent me a letter trying to say to do a certain thing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>The court also questioned jurors W, D, J and G, all of whom stated that they had not received the letter or the news article.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> All four of those jurors represented that, although they were aware that some of their fellow jurors had received something about the case in the mail, the jurors who had received the letter and the news article had not discussed the content of what they had received with them.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> All four of those jurors also represented that the fact that some of their fellow jurors had received the letter and the news article in no way affected their ability to remain fair and impartial or to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>hear the evidence adduced at trial and to return a verdict solely on the basis of such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">After the court and the attorneys interviewed the jurors, the defendant moved for a mistrial. Defense counsel argued that the information sent to the jurors concerned the defendant\u2019s prior criminal histoiy and that it was, therefore, \u201cextremely prejudicial.\u201d Defense counsel also argued that it was impossible to predict how that form of jury tampering might affect the jury and that the problem implicated the defendant\u2019s right to receive a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">The court orally denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial. The court first noted that it was not predisposed to deny the defendant\u2019s motion simply because the parties and the court already had expended considerable time and resources on the case. Instead, the court based its ruling on the jurors\u2019 responses to the questions asked of them. The court assessed the representations made by the jurors as being \u201cquite frank.\u201d The court further determined that the jurors realized their civic duty, devoted time in hearing the evidence and were motivated to avoid discussing the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">The court noted that W,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> D, J and G, the four jurors who had not received the material in the mail, consistently represented that they were aware only that some of their fellow jurors had received some type of correspondence and that no juror had discussed the contents of what he or she had received. Insofar as those four jurors were concerned, the court determined that it was \u201cbeyond [its] comprehension\u201d how the improper communication with some of the jurors could affect them.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">The court next discussed its findings with regard to M. The court noted that M was the only juror who had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>read at least part of the news article concerning the defendant\u2019s prior criminal history. The court determined that this fact, as well as M\u2019s representation that she would have \u201ca hard time\u201d disregarding the information that she read, warranted M\u2019s removal from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The court noted that L had represented that she read only the letter and not the news article. The court stated that it had concern over the phrase \u201cconvicted rapist\u201d in the letter, but that its concerns were allayed by L\u2019s representation that she would disregard what she had read and that it would have no affect on her. The court concluded: \u201cTaking her at her word, I have instructed her, and I assume she will follow those instructions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">The court stated its findings with regard to E as follows: \u201c[E] indicated that all she read was basically, \u2018dear concerned citizen,\u2019 which it doesn\u2019t say. It says, \u2018Responsible Citizen.\u2019 But that\u2019s her recollection. That\u2019s all she read. She never even read further where it indicates that the defendant supposedly was a convicted rapist. \u201cSo, she did not read the rest of that document or any of the second document, and it would not affect her at all. And I don\u2019t see how it could.\u201d Likewise, the court noted that T had read only the letter and not the news article. The court observed that T did not even recall the fact that the term \u201cconvicted rapist\u201d was used in the letter. The court was satisfied that T, as he had indicated, could disregard what he had read.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">The court summarized its conclusions with regard to all of the jurors, except M, as follows: \u201cNone of these jurors read the second page, which is the Hartford Courant article itself. I am totally satisfied that the little bit they read on that first page, they can put that aside, they can be totally fair and impartial, and [they] said it would not affect them on this case at all. I am extremely satisfied that the jurors were candid. I think they did not share any of that information. And I would be more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>concerned if they read that second page, which one juror did, which appears [to be] an article from the Courant. The three remaining jurors who received correspondence indicated [that] they did not read the second page. No one in the household told them anything about that. I\u2019m totally satisfied that they will be fair and impartial, that the little bit that they did read will not affect them sitting on the case.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Having set forth the necessary facts, we now set forth the standard of review that controls our consideration of the defendant\u2019s claim that the court improperly denied his motion for a mistrial. \u201cWhile the remedy of a mistrial is permitted under the rules of practice, it is not favored. [A] mistrial should be granted only as a result of some occurrence upon the trial of such a character that it is apparent to the court that because of it a party cannot have a fair trial . . . and the whole proceedings are vitiated. ... If curative action can obviate the prejudice, the drastic remedy of a mistrial should be avoided. ... On appeal, we hesitate to disturb a decision not to declare a mistrial. The trial judge is the arbiter of the many circumstances which may arise during the trial in which his function is to assure a fair and just outcome. . . . The trial court is better positioned than we are to evaluate in the first instance whether a certain occurrence is prejudicial to the defendant and, if so, what remedy is necessary to cure that prejudice. . . . The decision whether to grant a mistrial is within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Higgins, </em>265 Conn. 35, 75-76, 826 A.2d 1126 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Our appellate review is constrained to evaluating the court\u2019s exercise of its discretion even when, as here, the issue concerns whether improper communications between members of the jury and a person who is not a member of the jury deprived the defendant of his right to a fair trial. \u201cAlthough we recognize that trial [c] ourts face a delicate and complex task whenever they undertake to investigate reports of juror misconduct or bias ... we nevertheless have reserved the right to find an abuse of discretion in the highly unusual case in which such an abuse has occurred.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mukhtaar, </em>253 Conn. 280, 297, 750 A.2d 1059 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The constitution of Connecticut, article first, \u00a7 8, and the sixth amendment to the United States constitution guarantee a defendant\u2019s fundamental right to a fair trial by an <em>impartial </em>jury. \u201cSo basic to our jurisprudence is the right to a fair trial that it has been called \u2018the most fundamental of all freedoms.\u2019 <em>Estes </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>381 U.S. 532, 540, [85 S. Ct. 1628, 14 L. Ed. 2d 543] (1965). It is a right essential to the preservation and enjoyment of all other rights, providing a necessary means of safeguarding personal liberties against government oppression.\u201d <em>Nebraska Press Assn. </em>v. <em>Stuart, </em>427 U.S. 539, 586, 96 S. Ct. 2791, 49 L. Ed. 2d 683 (1976) (Brennan, J., concurring). \u201c[T]he theory of our system is that the conclusions to be reached in a case will be induced only by evidence and argument in open court, and not by any outside influence, whether of private talk or public print.\u201d <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Colorado, </em>205 U.S. 454, 462, 27 S. Ct. 556, 51 L. Ed. 879 (1907). It has long been the law of this state that any communication between a juror and any person not a member of the jury, concerning the cause under consideration, is prohibited. See <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>3 Day (Conn.) 219, 223 (1808).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Before reaching the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim, we first address an issue raised by the defendant con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>cerning whether he or the state bore the burden of proof. The defendant correctly points out that the letter mailed to the jurors attempted to persuade the jurors to convict him of the dimes with which he stood charged and that the news article that accompanied the letter referred to his prior criminal history. He argues that those communications were presumptively prejudicial and that the state bore the burden of demonstrating their harmlessness. The state, in contrast, argues that when, as here, the court itself was in no way responsible for the impropriety, the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that he actually was prejudiced by the improper communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Our Supreme Court discussed the burden of proof in cases involving improper juror contact in <em>State </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>248 Conn. 39, 726 A.2d 513 (1999). The defendant in <em>Rhodes, </em>having been convicted of murder and felony murder, filed a motion for a new trial on the ground of juror misconduct. Id., 42. The defendant alleged that a juror had discussed the deliberations with a third party. Id. The trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing in which the juror at issue admitted that she had engaged in several conversations about aspects of the case in general, and the course of the jury\u2019s deliberations, with her boyfriend. Id., 42-45. The trial court in <em>Rhodes </em>determined that \u201cirrespective of which party bore the burden of proof on the issue of prejudice, and by whatever standard of proof, the defendant could not prevail on his claim\u201d and, thus, denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. Id., 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">On appeal, the defendant in <em>Rhodes, </em>as does the defendant in the present case, argued that the improper contacts between the juror and the third party were presumptively prejudicial and that the state bore the burden of establishing that the contacts were harmless. Our Supreme Court stated that this state\u2019s prior case law \u201cplaces the burden on the defendant to show that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>or she was actually prejudiced by the juror misconduct when the trial court is in no way responsible for the impropriety.\u201d Id., 48. The Supreme Court determined that the circumstances of the case presented \u201cno reason to revisit [its] prior case law regarding the burden or standard of proof in juror misconduct cases\u201d because the defendant could not prevail either under the established standard in this state or under the standard proposed by the defendant. Id., 50. The court nevertheless acknowledged that a split of authority existed in the United States Circuit Courts of Appeal \u201cas to whether a presumption of prejudice arises when a juror has improper communications about the case with a third party.\u201d Id., 49 n.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Our Supreme Court in <em>Rhodes, </em>however, referring to <em>United States </em>v. <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 113 S. Ct. 1770, 123 L. Ed. 2d 508 (1993), signaled that the \u201ccritical consideration in resolving a claim of improper juror contact is not whether prejudice may be assumed from such contact, but, rather, whether, under the specific facts of the case, any such impropriety actually affected the verdict.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>supra, 248 Conn. 49 n.16. The court cited <em>Olano, </em>in which the United States Supreme Court stated: \u201cThere may be cases where [a jury] intrusion should be presumed prejudicial . . . but a presumption of prejudice as opposed to a specific analysis does not change the ultimate inquiry: Did the intrusion affect the jury\u2019s [deliberations] and thereby its verdict?\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 50 n.16, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Olano, </em>supra, 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Our Supreme Court in <em>Rhodes </em>applied the legal principles that apply with equal force to the present claim: \u201c[N]ot every incident of juror misconduct requires a new trial. . . . [D]ue process seeks to assure a defendant a fair trial, not a perfect one. . . . [T]he constitution does not require a new trial every time a juror has been placed in a potentially compromising situation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>. . . [because] it is virtually impossible to shield jurors from every contact or influence which might theoretically affect their vote. . . . The question is whether or not the misconduct has prejudiced the defendant to the extent that he has not received a fair trial. . . . The defendant has been prejudiced if the misbehavior is such to make it probable that the juror\u2019s mind was influenced by it so as to render him or her an unfair and prejudicial juror. . . . We have previously held that, in cases where the trial court is directly implicated in juror misconduct, the state bears the burden of proving that misconduct was harmless error. . . . Where, however, the trial court was in no way responsible for the juror misconduct . . . we have repeatedly held that a defendant who offers proof of juror misconduct bears the burden of proving that actual prejudice resulted from that misconduct.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>supra, 248 Conn. 47.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Applying those well settled legal principles to the present case, we conclude that the court did not abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>its discretion in finding that the defendant failed to meet his burden of proving that the misconduct, which he proved occurred, resulted in <em>actual prejudice. </em>Upon learning that L and some of her fellow jurors had received information about the case, the court afforded the unusual situation the concern and attention that it warranted. As was its duty, the court conducted an appropriate inquiry to investigate the allegation that a juror or jurors may have become biased. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Roman, </em>262 Conn. 718, 727, 817 A.2d 100 (2003). The record reflects that the court questioned each juror, and invited and permitted counsel for each side to question each juror, which they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">The court made numerous factual findings in support of its conclusion that the attempt to prejudice the jury did not warrant a mistrial. The court\u2019s function with regard to the matter required it to assess prejudice. On the basis of the representations of each juror, the court had to determine whether \u201cthe misbehavior [was] such to make it probable that the juror\u2019s mind was influenced by it so as to render him or her an unfair and prejudicial juror. . . . Because it is in the best position to evaluate the assurances by the jurors, the trial court\u2019s credibility assessment is entitled to substantial weight.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Feliciano, </em>256 Conn. 429, 450, 778 A.2d 812 (2001). The court\u2019s analysis in this case was inherently fact specific. When findings are not clearly erroneous, this court will decline to substitute its judgment for that of the finder of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">The court\u2019s findings, that the improper mailings had prejudiced M and that the other jurors had not been prejudiced, find support in the record. The court based its findings largely on the jurors\u2019 representations about what they <em>actually read. </em>As the court noted, jurors W, D, J and G did not even review either the letter or the news article, and they did not learn any of the details <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>about either of those items from their fellow jurors. Of the other three jurors who received the improper items, L, E and T, none of them read the news article. L read the brief letter, which contained the phrase \u201cconvicted rapist.\u201d The court found, however, that L credibly represented that the letter would have no affect on her and that she could follow the court\u2019s instructions. E recalled only that she read the greeting, \u201cdear concerned citizen,\u201d in the letter, and the court found credible her representation that this would not affect her ability to remain impartial as a juror. Finally, T represented that he had read the letter, but that he did not even recall that the term \u201cconvicted rapist\u201d was used in the letter. Again, the court specifically found that T could disregard what he had read.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">The court\u2019s factual findings with regard to all of those jurors are clear. Acting within the scope of its fact-finding role, the court was \u201cextremely satisfied\u201d that the jurors were candid, that they had not discussed the contents of the letter or the article, that they could put aside whatever effect the improper mailing had on them, and that they could remain \u201ctotally fair and impartial.\u201d It is fortunate that the court became aware of the incident immediately after it occurred and prior to the jury\u2019s deliberations. That timing permitted the court to examine each juror, to receive face-to-face assurances from each juror that the incident would play no role in their deliberations and specifically to instruct the jurors that they were to disregard completely what recently had been mailed to some of them.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>This court does not make light of the potentially negative impact that the letter and the news article might have had on every member of the jury. That can be no better demonstrated than by the representations of M, whom the court properly excluded. Our concerns, however, are allayed by the court\u2019s findings that none of the jurors who remained on the panel had read the news article and that the three jurors who had read some or all of the letter were unaffected. The record supports the court\u2019s determination that those jurors would remain fair and impartial, and that, as they had demonstrated, they would follow the court\u2019s instructions and not permit the information mailed to some of the jurors to affect their verdict. The court\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous, and its underlying findings support its conclusion that the defendant failed to demonstrate that he suffered actual prejudice. Consequently, we conclude that the court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial reflected a sound exercise of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b572-7\"> The defendant was later apprehended in Canada and returned to this state, where, in a separate proceeding, he pleaded guilty to two counts of failure to appear in the first degree and one count of failure to appear in the second degree.

The very next day following the court\u2019s examination of the jury, juror W reported to the court that he, too, had received in his mail the letter and the news article about the case. W delivered the items to the court. The court called W into the courtroom, outside of the presence of his fellow jurors, and W represented that his wife had examined the items and told him that a letter had come in the mail that \u201cwould probably pertain to the case.\u201d The court asked W if he had read the contents of what he had received. W responded that he had not. The court instructed W to ignore the fact that he had received the letter. The court asked W if he had \u201cany difficulty at all\u201d in continuing to serve as a juror in the case. W responded that he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">The defendant immediately renewed his motion for a mistrial. The court denied the motion, noting that W did not read the materials and did not know their contents. The court found credible W\u2019s representation that the fact that he had received a letter, which he did not examine at all, would not affect his ability to remain a fair and impartial juror.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b578-8\"> When defense counsel questioned J about the fact that jurors had received the letter and the news article in the mail, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-9\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Did anyone, even though they didn\u2019t go into the content, the ones that said they read it partially, did they talk about the general character of the article?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-10\">\u201c[The Witness]: They refused to offer any opinion.
