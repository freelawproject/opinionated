The defendant also was convicted, after a simultaneous trial to the court, of criminal possession of a pistol or revolver in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-217c. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>appeal, the defendant claims that there was insufficient evidence to prove that the barrel of the firearm in question was less than twelve inches in length, a necessary element of the offenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">The state concedes, and we agree after examining the record, that there was insufficient evidence to sustain the conviction. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gallichio, </em>71 Conn. App. 179, 182, 800 A.2d 1261 (2002). Accordingly, we reverse the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment of not guilty.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b602-13\">The defendant raised two additional claims that we do not address because the resolution of his first claim is dispositive of his appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
