They are also entitled to service pensions reflecting their years of service. Although the collective bargaining agreement expressly limits service pensions to reflect a base pay cap, the agreement does not expressly limit disability pensions. In this case, the city\u2019s retirement board decided that the firefighters\u2019 disability pension awards should be recalculated to correct prior pension payments that, in error, had failed to apply a base pay cap. The firefighters filed an administrative appeal to contest these recalculations, and the trial court sustained their appeal. We affirm the judgment of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The principal focus of the administrative appeal filed by the plaintiff firefighters of the city of Waterbury (city) was the absence of evidentiary support of record for the decision of the Waterbury retirement board (board) to recalculate their disability pension benefits by subjecting those benefits to a pay cap. They also claimed that, as a matter of law, the board\u2019s decisions misconstrued the terms of the agreement with respect to this cap. The defendants, the city, various city officers, and the board and its commissioners,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> defended the decisions of the board in both respects. The court sustained the plaintiffs\u2019 administrative appeal because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>of the absence of an evidentiary foundation for the board\u2019s recalculation of the plaintiffs\u2019 pensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">In their appeal from this adverse judgment, the defendants have raised four issues. They argue that the court improperly ignored (1) the factual and legal underpinnings of the decision of the board, (2) the board\u2019s reasonable interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement, (3) the testimony of the city\u2019s pension administrator about the proper interpretation of the agreement and (4) the plaintiffs\u2019 burden of proving, as a matter of fact, that the city\u2019s interpretation of the agreement was incorrect. We are not persuaded. Because each of the issues raises a question of law, our review is plenary. <em>DeLeo </em>v. <em>Nusbaum, </em>263 Conn. 588, 593, 821 A.2d 744 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The underlying facts are undisputed. Each of the plaintiffs is a retired firefighter who is presently collecting a pension in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement between their union and the city for the years 1995 to 1999. Each became entitled to retire on the ground of disability under General Statutes \u00a7 7-433c,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> commonly referred to as the Heart and Hyperten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>sion Act. For a number of years, each of them received disability pension benefits greater than their base pay at the time of retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">On March 2, 2001, the city pension administrator informed them of the reduction of their disability pensions to take account of the base pay cap. On April 17, 2001, the board held a public meeting to consider the validity of the recalculation of the plaintiffs\u2019 disability pensions. On the record of the public meeting, the city presented no factual evidence to the board in favor of the recalculations. There has been no representation that the board received any such evidence in its subsequent executive session. At the conclusion of the executive session, without discussion on the record, the board approved the recalculation of the plaintiffs\u2019 disability benefits to reflect the applicability of the base pay cap.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiffs then filed their administrative appeal in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">The underlying disagreement about the proper calculation of the plaintiffs\u2019 disability pensions is easily identified. It stems from two provisions of the 1995-1999 collective bargaining agreement between the city and its firefighters. One set of provisions describes the calculation of service pensions, while a different provision describes the calculation of disability pensions. For retirees like the plaintiffs, who elected to have then-service benefits calculated according to a so-called \u201cOption One,\u201d service benefits were subject to a base pay cap. When these plaintiffs subsequently became eligible for disability retirement, they became eligible for disability pensions under a different section of the agreement, which did not expressly subject disability benefits to such a base pay cap. The recalculation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>the plaintiffs\u2019 disability pensions reflects a change in the defendants\u2019 interpretation of the agreement. Nothing else had changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">After deciding that the plaintiffs had standing to pursue their appeal,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the court concluded that the collective bargaining agreement was ambiguous about the applicability of the base pay cap to disability pensions. In light of that ambiguity, the court held that the board should not have recalculated the plaintiffs\u2019 retirement pay without evidence of record that, as a matter of fact, the agreement had been intended to impose such a pay cap. Finding none, the court sustained the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">ADMINISTRATIVE FINDINGS OF FACT</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">In their appeal to this court, the defendants challenge the validity of the trial court\u2019s appraisal of the administrative record that, in their view, supported the decision of the board that the collective bargaining agreement had always been intended to subject disability pensions to a base pay cap. The plaintiffs, however, urge us to affirm the court\u2019s judgment that the administrative record did not afford a substantial basis of fact for the board\u2019s reinterpretation of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">It is now common ground that the agreement was ambiguous with respect to the relationship between the provisions in the collective bargaining agreement that describe Option One service pension benefits on the one hand and disability pension benefits on the other. The parties also agree that it was proper for the court to attempt to resolve this ambiguity by searching the administrative record for evidence about the intent of the contracting parties. See <em>Regency Savings Bank </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number><em>Westmark Partners, </em>70 Conn. App. 341, 345, 798 A.2d 476 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">After the court examined the board\u2019s proceedings to determine whether evidence of record before the board supported its recalculation of the plaintiffs\u2019 disability pensions,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the court stated, in its memorandum of decision, that it had found no such evidence. The court therefore sustained the plaintiffs\u2019 administrative appeal. The defendants have appealed to this court from the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The defendants argue that the judgment should be reversed because the court overlooked documentary evidence that was provided to the board by corporation counsel and explained by the city pension and benefits administrator. In addition, they maintain that the board conducted an investigation of its own. The administrative record does not support these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">We have no reason to doubt that the board had access to the information described by the defendants. On the record, however, the board did not base its decision on that information. The fact that the pension and benefits administrator testified about her calculations <em>in the trial court </em>does not provide evidence, on the record, that she had presented such evidence to the board. The record does not document the defendants\u2019 claim that the board independently investigated the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">Indeed, the administrative record, sparse as it is, strongly suggests that the board did not act on the basis of factual findings of any kind. At the public meeting, the board informed those present that the board would hear testimony opposing the disability pension recalcu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>lations. Nevertheless, despite a subpoena from the plaintiffs seeking the testimony of the pension and benefits administrator, the board did not permit her to be questioned about the basis for the recalculations. Counsel for the city simply informed the board that the city had the legal right to recalculate pensions that inadvertently had failed to reflect a contractual cap on disability pension payments. In response, the chairman of the board stated: \u201c[On] behalf of the city, I feel an obligation to follow the advice of my lawyer, and my lawyer is [counsel for the city] represented here . . . .\u201d He told counsel for the plaintiffs to pursue \u201clegal recourses to do what you will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Although the chairman permitted counsel for the plaintiffs to address the board, no member of the board responded in any fashion to counsel\u2019s presentation. Neither the plaintiffs nor the defendants assert that counsel\u2019s statements were evidence of record.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">As the court found, this administrative record does not contain any factual evidence of any kind. The record is, however, entirely consistent with the candid statement of the chairman of the board, that the board, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>acting on behalf of the city, felt itself obligated to accept the legal conclusion of the assistant corporation counsel that the collective bargaining agreement authorizes recalculation of the plaintiffs\u2019 pension benefits. We may infer that the board recognized that it had no special expertise to evaluate the merits of a novel issue of law. The board did not need factual evidence to support the legal conclusion that it had been asked to endorse.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Even if, as the defendants assert, the administrative record were deemed to incorporate information supporting the recalculations supplied to the board by corporation counsel, that evidence would not suffice. The evidence on which the defendants rely did not purport to document the intent of the parties when they agreed upon the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. As the court aptly noted in its memorandum of decision, no one presented <em>any </em>evidence, on or off the record, before the board or to the court, about the intent of those who negotiated the agreement on behalf of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Interpretation of the agreement by the present corporation counsel does not fill this evidentiary gap. As the plaintiffs note, corporation counsel did not assert that he had any knowledge, direct or indirect, about the city\u2019s 1995 negotiation posture with respect to disability pensions. Further, counsel did not explain why his current interpretation of the contract was more rehable, as a matter of fact, than the earlier interpretation of the contract by prior city agents at the time when the plaintiffs\u2019 disability pensions were calculated without a base pay cap. Presumably, the intent of the negotiating parties was more readily ascertainable then than in 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">The defendants also argue that the decision of the board did not need to be supported by factual evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>of record because \u201c[t]he defendant city is a party to the contract, not the individual parties here, and it is clear that its intention was that the pay cap apply.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In effect, they argue that, whether the intent of the contracting parties is viewed as a question of law or of fact, manifestation of the city\u2019s present intent is disposi-tive. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">From the vantage point of a question of law, the record reveals that the city and the plaintiffs take disparate views of the meaning of the collective bargaining agreement. The defendants do not maintain, and have not established, that their revised reading of the agreement is one in which the union concurs. \u201cThe traditional rule requiring that courts consider the intentions of both parties in construing a contract is well settled. . . . This rule allows parties to enter into contractual arrangements with the confidence that they subsequently will not find themselves legally bound to unknown or unanticipated obligations.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Grigerik </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>247 Conn. 293, 311, 721 A.2d 526 (1998). \u201cIn contracts, other than purely unilateral contracts of donation that have never been acted upon by the donee, there are always at least two parties whose intention and understanding must be considered.\u201d 3 A. Corbin, Contracts (1960) \u00a7 538, pp. 56-57. The city\u2019s interpretation does not, therefore, resolve ambiguities in the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Viewed as a question of fact, the defendants\u2019 argument about the relevance of the city\u2019s intention is no more than a variation of their other arguments about the sufficiency of the factual record. Those arguments we have already addressed and rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">In the absence of a factual administrative record supporting the city\u2019s recalculation of the plaintiffs\u2019 pensions, the defendants maintain that the plaintiffs cannot prevail because they failed to satisfy their own burden of proof. According to the defendants, the plaintiffs were required to present affirmative factual evidence of intent different from that expressed by coiporation counsel at the public meeting of the board. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">An administrative appeal properly may challenge an administrative decision that is not supported by evidence of record. See, e.g., <em>JSF Promotions, Inc. </em>v. <em>Administrator, Unemployment Compensation Act, </em>265 Conn. 413, 417, 828 A.2d 609 (2003); <em>Szewczyk </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>77 Conn. App. 38, 50, 822 A.2d 957, cert. granted on other grounds, 265 Conn. 903, 829 A.2d 421 (2003). We know of no cases, and the defendants have cited none, that require an administrative appellant to supply evidence in support of a different administrative result.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">We conclude, therefore, that the trial court properly examined the administrative record of the proceedings before the board to inquire whether that record contained factual evidence of the intent of the parties who negotiated the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. Furthermore, we concur in the court\u2019s determination that the administrative record contained no such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b270-10\">INTERPRETATION OF THE CONTRACT AS A MATTER OF LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">In the absence of evidence establishing the intent of the drafters of the collective bargaining agreement as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>a matter of fact, we turn to interpretation of the agreement as a matter of law. The defendants urge us to acquiesce in the decision of the board for two reasons. They maintain that we owe deference to the board\u2019s interpretation of the agreement and that, even read independently, the agreement imposes pay caps on disability pensions.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The defendants argue that the board\u2019s interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement, viewed as a conclusion of law, was entitled to deference by the trial court and this court. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Our law does not command universal judicial deference to administrative conclusions of law. In <em>MacDermid, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Environmental </em>Protection, 257 Conn. 128, 778 A.2d 7 (2001), a case on which the defendants rely, our Supreme Court recently reviewed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>applicable ground rules. \u201cEven as to questions of law, [t]he court\u2019s ultimate duty is only to decide whether, in light of the evidence, the [agency] has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally, or in abuse of its discretion. . . . Conclusions of law reached by the administrative agency must stand if the court determines that they resulted from a correct application of the law to the facts found and could reasonably and logically follow from such facts. . . . Ordinarily, this court affords deference to the construction of a statute applied by the administrative agency empowered by law to carry out the statute\u2019s purposes. . . . <em>Cases that present pure questions of law, however, invoke a broader standard of review than is ordinarily involved in deciding whether, inlight of the evidence, the agency has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion. . . . Furthermore, when . . . [an] agency\u2019s determination of a question of law has not previously been subject to judicial scrutiny . . . the agency is not entitled to special deference.\u201d </em>(Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 137. Like the defendants, we think it irrelevant, for present purposes, that the court was addressing an interpretation of a statute rather than a contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Applying <em>MacDermid, Inc., </em>to this case, we are persuaded that the court was not required to defer to the board\u2019s interpretation of the pensions provisions of the collective bargaining agreement. As far as the record shows, the board was deciding \u201ca pure question of law\u201d on an issue that had \u201cnot previously been subject to judicial scrutiny.\u201d Our analysis of the agreement is similarly de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">\u201cIn determining whether a contract is ambiguous, the words of the contract must be given their natural and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>ordinary meaning. ... [A] contract is ambiguous if the intent of the parties is not clear and certain from the language of the contract itself. . . . The contract must be viewed in its entirety, with each provision read in light of the other provisions . . . and every provision must be given effect if it is possible to do so. . . . If the language of the contract is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation, the contract is ambiguous.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>Wisvest-Connecticut, LLC, </em>259 Conn. 665, 670-71, 791 A.2d 546 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Our point of departure is the conceded ambiguity in the terms of the collective bargaining agreement with respect to the relationship between two kinds of pensions to which a firefighter might be entitled. Article XXXIII of the agreement does not state, with clarity and certainty, whether disability pensions, like service pensions, are subject to a base pay cap.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Under these circumstances, we review the agreement in accordance with the customary rules of contract interpretation. \u201cWe do so mindful of the fact that, in the present case, we have a contract formed between two parties of relatively equal bargaining power. Under . . . well established principles, [a] contract must be construed to effectuate the intent of the parties, which is determined from the language used inteipreted in the light of the situation of the parties and the circumstances connected with the transaction. . . . [T]he intent of the parties is to be ascertained by a fair and reasonable construction of the written words and . . . the language used must be accorded its common, natural, and ordinary meaning and usage where it can be sensibly applied to the subject matter of the contract.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Poole </em>v. Waterbury, 266 Conn. 68, 87-88, 831 A.2d 211 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">As with any issue of contract interpretation, we look first to the language of article XXXIII of the collective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>bargaining agreement. The relevant provisions are to be found in \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 9, on the one hand, and in \u00a7 11 on the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">Under \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 9, service pension benefits<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> could be calculated according to one of two options. For retired firefighters like the plaintiffs in this case, who elected Option One, \u00a7 8 prescribed that \u201cthe maximum amount of a service pension shall be ... an amount not to exceed said BASE PAY per the formulation set forth ... in Section 9 hereof.\u201d In \u00a7 9, \u00b6 375e, the term \u201cbase pay\u201d is defined as salary, longevity pay, holiday pay and regular drivers pay at the time of retirement. The pensions administrator testified that, in practice, the base pay cap was 100 percent of base pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">With respect to disability pensions under \u00a7 11 (also denominated \u00b6 378), the agreement unambiguously provides for disability benefits<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> measured by a percentage of base pay, unrelated to years of service, with a \u201cmaximum ... of seventy-six percent (76%) of BASE PAY.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Nowhere in \u00a7 11 does the agreement allude to a pay cap of any kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The ambiguity presented by the agreement is the textual linkage between \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 11 in that part of \u00a7 11 that defines base pay by reference to \u201cthe provisions of Section 9 hereof . . . .\u201d The defendants maintain that this cross-reference was intended to incorporate all of \u00a7 9, including the base pay cap that \u00a7 9 unambigu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>ously imposed on service pensions. The plaintiffs maintain, to the contrary, that the absence of an express cross-reference to a base pay cap was intended to indicate that disability pensions would not be subject to such a cap. We agree with the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">In our view, the text of article XXXIII, read as a whole, supports the award of disability benefits without a pay cap. Most important, we agree with the plaintiffs that we should attach significance to the absence of an express reference to a pay cap in \u00a7 11. The specificity with which article XXXIII spells out pension benefits cautions against judicial interpolation of language that the agreement does not contain. The agreement demonstrates that the drafters had no difficulty in spelling out pension caps when they wanted to impose them. It is not likely that they intended to impose pension caps by implication. Additionally, under \u00b6\u00b6 375a and 375b, the formula for calculation of Option One service pension benefits and the formula for calculation of the pension pay cap both took into account a firefighters\u2019 years of service. Years of service are not as directly relevant to a calculation of a disability pension benefit under \u00a7 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">We are persuaded, furthermore, that our interpretation of the text of article XXXIII is consistent with the dictates of public policy. At first blush, it seems anomalous to suppose that the agreement would have contemplated the possibility that disability benefits, because uncapped, might sometimes exceed 100 percent of base pay, which is the measure of the pay cap. Upon further analysis, however, this discrepancy may simply reflect the fact that future job opportunities for retired firefighters may be considerably more constricted for those who retire on the ground of disability than for those who retire in good health. Taking account of the long-term consequences of disability is good public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>We conclude, therefore, that the trial court properly sustained the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. Once the court determined that the collective bargaining agreement was ambiguous with respect to the calculation of disability pension benefits, the court properly examined the administrative record to determine whether it contained substantial factual evidence to resolve this ambiguity. As the plaintiff firefighters contended, the record did not contain such evidence. Furthermore, principles of contract interpretation support the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that, as a matter of law, the agreement entitled them to disability pension benefits without a pension pay cap.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b262-7\"> The defendants at trial were the city of Waterbury, Palma Brustat (city pension and benefits administrator), Richard Russo (city director of finance), the city of Waterbury retirement board and its commissioners, and former Mayor Philip Giordano.

In their motion asking the court to permit the presentation of evidence supplemental to that presented to the retirement board, they stated: \u201cThe additional evidence will materially aid the court in its administrative review, promote justice and insure that the court has all relevant information before it that the [board] had when it made its determination rejecting Plaintiffs\u2019 claimed interpretation of the applicability of the pay cap provision. The underlying claim by the plaintiffs in this matter is more akin to a breach of contract than to a typical administrative review of a board\u2019s decision granting or denying benefits.\u201d Indeed, in their oral argument at trial, they urged the court to interpret the agreement in a manner consistent with application of the pay cap to disability pensions. They were right the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">If a court concludes that an administrative ruling of law is mistaken, the court has the responsibility to address the merits of the legal issue with which it is confronted. See, e.g., <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Texas-Ohio </em>Power, Inc., 243 Conn. 635, 644, 708 A.2d 202 (1998). Were it otherwise, the issue would have to be relitigated in some other forum. The dictates of judicial economy counsel against following such a course.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b274-7\"> Although the defendants resist this characterization of \u00a7 9 benefits, \u00a7 9 is introduced, in \u00b6 373, as follows: \u201cAn employee with twenty (20) or more years of service is entitled to retire and receive a <em>service pension </em>regardless of his age.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b274-9\"> Section 11 disability pension payments are subject to offsets for statutory pensions that a firefighter might receive under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, General Statutes \u00a7 31-275 et seq., or the Heart and Hypertension Act. Offsets are not an issue in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b274-10\"> The plaintiffs\u2019 entitlement to the maximum awards of 76 percent of their base pay is not an issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
