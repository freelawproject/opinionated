Bolgard and Fleet Bank, N.A. On appeal, the plaintiff appears to claim that the court failed to consider evidence that would demonstrate that the defendants had engaged in a continuing conceal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>ment of facts, which barred the running of the statutes of limitation on her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Although we attempt to construe the rules of practice liberally in dealing with pro se litigants; see <em>Rosato </em>v. <em>Rosato, </em>53 Conn. App. 387, 390, 731 A.2d 323 (1999); we simply cannot consider a claim when the plaintiff has provided the court with what amounts to a one page brief that is devoid of any legal authority for or analysis of her claim. We decline to review claims when \u201c[n]othing more than [a] bare statement, without citation to legal authority, appears in [the appellant\u2019s] brief. Assignments of error which are merely mentioned but not briefed beyond a statement of the claim will be deemed abandoned and will not be reviewed by this court.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>61 Conn. App. 106, 108, 762 A.2d 523 (2000). \u201c[F]or this court judiciously and efficiently to consider claims of error raised on appeal . . . the parties must clearly and fully set forth their arguments in their briefs. We do not reverse the judgment of a trial court on the basis of challenges to its rulings that have not been adequately briefed. . . . [Assignments of error which are merely mentioned but not briefed beyond a statement of the claim will be deemed abandoned and will not be reviewed by this court. . . . Where the parties cite no law and provide no analysis of their claims, we do not review such claims.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Baris </em>v. <em>Southbend, Inc., </em>68 Conn. App. 546, 550-51, 791 A.2d 713 (2002). Accordingly, we decline to review the plaintiffs claim and deem it abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
