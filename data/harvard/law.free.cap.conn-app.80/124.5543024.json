Section 38a-788-6 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies, which determines the fee that insurance adjusters may charge, permits them to recover a fixed percentage \u201cof the amount of the loss when adjusted with the Insurance Companies or otherwise recovered . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The issue in this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>is whether the amount \u201cotherwise recovered\u201d is the <em>gross </em>amount of the insured\u2019s recovery or the <em>net </em>amount after an insured has paid attorney\u2019s fees and mortgage debts. The trial court concluded that the adjuster was entitled to recover a percentage of the gross amount. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The plaintiffs, public insurance adjusters Executive Services, Inc., and Louis E. Ranciato, filed a multicount complaint alleging breach of contract by the defendants, Jadwiga H. Karwowski and Mieczyslaw Karwowski, arising out of the defendants\u2019 failure to pay the fees specified in a contract for fire adjustment services. The defendants denied their liability and filed special defenses as well as a claim for setoff. After a stipulation of facts, the trial court rendered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, from which the defendants have appealed. Because the only issue before us is a question of the proper interpretation of a state regulation, an issue of law, our review of the defendants\u2019 appellate claim is plenary. See <em>Rudy\u2019s Limousine Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Transportation, </em>78 Conn. App. 80, 84, 826 A.2d 1161 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The court\u2019s memorandum of decision and the stipulation of the parties state the relevant facts. The defendant Jadwiga Karwowski contracted with the plaintiffs after three fires on September 26, October 5 and October 24, 1994, that destroyed her property at 73-75 Broad Street in New Britain. The property was insured by the Travelers Insurance Company (Travelers), which refused to pay the face amount of the policy because of its suspicion that the defendant Mieczyslaw Karwowski might have committed arson.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">The plaintiffs\u2019 claim arose out of litigation between the parties that resulted in Travelers paying a stipulated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>judgment of $1,054,138 for the fire loss.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Part of that judgment reflected Travelers\u2019 initial payment of $50,000 to the plaintiffs, as well as payment of $104,138.17 to mortgagees and recovery of $20,290.23 at a tax foreclosure sale of the property. Accordingly, Travelers paid the defendant Jadwiga Karwowski the net amount of $900,000, of which $300,000 was paid to her attorney as a fee for his services.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">In her written contact with the plaintiffs, the defendant Jadwiga Karwowski agreed to pay the plaintiffs a fee of 5 percent of the amount of her recovery from her fire loss. She tendered the plaintiffs a check for $32,500, calculated as 5 percent of the $600,000 she had retained after paying her attorney and 5 percent of the $50,000 advance she had received when she first presented her claim to Travelers.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">The plaintiffs assisted the defendants in recovering an initial adjustment of $50,000 and subsequently assisted in the litigation that resulted in their receiving a favorable stipulated judgment. During the jury trial, the plaintiffs Louis Ranciato and John Ranciato testified as expert witnesses in support of the successful claim of the defendant Jadwiga Karwowski against Travelers. The plaintiffs provided the proof of loss figures that were the basis of her claim. The plaintiff Louis Ranciato also assisted in the resolution of criminal proceedings charging the defendant Mieczyslaw Karwowski with having committed arson. Although the value of these services has not been quantified, the record demonstrates that the plaintiffs contributed significantly to the defendants\u2019 recovery from Travelers.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">The legal issue that confronts us is more easily stated than resolved. The insurance commissioner requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>insurance adjusters to use a contract that states: \u201cIn consideration for these services, Ewe hereby assign out of the monies due or to become due from said Insurance Companies on account of the said loss a sum equivalent to __% percent of the amount of the loss when adjusted with the Insurance Companies or otherwise recovered . . . .\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 38a-788-6. All we have before us is the text of the regulation designating this contract language. Did the insurance commissioner intend \u201cotherwise recovered\u201d to mean the gross recovery received after litigation, in contrast with the amount \u201cwhen adjusted,\u201d or did he intend to limit recovery after litigation to the net amount received by the insured after deduction of costs and fees? The only thing that is clear is that the text is ambiguous. There are no appellate decisions construing the text, and the trial courts that have considered the matter have disagreed about its meaning.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The defendants\u2019 argument for deduction of costs and fees from sums \u201cotherwise recovered\u201d proceeds from the unchallenged premise that legislation should be construed to produce a rational and sensible result. See, e.g., <em>Turner </em>v. Turner, 219 Conn. 703, 713, 595 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>297 (1991). They maintain that the text should be read to protect those confronted by fire losses from overreaching by knowledgeable insurance adjusters. This case, however, does not present any evidence of unconscionable conduct on the part of the plaintiffs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On the contrary, their vigorous efforts on behalf of both defendants manifestly protected the defendants\u2019 interests in a proper recovery. It is reasonable to read the regulation as having been intended to encourage just such efforts on behalf of insurance claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The defendants also argue that it would be unfair to awar d the plaintiffs a percentage of an insurance award that did not reflect the cost of the counsel fees incurred by the defendants. The defendants observe that the plaintiffs have not challenged the reasonableness of the payment of $300,000 to the defendants\u2019 attorney. The defendants further argue that, although the plaintiffs\u2019 services contributed to the defendants\u2019 recovery, payment of 5 percent of $600,000, the net recovery from the litigation, is sufficient compensation for their contributions. That argument assumes the propriety of deducting mortgage payments from the amount that is \u201cotherwise recovered.\u201d We cannot, however, conceive of the basis for that assumption. The money that Travelers paid to discharge the defendant Jadwiga Kar-wowski\u2019s mortgage debt was a benefit to her that she retained only because of the stipulated judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">In our view, the text of the regulation is more plausibly interpreted to support the plaintiffs\u2019 analysis of the meaning of \u201cotherwise recovered.\u201d The plaintiffs properly advise us to read this phrase in light of the entirety of the sentence in which it appears. The sentence begins: \u201cTo the Interested Insurance Companies and Others Whom it May Concern: I/we retain . . . (name <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>of public adjuster) to act as my/our public adjusters) and to advise and assist in the adjustment and settlement of my/our . . . loss at . . . (address) which occurred on or about . . . (date). In consideration for these services, I/we hereby assign out of the monies due or to become due from said Insurance Companies on account of the said loss a sum equivalent to_% percent of the amount of the loss when adjusted with the Insurance Companies or otherwise recovered . . . .\u201d Regs., Conn. State Agencies, \u00a7 38a-788-6. The phrase \u201cotherwise recovered\u201d appears, therefore, not in a description of the contract obligations of the plaintiffs and the defendants but in instructions to Travelers. As the plaintiffs further observe, the assignment directs Travelers whom to pay and when, i.e., \u201cwhen adjusted with the Insurance Companies or otherwise recovered . . . .\u201d In this context, the phrase \u201cotherwise recovered\u201d does not address the question of whether the recovery should be net or gross of the insured\u2019s litigation costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of \u00a7 38a-788-6 finds additional support in another part of the regulation. The parties apparently have deemed it irrelevant that the regulation expressly defines the fees that an insurance adjuster may charge. The regulation requires a contract between an adjuster and an insured to state: \u201cWe cannot charge you a fee greater than ten percent (10%) <em>of the actual or final settlement </em>of the loss covered by this contract nor can we rebate any part of the fee specified in this Employment Contract. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The phrase \u201cactual or final settlement\u201d indicates that the amount \u201cotherwise recovered\u201d is the gross amount that an insurer must pay for an insured loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>In the absence of guidance from the insurance commissioner, we conclude that the court properly interpreted the contract between the parties. As mandated by \u00a7 38a-788-6, an insurance adjuster may recover a fee of no more than 10 percent of the total amount that an insurer is obligated to pay under a policy of fire insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-8\"> Section 38a-788-6 of the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies provides in relevant part: \u201cForm of contract [Formerly Sec. 38-769-6.] No public adjuster shall enter into an employment contract except in conformity with this regulation. There shall be a true copy of the employment contract which shall be given to the client at the time the contract is signed. The contract and copy(ies) of the contract . . . shall state: (1) On side one: INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR PUBLIC ADJUSTER EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS: <em>Cancellation: </em>You may cancel this contract by notifying us at the address shown on the other side of this page .... <em>Settlement offer: </em>We shall forward to you any written settlement offer from the insurance company. <em>Fee: </em>Our services are available for a fee to be paid by you. We cannot charge you a fee greater than ten percent (10%) of the actual or final settlement of the loss covered by this contract nor can we rebate any part of the fee specified in this Employment Contract. <em>Copy of the contract: </em>We must give you a true copy of this Employment Contract at the time you sign it. . . . We must . . . inform you that we do not represent any insurance company or any insurance company adjusting firm. (2) On side two: ... To the Interested Insurance Companies and Others Whom it May Concern: I/we retain _ (name of public adjuster) to act as my/our public adjusters) and to advise and assist in the adjustment and settlement of my/our_(type) loss at _ (address) which occurred on or about _(date). In consideration for these services, I/we hereby assign out of the monies due or to become due from said Insurance Companies on account of the said loss a sum equivalent to_% percent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>amount of the loss when adjusted with the Insurance Companies or otherwise recovered . . . .\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The text of the contract was exactly the same as that specified in the regulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b155-8\"> In the underlying litigation, Jadwiga Karwowski recovered $1,142,172.48 from Travelers, and Travelers recovered $133,847.94 from Mieczyslaw Karwowski. As part of the stipulated judgment, Travelers issued a general release to Mieczyslaw Karwowski.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b156-8\"> In two cases, the court, <em>Hon. Anthony V. DeMayo, </em>judge trial referee, concluded that General Statutes \u00a7 38a-788-6 was enacted for the benefit of insureds and that \u201cotherwise recovered\u201d should therefore be construed so as to limit the fees of insurance adjusters. <em>Biller Associates </em>v. <em>Route 156 Realty Co., </em>Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven, Docket No. 348897 (October 22, 1996) (18 Conn. L. Rptr. 132, 134), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 52 Conn. App. 18, 725 A.2d 398 (1999), aff'd, 252 Conn. 400, 746 A.2d 785 (2000); <em>Biller Associates </em>v. <em>Peterken, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of New Haven, Docket No. 354173 (October 10, 1997), aff'd, 58 Conn. App. 8, 751 A.2d 836, cert. granted on other grounds, 254 Conn. 914, 759 A.2d 506 (2000). In another case, the court, <em>Hon. Howard J. Moraghan, </em>judge trial referee, construed the regulation to permit an adjuster to recover a percentage of the insured\u2019s recovery measured by a proof of loss even though the adjuster had been discharged. <em>Malis, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins.
