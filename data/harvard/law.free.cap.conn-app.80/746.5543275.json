On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction, (2) the trial court improperly omitted necessary instructions from its charge to the jury, thereby depriving him of his due process rights, and (3) the court failed to act, sua sponte, to strike certain testimony and to deliver a limiting instruction to the jury with regard to certain evidence. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">The facts underlying the conviction, as the jury reasonably could have found them, are as follows. The defendant was a registered home improvement contractor prior to August 26, 1998. On August 26, 1998, the department of consumer protection (department) suspended the defendant\u2019s registration. In 1998, Christine Bums contacted the defendant to discuss his remodeling the kitchen and the bathroom in her single-family home. Bums did not hire the defendant to undertake the job until February, 2001. In the period leading to his being hired for the job, the defendant spoke with Bums and, less frequently, with her husband, Eric Bums, about the project and its cost. During those conversations, the defendant falsely represented himself as or impersonated a registered home improvement contractor and offered to make home improvements to the Bums\u2019 home without having a current certificate of registration enabling him lawfully to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">Upon signing a written agreement with the defendant on February 8,2001, Christine Bums paid the defendant an initial deposit of $8500. On or about March 26, 2001, the defendant, along with two other individuals, performed demolition work in the Bums\u2019 kitchen. The defendant and others thereafter performed more work at the home. By April 1, 2001, Christine Bums had paid the defendant in excess of $14,000. The defendant worked intermittently on the project during April and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>May, 2001, and Christine Bums repeatedly expressed to the defendant her displeasure with the pace of his performance. During May, 2001, the defendant stopped working on the project altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Christine Bums spoke with the defendant via telephone. The defendant informed her that he needed more money and that she had lost her \u201ctime slot\u201d in which he could complete her project. The defendant installed the cabinets in the kitchen, but left other aspects of the project, such as the installation of flooring and lighting in the kitchen, unfinished. The defendant also failed to perform any renovation in the bathroom that he had agreed to perform. Christine Bums obtained estimates from other contractors regarding the cost of completing the renovation. Those estimates ranged from between $13,000 and $15,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">Frustrated by her failed attempts to get the defendant to return to her home to complete the remodeling project, Christine Bums filed a complaint with the department, and a department investigator looked into her complaint. The defendant\u2019s arrest followed. After the jury returned its guilty verdict, the court sentenced the defendant to a total effective term of one year imprisonment, suspended after 180 days, with three years of probation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">The defendant first claims that the evidence did not support his conviction of either charge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>\u201cIn reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim, we apply a two-part test. First, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. Second, we determine whether upon the facts so construed and the inferences reasonably drawn therefrom the [jury] reasonably could have concluded that the cumulative force of the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. ... In evaluating evidence, the trier of fact is not required to accept as dispositive those inferences that are consistent with the defendant\u2019s innocence. . . . The trier may draw whatever inferences from the evidence or facts established by the evidence it deems to be reasonable and logical. ... In conducting this review, the probative force of the evidence is not diminished where the evidence, in whole or in part, is circumstantial rather than direct.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Holmes, </em>75 Conn. App. 721, 739-40, 817 A.2d 689, cert. denied, 264 Conn. 903, 823 A.2d 1222 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">We shall first set forth some of the evidence that is relevant to the defendant\u2019s conviction of the charges. We will then define the elements that are integral to each of the crimes of which the defendant stands convicted and determine if the jury reasonably could have found that the state met its burden of proving each element beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">The Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">Christine Bums testified that she contacted the defendant in 1998 after she saw signs with his advertisement on them in her neighborhood. She told the defendant that she wanted to \u201credo\u201d the kitchen and the bathroom in her single-family home. She testified that after she called the defendant and inquired about the remodeling work that she wanted him to perform, she and the defendant kept in contact. Specifically, she testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>that in 2000 or in early 2001, the defendant visited her at her home to discuss the remodeling that she wanted him to do. She testified that the defendant showed her \u201ca book of all the work that he had [done and] of all the work that he could do, a display of what he did showing the work that he was doing.\u201d She testified that there was an envelope in the back of this book in which \u201cwas a registration of some kind.\u201d She further testified as to the conversation that she had with the defendant after she viewed that document: \u201cI said, \u2018Are you legitimate? Are you sure?\u2019 [The defendant] says, \u2018Are you crazy? Do you think I want to go to jail?\u2019 He goes, \u2018Sure.\u2019 He goes, \u2018If you don\u2019t believe me, I\u2019ll give you some references.\u2019 \u201d She testified that the defendant \u201creassured\u201d her and invited her to go to a home show to see examples of his handiwork on display.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">The following exchange occurred between the prosecutor and Christine Bums:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-7\">\u201cQ. Okay. Let me take a step back. So, when you referenced the card you were discussing in his book\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-8\">\u201cA. In his book. In his display book.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-9\">\u201cQ. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-10\">\u201cA. He had this one card with his license or registration in the book, in the back of the book.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-11\">\u201cQ. Okay. So, did he direct you to that registration indicating that he was a registered home improvement contractor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-12\">\u201cA. Yes, because I asked him, \u2018Are you legitimate?\u2019 because I needed to know because you just can\u2019t take anybody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-13\">\u201cQ. Right. And do you recall the registration number on the card that was in the back of the book that he showed you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>\u201cA. I don\u2019t remember, but he told me to call. He even said that I could check. He\u2019d give me names of references and people that he did work for.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Christine Bums also testified that on February 8, 2001, she and the defendant entered into a written contract entitled a \u201cretail sales contract.\u201d The contract, marked as a full exhibit at trial, listed various materials as well as detailed specifications for many of those materials, which Christine Bums agreed to purchase from the defendant. Those materials included custom cabinets, tile, skylights, flooring materials, a vanity, a toilet, a bathtub, shower walls, faucets and plumbing supplies, vinyl floorings, Sheetrock, a kitchen sink and various lighting fixtures. The contract contained the notation \u201cno installation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">Christine Bums testified about the circumstances under which the defendant drafted the contract: \u201c[W]hat [the defendant] did was, as he was writing, he said to me, \u2018I\u2019m going to \u2014 this is the things that we\u2019re going to do. Now, let\u2019s write it together. I\u2019m going to write down the things that I\u2019m going to do in your home. \u2019 So, we sat there together, and he said he was going to do it. This thing on [the contract] where it says no installation, if that was there, he did not present that to me. He must have did that after upon my signing because this \u2014 how could he say no installation when he sat here with me and we went over the things that he was going to do because I had to tell him what I wanted done. Who was going to do it?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">The prosecutor asked Christine Bums if the defendant had discussed with her the need to \u201carrange for installation\u201d of the items listed on the contract. She replied: \u201cNo, [the defendant] didn\u2019t say that. He said that these are the things that he was going to do himself.\u201d Christine Bums also testified that she observed the defendant, along with other individuals that she had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>neither hired nor paid directly, perform installation work at her home. Specifically, she recalled observing the defendant installing ceiling lights and cabinets in her kitchen.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Eric Bums testified that he, too, conversed with the defendant before his wife had hired the defendant. Eric Burns unambiguously testified that the defendant represented that he himself was going to do all of the installation at the Bums\u2019 home. Eric Bums also testified that he observed the defendant perform initial demolition work, complete \u201cthe majority of the installation on the cabinets\u201d and perform the wiring work for some of the light fixtures. Eric Bums further recalled that he observed other individuals, whom he had neither hired nor paid directly, work with the defendant on the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">Finally, the defendant testified that in August, 1998, the department suspended his registration as a home improvement contractor. He also testified that when he first met Christine Bums in 1998, when he was still a registered home improvement contractor, he gave her his business card, which was inscribed with his home improvement registration number.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant further recalled subsequently showing Christine Bums his \u201cdisplay book\u201d at some point in time, and testified that this book contained photographs and information concerning his \u201ccustom work.\u201d The defendant testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>Christine Bums did not ask him if he was a registered home improvement contractor and that he did not \u201crecall for a fact\u201d if he removed his home improvement contractor registration certificate from his display book immediately after the department suspended his registration in August, 1998. The defendant testified that \u201cmaybe\u201d he carried his home improvement registration certificate in that book in 1998, but testified that as of the time of trial, he no longer displayed that document in his display book.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">Violation of \u00a7 20-427 (b) (3)</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">To obtain a conviction under \u00a7 20-427 (b) (3),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the state bore the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the following elements: (1) that the defendant represented himself as or impersonated a registered home improvement<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> contra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>ctor<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and (2) that such representation or impersonation was false.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">The defendant claims that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction because there was no evidence that he falsely \u201crepresented or stated to [Christine Bums] that he was a registered home improvement contractor.\u201d The defendant cites the written contract, which contains the notation \u201cno installation,\u201d as evidence that he did not represent himself as a home improvement contractor, but merely a salesman of the materials listed on the contract. The defendant testified at trial that he neither offered to perform nor performed any installation work at the Bums\u2019 home.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">The jury heard the Burnses testify concerning their conversations with the defendant and that the substance of those conversations pertained to his offer to supply <em>and </em>to install the materials they wanted to purchase for their home remodeling projects. In the context of those representations by the defendant, the jury also heard Christine Bums recount a conversation that she had with him just before she agreed to hire him. According to Christine Bums, the defendant showed her his \u201cdisplay book,\u201d which, the jury reasonably could have found, contained his suspended home improvement contractor registration document. Christine Bums testified that she examined the book and specifically asked the defendant if he was \u201clegitimate.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>To that inquiry, the defendant responded that he was legitimate and directed her to look into the matter or to check his \u201creferences.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">The jury is entitled to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence before it and, in performing its function, the jury brings to bear its common sense and experience of the affairs of life. <em>State </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>70 Conn. App. 255, 283, 797 A.2d 616, cert. denied, 261 Conn. 919, 806 A.2d 1056 (2002). Given the context of the conversation and the defendant\u2019s actions in presenting Christine Bums with a book that contained a registration document that no longer was current, and in affirmatively representing his \u201clegitimacy\u201d in terms of the work that he offered to perform for her, we conclude that the jury reasonably could have found that the defendant falsely represented or impersonated a registered home improvement contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">Furthermore, the jury reasonably could have found that the evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s work on the project after he signed the contract with Christine Bruns supported its finding that he falsely had represented himself as or impersonated a registered home improvement contractor. Several witnesses testified that they observed the defendant performing installation work at the home and not merely delivering materials to the job site.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">The defendant argues that there was no evidence that he \u201crepresented or stated . . . that he was a registered home improvement contractor.\u201d The defendant also posits that \u201c[i]f Mrs. Bums viewed the defendant\u2019s registration, anytime after August, 1998, she would have seen that the registration had expired, as this information is clearly identified on a registration certificate or she would have learned that it was suspended, if she checked with the state.\u201d Those arguments are not persuasive. First, \u00a7 20-427 (b) (3) does not require the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>to prove that the defendant actually stated that he was a registered home improvement contractor. The evidence was sufficient to support the conviction because the jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant falsely represented that he was registered or that he impersonated a registered home improvement contractor. Second, the defendant\u2019s claim that Christine Bums could have learned that the registration document that he presented to her was not valid is irrelevant to our analysis. Such an occurrence would have no bearing on the criminal act that the defendant already had committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">Violation of \u00a7 20-427 (b) (5)</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">To obtain a conviction under \u00a7 20-427 (b) (5),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the state bore the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the following elements: (1) that the defendant offered to make any home improvement and (2) that, at such time, the defendant did not have a current certificate of registration. The evidence before the jury and the reasonable inferences that the jury could have drawn from such evidence leads us to conclude that the state proved those elements beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">The defendant argues that the state failed to prove that he offered to perform any home improvements. In support of his claim, the defendant correctly points out that the written agreement between the parties, which was entitled \u201cRETAIL SALES CONTRACT,\u201d described the materials that the defendant agreed to deliver, specified a \u201cdelivery\u201d date and contained the notation \u201cno <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>installation.\u201d The defendant implicitly argues that this written contract, which contained no mention of labor, costs of labor or the date on which installation would begin or be completed, precluded the jury from finding that he had offered to perform any home improvement work. The defendant testified that he was a mere supplier of materials and that he neither offered to install such materials nor installed such materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">On the basis of the cumulative effect of the evidence, the jury reasonably could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had offered to make home improvements. The jury could have inferred, from the evidence of the conversations between the defendant and Christine Bums prior to the time at which she hired him, that the defendant, by expressing his readiness and willingness to perform the installation work if she agreed to hire him, offered to perform the installation work that she required.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">The defendant\u2019s heavy reliance on his written sales contract with Christine Bums is misplaced. The defendant makes much of the notation \u201cno installation\u201d on the contract. This action did not sound in breach of contract. In this criminal prosecution, the contract merely was some evidence relied on by the defendant in support of his assertions that he had not offered to make home improvements. The jury was bound to review the contract in light of all of the other evidence and testimony. Consequently, the jury reasonably could have rejected the defendant\u2019s testimony and the notation on the contract. It also reasonably could have found, as Christine Bums testified, that the notation \u201cno installation\u201d on the contract appeared after she signed the contract. In the alternative, the jury reasonably could have found, as questioning dining the defendant\u2019s cross-examination suggested, that such a notation was purely disingenuous. The issue of what the defendant offered to do was, essentially, a credibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>contest between the Bums and the defendant. \u201cIt is the [jury\u2019s] exclusive province to weigh the conflicting evidence and to determine the credibility of witnesses.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Vassell, </em>79 Conn. App. 843, 846, 832 A.2d 99 (2003). Here, the jury clearly discredited the defendant\u2019s evidence concerning what he had offered to do at the Bums\u2019 home. On the basis of the evidence presented and the reasonable inferences that the jury could have drawn from such evidence, the jmy reasonably could have found that the state proved the necessary elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly omitted necessary instructions from its charge, thereby depriving him of his due process rights. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>The record reflects that the court did not define \u201chome improvement contract,\u201d as provided in General Statutes \u00a7 20-419 (5), in its instructions with regard to either count. Further, the court inadvertently omitted a word from the statutory definition of \u201ccontractor\u201d in its instructions with regard to each count. The defendant claims that those omissions \u201cundermined [his] defense that the agreement was not subject to the Home Improvement Act [General Statutes \u00a7 20-418 et seq.]\u201d and that the court did not provide the jury \u201cwith the legal authority and context for finding [him] <em>not </em>guilty as charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">The record reflects, and the defendant acknowledges, that he did not object at trial to those claimed errors in the court\u2019s charge. Further, the record reflects that the defendant did not submit a written request that the court define either \u201chome improvement contract\u201d or \u201ccontractor\u201d in its charge. Those failures render the defendant\u2019s claims of instructional error unpreserved. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>79 Conn. App. 667, 672-73, 830 A.2d 802, cert. denied, 266 Conn. 933, 837 A.2d 806 (2003). Nevertheless, the defendant argues that those claimed instructional errors violated his due process rights, that they are reviewable under <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 70, 327 A.2d 576 (1973), and that they \u201camounted to \u2018plain error.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">We will treat the defendant\u2019s claim for review under <em>Evans </em>as a request for review under the standard set forth in <em>Evans </em>and reformulated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). We will review the claim under <em>Golding </em>because the record is adequate for review and the claim is of constitutional magnitude. See <em>State </em>v. <em>L\u2019Minggio, </em>71 Conn. App. 656, 671, 803 A.2d 408 (improper jury instruction as to essential element of crime charged may violate due process right to fair trial), cert. denied, 262 Conn. 902, 810 A.2d 270 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>In reviewing an unpreserved claim of instructional error, we consider whether the substance of the charge as a whole misled the jury. The challenged instruction \u201cis constitutionally adequate if it provides the jurors with a clear understanding of the elements of the crime charged, and affords them proper guidance for their determination of whether those elements were present.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Ingram, 73 Conn. App. 246, 251, 807 A.2d 1023 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">We first consider whether the court\u2019s omission of the word \u201cimprovement\u201d in its definition of \u201ccontractor\u201d possibly misled the jury. We have reviewed the court\u2019s instruction with regal\u2019d to the charge of offering to make home improvements without being a registered home improvement contractor in violation of \u00a7 20-427 (b) (5). As part of that instruction, the court read from \u00a7 20-427 (b) (5) and then defined the elements of the offense. In so doing, the court defined \u201chome improvement\u201d by reading the relevant statutory language of \u00a7 20-419 (4). Immediately thereafter, the court defined the term \u201ccontractor.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We also have reviewed the court\u2019s instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>with regard to the charge of representing oneself falsely as or impersonating a registered home improvement contractor in violation of \u00a7 20-427 (b) (3). The court read the relevant statutory language and set forth the elements of the offense. As part of its instruction, the court stated: \u201cAgain, the law defines home improvement as I have already defined it for you. And also the law defines contractor; again, I have defined it previously</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">In defining \u201ccontractor,\u201d the court used the term \u201chome contracts;\u201d see footnote 10; rather than correctly stating \u201chome improvement contracts.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 20-419 (3) provides in relevant part: \u201c \u2018Contractor\u2019 does not include a person for whom the total cash price of all of his home <em>improvement </em>contracts with all of his customers does not exceed one thousand dollars during any period of twelve consecutive months.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">Having reviewed the court\u2019s instructions as to each count in their entirety, rather than in artificial isolation, we conclude that the court\u2019s misstatement was harmless. The issues before the jury concerned whether the defendant was a registered <em>home improvement </em>contractor, whether he had offered to make <em>home improvements </em>and whether he falsely had represented himself as or impersonated a registered <em>home improvement </em>contractor. The only type of contract in evidence and at issue during the trial was the defendant\u2019s contract for <em>home improvement </em>with Christine Bums. \u201cIn reviewing a claim of error in a jury charge, [w]e must examine the issue or issues before the jury . . . and examine the charge in view of the factual posture of the case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number><em>Alston, </em>5 Conn. App. 571, 578, 501 A.2d 764 (1985), cert. denied, 198 Conn. 804, 503 A.2d 1186 (1986). Under those circumstances, we conclude that it is not reasonably possible that the juiy was misled into believing that the court\u2019s instruction pertained to anything other than a home improvement contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">In regard to his second claim of instructional error, the defendant challenges the court\u2019s charge in that it did not define the term \u201chome improvement contract,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 20-419 (5).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We conclude that the court\u2019s omission of that definition from its charge was inconsequential. The existence of a \u201chome improvement contract\u201d was relevant only to the issue of whether, under \u00a7 20-427 (b) (3), the defendant falsely represented himself as or impersonated a registered home improvement contractor. The statutory definition of \u201ccontractor\u201d provides in relevant part: \u201c \u2018Contractor\u2019 does not include a person for whom the total cash price of all of his home improvement contracts with all of his customers does not exceed one thousand dollars during any period of twelve consecutive months.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 20-419 (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">The existence of a home improvement contract was not an essential element of either of the crimes with which the defendant stood charged. The defendant\u2019s criminal acts were proven by evidence of what he offered to do and in what manner he represented himself. The evidence of a contract for home improvement between the defendant and Christine Bums was relevant, along with other evidence, to the issue of whether he committed those criminal acts, but it did not form the basis of his conviction.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>The court\u2019s charge guided the jury to a proper verdict. Neither claimed error detracted from the court\u2019s proper recitations of and instructions concerning the elements of each offense.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">The defendant finally claims that the court\u2019s failure to act, sua sponte, to strike certain testimony and to deliver a limiting instruction with regard to certain evidence constituted plain error. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">The record reflects that during its case-in-chief, the state called Pamela Brown to testify. Brown testified that she was employed by the department as a special investigator and that she had worked in the department\u2019s home improvement unit, where she investigated both civil and criminal violations of the Home Improvement Act and, specifically, Christine Bums\u2019 complaint against the defendant. During the state\u2019s questioning of Brown, the following colloquy, in relevant part, occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-9\">\u201cQ. Okay. And do you know the defendant . . . ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-10\">\u201cA. Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-11\">\u201cQ. How do you know him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-12\">\u201cA. Since 1999, I\u2019ve investigated other criminal and civil cases involving [the defendant] and his business, Ready Company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-13\">Shortly thereafter, during cross-examination, defense counsel presented Brown with an exhibit containing various documents and exhibits she compiled during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>her investigation, as well as a copy of her report. Defense counsel questioned Brown about the course of her investigation. Although defense counsel did not question Brown about it, Brown\u2019s report contained a paragraph entitled \u201cExecutive Summary,\u201d which included the following sentence: \u201cRichard Koslik d/b/a Ready Company appears to be in violation of probation resultant from other home improvement criminal cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">The defendant claims that the aforementioned testimony of Brown, as well as that sentence from her report, \u201ctainted [the jury] with the impression that [he] had similar prior violations of the Home Improvement Act\u201d and that its admission deprived him of a fair trial. The defendant concedes that he did not object to either Brown\u2019s challenged testimony or to the admission of the report. To the contrary, defense counsel introduced Brown\u2019s report into evidence. The defendant now claims that the court, sua sponte, should have stricken Brown\u2019s challenged testimony and delivered a limiting instruction to the jury concerning her report, and that its failure to take either step constituted plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">\u201cTo prevail under the plain error doctrine, the defendant must demonstrate that the claimed error is both so clear and so harmful that a failure to reverse the judgment would result in manifest injustice. . . . This doctrine is not implicated and review of the claimed error is not undertaken unless the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and the public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hooks, </em>80 Conn. App. 75, 86, 832 A.2d 690, cert. denied, 267 Conn. 908, 840 A.2d 1171 (2003); see also Practice Book \u00a7 60-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">Here, the claimed error is not obvious. The defendant has failed to cite any authority in support of his proposition that the court had a duty to strike Brown\u2019s testimony or to deliver a limiting instruction with regard to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>the exhibit. Given the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the court was under no duty, sua sponte, to act. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Cator, </em>256 Conn. 785, 801-802, 781 A.2d 285 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">Apart from failing to demonstrate that the court should have acted as he suggests, the defendant also has failed to demonstrate that any error \u201cmore likely than not\u201d affected the verdict. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Day, </em>233 Conn. 813, 852, 661 A.2d 539 (1995). Brown\u2019s challenged testimony referred to her \u201cinvestigation\u201d of the defendant in prior civil and criminal cases. The challenged sentence from Brown\u2019s report referred to the defendant\u2019s apparent probationary status \u201cfrom other home improvement criminal cases.\u201d The defendant apparently posits that the admission of that evidence did not accord with the standard for admissibility applicable to prior convictions or to prior uncharged misconduct. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>supra, 70 Conn. App. 271-73. Brown\u2019s isolated and vague references did not specify whether the defendant had been convicted of a crime, what crime or crimes he had been convicted of or even when those acts occurred. Additionally, that evidence stands amid the testimony of the defendant and Brown that in August, 1998, the department suspended his registration. Applying common sense to that undisputed evidence, the jury would have inferred that the defendant\u2019s suspension resulted from some type of inappropriate behavior on his part, thereby lessening the marginal, if any, impact of that evidence on the jury.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> For all of the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim does not implicate the plain error doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b777-10\"> As a special condition of the defendant\u2019s probation, the court ordered him to pay restitution to Christine Bums and Eric Bums in the amount of $9434.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b777-11\"> In his principal brief, the defendant states his claim as one challenging the court\u2019s denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal. The defendant sought a judgment of acquittal at the close of the state\u2019s case-in-chief. See Practice Book \u00a7 42-40. The court denied the motion, and the defendant elected to put on evidence following that ruling. That being the case, we shall conduct our review of the defendant's sufficiency claim in light of all of the evidence presented at trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Feliciano, </em>74 Conn. App. 391, 395, 812 A.2d 141 (2002), cert. denied, 262 Conn. 952, 817 A.2d 110 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b781-8\"> The jury also had before it other evidence that the defendant performed installation work at the Bums\u2019 home. For example, the defendant admitted that he had installed a faucet. The state also introduced two handwritten notes given by the defendant to Christine Bums. The first note stated, inter alia, \u201cChris If you buy a faucet 4 hole I\u2019ll put it in Sat. and hook up dishwasher.\u201d The second note stated, inter alia, \u201cChris: Be back Thursday will start on floor # PR 3140 Colonial Cherry Inlay. *Please put up shower curtain.*\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b781-9\"><em> </em>There was no evidence that once the department suspended the defendant\u2019s registration, the defendant informed Christine Bums to disregard that representation on his business card.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b782-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 20-427 (b) provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall ...

We disagree. The jury reasonably could have found, as the Burnses testified, that for $17,000, the defendant agreed to purchase and to deliver the building materials that they wanted for their home and that he would install such materials. Although the defendant correctly points out that the written contract did not allocate that dollar amount in terms of materials and labor, the jury, applying its common sense and considering the scope of the work that he agreed to perform, reasonably could have found that he had offered to perform work having a total cash price exceeding $200.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-9\">The defendant also claims that there was no evidence that the total cash price of all of his home improvement contracts with all of his customers exceeded $1000 during any period of twelve consecutive months so as to satisfy the definition of \u201ccontractor\u201d in General Statutes \u00a7 20-419 (3); see footnote 7. The state did not bear the burden of proving that the defendant was a contractor; the state bore the burden of proving that the defendant improperly had represented himself as or impersonated a registered home improvement contractor and that he offered to make home improvements. Even were that not the case, on the basis of the agreement between the defendant and Christine Bums alone, the jury could have found that he had offered and agreed to perform a home improvement, and that the total cash price of his contracts exceeded $1000 during any period of twelve consecutive months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b789-7\"> The court stated: \u201cThe law defines home improvement as follows: Home improvement includes but is not limited to the repair, replacement, remodeling, alteration, conversion, modernization, improvement, rehabilitation, or sandblasting of or addition to any land or building or that portion thereof which is used or designed to be used as a private residence, dwelling place, or residential rental property or the construction, replacement, installation or improvement of driveways, swimming pools, porches, garages, roofs, siding, insulation, solar energy systems, flooring, patios, landscaping, fences, doors and windows and waterproofing in connection with such land or building or that portion thereof which is used or designed to be used as a private residence, dwelling place or residential property in which the total cash for all work agreed upon between the contractor and owner exceeds $200.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-8\">\u201cHome improvement does not include; A, the construction of a new home; B, the sale of goods by a seller who neither arranges to perform nor performs directly or indirectly any work or labor in connection with the installation or application of the goods or materials.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-9\">\u201cThe law defines contractor as follows: Contractor means any person who owns and operates a home improvement business or who undertakes, offers to undertake, or agrees to perform any home improvement.
