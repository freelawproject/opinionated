J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ajd\">The defendants, Jonathan Rapoport, Haig Development, LLC, and Opus Management, Inc., appeal from the judgment of the trial court granting a prejudgment attachment in the amount of $1 million in favor of the plaintiffs, John Doe, Jane Doe, James Doe and Jeff Doe. On appeal, the defendants claim that (1) the court improperly found that the affidavit on which the court based its judgment was sufficient to establish probable cause under General Statutes \u00a7 52-278d, (2) the court improperly admitted into evidence a medical report pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-174 (b) and (3) the plaintiffs failed to initiate a valid civil action. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to the resolution of the defendants\u2019 appeal. On February 14, 2001, Rapoport pleaded guilty to three counts of risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21 (2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The victims of Rapoport\u2019s criminal actions were the minor plaintiffs, James Doe and <em>Jeff </em>Doe. Subsequent to Rapoport\u2019s guilty plea, the plaintiffs<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> filed an application for a prejudgment remedy seeking an attachment to secure the sum of $1 million against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>the property or assets of the defendants.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On May 11, 2001, the defendants were served with the plaintiffs\u2019 application for the attachment, accompanying documents,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> including an unsigned copy of the complaint, and an affidavit from John Doe in support of the application for the attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 proposed twelve count complaint alleged various causes of action against Rapoport, including battery, assault and sexual contact with each of the minor plaintiffs. Count eleven alleged that Rapo-port had quitclaimed certain real property to Haig Development, LLC, with the \u201cintent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors.\u201d Count twelve alleged that the property transfer was made by Rapoport without his having received a reasonable equivalent value and that he either was insolvent at the time of the transfer or became insolvent as a result thereof. A hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for the attachment was scheduled for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>May 21, 2001, and then rescheduled for June 12, 2001. Further delays ensued, and the hearing was again delayed. On July 20,2001, the plaintiffs served the defendants with the twelve count complaint. A hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 original application had not been rescheduled. The plaintiffs, therefore, filed a second application, which was served on the defendants on November 7, 2001. On November 15, 2001, the court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for default for the defendants\u2019 failure to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">A hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 application was held on December 20, 2001. At that hearing, the court heard testimony from Jane Doe, and various documents were introduced into evidence. On May 14, 2002, the court issued its memorandum of decision. The court found that the affidavit that was submitted in support of the application was sufficient to establish probable cause to believe that it was likely that the plaintiffs would succeed on the merits. Accordingly, the court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 application. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">The defendants first claim that the court improperly found that the affidavit on which the court based its decision was sufficient to establish probable cause under General Statutes \u00a7 52-278c. Specifically, the defendants argue that the affidavit contained no reference to any damages suffered by the plaintiffs and that the affidavit therefore could not support a finding of probable cause. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">We set forth the following legal principles that will aid in the resolution of that issue. \u201cA hearing on an application for prejudgment remedy is not a full-scale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>trial on the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims . . . but rather concerns only whether and to what extent the plaintiff is entitled to have property of a defendant held in custody of the law pending final adjudication of the merits of the action. . . . Appellate review of the trial court\u2019s decision is limited to whether it was clearly improper and whether the trial court\u2019s conclusion was reasonable. ... In the absence of a procedural flaw in prejudgment remedy proceedings . . . appellate courts have only a limited role to play in reviewing a trial court\u2019s broad discretion to deny or to grant a prejudgment remedy.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Soltesz </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>56 Conn. App. 114, 116, 741 A.2d 335 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">\u201c[A]n appellate court is entitled to presume that the trial court acted properly and considered all the evidence. . . . [Our role] is not to duplicate the trial court\u2019s weighing process, but rather to determine whether its conclusion was reasonable. In the absence of clear error, this court should not overrule the thoughtful decision of the trial court, which has had an opportunity to assess the legal issues which may be raised and to weigh the credibility of at least some of the witnesses. . . . Thus, this court\u2019s review is limited to whether the trial court\u2019s conclusion was reasonable.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bosco </em>v. <em>Arrowhead by the Lake, Inc., </em>53 Conn. App. 873, 875, 732 A.2d 205 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">In the present case, John Doe provided an affidavit with the application for the attachment. The affidavit stated that Rapoport had pleaded guilty to conduct that constituted a risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21. Furthermore, that conduct was committed against the minor children in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">As we have stated, the probable cause hearing is not a full-scale trial on the merits. \u201cThe plaintiff does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>have to establish that he will prevail, only that there is probable cause to sustain the validity of the claim. . . . The court\u2019s role in such a hearing is to determine probable success by weighing probabilities. . . . [T]his weighing process applies to both legal and factual issues. ... In addition, the trial court has the responsibility, after the adversarial evidentiary hearing, to consider not only the validity of the claim but also the amount that is being sought.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Giordano </em>v. <em>Giordano, </em>39 Conn. App. 183, 206, 664 A.2d 1136 (1995). Stated more succinctly, \u201c[pjrobable cause for purposes of the [prejudgment remedy] statutes is a flexible common sense standard that does not demand that a belief be correct or more likely true than false.\u201d <em>Fischel </em>v. <em>TKPK, Ltd., </em>34 Conn. App. 22, 24, 640 A.2d 125 (1994). The affidavit, although very brief, supplied the court with the necessary facts to support a finding that there was probable cause to sustain the validity of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Even if we were to conclude that the affidavit alone was insufficient to support a finding of probable cause, the evidence presented at the hearing amply supported such a finding. Our Supreme Court has stated that \u201ca plaintiff may present evidence at a hearing on a motion to dissolve an ex parte prejudgment attachment in order to support an insufficient initial affidavit.\u201d <em>Glanz </em>v. <em>Testa, </em>200 Conn. 406, 408, 511 A.2d 341 (1986). We see no reason why the plaintiffs in this case should not be permitted to use evidence at the hearing to buttress the facts contained in the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">The plaintiffs supplied evidence at the hearing that further supported the court\u2019s finding of probable cause. First, Jane Doe testified that she was present when Rapoport pleaded guilty. She further testified that Jeff Doe had received treatment from both a psychologist and a psychiatrist. She stated that Jeff Doe had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>received the recommended amount of treatment due to a lack of financial resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Second, the plaintiffs introduced a certified copy of Rapoport\u2019s criminal judgment and a transcript of his plea. Both of those documents supported the allegations set forth in the complaint. Third, the report of William Hartman, a psychologist who treated Jeff Doe, was admitted into evidence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That report detailed the various traumatic effects of Rapoport\u2019s sexual abuse and the subsequent serious effect on Jeff Doe. Furthermore, the report acknowledged that years of specialized psychotherapy, perhaps even a residential treatment setting, likely will be necessary. On the basis of that evidence, it is clear that the court did not abuse its discretion or commit clear error in granting the plaintiffs\u2019 application for an attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">The defendants next claim that the court improperly admitted into evidence Hartman\u2019s medical report pursuant to \u00a7 52-174 (b).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Specifically, the defendants argue that the report failed to meet the requirements of \u00a7 52-174 (b) in that (1) no bill for treatment accompanied the report and (2) the report did not disclose Hartman\u2019s area of expertise or whether he actually treated Jeff Doe. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The defendants first argue that \u00a7 52-174 (b) requires that a bill for treatment must accompany the report for the report to be admissible. The defendants further claim the bill is necessary to demonstrate that the provider, in this case a psychologist, treated the plaintiff in the ordinary course of practice. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">The defendants argue in their brief that \u201c\u00a7 52-174 requires that both the bill for treatment and the report be admitted together.\u201d The defendants, however, have failed to provide us with any rule of law to support that claim. As we frequently have stated, \u201c[a]naiysis, rather than mere abstract assertion, is required in order to avoid abandoning an issue by failure to brief the issue properly. . . . We will not review claims absent law and analysis. . . . <em>Wachter </em>v. <em>UDV North </em>America, <em>Inc., </em>75 Conn. App. 538, 545-46, 816 A.2d 668 (2003).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ghent </em>v. <em>Mead-owhaven Condominium, Inc., </em>77 Conn. App. 276, 289, 823 A.2d 355 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">Even if we were to consider the defendants\u2019 claim, we would conclude that the \u00a7 52-174 (b) does not require that a bill for treatment accompany the medical report. At the outset, we set forth the applicable standard of review. \u201cStatutory construction is a question of law and therefore our review is plenary. . . . [0]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>MacMillan </em>v. <em>Higgins, </em>76 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Conn. App. 261, 274, 822 A.2d 246, cert. denied, 264 Conn. 907, 826 A.2d 177 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Simply put, the defendants\u2019 claim that a bill for treatment must accompany a medical report for the report to be admissible pursuant to \u00a7 52-174 (b) is without merit. We have stated that the language of the statute is the most important factor in statutory construction. See <em>In re Shonna K., </em>77 Conn. App. 246, 254, 822 A.2d 1009 (2003). The language of \u00a7 52-174 (b) provides in relevant part: <em>\u201cThe use of any such report or bill in lieu of the testimony </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The use of the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d indicates that either a report or a bill may be used by the offering party as long as it was signed by the treating physician. See <em>Lopiano </em>v. <em>Lopiano, </em>247 Conn. 356, 383, 752 A.2d 1000 (1998) (\u201c \u2018[t]hus, once the statutory requirement that the report be signed by a treating physician is met, the evidence in that report is admissible and has the same effect as a business entry\u2019 \u201d). Moreover, the legislative history supports such an interpretation. \u201c[T]his bill would allow an attorney in a civil action based on personal injury or death <em>to introduce into evidence a medical report of a physician </em>without the necessity of in fact calling the physician to testify.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 382, quoting 20 H.R. Proc., Pt. 8, 1977 Sess., p. 2993, remarks of Representative Ernest N. Abate.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Finally, as we have stated, the defendants have failed to provide us with any case law indicating such a requirement. Our research has found, however, instances where a report was admitted pursuant to \u00a7 52-174 (b) without an accompanying bill. See, e.g., <em>Pineau </em>v. <em>Home Depot, Inc., </em>45 Conn. App. 248, 252-54, 695 A.2d 14 (1997) (court properly admitted cover letter of treating physician pursuant to \u00a7 52-174 (b)), appeal dismissed, 245 Conn. 422, 713 A.2d 825 (1998); <em>Shegog </em>v. <em>Zabrecky, </em>36 Conn. App. 737, 750, 654 A.2d 771 (\u201csigned report of a treating physician may be used in lieu of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>the testimony of that treating physician\u201d), cert. denied, 232 Conn. 922, 656 A.2d 670 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">On the basis of the foregoing, we conclude that it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to submit a bill for treatment for the Hartman report to be admissible pursuant to \u00a7 52-174 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">The defendants next argue that the report did not disclose Hartman\u2019s area of expertise or whether he actually treated Jeff Doe. The defendants further claim that because the report failed to contain that information, it was hearsay, and the court improperly admitted the report into evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">As a preliminary matter, we set forth the applicable standard of review. \u201c[T]he trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility ... of evidence. . . . We will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling, and . . . evi-dentiary rulings will be overturned on appeal only where there was an abuse of discretion and a showing by the defendant of a substantial prejudice or injustice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sheiman </em>v. <em>Shei-man, </em>72 Conn. App. 193, 201, 804 A.2d 983 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">Our Supreme Court has set forth the requirements for a report to be admissible pursuant to \u00a7 52-174 (b). \u201c[Section 52-174 (b)] permits a signed doctor\u2019s report to be admitted as a business entry. . . . [It] creates a presumption that the doctor\u2019s signature is genuine and that the report was made in the ordinary course of business. . . . Thus, once the statutory requirement that the report be signed by a treating physician is met, the evidence in that report is admissible and has the same effect as a business entry. . . . This statute serves the purpose of getting medical evidence before the jury in the absence of the treating physician. . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>The need for this statutory exception allowing for a substitute for testimony was clearly driven by economics due to the necessity for medical evidence in every personal injury action for damages.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lopiano </em>v. <em>Lopiano, </em>supra, 247 Conn. 383.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">In the present case, the plaintiffs, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 13-4,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> disclosed Hartman as the psychologist who had treated Jeff Doe. Furthermore, at the hearing, Jane Doe testified that Hartman was the treating psychologist of Jeff Doe. Hartman signed the report that was admitted into evidence. On the basis of those facts, it is clear that the requirements of \u00a7 52-174 (b) were met; the report was signed by the treating psychologist. We conclude, therefore, that the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the Hartman report into evidence pursuant to \u00a7 52-174 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">The defendants\u2019 final claim is that the plaintiffs failed to initiate a valid civil action. Specifically, the defendants argue that the plaintiffs\u2019 first application was deemed withdrawn on June 21, 2001, when a hearing was not scheduled within thirty days of the original hearing date of May 21, 2001. The defendants further assert that because the original application was withdrawn, service of the civil action on July 20, 2001, was somehow invalid, as was the service for the second application for the attachment that was made on November 7, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Aside from a reference to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-278d (b)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and 52-278j (b),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the defendants again have failed to provide this court with any meaningful legal analysis of their claim. The applicability of the statutes cited by the defendants is not clear, as the original application was never granted or denied. Absent such legal analysis, the claim is deemed waived. See <em>Ghent v. Meadowhaven Condominium, Inc., </em>supra, 77 Conn. App. 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Even if we were to review that claim, it is clear that it is without merit. General Statutes \u00a7 52-278h provides that \u201c[t]he provisions of this chapter shall apply to any application for prejudgment remedy filed by the plaintiff at any time after the institution of the action, and the forms and procedures provided therein shall be adapted accordingly.\u201d The plaintiffs in this case commenced an action on July 20,2001, and even if we assume arguendo that the first application was deemed to have been withdrawn due to a lapse of time, the service of the second application on November 7, 2001, was valid. Thus, service of the complaint, and the application for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>the attachment and the hearing on the application all were valid and proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b141-8\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53-21 provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person who ...
