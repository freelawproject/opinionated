The court sentenced appellant to an aggregate term of thirty years\u2019 incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-11\">On appeal, appellant presents the following questions for our review, which we have rephrased slightly, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-12\">1. Did the circuit court err in permitting the State to introduce the results of a blood alcohol test where the State failed to establish a proper chain of custody between the blood obtained from appellant and the blood tested to obtain those results?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-13\">2. Did the circuit court err in permitting the State\u2019s expert to offer testimony relating to the data acquired from the air bag control module of appellant\u2019s vehicle where the State failed to establish the accuracy and validity of the methodology used to acquire that data?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-14\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">On June 5, 2011, appellant drove his sport utility vehicle (\u201cSUV\u201d), at a speed of approximately 89 miles per hour, into the rear of another vehicle. Appellant struck the car with such force that the two rear-seat occupants were ejected through the rear window of the car and killed. The driver also was killed when the car struck a tree. The front seat passenger survived, but he sustained a fractured back, a fractured pelvis, an ankle injury, a concussion, and other serious and debilitating juries.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">When the surviving front seat passenger got out of the vehicle to look for his wife and the driver\u2019s wife, he saw appellant standing there. He asked appellant for help, but appellant just continued to stand there, offering no assistance. Appellant\u2019s blood alcohol content was .24 grams per 100 ml of blood, three times the legal limit to operate a vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">We shall incorporate additional facts, relevant to each of the questions presented by appellant, in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">Admission of Results of the Blood Test</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">Appellant first contends that the circuit court \u201cerred in allowing the State to offer blood test results because the State failed to establish the chain of custody between the blood taken from [appellant] and the blood tested to produce [the] test result.\u201d The State disagrees, asserting that \u201cthe trial court acted within its discretion in admitting the results of [appellant\u2019s] blood test.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-12\">Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b91-13\">Officer Thomas Crosby, a member of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department, testified that, on June 5, 2011, he transported appellant from the scene of the accident to Fort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Washington Hospital Center. He observed a phlebotomist draw blood from appellant to measure his blood alcohol level.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Corporal Stephen Fox supplied the hospital with a blood collection kit. He described a blood collection kit as a sealed cardboard box containing vials for blood collection, a preparatory product to clean the skin at the collection site, and security seals and integrity seals. Once the blood is collected, the vials are secured with the seals and then repackaged in the cardboard box, which is then sealed. The blood collection kit that he provided to the hospital was \u201cnew, unopened, and it was still within its expiration time period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Corporal Fox observed the phlebotomist draw blood from appellant. After the blood was in the vials from the blood collection kit, the phlebotomist sealed the vials with integrity seals and signed the chain of custody form, which was admitted as State\u2019s Exhibit # 14. This form contained the phlebo-tomist\u2019s signature, appellant\u2019s name, the time and date of arrest, and the time, date, and location of the sample collection.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">Corporal Fox then repackaged the vials into a secured container with foam packaging, put the container into a bag, and then put the bag in the cardboard box. Corporal Fox took the repackaged blood collection kit to the Special Operations Division offices, and he placed the package into the mail to the Chemical Test for Alcohol Unit of the Maryland State Police for analysis. Corporal Fox testified that the legal limit in Maryland to operate a motor vehicle is .08 grams per 100 ml of blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">Phlebotomist Seleshe Russom confirmed that he drew blood from appellant using a blood collection kit supplied to him by the police. He verified his signature on the police chain of custody form, which had been admitted as State\u2019s Exhibit #14.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">Wayne Shu, a forensic scientist with the Maryland State Police Crime Lab, performed the blood alcohol content testing in this case. He identified State\u2019s Exhibit # 14 as \u201ca copy of the Form 34 that\u2019s filled out and provided.\u201d He stated, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>however, that \u201cthere seemed to be a bottom part missing to this,\u201d explaining that his copy of the \u201cForm 34 on the bottom has where [he] could input the results and get the control number,\u201d and that the exhibit was \u201ca little different than [his] copy, but it\u2019s similar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">Mr. Shu described the blood analysis process, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-5\">The blood kit is hand delivered to the Maryland State Police Crime Lab, which is then received by our receiving unit. At that time, it\u2019s logged into our system, which is our evidence tracking system. When I\u2019m ready for analysis, I call down to receiving and I pick up the kit, which I do. After that, I bring it to our toxicology unit, which is our locked lab which only approved personnel can get into; namely, the forensic scientist working toxicology and also the supervisors and management.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-6\">After the kit is taken into the lab, it\u2019s then locked in our refrigerator, which has key to it, and it stays there until I\u2019m ready to analyze the blood kit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-7\">At that point, that blood kit is taken out and we run our analysis in batches____But ... only one kit is opened at one time to make sure there\u2019s no tube switching, and I make sure that the numbers on the kit corresponds with the evidence kit itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-10\">After I make sure of that ... we [test] two vials for quality assurance. The results have to be duplicated. After that, I ... make a sequence. And after I check the sequence with the worksheet, make sure it corresponds to the evidence kit itself, I run the instrument and the instrument prints out the results after it\u2019s finished the analysis. And I review the analysis and submit the findings to our ... Chemical Testing for Alcohol Unit ... they send a report to me, I review it and sign it after I make sure everything is correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">Mr. Shu explained that, in this case, he received appellant\u2019s blood kit from \u201cour [central] receiving unit,\u201d and he \u201cput it into the refrigerator in our toxicology unit until [he] was ready <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>to analyze the blood.\u201d When he was ready, he took it out of the refrigerator, \u201csampled it,\u201d and then followed the testing procedure that he outlined for the jury. After the blood sample was analyzed, a report was printed, and he wrote down the results. Once he received the final report, he made sure the information was correct, and he signed the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">The State then moved into evidence, as State\u2019s Exhibit # 13, the report indicating Mr. Shu\u2019s findings. Appellant objected, arguing that the \u201cState has not established chain of custody. They haven\u2019t established that the blood that was taken by this phlebotomist, Mr. Russom, was the blood that was analyzed by this particular witness.\u201d Appellant asserted that the parties did not \u201chave the actual blood kit that was taken, the actual blood that was taken, the vials, the cardboard box, any of the notations on the cardboard box.\u201d Instead, all the parties had was State\u2019s Exhibit # 14, \u201cwhich would have been the only marking or only indication of what was actually given to\u201d Mr. Shu, and Mr. Shu had indicated that the exhibit was \u201cnot what was provided to him,\u201d but rather, it was only \u201csimilar.\u201d Thus, he concluded, the State had not established that the blood that was drawn was the same blood that was analyzed by Mr. Shu.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The court then allowed the State to further examine Mr. Shu about the condition of the blood collection kit when he received it. Mr. Shu explained that he had received the package from the police Central Receiving Unit. The blood collection kit was a cardboard box with evidence tape over it to seal it. Mr. Shu broke the \u201cevidence seal and opened the cardboard box. Inside the box was a \u201cplastic clam shell that has evidence seals alongside of it.\u201d Mr. Shu broke the seals on the \u201cclam shell\u201d to get to the two test tubes, and he ensured that there was no evidence of tampering.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">After that testimony, the State again sought to admit into evidence the results of appellant\u2019s blood alcohol test. Appellant objected, arguing that Mr. Shu had indicated that he received the package via hand-delivery, and Officer Fox had testified that he had mailed the kit. He asserted that there was a \u201chole in the chain of custody,\u201d and \u201cif we had the vials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>and the cardboard kit and the attached signatures on that cardboard kit, then perhaps the State could establish chain of custody. We don\u2019t have that. All we have at this point is ... State\u2019s Exhibit 14, which doesn\u2019t indicate anything at this point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The court overruled appellant\u2019s objection. State\u2019s Exhibit # 13, along with Mr. Shu\u2019s testimony regarding the results of Mr. Shu\u2019s testing of appellant\u2019s blood, was admitted. Appellant\u2019s blood alcohol concentration was .24 grams of alcohol per 100 ml of blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">On cross-examination, appellant asked Mr. Shu about the difference between State\u2019s Exhibit # 14 and Mr. Shu\u2019s copy of the form. Mr. Shu explained that his copy had the same top portion, but it had a \u201cbottom tear off that says laboratory use.\u201d He stated: \u201cBasically, it has a portion where I can note the condition of the seal,\u201d and in \u201cthis case, I know the seal was okay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">On redirect, Mr. Shu stated that the form that he had brought with him to court was different from State\u2019s Exhibit # 14 in that the exhibit \u201cdoes not include the laboratory tear off copy of [his] signature and [his] statement which [he] wrote on\u201d the form. Other than that, the forms were identical.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">Chain of Custody</p>\n<p id=\"b95-12\">Appellant argues that the State failed to establish the necessary chain of custody between the blood drawn by Mr. Russom and the blood tested by Mr. Shu. Noting that Corporal Fox testified that he sent the blood collection kit through the mail to the Maryland State Police, and Mr. Shu testified that he obtained the kit from the Receiving Unit of the Maryland State Police, appellant argues that there was a \u201c \u2018hole in the chain of custody,\u2019 as the items were handled and transferred by numerous unknown people, both throughout the postal service en route to the State Police, and by people within the State Police Receiving Unit before [being] retrieved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>by Mr. Shu.\u201d Moreover, he argues, there \u201cwas no evidence that the chain of custody documentation in State\u2019s Exhibit 14 accompanied those items during the journey and remained attached to those particular items throughout those undocumented parts of their journey.\u201d In addition, as Mr. Shu testified that there was a portion of State\u2019s Exhibit # 14 missing, there was no evidence that the exhibit \u201cwas full, complete, and accurate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">The State contends that it is not necessary for the State to \u201cpresent testimony from every human being who touched an item before that evidence may be admitted into evidence,\u201d nor is there \u201cany requirement that the State provide any written documentation whatsoever concerning chain of custody.\u201d It asserts that the authenticity of an item offered at trial may be established almost entirely by circumstantial evidence, and the only issue before the court is whether the evidence presented is sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims it to be. The State argues that, in this case, the testimony was sufficient to allow a rational fact finder to determine that the blood tested by Mr. Shu was the same blood collected from appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">With respect to appellant\u2019s argument that there is a \u201cmissing\u201d portion of State\u2019s Exhibit # 14, the State responds in two ways. First it asserts that the \u201cmissing\u201d portion was not actually missing, as Mr. Shu had with him a copy of the complete form, which included the bottom portion. Moreover, it argues, there is nothing in the record to indicate that the presence or absence of the \u201cmissing\u201d portion of the form would prevent the jury from determining that the unsealed blood vials received by Mr. Shu were the same vials mailed by Corporal Fox. Indeed, the \u201cpart of the form that [Mr.] Shu filled out had nothing to do with the authentication of the blood when [Mr.] Shu received it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Determinations regarding the admissibility of evidence generally are left to the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Hajireen v. State, </em>203 Md.App. 537, 552, 39 A.3d 105, <em>cert. denied, </em>429 Md. 306, 55 A.3d 908 (2012). This Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>reviews a trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Simms, </em>420 Md. 705, 724-25, 25 A.3d 144 (2011). <em>Accord Nixon v. State, </em>204 Md. 475, 483, 105 A.2d 243 (1954) (reviewing trial court\u2019s ruling excluding evidence based on inadequate chain of custody for an abuse of discretion). A trial court abuses its discretion only when \u201cno reasonable person would take the view adopted by the [trial] court,\u201d or when the court acts \u201cwithout reference to any guiding rules or principles.\u201d <em>King v. State, </em>407 Md. 682, 697, 967 A.2d 790 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Chain of custody evidence is necessary to demonstrate the \u201cultimate integrity of the physical evidence.\u201d <em>Best v. State, </em>79 Md.App. 241, 256, 556 A.2d 701, <em>cert. denied, </em>317 Md. 70, 562 A.2d 718 (1989). In most cases, an adequate chain of custody is established through the testimony of key witnesses who were responsible for the safekeeping of the evidence, i.e., those who can \u201c \u2018negate a possibility of \u201ctampering\u201d ... and thus preclude a likelihood that the thing\u2019s condition was changed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jones v. State, </em>172 Md.App. 444, 462, 915 A.2d 1010 (quoting <em>Wagner v. State, </em>160 Md.App. 531, 552, 864 A.2d 1037 (2005)), <em>cert. denied, </em>399 Md. 33, 922 A.2d 574 (2007). What is necessary to negate the likelihood of tampering or of change of condition will vary from case to case. <em>Best, </em>79 Md.App. at 250, 556 A.2d 701. The existence of gaps or weaknesses in the chain of custody generally go to the weight of the evidence and do not require exclusion of the evidence as a matter of law. <em>See Jones, </em>172 Md.App. at 463, 915 A.2d 1010 (upholding the admission of the evidence, but noting that the gaps in the State\u2019s chain of custody supported defense counsel\u2019s remarks in closing that the jury should discount its value).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">Here, the evidence showed that Corporal Fox responded to the hospital with a blood collection kit that was \u201cnew, unopened, and it was still within its expiration period.\u201d He then observed the phlebotomist, Mr. Russom, draw blood from appellant. Mr. Russom then sealed the vials, and Corporal Fox placed them in a secured container, which was then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>\u201csealed into a bag,\u201d and then placed in the cardboard box. The box was then mailed to the Maryland State Police Crime Lab, where Mr. Shu took possession of the box, with its seals still intact. The box was kept in a locked and secure area of the crime lab while Mr. Shu performed his analysis. Mr. Shu testified that he inspected the cardboard box, in which the blood was delivered, the interior container protecting the vials, as well as the vials themselves, before performing his tests, and he saw no evidence of any tampering. This chain of custody evidence was sufficient to allow a rational fact finder to determine that the blood Mr. Shu tested was the same blood that Mr. Russom collected from appellant and turned over to Corporal Fox.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Admission of the SUY\u2019s Recorded Data</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Appellant next contends that the circuit court \u201cerred in permitting the State to offer evidence derived from the air bag control module of [appellant\u2019s] vehicle because there was no evidence that the data was based upon a reliable methodology.\u201d The State contends that appellant is wrong and \u201cmisapprehends the standard for the admission of both scientific evidence and expert testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">Proceedings Below</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">Corporal Frank Carson, a member of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department, investigated the collision. He testified at trial, without objection, as an expert witness in crash data retrieval and air bag control module analysis. During voir dire, Corporal Carson testified that he had been an accident reconstructionist for 15 years. He described the training and experience he had regarding how to use specialized equipment to retrieve \u201ccrash data\u201d from vehicle air bag control modules, as well as how to analyze that information \u201cas it applies to accident reconstruction and crashes.\u201d Corporal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Carson had qualified as an expert in crash data retrieval for air bag control modules on two prior occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">After he was accepted as an expert, Corporal Carson explained that the air bag control module determines whether a vehicle\u2019s air bag should deploy by measuring \u201cdeceleration and time.\u201d Analogizing to a parachute that opens on impact, which is not helpful, he noted that an air bag must be deployed prior to impact to be effective. The module attempts to predict when a collision is imminent by measuring the severity of rapid decelerations. Although Corporal Carson knew how to retrieve and analyze \u201ccrash data\u201d from the air bag control module, he acknowledged that he did not know the specific \u201cengineering parameters\u201d that the module used in determining whether to deploy the air bag, stating that this was \u201ca trade secret.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">With respect to the collision in this case, as part of the investigation, Corporal Carson removed the air bag control module from appellant\u2019s SUV. He attached the module to a \u201cspecial interface,\u201d and then attached that to a computer running a particular program. He then was able to retrieve the data from the module and download the information from the module to his computer. Software on his computer then produced \u201ca readable formatted report\u201d of the data retrieved from the module. The method he used to retrieve the data is \u201caccepted within the scientific community of reconstruction-ists.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">The State then offered into evidence, as State\u2019s Exhibit # 12, the report Corporal Carson generated. Appellant objected to the admission of the report, as well as Corporal Carson\u2019s testimony regarding the report, on the ground that the State had not established the reliability of the data. He argued that Corporal Carson\u2019s testimony was \u201csimply saying this is what the computer shows or the computer system shows in the vehicle, but there\u2019s no indication that that computer system is reliable.\u201d Moreover, he asserted that the \u201cretrieval tool\u201d used to collect the data was version \u201c4.0,\u201d and he proffered to the court that the \u201clatest software ... is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>actually a version 10.3.\u201d Counsel directed the court to the \u201cwarning at the top of this State\u2019s Exhibit Number 12 that the latest retrieval system or latest software should be used.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The court asked if counsel had any cases addressing the reliability of the crash retrieval system, and counsel said that he did not \u201chave any with me right now.\u201d The court then allowed the prosecutor to ask additional questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Corporal Carson testified that he had investigated 175 fatal motor vehicle collisions, including cases in which air bag control modules and crash data retrievals had been involved. With respect to his opinion regarding the reliability and accuracy of \u201ccrash data retrieval,\u201d Corporal Carson stated that, in his experience as an accident reconstructionist, \u201cair bag control modules are very accurate, especially if they\u2019re involved in cases in the direction they\u2019re designed to sense,\u201d meaning forward and backward decelerations. He stated that National Traffic Safety Administration (\u201cNTSA\u201d) studies have shown that the modules were accurate to \u201cbetween a half and two miles an hour, in most cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The court ultimately overruled appellant\u2019s objection.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It stated that appellant\u2019s argument went \u201cmore towards whatever argument you want to make in terms of the weight the jury should give to it, but the [c]ourt is satisfied that it\u2019s admissible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">Corporal Carson then discussed the data retrieved from the air bag control module. He testified that, one second prior to the crash, the vehicle was going 89 miles per hour, the brake was not applied, and the air bag did not deploy.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">Basis for Expert Opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b100-11\">Appellant contends that the court erred in allowing the testimony derived from the air bag control module of his SUV <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>because the State \u201coffered no information concerning the reliability of the system used to record and relate that data.\u201d Therefore, he asserts, Corporal Carson did not have a sufficient factual basis for his expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The State contends that, contrary to appellant\u2019s position, it \u201cis not necessary for an expert to be able to describe, in detail, the software code used to retrieve information.\u201d Rather, \u201cit is enough that the information [the expert] relied upon is of a type generally relied upon by similar experts.\u201d In this case, it asserts that \u201cthere was direct testimony that the module was a reliable and accurate source of data in general.\u201d Moreover, \u201cany complaints regarding the accuracy of the information recorded by the control module in [appellant\u2019s] car went to its weight, not its admissibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The decision whether to admit or exclude expert testimony is a matter within the discretion of the trial court, and the court\u2019s decision in this regard \u201c \u2018will seldom constitute a ground for reversal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Donati v. State, 215 </em>Md.App. 686, 742, 84 A.3d 156 (quoting <em>Bryant v. State, </em>393 Md. 196, 900 A.2d 227 (2006)), <em>cert. denied, </em>438 Md. 143, 91 A.3d 614 (2014). <em>Accord Massie v.

In making that determination, the court shall determine (1) whether the witness is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, (2) the appropriateness of the expert testimony on the particular subject, and (3) whether a sufficient factual basis exists to support the expert testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Appellant\u2019s claim rests on the third prong, whether Corporal Carson had a sufficient factual basis for his opinion. Appellant asserts that he did not because the State failed to . establish that his testimony was supported by a reliable process or methodology. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">To be sure, \u201csimply because a witness has been tendered and qualified as an expert in a particular occupation or profession, it does not follow that the expert may render an unbridled opinion, which does not otherwise comport with Md. Rule 5-702.\u201d <em>Giant Food, Inc. v. Booker, </em>152 Md.App. 166, 182, 831 A.2d 481, <em>cert. denied, </em>378 Md. 614, 837 A.2d 926 (2003). Rather, \u201c[a]n expert\u2019s opinion testimony must be based on [an] adequate factual basis so that it does not amount to \u2018conjecture, speculation, or incompetent evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 182-83, 831 A.2d 481 (quoting <em>Uhlik v. Kopec, </em>20 Md.App. 216, 223-24, 314 A.2d 732 (1974)). <em>Accord City Homes, Inc. v. Hazelwood, </em>210 Md.App. 615, 678-79, 63 A.3d 713, <em>cert. denied, </em>432 Md. 468, 69 A.3d 476 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The parties have not cited, and we have not found, any Maryland case addressing the issue regarding the reliability of vehicle air bag control modules. Other jurisdictions, however, have concluded that \u201cblack box\u201d data from a motor vehicle\u2019s recording system, is reliable and admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">In <em>Com. v. Zimmermann, </em>70 Mass.App.Ct. 357, 873 N.E.2d 1215 (2007), in a trial for motor vehicle homicide by negligent operation, the Appeals Court of Massachusetts agreed with the trial court that evidence taken from the event data recorder (EDR) in the defendant\u2019s vehicle was sufficiently reliable to be admissible. The Commonwealth\u2019s expert had conducted 200 tests on EDRs, and he testified that the technology behind the EDR had been known for many years, that he and other experts had found the EDRs to be reliable, that EDRs needed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>no maintenance and calibration for 10 years, and that his calculations based on the physical and other evidence were consistent with the EDR data from the defendant\u2019s vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 1220. Under these circumstances, the appellate court held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the EDR data was reliable and admissible. <em>Id. </em>at 1221.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Similarly, in <em>People v. Christmann, </em>3 Misc.3d 309, 315, 776 N.Y.S.2d 437 (N.Y. Justice Ct.2004), the court held, in a prosecution for speeding and failing to exercise due care, that accident data recorded in a motor vehicle\u2019s sensing diagnostic module (SDM) was admissible because it was reliable. It held that such evidence was \u201cgenerally accepted as reliable and accurate by the automobile industry and [NTSA].\u201d <em>See Bachman v. Gen\u2019l Motors Corp., </em>332 Ill.App.3d 760, 267 Ill.Dec. 125, 776 N.E.2d 262, 281 (\u201ccrash sensors such as the SDM have been in production in automobiles for over a decade\u201d and are generally accepted as a tool of accident reconstruction), <em>appeal denied, </em>202 Ill.2d 598, 272 Ill.Dec. 339, 787 N.E.2d 154 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Here, Corporal Carson, who had extensive training and experience in how to use specialized equipment to retrieve data from control modules, had qualified as an expert in crash data retrieval from air bag modules on two different occasions. As the State notes, he testified that the method he used to retrieve the data was accepted within the scientific community of reconstructionists, and that, in his experience, air bag control modules are very accurate. He also testified that NTSA studies have shown them to be accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">The testimony here regarding the reliability of the air bag control module was not extensive. It was sufficient, however, for us to conclude that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in determining that \u201cblack box\u201d data derived from the air bag control module of appellant\u2019s SUV was sufficiently reliable to support the expert\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-12\">. After a lunch break, counsel for appellant did present a case saying that a foundation for testimony must be laid, but the court stated that the facts were \"completely distinguishable from the situation\u201d in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
