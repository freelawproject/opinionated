After Franklin failed to respond to Johnson\u2019s discovery requests, Johnson filed a motion for summary judgment on June 13, 2014. At a motion hearing on July 25, 2014, the circuit court denied summary judgment and denied Johnson\u2019s complaint. Johnson appealed on August 18, 2014, and asks:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Did the trial court abuse its discretion by denying Johnson\u2019s complaint for a bill of discovery for lead-based paint testing to support a separate lead-paint poisoning suit?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">We answer \u201cyes,\u201d vacate the judgment of the circuit court, and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Johnson filed this suit as a companion action to a pending lead-paint poisoning case filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. <em>See Johnson v. Riggs Properties, </em>24-C-11-007769 (Cir.Ct.Balt.City). In that case, Johnson alleged that \u201che suffered severe and permanent injuries from exposure and ingestion of lead-based paint and lead-based paint dust at properties including [the Property].\u201d Johnson \u201canticipate[d] that the presence or absence of lead-based paint in [the Property] will be extremely relevant to his claims\u201d in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">On February 19, 2014, Johnson, by letter, contacted Franklin, who is not a party to the companion suit and is the current owner of the Property, to request her permission to conduct \u201cnon-invasive environmental testing\u201d of the Property to determine the presence and extent of lead-based paint in the Property. After Franklin failed to respond, Johnson filed a complaint to perpetuate evidence and request for a hearing pursuant to Md. Rule 2-404, on March 6, 2014, in the circuit court. In his complaint, Johnson alleged that \u201c[a]n equitable bill of discovery is the <em>only </em>way for [Johnson] to obtain the information he requires. [Johnson]\u2019s requested relief is specific and adapted to securing the relief sought conveniently, effectively and completely.\u201d (Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">Franklin filed an answer <em>pro se </em>on April 11, 2014, requesting that the circuit court deny Johnson\u2019s request. Franklin denied that Johnson needed a \u201cright of access to the [Property] in this case because the required testing ha[d] already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>been completed,\u201d and that \u201c[Johnson] ha[d] an adequate alternative remedy for obtaining the evidence [he] claim[ed] [he] need[ed]\u201d because Franklin had already provided Johnson with copies of the results of the prior testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">After Franklin filed her answer, Johnson propounded requests for production of documents, interrogatories, and requests for admission of facts on Franklin on April 23, 2014. Franklin failed to respond to any of Johnson\u2019s discovery requests, and Johnson moved for summary judgment pursuant to Md. Rule 2-501(a) on June 13, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">On July 25, 2014, the circuit court held a hearing on Johnson\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Johnson argued that \u201call [he] want[ed] is access ... to the actual paint to test the paint.\u201d Johnson cited \u201cone sample in the livingroom [sic] windowsill that did contain a little bit of lead which leads [him] to believe that there may be lead-based paint in the [Property].\u201d Johnson offered to complete the testing \u201cat any time convenient to Ms. Franklin.\u201d In response, Franklin cited the \u201cfact that [she] had the test done and [she] gave them the paperwork showing that the State and the Federal government approved[,]\u201d as why she \u201cdidn\u2019t see it necessary for them to come in my home.\u201d She stated that had she \u201cnot had the test done [she] wouldn\u2019t have a problem.\u201d Johnson added that she \u201crehabbed the house.... New sheet rock is up. There is no old paint in the house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">The circuit court framed \u201cthe issue the Court has to weigh\u201d as \u201cobviously [Franklin\u2019s] personal privacy and inconvenience.\u201d The court asked Franklin to \u201ctell the Court if you will, how you feel about having someone come into your house and do this test, even though they are saying that it is going to be short and quick.\u201d Franklin said, \u201cthere\u2019s no reason,\u201d because of the previous testing, and that she \u201cjust d[oes]n\u2019t want them\u201d coming into the Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">The circuit court ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-9\">In this particular case the Court, one, makes a finding that this type of pleading is not appropriate for Summary Judgment because it would not be a judgment, just sort of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>grant or deny of the petition or request. And so in that sense, there would be no judgment in either way, the Court will either grant or deny the request. The Court will also make a finding in this particular case based on what I\u2019ve heard from Ms. Franklin and what I saw in her response. And also with the pleadings and the case law as well in this particular case, I don\u2019t believe that [Johnson], in this case, [Johnson] has shown that [Franklmfs privacy rights have been outweighed by [Johnsonfs needs to do this additional testing. And so, the motion is denied and the request is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The circuit court\u2019s order of July 25, 2014, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">FOUND that [Johnson] failed to establish that his right to access the premises outweighs the privacy rights of [Franklin]; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">ORDERED that for the reasons stated on the record, [Johnsonfs Motion for Summary Judgment (Docket Entry # 7) is DENIED; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Af0\">ORDERED that [Johnsonfs Complaint to Perpetuate Evidence (Docket Entry # 1) is DENIED; and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AD-\">ORDERED that the Clerk of Court shall close the case with all costs to be paid by the Plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">Johnson contends that \u201cthe Court decided, <em>sua sponte, </em>that [his] Complaint was actually a \u2018request,\u2019 which was legal error.\u201d In tandem with that argument, Johnson argues that summary judgment in his favor was the appropriate disposition of this case. Johnson cites the lack of a genuine dispute of material fact, because Franklin failed to respond to any of his discovery requests, and \u201ctherefore, admitted\u201d that there was no genuine dispute of material fact. Johnson argues that, although no evidentiary hearing was held as required by <em>Stokes v. 835 N. Washington Street, LLC, </em>141 Md.App. 214, 784 A.2d 1142 (2001), he did prove, through Franklin\u2019s admissions, by a preponderance of the evidence that there is no dispute that \u201c[Johnsonfs right to access the premises out<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>weighed [Franklinj\u2019s privacy interest\u201d and, as a result, summary judgment should have been granted in his favor. Johnson urges us to accept a <em>de novo </em>standard of review in reviewing whether his complaint was properly denied because it was denied as a part of his motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">Johnson correctly cites <em>Stokes </em>as largely controlling. In <em>Stokes, </em>we considered a similar case, where a minor filed a lead poisoning action against the former owner of a home. <em>Stokes, </em>141 Md.App. at 216, 784 A.2d 1142. The current property owner refused the minor\u2019s request to access the property to conduct lead paint testing, and the minor filed an action against the current owner seeking an order of entry to conduct noninvasive lead-paint testing. <em>Id. </em>The trial court denied the minor\u2019s request and, on appeal to this Court, we considered whether Md. Rule 2-404 allowed for non-party production. <em>Id. </em>at 218-23, 784 A.2d 1142.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">In <em>Stokes, </em>we held \u201cthat the circuit courts have the power to order inspection of a non-party\u2019s property on a case-by-case basis through the equitable bill of discovery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223, 784 A.2d 1142. We recognized that, while the Maryland Rules do not have a specific mechanism allowing for the entry upon land of a non-party for inspection, \u201c[n]o Maryland Rule prohibits\u201d it, either. <em>Id. </em>at 225, 784 A.2d 1142. In making our determinations, we noted that \u201ca rule denying a party\u2019s right to seek an equitable bill of discovery may well violate the party\u2019s constitutional right of access to the courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted). Because testing the premises for lead paint contamination is \u201cvital\u201d to a lead poisoning suit, we held that \u201c[a]n equitable bill of discovery is the only way for appellants to obtain the information they need.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 226, 784 A.2d 1142.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Although we recognized in <em>Stokes </em>that a trial court may issue a bill of discovery under its inherent equitable power, we did not discuss how to obtain a bill of discovery or how we would review the grant or denial of one, which is the focus of this case. We do so now.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>We begin with a review of what a bill of discovery is. A bill of discovery \u201chas been a procedural tool in use for centuries\u201d and \u201cis well recognized.\u201d <em>Estate of Bochiccho v. Quinn, </em>136 Conn.App. 359, 46 A.3d 239, 241 n. 2 (2012). It is an equitable remedy that allows a litigant to obtain information that is in the exclusive possession of another person and is necessary to the establishment of the litigant\u2019s case. <em>See Meltzer v. Kushin, </em>342 Pa. 84, 20 A.2d 189, 190 (1941). The rationale behind this \u201cremedy, when used as an auxiliary process in aid of trials at law, is simplicity itself. At times, cases will not be proved, or will be proved clumsily or wastefully, if the litigant is not permitted to gather his evidence in advance____Today the remedy survives, chiefly, if not wholly, to give facility to proof.\u201d <em>Pottetti v. Clifford, </em>146 Conn. 252, 150 A.2d 207, 211 (1959) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Historically, a \u201cbill of discovery\u201d could refer to either a \u201cbill of discovery and relief\u2019 or \u201ca pure bill of discovery,\u201d but there is a distinction. Thomas E. Rosensteel, <em>Equity\u2019s Bill of Discovery, A Unique Application in the Field of Products Liability, </em>49 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 124, 125-26 (1972). The distinction is that the former is employed when a party seeks discovery along with some form of relief, while the latter is used purely to discover facts. <em>Pottetti, </em>150 A.2d at 210-11; <em>see also Carten v. Carten, </em>153 Conn. 603, 219 A.2d 711, 715 (1966) (noting that \u201cthere is no <em>ad damnum </em>claimed\u201d in pure bills of discovery). Typically, a pure bill of discovery is used \u201cto obtain evidence to be use[d] in some suit other than that in which discovery is sought.\u201d <em>Peyton v. Werhane, </em>126 Conn. 382,11 A.2d 800, 803 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">In Maryland, because a bill of discovery stems from the inherent powers of the circuit courts, there is no specific rule governing them. <em>See Stokes, </em>141 Md.App. at 223-25, 784 A.2d 1142.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, a litigant can initiate a bill of discovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>by filing a complaint, which seeks relief in the form of discovery, or by filing a request for a bill of discovery in the action for which the discovery is sought. Daniel Morman, <em>The Complaint for a Pure Bill of Discovery\u2014A Living, Breathing, Modern Day Dinosaur?, </em>78 Fl. B.J. 50, 50 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Returning to the instant case, Johnson argues that the circuit court wrongly \u201ctransform[ed] [Johnson]\u2019s pleadings\u201d into a \u201c \u2018request,\u2019 which was legal error.\u201d He avers that the court could not turn his complaint into something else \u201cin order to justify its intended end result.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We disagree with Johnson and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">In this case, Johnson filed a \u201ccomplaint to perpetuate evidence and request for a hearing[.]\u201d As a part of his complaint, Johnson pled, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-6\">3. [Johnson] seeks, through the instant Complaint, to have this Honorable Court exercise its subpoena power to prevent [Franklin] from withholding evidence relevant to <em>Trashawn Johnson, et al. v. Riggs Properties, et al. </em>To that end, [Johnson] seeks to obtain an Order allowing him to conduct non-invasive, non-destructive environmental testing of the interior and exterior of [the Property]. Maryland Rule 2-404 allows this action to perpetuate evidence. The Court of Special Appeals confirmed that this Honorable Court has the power to grant [Johnson]\u2019s requested relief through an equitable bill of discovery. <em>Charles Stokes, a minor, et al. v. 835 N. Washington Street, LLC, </em>141 Md. App. 214 [784 A.2d 1142] (2001).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>4. The evidence [Johnson] seeks to discover (the presence or absence of lead-based paint in [the Property]) is material and necessary for [Johnson] to prove his case <em>Trashawn Johnson, et al. v. Riggs Properties, et al. </em>The environmental testing will also assist medical experts in determining the extent to which [Johnson] was exposed to lead-based paint and lead-based paint dust on an ongoing basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-4\">5. ... An equitable bill of discovery is the <em>only </em>way for [Johnson] to obtain the information he requires.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">(Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">First, although Johnson cited Md. Rule 2-404 as authority, the rule does not allow this suit to continue and does not provide the requested relief. Md. Rule 2-404 allows for perpetuation of evidence before an action has been filed through deposition under Md. Rule 2-412, production of documents under Md. Rule 2-422, or mental or physical examination under Md. Rule 2-423. Md. Rule 2-404(a)(2). \u201cEvidence perpetuated in accordance with the requirements of this section may be used in any court in any action involving the same subject matter and against any person served with a notice, request, or motion in the manner provided by ... this Rule.\u201d Md. Rule 2-404(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">We held in <em>Webb v. Joyce Real Estate, Inc., </em>108 Md.App. 512, 526, 672 A.2d 660 (1996), that Md. Rule 2-422 does not authorize a circuit court to grant entry onto property owned by a nonparty. Because Md. Rule 2-404 allows perpetuation of evidence by \u201crequest for production of documents required by Rule 2-422[,]\u201d Md. Rule 2-404 does not authorize this action to perpetuate evidence, as Franklin is not a party in the companion suit. Moreover, Md. Rule 2-404 allows for perpetuation of evidence either \u201cbefore action instituted\u201d or \u201cpending appeal\u201d\u2014the action before us does not fit either of those categories. Lastly, because the evidence of lead paint would not be used \u201cagainst any person served with [the] request ... in the manner provided by ... this Rule[,]\u201d Md. Rule 2-404 would not authorize this action because Johnson has admitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>that Franklin would not be named in the companion case. It, therefore, could not be used against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Johnson, in this case through his pleading, sought a pure bill of discovery because he only began this action to discover facts, not to seek some other relief, which is not provided for in any particular Maryland Rule. <em>See Stokes, </em>141 Md.App. at 223-25, 784 A.2d 1142 (allowing for an equitable remedy of a bill of discovery, even though it is not authorized pursuant to the Maryland Rules). Although Johnson did not title his pleading a \u201ccomplaint for a pure bill of discovery,\u201d we can discern that he sought one based on his citation to <em>Stokes </em>and reference to an \u201cequitable bill of discovery\u201d as his only requested remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Even though the word \u201ccomplaint\u201d is found in the title, it is not the type of complaint contemplated by the Maryland Rules, because it is a vehicle used only for discovery and is not a cause of action, which is required in a typical complaint. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-305 (requiring that a pleading set forth \u201cthe facts necessary to constitute a cause of action\u201d). We, thus, accept that Johnson filed his complaint for the purpose of initiating a pure bill of discovery, not to institute a civil action against Franklin, even though a complaint was filed. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-101 (explaining that a \u201ccivil action is commenced by filing a complaint\u201d). Indeed, it is more akin to,a request because Johnson sought discovery by inspection. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-422 (noting that inspection is requested by the parties). Although we said that Md. Rule 2-422 would not give Johnson relief, it is the closest form of discovery to a pure bill of discovery contained in the Maryland Rules. <em>See id. </em>(allowing for inspection of property of parties). This resolves whether Johnson\u2019s complaint for an equitable bill of discovery was a true \u201ccomplaint,\u201d or could be termed something else, but it does not resolve whether summary judgment is an appropriate resolution or reveal what our standard of review should be.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Johnson avers that the circuit court erred by denying him summary judgment and denying his complaint without granting Franklin \u201csummary judgment, formally[.]\u201d In arguing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>that summary judgment was an appropriate disposition of this case, Johnson relies on Franklin\u2019s failure to respond to his discovery requests that he propounded on Franklin after initiating this suit. Because of Franklin\u2019s failure to respond to his requests for admissions, Johnson argues that there was no genuine dispute of material fact because, pursuant to Md. Rule 2-424(b), all of the facts at issue were admitted by Franklin. Johnson contends that, although no evidentiary hearing was held, he met his burden of proof because of the admissions of Franklin.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">We return to the history of a pure bill of discovery for guidance. As we said in <em>Stokes, </em>Maryland does not have a \u201cprovision allowing for non-party ... inspection!!,]\u201d and a pure bill of discovery is an equitable remedy. <em>Stokes, </em>141 Md.App. at 219, 223, 784 A.2d 1142 (footnote omitted). As we opined previously, a pure bill of discovery seeks only to discover facts. <em>See Pottetti, </em>150 A.2d at 210-11. Notably, \u201c[a]n equitable bill of discovery is the only way for [Johnson] to obtain the information [he] need[s].\u201d <em>Stokes, </em>141 Md.App. at 226, 784 A.2d 1142; <em>see also </em>Md. Rule 2-401, <em>et seq. </em>(allowing for discovery in a civil action).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">As we said in <em>Stokes:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">The parties are entitled to an evidentiary hearing at which appellants must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) what they seek to discover is material and necessary for proof of the other action already brought; (2) appellants have no other adequate means of obtaining discovery of the essential information; (3) appellants\u2019 right of access to the premises outweighs the privacy rights of both the owner and the occupants of the property; and (4) issuance of an equitable bill of discovery will not impose an unreasonable hardship upon the owner or upon any occupant of the property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-8\"><em>Stokes, </em>141 Md.App. at 226-28, 784 A.2d 1142 (citations and footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">Resultantly, we agree with the circuit court\u2019s ruling that \u201cthis type of pleading is not appropriate for Summary Judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>ment ..., just sort of a grant or den[ial] of the petition or request.\u201d Under <em>Stokes, </em>the parties are entitled to an eviden-tiary hearing on the facts of the case. <em>Stokes, </em>141 Md.App. at 228, 784 A.2d 1142. In this case, Franklin did not waive her right to a hearing, and she was present, for the hearing, at which time she contested the granting of Johnson\u2019s request. Where, as here, the determination cannot be made as a matter of law, the entry of a summary judgment is inappropriate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Finally, despite Johnson\u2019s claim, an evidentiary hearing did take place. At the hearing, the circuit court examined Franklin, who appeared <em>pro se:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-6\">THE COURT: ... And so tell the Court if you will, how you feel about having someone come into your house and do this test, even though they are saying that it is going to be short and quick.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-7\">MS. FRANKLIN: I said\u2014I said no, because I had already had it done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-8\">THE COURT: Mm-hmm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-9\">MS. FRANKLIN: So there\u2019s no reason. If the State and the Federal government accept it, why can\u2019t they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-10\">THE COURT: Okay. And in terms of them coming into your house, you just don\u2019t want them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-11\">MS. FRANKLIN: Right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-12\">The court held an evidentiary hearing because it accepted evidence in the form of testimony by Franklin. Thus, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>court complied with the requirement of an evidentiary hearing of <em>Stokes </em>by doing more than only hearing arguments.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Because we have settled what a bill of discovery is and how you can obtain one, we turn now to what is the proper standard of review. Johnson argues that we should review the case <em>de novo </em>because the case was disposed of by summary judgment. However, as we have discussed, Johnson\u2019s bill of discovery was not disposed of by summary judgment; accordingly, we decline to accept Johnson\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Notably, \u201c[p]ure bills of discovery are favored in equity[.]\u201d <em>Peyton, </em>11 A.2d at 803. \u201c[B]ecause a pure bill of discovery is favored in equity, it should be granted unless there is some well founded objection against the exercise of the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>Estate of Bochicchio, </em>46 A.3d at 241 n. 2; <em>see also Peyton, </em>11 A.2d at 803 (pure bills of discovery \u201care sustained in all cases\u201d); <em>Pottetti, </em>150 A.2d at 211 (\u201cIn passing upon the bill, the court exercises a discretionary power\u201d).

Finally, because no party offered the requests for admissions into evidence, they were not a part of the record of the evidentiary hearing. <em>See </em>Md.
