Okoro was granted a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d), who found that Okoro had violated the Act, that his violations were willful and had the potential for harm to human safety, and that the Department\u2019s penalty of $37,500 was appropriate. Okoro petitioned for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, which reversed and remanded the ALJ\u2019s decision with instructions for the parties to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>argue the appropriate penalties without considering the violations\u2019 potential for harm to human safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">On remand, the ALJ refused to allow\" Okoro to present additional evidence, and heard argument only on whether Okoro\u2019s violations were willful. The ALJ issued a revised decision, finding that Okoro\u2019s violations were willful, and assessing a penalty of $25,650. Okoro filed a second petition for judicial review in the circuit court, which affirmed the revised decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Okoro presents three questions for our review, which we have rephrased as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">1. Do substantial evidence and applicable law support the ALJ\u2019s finding that Okoro\u2019s violations were willful?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">2. Did the ALJ err by refusing to allow Okoro to argue the issue of willfulness at the remand hearing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-8\">3. Did the ALJ err by excluding the additional testimony proffered by Okoro regarding the lead risk reduction certificate for the Park Avenue property at the remand hearing?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">We answer the first question in the affirmative and the second and third questions in the negative. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">Okoro is the owner of two residential rental properties in Baltimore, Maryland: (1) 105 West Saratoga Street, Unit 2 (\u201cthe Saratoga Street property\u201d), and (2) 1408 Park Avenue, Unit 1 (\u201cthe Park Avenue property\u201d). Both properties were constructed before 1950, and thus are considered \u201caffected properties\u201d subject to the registration and lead risk reduction certification requirements under the Act. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1996, 2013), \u00a7\u00a7 6-801, -811, -812, -815 of Environment Article (\u201cEnv\u2019t\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-12\">In May of 2010, Kurt Kroncke moved into the Saratoga Street property. The Saratoga Street property was not registered as an \u201caffected property,\u201d nor was a lead risk reduction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>certificate (\u201ccertificate\u201d) submitted to the Department upon the change of occupancy, as required by the Act. On August 10, 2011, Whitney Blomquist moved into the Park Avenue property. The Park Avenue property was initially registered as an \u201caffected property\u201d on May 2, 2004, but the registration had not been renewed as of Blomquist\u2019s move-in, nor was a certificate submitted to the Department upon the change of occupancy, as required by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">On August 15, 2011, Blomquist reported to the Department that the Park Avenue property did not have a valid certificate, and the Department opened an investigation into all of Okoro\u2019s rental properties. After Okoro was informed of Blomquist\u2019s complaint in August 2011, he arranged for both properties to be inspected on October 31, 2011. Okoro filed a certificate for the Saratoga Street property on October 31, 2011, but the Park Avenue property needed remedial work before a certificate could be issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">On March 15, 2012, the Department filed an Administrative Complaint, Order and Penalty (\u201cAdministrative Complaint\u201d) against Okoro for various violations of the Act. The Administrative Complaint alleged that Okoro (1) failed to register or renew the registration of the Park Avenue and Saratoga Street properties; (2) failed to bring both properties into compliance with the lead risk reduction standard; and (3) failed to obtain certificates for both properties. The Administrative Complaint ordered Okoro to bring all of his properties into compliance with the Act, and sought a $2,500 penalty for the registration violations, and a $35,000 penalty for the risk reduction violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">On March 29, 2012, Okoro requested a hearing before the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) to contest the Administrative Complaint. Okoro registered the Park Avenue property and the Saratoga Street property as \u201caffected properties\u201d on April 8, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">On June 12, 2012, a hearing was held before an ALJ, at which Okoro appeared <em>pro se. </em>At the outset of the hearing, Okoro moved to dismiss the Administrative Complaint on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>grounds that he was in compliance with the Act. The Department conceded that the Saratoga Street property was \u201cbrought into compliance\u201d with the risk reduction requirements as of the date of the filing of the Administrative Complaint, but alleged that \u201cthere was a significant period of time that that property was in violation.\u201d In addition, the Department stated that the Park Avenue property remained in violation of the risk reduction requirements as of the date of the hearing, because there was no valid certificate on file with the Department. The ALJ denied the motion to dismiss, and both sides called witnesses and presented evidence on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">In a decision issued on September 7, 2012, the ALJ determined: (1) Okoro violated the Act\u2019s registration and risk reduction certification requirements for both properties; (2) Okoro violated the Act\u2019s 100% compliance requirement; and (3) the Department\u2019s $37,500 penalty was reasonable and within its statutory authority. To decide whether the Department\u2019s penalty was appropriate, the ALJ considered eight factors, as required by the Act, and found that two factors were present: (1) Okoro\u2019s violations were willful, because he failed to exercise reasonable care in remedying the certification violation for the Park Avenue property, and provided no explanation for the other violations; and (2) Okoro\u2019s violations had the potential for harm to human safety, because Blom-quist was a woman of child-bearing age. The ALJ ordered Okoro to pay the $37,500 penalty requested by the Department and bring the Park Avenue property into compliance with the Act\u2019s lead risk reduction requirements within thirty days.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">On September 21, 2012, Okoro, now represented by counsel, filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. In his memorandum filed on December 18, 2012, Okoro challenged (1) the ALJ\u2019s findings that Okoro had violated the Act\u2019s registration and certification requirements, that Okoro\u2019s violations were \u201cwillful,\u201d and that the violations had the potential for harm to human safety, (2) the ALJ\u2019s impartiality, and (3) the ALJ\u2019s characterization of the Park <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Avenue property\u2019s certificate as \u201cundated.\u201d The Department filed an Answering Memorandum on January 18, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">On March 25, 2013, the circuit court held a hearing and issued an order holding that the Department failed to establish that Blomquist was a \u201cperson at risk\u201d as defined by the Act, because the Department never proved that Blomquist was pregnant and spent at least twenty-four hours per week in the Park Avenue property. The court (1) reversed and remanded the agency\u2019s decision \u201cinsofar as it assesses penalties against [Okoro],\u201d (2) ordered that the parties be \u201cgranted an opportunity to argue the issue of imposition of penalties without considering the \u2018potential for harm to human health or safety\u2019 factor,\u201d and (3) ordered the ALJ to make a determination of the imposition of penalties without considering the \u201cpotential for harm to human health or safety\u201d factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">On October 9, 2013, the ALJ held a remand hearing \u201cto give the parties an opportunity to argue the issue of imposition of penalties.\u201d At the outset of the hearing, the ALJ heard argument on the Department\u2019s motion to quash Okoro\u2019s request for a subpoena of a Department employee (\u201cOkoro\u2019s witness\u201d) to rebut the Department\u2019s testimony at the June 12, 2012 hearing regarding the status of Okoro\u2019s certificates on file with the Department. The ALJ granted the Department\u2019s motion to quash on the grounds that the circuit court\u2019s remand order did not provide that additional evidence could be taken at the remand hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">On the merits, the Department argued that the ALJ should uphold its original penalty of $37,500, because Okoro\u2019s violations were willful. Okoro responded that his violations were not willful under Maryland law, because \u201che did not know of the violations\u201d and he \u201chad taken reasonable efforts\u201d to remedy the violations as soon as he was made aware of them. Okoro reiterated his argument that the Department misled the ALJ at the previous hearing regarding the status of Okoro\u2019s certificates.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Two days after the hearing, Okoro filed a motion for mistrial on the ground, among others, that the ALJ erred in failing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>to allow Okoro\u2019s witness to testify at the remand hearing. This motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">On October 31, 2013, the ALJ issued a Revised Decision on Remand (the \u201cRevised Decision\u201d), ordering Okoro to pay a penalty of $25,650 and bring the Park Avenue property into compliance with the Act. The ALJ did not alter her original findings and discussion \u201cexcept as necessary to comply with the remand order.\u201d The ALJ, however, did reduce the total amount of the penalty from $37,500 to $25,650.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Okoro filed a second petition for judicial review in the circuit court on November 18, 2013. The Department filed a response to Okoro\u2019s petition on November 25, 2013. Okoro filed a memorandum with the circuit court on February 18, 2014, arguing that the ALJ erred in (1) stating that she was limited on remand to consider argument on the potential for harm to human health and safety factor only, and (2) not allowing Okoro\u2019s witness to testify to rebut the Department\u2019s testimony at the June 12, 2012 hearing. The Department filed an Answering Memorandum on March 19, 2014, arguing that the ALJ\u2019s Revised Decision \u201cwas based upon a proper application of the law, was supported by substantial evidence and complied with [the circuit court\u2019s] Order by excluding the \u2018potential harm to human health\u2019 penalty factor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The circuit court held a hearing on Okoro\u2019s second petition for judicial review on April 23, 2014. On May 5, 2014, the court issued a Memorandum and Order affirming the ALJ\u2019s Revised Decision. On May 8, 2014, Okoro filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">In reviewing an administrative decision, \u201c[t]his Court looks through the circuit court\u2019s decision and evaluates the decision of the agency.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Md. Dep\u2019t of the Env\u2019t, </em>217 Md. App. 271, 283, 92 A.3d 579 (2014) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Such review is limited to deciding \u201cif there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and ... if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>John A. v. Bd. of Educ. for Howard Cnty., </em>400 Md. 363, 381, 929 A.2d 136 (2007). \u201cThe substantial evidence test evaluates whether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached.\u201d <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Lipella, </em>427 Md. 455, 467, 48 A.3d 803 (2012) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The Court of Appeals has stated that \u201c[e]ven with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency. Thus, an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts.\u201d <em>Md. Aviation Admin. v. Noland, </em>386 Md. 556, 572, 873 A.2d 1145 (2005) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">Furthermore, an agency \u201chas broad latitude in fashioning sanctions within legislatively designated limits.\u201d <em>Neutron Products, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t Of The Env\u2019t, </em>166 Md.App. 549, 584, 890 A.2d 858, <em>cert. denied, </em>392 Md. 726, 898 A.2d 1005 (2006). Therefore, \u201c[a] reviewing court is not authorized to overturn a lawful and authorized sanction unless the disproportionality [of the sanction] or abuse of discretion was so extreme and egregious that the reviewing court can properly deem the decision to be arbitrary and capricious.\u201d <em>Noland, </em>386 Md. at 581, 873 A.2d 1145 (brackets in original) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">\n<em>I. \u201cWillfulness\u201d Factor</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">First, Okoro argues that the ALJ erred in finding that Okoro\u2019s violations were willful, because \u201cwillfulness\u201d under Maryland law requires an \u201cintentional violation or deliberate intention or reckless disregard with an intent to cause harm,\u201d not merely a lack of knowledge of the law. According to Okoro, the ALJ\u2019s determination that Okoro\u2019s violations were willful was unsupported by evidence in the record, because the ALJ stated in her decision that she accepted as credible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Okoro\u2019s testimony that he made efforts to comply with the Act\u2019s requirements, and that she erroneously ignored the evidence that Okoro was unaware of the violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">The Department responds that the ALJ\u2019s findings concerning Okoro\u2019s willfulness were supported by substantial evidence and were legally correct. According to the Department, willfulness in the environmental enforcement context \u201cis considered in terms of the extent to which the existence of the violation was known but uncorrected by the violator, and the extent to which the violator exercised reasonable care.\u201d The Department contends that, because Okoro was aware of his obligations under the Act, substantial evidence demonstrated that Okoro did not exercise reasonable care in ensuring that he met such obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Under the Act, rental property owners must annually register their \u201caffected properties\u201d (properties constructed before 1950) with the Department, and update those registrations and satisfy lead risk reduction standards with every change in occupancy. <em>See </em>Env\u2019t \u00a7\u00a7 6-801, -811, -812, -815. The Act requires an owner to ensure that 100% of his affected properties satisfy these risk reduction standards by filing a current certificate of compliance for each affected property with the Department. Env\u2019t \u00a7 6-817.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The Department may impose a monetary penalty for any violation of the registration and certification requirements described above; each day a violation occurs constitutes a separate violation. Env\u2019t \u00a7\u00a7 6-849, 7-266(b)(3). The Department may impose a maximum penalty of (1) $20 per day for failure to register (or renew registration of) an affected property, and (2) $500 per day for all other violations. Env\u2019t \u00a7 6-849(a), -850(a), 7-266. The penalty may not exceed $25,000 for each violation, or $100,000 in total. Env\u2019t \u00a7 7-266(b)(2)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">In evaluating the appropriateness of a monetary penalty for a violation, the following eight factors must be considered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">1. The willfulness of the violation, the extent to which the existence of the violation was known to but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>uncorrected by the violator, and the extent to which the violator exercised reasonable care;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-4\">2. Any actual harm to the environment or to human health, including injury to or impairment of the use of the waters of this State or the natural resources of this State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">3. The cost of cleanup and the cost of restoration of natural resources;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">4. The nature and degree of injury to or interference with general welfare, health, and property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">5. The extent to which the location of the violation, including location near waters of this State or areas of human population, creates the potential for harm to the environment or to human health or safety;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">6. The available technology and economic reasonableness of controlling, reducing, or eliminating the violation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-9\">7. The degree of hazard posed by the particular waste material or materials involved; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-10\">8. The extent to which the current violation is part of a recurrent pattern of the same or similar type of violation committed by the violator.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">Env\u2019t \u00a7 7\u2014266(b)(2)(ii) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-12\">We agree with the Department that \u201c[i]n the context of an environmental enforcement action, \u2018the willfulness of a violation\u2019 of an order is considered in terms of \u2018the extent to which the existence of the violation was known but uncorrected by the violator, and the extent to which the violator exercised reasonable care.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gertz v. Md. Dep\u2019t of the Env\u2019t, </em>199 Md.App. 413, 430-31, 23 A.3d 236 (quoting Env\u2019t \u00a7 9-342(b)(2)(ii)(l), the water pollution control statute, which contains identical language regarding \u201cwillfulness\u201d as a factor to consider before assessing a penalty), <em>cert. denied, </em>423 Md. 451, 31 A.3d 919 (2011); <em>see also Am. Recovery Co., Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene, </em>306 Md. 12, 21, 506 A.2d 1171 (1986) (upholding a penalty in which the agency found that the appellant\u2019s environmental violation satisfied the \u201cwillfulness\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>factor, because the \u201chearing examiner expressly found that the company has been on notice about specific violations and has not remedied them\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The statute requires the ALJ to consider both \u201cthe extent to which the existence of the violation was known to but uncorrected by the violator, and the extent to which the violator exercised reasonable care,\u201d before finding that a violation was willful. Env\u2019t \u00a7 7-266(a)(b)(2)(ii)(l). The ALJ need not, however, <em>find </em>both elements to be present to determine willfulness; he or she simply must <em>consider </em>both parts of the \u201cwillfulness\u201d definition and make appropriate findings thereunder. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Okoro\u2019s violations were willful. The Revised Decision stated the following on willfulness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-5\">[The Department] presented evidence that [Okoro] was aware of the registration and certification requirements, because he had complied with those requirements for other properties he owned. [Okoro] did not deny that at the times relevant to this case, he knew about the registration and certification requirements. He testified that since 2006, he used an inspector, Brian Maclver, to perform lead inspections and to submit certifications to [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Department], and that he relied upon a property manager, Jazma Robinson, to ensure that Mr. Maclver carried out these duties. [Okoro] stated that he tried to do the right thing, and that when he was made aware of the violations, he \u201cjumped\u201d to fix them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-4\">[Okoro] provided no explanation for the violations of the registration requirements, or the violation of the certification requirement for the Saratoga Street [property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-5\">As to the certification for the Park Avenue [p]roperty, [Okoro] testified as follows: He first learned of a problem in August 2011, and he told Ms. Robinson to take care of it. In October 2011, Mr. Maclver inspected the property but it did not pass because it required some work on the outside. After [Okoro] fixed the windowsills, Mr. Maclver \u201cpassed\u201d the unit but did not complete a certification because of a dispute about his payment. There were several e-mail exchanges, and as of January 2012, [Okoro] believed the certification had been taken care of by Mr. Maclver. In March 2012, [Okoro] received the [Administrative] Complaint. He contacted Mr. Maclver, who raised concerns about changes in [the Department\u2019s] rules that might require a new inspection. In April 2012, Mr. Maclver told [Okoro] after discussions with [a Department] employee, he concluded that the prior inspection was sufficient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">[Okoro] provided records of e-mail correspondence with Mr. Maclver, showing that as of May 8, 2012, the certification had not yet been completed. [Okoro] also provided a copy of a certification by Mr. Maclver for the Park Avenue [property, with no inspection date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">[A Department employee] testified that the certification without an inspection date had been submitted by the inspector to [the Department] with a notation \u201cVOID\u201d written across it. She stated that because of this notation, and because the certification had no inspection date and no supporting documents, it was not considered valid by [the Department].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>I accepted [Okoro\u2019s] testimony as credible evidence of his efforts to comply with the certification requirement for the Park Avenue [p]roperty. It is clear, however, that over a prolonged period of time, continuing to the date of the hearing, [Okoro] failed to accept the responsibility for ensuring that the certification requirement was met. He did not exercise reasonable care. [Okoro] also presented no explanation for the other violations charged in this case. Willfulness in these violations has been shown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">(Emphasis added) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">As indicated above, the ALJ found that Okoro\u2019s violations were willful, because he knew the law and failed to exercise reasonable care to ensure his compliance with the law. The ALJ heard testimony that Okoro was aware of the registration and certification requirements, because he had complied with these requirements for his other properties. Moreover, the Department had accredited Okoro \u201cto perform the work necessary to bring affected properties into compliance.\u201d Thus, with substantial evidence of Okoro\u2019s knowledge of the law, the issue before us centers on the existence of substantial evidence, <em>vel non, </em>that Okoro failed to exercise reasonable care in ensuring that the subject properties were in compliance with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">\n<em>A. Registration Requirements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A1\">Okoro testified that he had employed someone to register his properties, but that he \u201cpersonally registered these properties\u201d after learning of the registration violations. It is undisputed that new tenants moved into the Saratoga Street property in May 2010 and in the Park Avenue property in August 2011, thus triggering the requirements of registration (or re-registration). It is also undisputed that neither property was registered until April 8, 2012. Okoro did not present any explanation for the twenty-three month delay in registering the Saratoga Street property and the eight-month delay in registering the Park Avenue property, other than he delegated that responsibility to his property manager. In our view, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Okoro\u2019s delegation to his property manager of the responsibility to comply with the registration requirements of the Act without also ensuring such compliance did not constitute the exercise of reasonable care where the lack of compliance continued over a prolonged period of time. As a result, there is substantial evidence in the record that Okoro failed to exercise reasonable care to ensure the properties satisfied the registration requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">\n<em>B. Certification Requirements</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A8l\">1. Saratoga Street Property</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Both Okoro and the Department presented evidence that the Saratoga Street property was brought into compliance with the certification requirements on October 31, 2011. Oko-ro, however, did not provide any explanation for his failure to have the Saratoga Street property comply with the certification requirements from the change in occupancy in May 2010 to October 31, 2011, other than the delegation of that responsibility to his property manager. As previously stated, Okoro\u2019s delegation to his property manager of the responsibility to comply with the certification requirements of the Act without also ensuring such compliance did not constitute the exercise of reasonable care where the lack of compliance continued over a prolonged period of time. As a result, there is substantial evidence that Okoro failed to exercise reasonable care to ensure that the Saratoga Street property was brought into compliance with the certification requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">2. Park Avenue Property</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Okoro did make efforts to ensure that the Park Avenue property was in compliance with the certification requirements, but there is substantial evidence that he did not exercise reasonable care in remedying a known violation. The ALJ credited Okoro for those efforts by assessing a lower monthly penalty for the certification violation at the Park Avenue property than she did for the certification violation at the Saratoga Street property. Both Okoro and the Department presented evidence that the Park Avenue property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>needed further work to bring it into compliance with the certification requirements. Okoro testified that he attempted to bring the Park Avenue property into compliance by delegating this task to his property manager, and that Okoro thought\u2014but did not verify with the Department\u2014that the Park Avenue property was in compliance by December 2011 or January 2012. The ALJ found that Okoro failed to use reasonable care in remedying the Park Avenue property violation, because he \u201cfailed to accept the responsibility for ensuring that the certification requirement was met.\u201d Okoro testified that he took the inspector at his word that the certificate was filed, and that the inspector was \u201cprocrastinating\u201d in filing the Park Avenue property\u2019s certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">Even if Okoro believed that the inspector had taken care of the certification requirements for the Park Avenue property, we agree that Okoro failed to use reasonable care by not following up with the Department to ensure that the property was in compliance with the Act. Given the length of time that passed between when Okoro was put on notice of the Park Avenue property violations in August 2011, and the date of the hearing in June 2012, when the Park Avenue property was still not in compliance, we agree that Okoro\u2019s mere belief that he was in compliance is an insufficient exercise of reasonable care under the Act. Furthermore, Okoro\u2019s belief that he was in compliance in March 2012, when he received by fax a copy of a certificate of compliance, is unreasonable, because his inspector did not fill in a date of inspection on the certificate; the certificate thus was clearly invalid. Accordingly, there is substantial evidence in the record to support the ALJ\u2019s finding that Okoro failed to exercise reasonable care in remedying the known violation at the Park Avenue property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>Finally, it is important to note that if we adopt Okoro\u2019s standard of reasonable care and conclude that his violations were not willful because he delegated the task of compliance to his property manager, rental property owners would escape any penalty under the Act as long as their property managers never informed them of their noncompliance. Such interpretation would render the statute\u2019s enforcement scheme ineffective, because rental property owners, not their managers, are held responsible under the Act for ensuring compliance. <em>See </em>Env\u2019t \u00a7\u00a7 6-801, -811, -812, -815, -817.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">\n<em>II. \u2018Willfulness\u201d Argument at Remand Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Next, Okoro contends that the ALJ erred in not allowing him to argue the issue of willfulness at the remand hearing on October 9, 2013. According to Okoro, the ALJ \u201crefused to hear argument on the question of willfulness, determining that this issue was not part of the argument on penalties and one that she would not \u2018reopen.\u2019 \u201d Okoro argues that willfulness \u201cwas still relevant because it was the only statutory penalty factor remaining and therefore directly relevant to the penalty hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The Department responds that both parties were afforded an opportunity to present argument on Okoro\u2019s willfulness at the remand hearing on October 9, 2013. According to the Department, the claim that the ALJ refused to hear argument on this issue at the remand hearing \u201cis belied by eight pages of transcript, reflecting that the majority of [ ] Okoro\u2019s argument focused on willfulness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">We disagree with Okoro\u2019s contention that the ALJ did not allow him to argue the issue of willfulness at the remand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>hearing. Okoro is correct that the remand hearing\u2019s transcript reveals that the ALJ stated the following: \u201cIt is my intention to do what the Court orders, to take no evidence today, and to hear argument, first from [the Department], then from [Okoro], then back from [the Department], on the subject of potential for harm to human health and safety, excluding the Blomquist factors.\u201d Okoro interprets this statement to mean that the ALJ did not allow Okoro to argue the issue of willfulness at the remand hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">Okoro\u2019s interpretation cannot stand, however, because both of the parties\u2019 arguments at the remand hearing focused exclusively on willfulness, with neither side presenting any argument \u201con the subject of potential for harm to human safety.\u201d For example, the Department began its argument by stating that \u201cbased on the penalty factor of willfulness alone, it\u2019s the Department\u2019s position that the penalty assessment of $37,500 should not be altered.\u201d The Department argued that \u201cwillfulness would be the most egregious penalty factor,\u201d and then cited two cases discussing the penalty factors. The Department concluded its argument by stating that \u201cbased on [the ALJ\u2019s] factual findings, dates of non-compliance, the amount of maximum penalty that the Department is able to assess for failing to register and failing to obtain certificates, coupled with the assessment of the penalty factors, [the ALJ\u2019s] finding that the violations were willful, I believe is more than enough to uphold the entire ... $37,500 penalty.\u201d Similarly, Okoro began his argument by defining willfulness \u201cas somebody knowing about a violation or intentionally violating.\u201d Then, Okoro argued that there was no evidence in the record to support a finding that Okoro\u2019s violations were willful.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">According to the transcript, the ALJ did state that she would only hear argument \u201con the subject of potential for harm to human health and safety, excluding the Blomquist factors.\u201d We believe, however, that the ALJ\u2019s comment was either a misstatement or an error in the transcript. The ALJ read from the circuit court order twice, stating that \u201cthat the parties are hereby granted an opportunity to argue the issue of imposition of penalties <em>without considering the potential for </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number><em>harm to human health and safety factor </em>listed under Section 6-819(a)(3)(iv) as it relates to Blomquist.\u201d (Emphasis added) Thus, the ALJ clearly understood that she was permitted to hear argument on the willfulness factor, and did in fact hear such argument. Accordingly, Okoro\u2019s contention that the ALJ did not permit him to argue willfulness at the remand hearing is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\n<em>III. Additional Testimony at Remand Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"At1\">Finally, Okoro argues that the circuit court erred in failing to reverse the ALJ\u2019s decision to exclude his proffered additional testimony at the remand hearing. Specifically, according to Okoro, the ALJ erred in not allowing Okoro\u2019s witness to testify at the remand hearing, because the witness\u2019s testimony regarding the status of his certificates on file with the Department was \u201cdirectly relevant to the issue of willfulness.\u201d Okoro contends that his witness\u2019s testimony would have \u201ccontradict[ed] the evidence [the Department] submitted\u201d regarding Okoro\u2019s willfulness at the June 12, 2012 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The Department responds that the ALJ did not err in refusing to permit Okoro\u2019s witness to testify at the remand hearing. The Department contends that such testimony \u201cwould have provided only factual information\u201d regarding Okoro\u2019s certifications, which \u201cwould have been inconsistent with the Remand Order by opening up the case for additional evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">At the remand hearing on October 9, 2013, the ALJ was bound by the circuit court\u2019s March 25, 2013 order (the \u201cRemand Order\u201d). The circuit court reviewed its Remand Order in its October 31, 2013 Memorandum and Order when it found that the ALJ committed no error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-7\">At the remand hearing, [Okoro] wished to introduce additional testimony said to relate to the willfulness factor which was already addressed by the ALJ\u2019s findings. Consistent with the direction of the remand order, the parties were provided the opportunity to argue the penalties to be imposed, based on existing evidence and excluding reference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>to potential harm. [The circuit court\u2019s] order on remand did not instruct or require further fact-finding on the penalty issue. Thus, it was appropriate for the OAH to restrict the hearing to argument on the appropriateness of the penalty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">In other words, whether the ALJ erred at the remand hearing depends upon the scope of the Remand Order, because the ALJ was bound by such order. We agree with the circuit court that the ALJ complied with the Remand Order when she refused to allow Okoro to present new evidence at the remand hearing, because the Remand Order did not authorize or require new evidence. In the instant appeal, Okoro does not challenge the Remand Order itself, assuming such challenge is permitted,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and thus we cannot reach any issue relating to the limitations placed by the Remand Order on the ALJ at the remand hearing. Accordingly, the ALJ did not err in excluding the additional testimony offered by Okoro at the remand hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b231-6\">. Okoro relies heavily on <em>Reisch v. State, </em>107 Md.App. 464, 482, 668 A.2d 970 (1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>342 Md. 332, 675 A.2d 993 (1996), claiming that \"willfulness\u201d is defined as an act of \u201cintentional violation\u201d or \u201cdeliberate intention or reckless disregard with an intent to cause harm.\u201d <em>Reisch </em>is clearly distinguishable from the instant case, both factually and legally. <em>Reisch </em>is a criminal case in which the issue was whether the appellant\u2019s failure to obtain a home improvement license was a \"willful\u201d violation of the Maryland Home Improvement Law, Md.Code 1957, Art. 56, \u00a7\u00a7 261, 267. <em>Id. </em>at 466, 481, 668 A.2d 970. In determining the definition of the term \"willful,\u201d we observed that \u201cin <em>Ewell v. State, </em>207 Md. 288, 299, 114 A.2d 66 (1955), the Court of Appeals said that <em>'[t]he term \u2018\u2018willfully\u201d in criminal statutes </em>... characterize^] an act done with deliberate intention for which there is no reasonable excuse....\u2019 \u201d <em>Reisch, </em>107 Md.App. at 481, 668 A.2d 970 (alterations in original) (emphasis added). Here, on the other hand, the ALJ found that Okoro violated the Act, and ordered him to pay a civil administrative penalty in accordance with Env't \u00a7\u00a7 6-849(a), -850(a), 7-266(b)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b235-5\">. We also observe that the ALJ was authorized to assess a penalty of up to $20 per day for the registration violations, and $500 per day for the certification violations, as long as the total penalty did not exceed $100,000. Env\u2019t \u00a7\u00a7 6-849, -850, 7-266. The ALJ imposed a penalty of $2,500 for the registration violations, $1,000 per month for the certification violation at the Saratoga Street property, and $500 per month for the certification violation at the Park Avenue property. These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>penalties are clearly within the agency\u2019s discretion, because they fall well below the maximum penalties allowed under the Act. <em>See Neutron Products, Inc. v. Dep't Of The Env\u2019t, </em>166 Md.App. 549, 593, 890 A.2d 858 (upholding a penalty of $40,700 for 3,626 violations, even though the Department did not assign a particular penalty amount for each violation, because the penalty did not exceed the statutory cap for each violation or for the aggregate penalty), <em>cert. denied, </em>392 Md. 726, 898 A.2d 1005 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b239-6\">. Okoro did not note an appeal to this Court from the Remand Order, which is an appealable order. <em>See Metro Maint. Sys. South, Inc. v. Milburn, </em>442 Md. 289, 304, 112 A.3d 429 (2015) (\"In sum, a remand after a circuit court has conducted judicial review that precludes the parties from further contesting or defending the validity of the agency\u2019s decision in that court\u2014and leaves nothing further for the court to do\u2014 is a final judgment.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
