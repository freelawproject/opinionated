One of the victims, Charlene Williams, sued Fidelity First, which was found liable under a theory of <em>respondeat superior </em>and ordered to pay damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Fidelity First then filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County against Mr. Fox and another individual, seeking indemnification.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It alleged that \u201cthe fraudulent mortgage rescue scheme scam\u201d perpetrated by Mr. Fox was within the scope of his employment with Fidelity First, and Mr. Fox and the other individual were \u201csolely responsible to Fidelity First for any and all damages imposed by the jury on Fidelity First or, in the alternative, are joint tortfeasors.\u201d Mr. Fox argued that the claims for indemnification and contribution were discharged in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of Fidelity First. It found that, because the claim against Mr. Fox was based on fraud, it was nondischargeable in bankruptcy. Accordingly, it ordered judgment in favor of Fidelity First and against Mr. Fox and another employee for indemnification and contribution in the amount of $340,583.98, plus costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">On appeal, Mr. Fox presents the following questions for our review, which we have rephrased as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-10\">1. Did the circuit court err in granting summary judgment in favor of Fidelity First where Mr. Fox previously received a discharge in a no-asset Chapter 7 bankruptcy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>case, and no determination was made that such claim was nondischargeable under the Bankruptcy Code?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-4\">2. Did the circuit court err in granting summary judgment on Fidelity First\u2019s indemnification claim where the jury found Fidelity First negligent, and the record reflected a dispute of material fact whether Fidelity First\u2019s conduct was passive?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">The Initial Litigation</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">The factual background underlying this appeal was set forth by this Court in the appeal from the initial tort action. <em>Fidelity First Home Mort. Co. v. Williams, </em>208 Md.App. 180, 56 A.3d 501 (2012). We shall reiterate only those facts necessary to resolve this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">Ms. Williams sued Fidelity First, Mr. Fox, and James Dan, alleging that Mr. Fox and Mr. Dan had engaged in a fraudulent foreclosure rescue scheme that caused her to lose title to, and be deprived of, the equity in her home. <em>Id. </em>at 183, 56 A.3d 501. She alleged that Fidelity First, Mr. Fox\u2019s employer, was vicariously liable for fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, and violations of the Protection of Homeowners in Foreclosure Act. <em>Id. </em>Ms. Williams subsequently dismissed her claims against Mr. Fox and Mr. Dan and proceeded solely against Fidelity First, asserting that Mr. Fox and Mr. Dan were acting within the scope of their employment, and Fidelity First was vicariously liable on the basis of <em>respondeat superior. Id. </em>at 184, 56 A.3d 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">At trial, the evidence showed that Mr. Fox was hired as a loan officer for Fidelity First, a mortgage broker. He became an excellent producer and was rewarded with higher commission rates. <em>Id. </em>at 186, 56 A.3d 501. On at least three occasions, however, he was caught forging documents. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>was reprimanded and suspended, but he was not terminated. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">The foreclosure rescue scheme began in 2006. <em>Id. </em>at 187, 56 A.3d 501. Mr. Fox would identify distressed homeowners who were unable to qualify for traditional mortgage refinancing due to poor credit, but who owned equity in their homes. <em>Id. </em>Mr. Fox advised these distressed homeowners that he could assist them in refinancing their mortgages by using his or Mr. Dan\u2019s own credit. <em>Id. </em>The homeowners were convinced that they could avoid losing their homes to foreclosure by selling their homes to Mr. Fox, Mr. Dan, or a straw buyer, and remaining in the properties as tenants. <em>Id. </em>Mr. Fox and Mr. Dan promised that they would pay the mortgages on the properties for six months to a year, at which time the homeowners would be able to re-acquire title to their properties. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">To facilitate the property purchases, Mr. Fox, Mr. Dan, or a straw buyer would apply for and obtain a mortgage in their own name. <em>Id. </em>In at least three of the approximately eight transactions, Fidelity First was the mortgage broker. <em>Id. </em>The loan applications contained materially false representations with respect to the borrower\u2019s income, assets, and intent to occupy the home, among other things. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Ms. Williams was the homeowner in the third transaction, which took place in August 2006. <em>Id. </em>at 188, 56 A.3d 501. Ms. Williams had been having financial problems and ceased making her mortgage payments. <em>Id. </em>Her lender initiated foreclosure proceedings against her. <em>Id. </em>Ms. Williams received a solicitation letter from Fidelity First, advising her that she had been pre-approved for a lower interest rate and/or debt consolidation. <em>Id. </em>The letter was signed \u201cShawn Murphy Director of Customer Service Fidelity First.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 189, 56 A.3d 501. Shawn Murphy was not an employee of Fidelity First, but rather, he was a fictitious person named after a friend of Daniel Eubanks, the president and sole owner of Fidelity First. <em>Id. </em>Mr. Eubanks assigned different names to the different types of solicitation letters that Fidelity First <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>sent to potential borrowers, so when the potential borrower called, the person receiving the call would be able to identity the type of solicitation the potential borrower had received. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Ms. Williams called Fidelity First in response to the solicitation letter. <em>Id. </em>Mr. Fox took the call and informed Ms. Williams that he could assist her in refinancing the mortgage on her property. <em>Id. </em>Mr. Fox determined, however, that Ms. Williams would not qualify for a refinance loan. On May 11, 2006, Ms. Williams executed a written contract to sell the property to Mr. Dan for $225,000. <em>Id. </em>The next day, Mr. Dan applied for a mortgage loan with First National Bank of Arizona. <em>Id. </em>at 190, 56 A.3d 501. Mr. Fox was the loan officer on the application, and Fidelity First was the mortgage broker. <em>Id. </em>On his application, Mr. Dan made numerous misrepresentations about the amount of his annual income, his savings, and the real property he claimed to own. <em>Id. </em>Mr. Dan\u2019s mortgage application was approved by a loan processor for Fidelity First. <em>Id. </em>In the ordinary course of business, this mortgage application also would have been reviewed by Mr. Eubanks, but Mr. Eubanks denied having reviewed this particular file. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">On August 4, 2006, settlement occurred. <em>Id. </em>Ms. Williams signed a deed, which conveyed the property to Mr. Dan, as well as the HUD-1 settlement sheet and other related papers. <em>Id. </em>She also signed a contingent deed that would transfer ownership back to her after several years, which document was to be held by the settlement attorney for three years. <em>Id. </em>Ms. Williams believed that she was refinancing the mortgage on her house using Mr. Dan\u2019s credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">At settlement, Ms. Williams received a check for $63,893.79 in net proceeds from the sale. <em>Id. </em>at 191, 56 A.3d 501. Shortly after settlement, she endorsed that check to Mr. Dan, and he cashed it. <em>Id. </em>He gave Ms. Williams $3,000 in cash and told Ms. Williams that the remaining amount would be held in escrow to pay her mortgage. <em>Id. </em>In actuality, Mr. Dan deposited the remaining proceeds of sale into his own personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>checking account. He used $44,420.07 to pay settlement costs. <em>Id. </em>at 190-91, 56 A.3d 501. Mr. Fox and Mr. Dan split the remaining balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">In October 2006, Ms. Williams received another check in the amount of $11,804.62 from the title company, which represented a refund for overpayments made to her creditors out of the settlement proceeds. <em>Id. </em>at 191, 56 A.3d 501. Mr. Fox called Ms. Williams and convinced her to endorse the check over to him. <em>Id. </em>She did, and he gave her $3,000 in cash, telling her that the remaining amount would be deposited into escrow. <em>Id. </em>Instead, it was deposited in Mr. Fox\u2019s personal checking account. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Although Ms. Williams thought the mortgage was in her name, and she was paying the loan with the money that Mr. Fox and Mr. Dan were holding in escrow for her, the mortgage actually was in Mr. Dan\u2019s name, and Ms. Williams essentially was making rental payments. <em>Id. </em>at 192, 56 A.3d 501. Ms. Williams learned that she no longer owned the property in 2007, when she was served with an eviction notice. <em>Id. </em>She learned that she was \u201ca tenant in [her] own home,\u201d and that Mr. Dan\u2019s mortgage was in foreclosure. <em>Id. </em>Although she tried to contact the mortgage lender, its representatives would not speak to her because her name was not on the loan. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">In December 2009, Mr. Fox and Mr. Dan were indicted in federal court for wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. <em>Id. </em>Mr. Fox ultimately pleaded guilty pursuant to an agreed statement of facts. <em>Id. </em>at 193, 56 A.3d 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Ms. Williams\u2019 case against Fidelity First went to trial on February 7, 2011. Mr. Fox and Mr. Dan testified about their involvement in the foreclosure scheme and the culture at Fidelity First. <em>Id. </em>Mr. Fox described the considerable pressure for loan officers to produce, and he stated that the failure to produce would lead to termination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">Mr. Eubanks denied knowledge that Mr. Fox and/or Mr. Dan were engaging in fraud prior to the transaction with Ms. Williams. <em>Id. </em>at 196, 56 A.3d 501. He explained that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>transaction with Ms. Williams was the first of the foreclosure rescue transactions in which the loan originated through Fidelity First. Following that transaction, Mr. Fox originated two more loans through Fidelity First, but Mr. Eubanks testified that neither of those transactions were on his \u201cradar.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">The jury returned a verdict in favor of Ms. Williams. <em>Id. </em>The jury indicated on the verdict sheet that Fidelity First, acting through one or more of its agents, committed fraud, breached its fiduciary duty, and violated the Maryland Homeowner\u2019s Protection in Foreclosure Act. It also found that Fidelity First was negligent in its retention or supervision of Mr. Fox. The jury awarded Ms. Williams $70,000 in compensatory damages. It awarded $150,000 in punitive damages based on its finding that the conduct engaged in by Fidelity First, through one or more of its agents, amounted to fraud and/or breach of fiduciary duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">On appeal to this Court, Fidelity First asserted, <em>inter alia, </em>that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s findings that it negligently supervised and retained employees. <em>Id. </em>at 184-85, 56 A.3d 501. We disagreed, holding that there was evidence from which a reasonable juror could infer that Mr. Eubanks \u201ctolerated and even encouraged forgery in the pursuit of closing more loans,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 199, 56 A.3d 501, and that Mr. Eubanks was aware of the foreclosure rescue scheme transactions. <em>Id. </em>at 200, 56 A.3d 501. With respect to <em>respon-deat superior, </em>Fidelity First argued that the evidence of Mr. Fox\u2019s fraud, \u201cdid not support a reasonable inference that [he] was acting within the \u2018scope of his employment\u2019 at the time of the tortious conduct\u201d because, although his initial contact with Ms. Williams arose out of his role as loan officer, once he began participating in the foreclosure rescue scheme, he ceased acting within the scope of his employment. <em>Id. </em>at 201, 56 A.3d 501. We disagreed, holding that a reasonable juror could find that Mr. \u201cFox was acting within the scope of his employment when he perpetrated the fraudulent scheme against [Ms.] Williams.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 204, 56 A.3d 501. We explained that the jurors \u201cwere free to disbelieve\u201d Mr. Eubanks\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>testimony that he did not review the loan file in Ms. Williams\u2019 case, <em>id. </em>at 205, 56 A.3d 501, and to find that Mr. Eubanks \u201chad reason to expect that [Mr.] Fox was engaging in foreclosure rescue transactions because [Mr.] Fox had discussed his \u2018side business\u2019 with [Mr.] Eubanks and informed him that it was extremely profitable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-4\">There was ample evidence at trial that [Mr.] Eubanks encouraged competition among the loan officers to see who could achieve the highest closing rate; that loan officers who failed to produce enough loans in a given month would be subjected to ridicule; and that failure to produce ultimately would lead to termination.... Given all of this evidence, a reasonable juror could infer that [Mr.] Fox\u2019s foreclosure rescue scheme, while in furtherance of his own interests, also was incidental to the performance of his job duties and in furtherance of Fidelity First\u2019s interest in closing loans.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 206, 56 A.3d 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">The Litigation at Issue on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">On March 22, 2011, subsequent to the verdict in the underlying action, Fidelity First filed a complaint against Mr. Fox and Mr. Dan, alleging that Ms. Williams\u2019 damages were proximately caused by the acts or omissions of Mr. Fox and Mr. Dan, and therefore, Mr. Fox and Mr. Dan were \u201csolely responsible\u201d to Fidelity First for the damages the jury awarded to Ms. Williams. Mr. Fox answered by denying the allegations in the complaint, and he did not assert any affirmative defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">On December 27, 2011, Fidelity First filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting that there were no material facts in dispute because Mr. Fox previously had testified to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>involvement in the fraudulent mortgage rescue scheme and his intent to defraud his victims, including Ms. Williams.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It argued, therefore, that \u201cany damages to Ms. Williams resulted solely from [his] active and primary negligence and any negligence on the part of Fidelity First, if any at all, was merely passive and secondary in nature.\u201d Accordingly, Fidelity First sought indemnification and contribution. Attached to the motion were the transcripts from the initial litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">On February 24, 2012, Mr. Fox, <em>pro se, </em>filed an opposition, asserting that there were genuine issues of material fact in dispute. In particular, he pointed to Mr. Eubanks\u2019 own conduct, and he argued that any issue of active, independent negligence on the part of Fidelity First had not been litigated. He asserted that Mr. Eubanks \u201corchestrated Fidelity\u2019s corruption,\u201d directed Mr. Fox to \u201cconduct unlawful activity,\u201d \u201cencouraged employees to falsify documents,\u201d and \u201ccompletely controlled\u201d Mr. Fox\u2019s work activities. Mr. Fox did not raise his discharge in bankruptcy. Mr. Fox also made his own motion for summary judgment, on the grounds of res judicata or collateral estoppel, asserting that the issues raised in the complaint were, or should have been, raised in the initial litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>On March 23, 2012, the court denied both motions for summary judgment. It stated that \u201cthere are still genuine disputes of material fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">On October 25, 2012, Fidelity First filed a second motion for summary judgment, asserting that \u201c[a]ny damages it owes to Ms. Williams resulted solely from the active and primary negligence of Fox and Dan. No direct liability on the part of Fidelity First was alleged by Ms. Williams and the jury verdict was based upon a finding of vicarious liability.\u201d It attached Mr. Fox\u2019s trial testimony in the Williams\u2019 case, as well as the agreed statement of facts from the federal case. Fidelity First stated that it was \u201cundisputed that Fox and Dan perpetrated the fraud against Ms. Williams which gave rise to her cause of action against Fidelity First for respondeat superior,\u201d and \u201c[b]oth Fox and Dan admitted to the underlying fraudulent conduct and for which they were found to have acted within the scope of employment.\u201d It argued that there were no material facts in dispute with respect to its claim for indemnification and contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Mr. Fox did not file an opposition to Fidelity First\u2019s second motion for summary judgment. Instead, on November 9, 2012, Mr. Fox filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland a motion to reopen a Chapter 7 voluntary bankruptcy case that he originally filed on January 16, 2009.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Mr. Fox asserted that, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code, a discharge under \u00a7 727 of the Bankruptcy Code \u201c \u2018operates as an injunction against the commencement or continuation of an action, the employment of process, or an act, to collect, recover or offset any such debt as a personal liability of the debtor, whether or not the discharge of such debt is waived.\u2019 \u201d He sought to include <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>Fidelity First as a creditor, as the events giving rise to Fidelity First\u2019s claim for indemnification and contribution occurred prior to his original bankruptcy petition date. He conceded that \u201cFidelity First was not scheduled as a creditor\u201d in the bankruptcy case \u201cbecause it[s] claims were not asserted until well after\u201d the bankruptcy case was closed. Furthermore, as the \u201cChapter 7 Trustee reported this as a \u2018no asset\u2019 case, ... the claims of unscheduled creditors,\u201d including Fidelity First, \u201cwere discharged.\u201d Thus, he sought to reopen the case to \u201cadd Fidelity First as a creditor, and to enforce the discharge injunction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">On November 13, 2012, Mr. Fox filed in the circuit court a notice of discharge, discharge order, and discharge injunction, asserting for the first time that he had filed a voluntary bankruptcy petition under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. He argued that the order by the Bankruptcy Court granting a discharge operated as an injunction against the continuation of the case. The circuit court stayed the proceedings pending a decision from the Bankruptcy Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">On November 15, 2012, the Bankruptcy Court issued a memorandum order denying Mr. Fox\u2019s motion to reopen his Chapter 7 case to add Fidelity First as a creditor, finding that \u201c[n]o ground exists to reopen the case.\u201d It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">[T]he failure by the Debtor[s] to list the Creditor does not automatically deprive the Debtor(s) of a discharge of the claim held by the Creditor. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(3) prevents the discharge of an unlisted claim <em>if </em>the failure to schedule the claim results in that Creditor being deprived of the opportunity to timely file a proof of claim. In addition, if the claim is of a kind which would have been held nondis-chargeable by reason of false pretenses, fraud, willful and malicious injury, as more fully set forth in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 523(a)(2), (4), or (6), the failure to schedule the claim will prevent the discharge of the unscheduled claim where such failure also prevented the Creditor from filing a timely request for determination of dischargeability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Because this bankruptcy case was a no asset case, the notice sent to creditors who had been scheduled did not contain a deadline for filing proofs of claims. Accordingly, the failure to schedule the Creditor did not deprive the Creditor of the opportunity to timely file a proof of claim; and it therefore appears that the Creditor\u2019s claims may have been discharged, even though it had not been scheduled. If the Creditor\u2019s claim arises from fraud, misrepresentations, willful or malicious injury, as more fully set forth in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 528(a)(2), (4), or (6), that claim may not have been discharged. Further, if one of the other exceptions to discharge in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a) is found to be applicable to the Creditor\u2019s claim, the claim will not have been discharged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-4\">The Debtor(s) may raise the issue of discharge in a non-bankruptcy court as a potential defense to collection] litigation. The non-bankruptcy court has concurrent jurisdiction with the bankruptcy court to determine if a Debtor(s)\u2019 discharge applies to a particular claim. Consequently, if the Creditor alleges that the claim on which suit is brought is nondischargeable, the non-bankruptcy court may rule whether the claim is discharged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Accordingly, the Bankruptcy Court determined that it was not necessary to reopen the case, and it denied Mr. Fox\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">On January 9, 2013, the circuit court lifted the stay. It gave Mr. Fox 18 days to respond to the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">On January 25, 2013, Mr. Fox, through counsel, filed a \u201cResponse To Order Lifting Stay And Motion For Summary Judgment; And Notice of Discharge, Discharge Order, And Discharge Injunction.\u201d He did not request a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">Mr. Fox asserted that, as \u201cprovided in the Bankruptcy Court Order, the claims of unscheduled creditors are discharged in a no asset case, unless an exception from discharge under Section 523(a)(2), (4) or (6) of the Bankruptcy Code applies.\u201d He argued that, \u201cunless a determination is made that one of the exceptions from discharge listed in Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>523(a)(2), (4) or (6) of the Bankruptcy Code applies, the claims of Plaintiff have been discharged in the Chapter 7 case,\u201d and therefore, the circuit court was required to \u201cmake the threshold determination of whether any of Plaintiffs claims are excepted from discharge under Section 523(a)(2), (4) or (6) of the Bankruptcy Code.\u201d He further argued that, under the Bankruptcy Code, \u201ca creditor must commence an adversary proceeding to determine the dischargeability of a debt which is procedurally subject to the Bankruptcy Rules,\u201d and if Fidelity First \u201cbelieves that any exceptions to discharge apply, it should amend the [circuit court] Complaint or file other appropriate pleadings seeking such relief and asserting such allegations which would support any such determination.\u201d Moreover, he stated that, if Fidelity First \u201cbelieves that it is entitled to summary judgment on any of the exceptions from discharge duly raised by [it], then it can file a motion for summary judgment at that time briefing the applicable bankruptcy law issues and asserting undisputed facts that support such legal requirements.\u201d Mr. Fox stated that, in the absence of Fidelity First asserting \u201cin any pleading that its indemnification claim is excepted from discharge,\u201d Fidelity First\u2019s \u201cclaims ... have been discharged in the Chapter 7 case,\u201d and \u201cruling on the motion for summary judgment on the indemnification claim is not appropriate at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">Fidelity First filed a reply to Mr. Fox\u2019s response, noting that there was \u201cno response to Plaintiffs Motion for Summary Judgment,\u201d but rather, the response solely addressed whether the claim was dischargeable. In that regard, Fidelity First stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-5\">It is undisputed that claims arising from the debtor\u2019s fraud and/or misrepresentations are non-dischargeable under a Chapter 7 petition. Without providing any supporting authority, Defendant Fox contends that Plaintiff must amend its original pleading to include an allegation that its claim is subject to an exception from a Chapter 7 discharge. This ... [c]ourt has concurrent jurisdiction with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to determine whether Mr. Fox\u2019s Chapter 7 discharge incorporates the instant suit, a claim for indem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>nification arising out of Mr. Fox\u2019s admitted perpetration of fraud and misrepresentation upon Charlene Williams, and therefore, it is not necessary for Plaintiff to amend its pleading. See attached Bankruptcy Court Order, dated November 14, 2012.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-4\">Nevertheless, Mr. Fox\u2019s attempt to retroactively discharge this claim is yet another attempt to delay these proceedings. At the time he filed his Chapter 7 Bankruptcy proceeding, Mr. Fox was already on notice of Charlene Williams\u2019 claims against him for fraud, among other things, as the actions that gave rise to her claim all occurred in 2006 and 2007, long before his 2009 bankruptcy filing. Furthermore, by virtue of the federal indictment dated December 8, 2009 and his subsequent guilty plea, Mr. Fox failed to either reopen or amend his petition at that time, despite the fact that the Williams\u2019 claim, as well as this action in which we stand in her shoes against him, have been going on since 2009. Thus, Mr. Fox had ample opportunities to raise this issue well before the time of trial and/or summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-5\">This [cjourt should therefore find that this claim, being non-dischargeable, is not subject to Mr. Fox\u2019s Bankruptcy petition and grant summary judgment for the reasons set forth in Plaintiffs motion and supporting memorandum.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">On June 10, 2013, the court granted Fidelity First\u2019s motion for summary judgment.

In that regard, he asserts: (1) Fidelity First failed to file, as required, a complaint or a motion \u201cseeking to identify which exception from discharge it believed applied to this case\u201d; and (2) the court failed to make a determination, after a hearing that Fidelity First\u2019s claim was nondischargeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">Second, Mr. Fox contends that summary judgment was improper on the merits of the claim. He asserts that there was \u201cample evidence in the record to conclude that there was a genuine dispute of material fact concerning whether [Fidelity First\u2019s] negligence (either directly or through its owner and officer Dan Eubanks) was merely passive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Fidelity First makes several arguments in response. First, it contends that Mr. Fox has not preserved the issues he raises on appeal because they were not raised in or considered by the circuit court. Second, Fidelity First argues that the court properly granted summary judgment because \u201cthere were no material facts in dispute and Fidelity First was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d In that regard, it asserts that it was undisputed that Mr. Fox \u201cwas the employee who committed the underlying fraudulent conduct for which [it] was found vicariously liable,\u201d and Mr. Fox did \u201cnot offer any alleged, material, factual disputes.\u201d It asserts that the awards for punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees could \u201conly have been awarded by virtue of Fox\u2019s fraudulent misconduct and statutory violations.\u201d Citing Maryland law providing that an employer who is found liable under the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior </em>for the tortious conduct committed by its employees may recover the full amount of its loss from the employee, <em>see Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. v. Scarlett Harbor Associates, </em>109 Md.App. 217, 277, 674 A.2d 106 (1996), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>346 Md. 122, 695 A.2d 153 (1997), combined with Mr. Fox\u2019s failure to even respond to Fidelity First\u2019s substantive argument regarding its right to indemnifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>cation and contribution, Fidelity First argues that the court\u2019s grant of summary judgment was proper.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Third, with respect to Mr. Fox\u2019s argument regarding the circuit court\u2019s finding that the debt was nondischargeable, Fidelity First argues that this ruling was legally correct. It asserts that, if Mr. Fox wanted a hearing on this issue, he should have asked for one. Because he did not, the circuit court did not err in ruling on the issue without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Discharge of Debt</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">We address first Mr. Fox\u2019s contention that the court erred in determining that, although he had obtained a discharge in bankruptcy, Fidelity First\u2019s claim was nondischargeable. Before doing so, a brief discussion of bankruptcy law is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">Bankruptcy Law</p>\n<p id=\"b532-10\">Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727(b), allows a debtor to obtain a discharge \u201cfrom all debts that arose before the order of relief,\u201d except as provided in \u00a7 523. <em>Marvin v. Marvin, </em>51 Va.App. 619, 659 S.E.2d 579, 581 (2008). Section 523(a) lists nineteen exceptions to discharge, i.e., debts that are excluded from a debtor\u2019s discharge. <em>In re Candidus, </em>327 B.R. 112, 116 (E.D.N.Y.2005). Because \u201cthe exceptions are all factually and legally based, a dispute may arise between the debtor and the creditor regarding whether the debt was discharged or not.\u201d <em>In re Mitchell, </em>418 B.R. 282, 286 n. 3 (8th Cir. BAP 2009). In that situation, a court will \u201cdetermine whether the legal and factual predicates for an exception to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>discharge exist and therefore determine whether the debt was discharged or not.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">There are four categories of debt excepted from discharge under \u00a7 523(a) that are relevant to this case. Debts listed in \u00a7 523(a)(2), (4), and (6) encompass claims arising out of: (1) \u201cactual fraud, false pretenses or false representations\u201d ((a)(2)); (2) \u201cfraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity, embezzlement or larceny\u201d ((a)(4)); and (3) \u201cwillful or malicious injury to person or property\u201d ((a)(6)). <em>In re Candidus, </em>327 B.R. at 116. These debts sometimes are referred to as \u201cintentional tort debts.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The Court in <em>Candidus </em>explained the procedure involved for a creditor to determine the nondischargeability of an intentional tort debt, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-6\">What is so special about the intentional tort debts is that they will be automatically discharged, unless the creditor files a complaint in the bankruptcy court to determine their dischargeability within a strict time limit of 60 days from the date first set for the meeting of creditors. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(c); Fed. R. Bankr.P. 4007(c). Section 523(c) also grants the bankruptcy court exclusive jurisdiction to determine the dischargeability of the intentional tort debts. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Bankr.P. 4007 advisory committee\u2019s note (1983); 4 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>\u00b6 523.26[1] at 523-129 (15th ed. rev. 2004).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-7\">These time and jurisdictional limitations do not apply to any of the other fifteen categories of debt excepted from discharge under \u00a7 523(a), including \u00a7 523(a)(3). A complaint to determine dischargeability of debts other than intentional tort debts may be filed at any time. Fed. R. Bankr.P. 4007(b). Jurisdiction to determine dischargeability of these categories of debt is held concurrently by the bankruptcy court and any appropriate non-bankruptcy forum. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(b); Fed. R. Bankr.P. 4007 advisory committee\u2019s note (1983).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 116-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">A fourth category of debt excepted from discharge under \u00a7 523(a) that is relevant to this case is debt \u201cneither listed nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>scheduled\u201d in the bankruptcy petition. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(3). As the Court in <em>Candidus </em>explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-4\">[Section] 523(a)(3)(B) excepts unscheduled debt from discharge, where the creditor, due to the absence of notice or actual knowledge of the bankruptcy filing, failed to timely exercise his right to obtain a dischargeability determination of debts \u201cof a kind specified in\u201d \u00a7 523(a)(2), (4), or (6). Thus, \u00a7 523(a)(3)(B) protects the right of an unscheduled creditor to obtain a determination of nondischargeability of intentional tort debts, and helps vouchsafe the public policy that debts discharged in a Chapter 7 case are only debts honestly incurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">In sum, a debtor\u2019s failure \u201c \u2018to schedule a fraud debt or otherwise inform the creditor of the bankruptcy is forfeiture of the right to enjoy exclusive federal jurisdiction and loss of the sixty-day limitations period applicable in the exclusive jurisdiction actions.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Bartomeli, </em>303 B.R. 254, 269 (D.Conn.2004) (quoting <em>In re Franklin, </em>179 B.R. 913, 924 (E.D.Cal.1995)). <em>In re Steward, </em>509 B.R. 123, 127 (W.D.Mich. 2014) (\u201c[A] debtor who omits a creditor from his or her schedules runs the risk that the creditor\u2019s claim will be excepted from discharge under \u00a7 523(a)(3)(B) and that a court other than the United States Bankruptcy Court may be called upon to make that determination.\u201d); <em>In re Taylor, </em>49 B.R. 416, 419 (N.D.Tex.1985) (\u201cThe determination of dischargeability under \u00a7 523(a)(3), unlike such determinations under \u00a7 523(a)(2), (4), or (6), is of the type over which the Bankruptcy Court has concurrent, but not exclusive jurisdiction.\u201d) (quoting <em>In re McNeil, </em>13 B.R. 743, 747 (S.D.N.Y.1981)). And as one court has noted: \u201c \u2018Conceivably, the debtors would prefer to litigate this issue in the federal bankruptcy forum where discovery devices, rules of evidence and case law may be more compatible with their objectives than those pertaining in the state courts.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Taylor, </em>49 B.R. at 419 (quoting <em>In re McNeil, </em>13 B.R. at 747).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Accordingly, because Mr. Fox did not schedule Fidelity First as a creditor in his bankruptcy case, the circuit court had concurrent jurisdiction to construe the discharge \u201c \u2018and determine whether a particular debt is or is not within the discharge.\u2019 \u201d <em>Howard v. Howard, </em>336 S.W.3d 433, 442 (2011) (quoting <em>Sunbeam Corp. v. Dortch, </em>313 S.W.3d 114, 116 (Ky. 2010)). The issue before the court was whether the debt was nondischargeable because it was \u201cof a kind specified in\u201d \u00a7 523(a)(2), (4) or (6). <em>See </em>\u00a7 523(a)(3)(B); <em>In re Candidus, </em>327 B.R. at 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Procedure to Determine Whether Debt is Discharged</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Mr. Fox contends that, before even addressing \u201cthe merits of the dischargeability issue,\u201d \u201cthere is a procedure which must be followed which was completely ignored in this case.\u201d He argues, citing \u00a7 523(c)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code and Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 4007, that an intentional tort debt can be found nondischargeable only after a complaint is filed and a hearing is held.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Section 523(c)(1) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-8\">Except as provided in subsection (a)(3)(B) of this section, the debtor shall be discharged from a debt of a kind specified in paragraph (2), (4), or (6) of subsection (a) of this section, unless, on request of the creditor to whom such debt is owed, and after notice and a hearing, the court determines such debt to be excepted from discharge under paragraph (2), (4), or (6), as the case may be, of subsection (a) of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-9\"><em>See </em>Fed. R. Bankr.P. 4007 (a creditor may file a \u201ccomplaint to obtain a determination of the dischargeability of a debt\u201d within \u201c60 days after the first date set for the meeting of creditors\u201d). Mr. Fox asserts error here because there was no complaint filed, no identification of the exceptions Fidelity First believed were applicable, no discovery, and \u201cno determination of non-dischargeability after notice and a hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>The <em>Candidus </em>court noted four ways to obtain a judicial determination of dischargeability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aoq\">i) if the creditor pursues a lawsuit on the claim, the debtor can assert the bankruptcy discharge as an affirmative defense and the court with jurisdiction over the lawsuit can decide whether the debt falls within any of the exceptions to discharge, ii) the debtor may be able to remove the collection effort to the bankruptcy court, iii) either the debtor or the creditor can move to reopen the bankruptcy case pursuant to Fed. R. Bankr.P. 4007(b) for the purpose of filing a complaint to determine dischargeability, and iv) the debtor can bring an action against the creditor in the bankruptcy court to enforce the \u00a7 524(a)(2) discharge injunction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-4\"><em>In re Candidus, </em>327 B.R. at 118. Here, after failing in his quest to reopen the bankruptcy case, Mr. Fox opted to pursue the affirmative defense avenue in state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Mr. Fox\u2019s argument, that pursuant to \u00a7 523(c)(1) and Rule 4007 Fidelity First had to file a separate complaint in state court to obtain a determination of nondischargeability and the court was required to hold a hearing prior to determining if the debt was excepted for discharge, is without merit. This argument ignores the plain language of \u00a7 523(c)(1), which sets forth the procedure \u201c[ejxcept as provided in subsection (a)(3)(B).\u201d As indicated, \u00a7 523(a)(3)(B) addresses the situation here, an unscheduled intentional tort debt. Thus, the statute itself provides that the requisite procedures set forth in \u00a7 523(c)(1) do not apply here. Indeed, Mr. Fox has not cited any case holding that a state court with concurrent jurisdiction regarding whether a debt is covered by a bankruptcy court discharge must follow the federal court procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">To be sure, a state court must apply the substantial federal law regarding whether a particular debt is covered by a bankruptcy discharge. <em>See In re Goodwich, </em>517 B.R. 572, 583 (D.Md.2014). With respect to procedural matters, however, \u201c \u2018[t]he law of the forum governs.\u2019 \u201d <em>Goodwich v. Sinai Hosp. of Baltimore, Inc., </em>343 Md. 185, 205, 680 A.2d 1067 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>(1996) (quoting <em>Rein v. Koons Ford, </em>318 Md. 130, 147, 567 A.2d 101 (1989)). There is no procedural provision in Maryland law that requires a creditor to file a separate complaint in response to a debtor asserting the affirmative defense of discharge of debt. Nor is there a requirement for the court to hold a hearing on this issue, prior to rendering its decision, when no hearing was requested. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2\u2014311(f) (a party desiring a hearing on a motion shall request one). Accordingly, we reject Mr. Fox\u2019s argument that the circuit court committed procedural errors in its resolution of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Fraud Claims Are Not Dischargeable</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">We turn next to the merits of the court\u2019s determination that Fidelity First\u2019s claim was not discharged by the bankruptcy case. Section 523(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that a discharge pursuant to \u00a7 727 \u201cdoes not discharge an individual debtor from any debt ... (2) for money, property, services ... obtained by ... false pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud, other than a statement respecting the debtor\u2019s or an insider\u2019s financial condition.\u201d The circuit court found that, because the case \u201cincludes a claim for fraud, it is non-dischargeable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Mr. Fox does not dispute that he engaged in fraud in connection with his dealings with Ms. Williams. Rather, he asserts that \u201cthe underlying lawsuit was a claim for indemnification\u2014not fraud,\u201d and because Fidelity First \u201chas not alleged that [he] defrauded it,\u201d the claim is not covered by the fraud exception. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">This same argument was considered, and rejected, in <em>In re Saenz, </em>515 B.R. 521 (S.D.Tex.2014). In that case, the creditor, Pizza Patron, Inc. (\u201cPPI\u201d), a franchiser of pizza restaurants, was sued based on an allegation by a buyer of a franchise that the debtor, PPI\u2019s agent Saenz, committed fraud against the buyer. <em>Id. </em>at 524. PPI filed a Complaint for Determination of Non-Dischargeable Debt, asserting that, if it was held vicariously liable for the tortious conduct committed by Saenz, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Saenz would be liable to PPI, and requesting that Saenz\u2019s liability to PPI be declared nondischargeable under \u00a7 523(a)(2). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Saenz argued that PPI failed to state a claim for fraud under \u00a7 523(a)(2) because PPI did not allege that it was defrauded by him. <em>Id. </em>at 526-28. The court rejected this argument, stating: \u201c[Section] 523(a)(2) does not state that the alleged fraud must be committed against the movant creditor. Nothing in this subsection precludes PPI from asserting an exception to discharge just because PPI wasn\u2019t the target of the debtor\u2019s alleged fraudulent conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 526. It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\">Saenz\u2019s contention that PPI must be the target of debt- or\u2019s fraud in order to sustain a \u00a7 523(a)(2) claim is at odds with the Supreme Court\u2019s broad interpretation. In <em>[Cohen v. de la Cruz, </em>523 U.S. 213, 217, 118 S.Ct. 1212, 140 L.Ed.2d 341 (1998) ], the Supreme Court stated that \u00a7 523(a)(2) prevents the discharge of all liability arising from fraud. In this case, accepting PPI\u2019s factual allegations as true, then any liability that Saenz would have to PPI would arise from Saenz\u2019s fraudulent conduct. Moreover, although PPI may not have been the target of debtor\u2019s fraud, PPI will be a victim of the fraud if PPI is held vicariously liable. Permitting Saenz to discharge a debt that was incurred due to his fraud merely because PPI was not the target of the debtor\u2019s fraud is inconsistent with the basic policy that bankruptcy relief is reserved for the \u201chonest but unfortunate debtor.\u201d <em>See [Cohen, </em>523 U.S. at 217, 118 S.Ct. at 1216] (\u201c[t]he Bankruptcy Code has long prohibited debtors from discharging liabilities incurred on account of their fraud, embodying a basic policy animating the Code of affording relief only to an honest but unfortunate debtor\u201d). Accordingly, the Court rejects the argument that the fraud debt is only excepted from discharge under \u00a7 523(a)(2) if Saenz defrauded PPI.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 528 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">We agree with that reasoning. Mr. Fox obtained money by fraud, and Fidelity First\u2019s liability arises from that fraud. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Thus, even though Fidelity First was not the target of Mr. Fox\u2019s fraud, pursuant to \u00a7 523(a)(2), Mr. Fox is not entitled to discharge of the debt that was incurred due to his fraud. The circuit court properly determined that Fidelity First\u2019s claim was nondischargeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Indemnification Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Mr. Fox next contends that the court erred in granting summary judgment on Fidelity Fox\u2019s indemnification claim because the record reflects \u201ca dispute of material fact whether appellee\u2019s conduct was passive.\u201d He asserts: \u201cMr. Eubanks knowingly allowed loan officers to engage in loan fraud, and he lured in the prospects with his own fraud. He was the one leading the sheep to the wolves. To say his role was passive is almost laughable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Fidelity First argues that this issue is not preserved for this Court\u2019s review because Mr. Fox did not contend below \u201cthat there was a disputed material fact as to whether Fidelity First\u2019s negligence was the active cause of [Ms.] Williams\u2019 damages.\u201d Moreover, it asserts that \u201cthe circuit court was legally correct when it granted summary judgment in favor of Fidelity First as there were no material facts in dispute and Fidelity First was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d In that regard, Fidelity First states that it was undisputed that Mr. Fox was \u201cthe employee who committed the underlying fraudulent conduct for which Fidelity First was found vicariously liable,\u201d and Mr. Fox did not deny those facts or otherwise allege any material, factual disputes. Rather, his sole response to the motion for summary judgment involved his assertion that the claim had been discharged by the order of the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">In responding to a motion for summary judgment, the opposing party \u201cmust identify \u201cwith particularity the material facts that are disputed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Beyer v.

Nibco, Inc., </em>96 Md.App. 127, 136, 623 A.2d 731 (1993)), <em>aff'd on other </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number><em>grounds, </em>369 Md. 335, 800 A.2d 707 (2001). \u201cMoreover, the opposing party must present evidence that would be admissible at trial to show the existence of a material factual dispute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Failure to do so renders the issues unpreserved. <em>Id. </em>at 636, 779 A.2d 388. \u201cBald, unsupported statements or conclusions of law\u201d do not generate a genuine dispute of material fact, and therefore, they cannot defeat a motion for summary judgment. <em>Hoffman Chevrolet, Inc. v. Wash. County Nat\u2019l Sav. Bank, </em>297 Md. 691, 712, 467 A.2d 758 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">Here, the undisputed facts before the circuit court on the motion for summary judgment were that Mr. Fox perpetrated a fraud upon Ms. Williams, and that Fidelity First was found to be vicariously liable for Mr. Fox\u2019s misconduct. \u201cAn employer who is liable for a tort committed by an employee under the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior </em>may, in the absence of active, independent negligence on the part of the employer, recover the full amount of its loss from the employee.\u201d <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. v. Scarlett Harbor Assocs., Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>109 Md.App. 217, 277, 674 A.2d 106 (1996), <em>affd on other grounds, </em>346 Md. 122, 695 A.2d 153 (1997). There was no finding in the underlying action of active, independent negligence on the part of Fidelity First, and Mr. Fox did not assert in response to the second motion for summary judgment, the motion at issue here, that there was a material dispute of fact on this issue. Under these circumstances, the circuit court properly granted Fidelity First\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We perceive no error in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b517-11\">. This other individual, James Dan, is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b523-10\">. We did not consider in that case, as it was not an issue presented to us, whether Mr. Eubanks' conduct amounted to fraud, thereby rendering Fidelity First\u2019s involvement active, as opposed to passive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b524-5\">. The motion stated that Mr. Fox had pleaded guilty in federal court to wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud in connection to these fraudulent schemes, and it attached a copy of the agreed statement of facts in that case, which included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">In order to obtain the mortgage loans in his name, Fox made materially false and fraudulent loan applications including falsification of his intent to occupy the property, annual income, savings, other properties owned, and source of the borrower\u2019s funds for closing. Dan did as well. Fox was typically the loan officer for Dan's loans and was aware of Dan\u2019s material misrepresentations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-7\">Fox and Dan attended settlements on these properties which were required to be conducted according to the financial terms and conditions specified by the mortgage lenders and set forth on the settlement statements (sometimes called HUD-ls). These HUD-ls were false. The source of funds for the closing and the disposition of the sales proceeds materially varied from the HUD-1 which was furnished to the lender as set forth in more detail below. Fox was motivated to enter these transactions because he received a portion of the seller\u2019s proceeds which were set forth on Line 603 of the HUD-1, even though Fox (or Dan) was the buyer.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b525-6\">. On January 16, 2009, Mr. Fox filed Bankruptcy Petition # 09-10795 in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland, seeking voluntary discharge, in a \"no-asset\u201d case, under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. Fidelity First was not scheduled as a creditor in the petition. On April 29, 2009, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order granting a discharge under Section 727 of Title 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Mr. Fox\u2019s bankruptcy case was then closed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b532-11\">. Fidelity First also argues that this Court lacks jurisdiction to review the Bankruptcy Court's November 15, 2012, order. We construe Mr. Fox's argument to be about the circuit court's order, not the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order, so we need not address this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
