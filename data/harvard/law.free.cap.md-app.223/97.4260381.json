Leopold, then the Anne Arundel County Executive, was indicted in early 2012 for misconduct in office, based in part on allegations that he used his position to compile dossiers on his potential (or at least perceived) political challengers and enemies. Some of those individuals<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Maryland (\u201cACLU\u201d) (collectively \u201cthe appellants\u201d) requested copies of the information Mr. Leopold had assembled about them from Mr. Leopold (in his individual capacity and as County Executive), and James Teare (then the Anne Arundel County Chief of Police), or the custodian of records, under the Maryland Public Information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Act (\u201cPIA\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Anne Arundel County (the \u201cCounty\u201d) responded, over time, to these requests on their behalf, and the appellants were dissatisfied with the County\u2019s response.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">The appellants sued in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. Their amended complaint alleged that Mr. Leopold, Chief Teare, and the County (collectively, \u201cthe appellees\u201d) violated the PIA, and asked the court to compel the production of additional documents, enter a declaratory judgment, and award damages. The appellees filed a Motion to Dismiss and/or for Summary Judgment, the circuit court granted it, and this appeal followed. We agree with the appellees in large part, but we hold that the circuit court erred in dismissing Count I, in which the appellants alleged that the appellees violated the PIA by wrongfully compiling and using information about the appellants for use in Mr. Leopold\u2019s reelection campaign, and we remand for further proceedings on that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Mr. Leopold\u2019s misconduct in office was the subject of a separate criminal case,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but that story sets the stage for the appellants\u2019 requests for information, the responses they received (or didn\u2019t) and from whom, and the PIA claims at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>1. Mr. Leopold\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Mr. Leopold was indicted on March 2, 2012. Among other things, the Indictment alleged that he had used his Executive Protection Officers (\u201cEPOs\u201d)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to compile information on his political opponents:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">[Mr.] Leopold directed on-duty [EPOs] to create dossiers on persons he viewed as political challengers, including but not limited to, Joanna Conti and Carl Snowden. The EPOs did not consider these people to be security risks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">After a bench trial, Mr. Leopold was found guilty of two charges of misconduct while in office. The court found specifically that Mr. Leopold had wrongfully diverted County employees and resources to his election campaign, including the creation of dossiers (as we recounted in our reported opinion on appeal):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-7\">It should have come as no surprise to [Mr. Leopold] that employing on duty sworn police officers to work on his election campaign was wrongful and illegal. Section 13-303 of Article XXIV of the Maryland Code provides that an employee of a local entity may not be required to provide any political service. Section 13-105 further provides that an employee of a local entity, which Anne Arundel County is a local entity, may not engage in political activity while on the job during working hours.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-8\">[Mr. Leopold], as an individual with decades of Governmental and election experience, was beyond a doubt aware that requiring [ ] on duty police officers to perform substantial services for his reelection campaign was wrongful and illegal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>By wrongfully taking substantial advantage of free public employee help for his campaign, an asset unavailable to his opponent, [Mr. Leopold] was placing his thumb on the scales of our political system to heavily tilt it in his favor. These actions robbed Anne Arundel County citizens of the fair political electoral process they were entitled to receive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-4\">[Mr. Leopold\u2019s] actions were done systematically during the election season of 2010. [He] committed these acts knowingly, willfully and intentionally and under color of his office as County Executive. He did so corruptly and is guilty of this offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-5\"><em>Leopold, </em>216 Md.App. at 600-01, 88 A.3d 860. The trial court barred Mr. Leopold from running for political office in Maryland for five years, sentenced him to a brief incarceration and house arrest followed by five years\u2019 probation, and ordered him to perform 400 hours of community service and pay a $100,000 fine. This Court affirmed his conviction on appeal, although we struck that portion of his sentence that prohibited him from running for public office.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">2. The information requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Almost immediately after Mr. Leopold\u2019s indictment, the appellants began to investigate the existence and contents of the alleged dossiers. Most importantly for our purposes, the appellants served a series of PIA requests:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-8\"><em>\u2022 March 6, 2012 (\u201cFirst Request\u201d): </em>The ACLU served on \u201cMr. John Leopold (Or Custodian of Records), Office of the County Executive,\u201d and on \u201cChief James Teare (Or Custodian of Records), Anne Arundel County Police Department\u201d a PIA request for the \u201cLeopold dossiers\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> on Carl Snowden and Joanna Conti. The First Request included eleven numbered paragraphs, each seeking a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>category of records. The County responded by letter dated March 13, 2012 and attached a partial production.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-5\"><em>\u2022 March 16, 2012: </em>The ACLU served\u2014again on Mr. Leopold and Chief Teare\u2014the same requests as the First Request on behalf of thirteen more individuals. The County responded by letter dated March 30, 2012 and attached a partial production and supplemented its response to the First Request.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-6\">\u2022 <em>March 23, 2012: </em>The ACLU served on the same parties a supplemental request that named four more individuals. The County\u2019s March 30, 2012 letter also responded to this request.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-7\"><em>\u2022 April 3, </em>2012:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The ACLU served the same requests as to another individual. The County responded by letters dated April 25, 2012 and June 28, 2012.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-8\"><em>\u2022 August 15, 2012: </em>The ACLU served on the Police Department a request for all \u201cCriminal History Records Information\u201d as to all of the individuals named in the first four Requests. The County responded by letters dated September 27, 2012 and October 10, 2012.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">3. The County\u2019s responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">The County responded to all five requests on behalf of all of the appellees. The County\u2019s response letters attached some responsive documents, but declined to disclose anything from two discrete categories of information. <em>First, </em>it declined to release to the ACLU certain tape-recorded interviews of Mr. Leopold\u2019s EPOs by Major Edward Bergin (and referred to as \u201cthe Bergin tapes\u201d). According to Major Bergin, he became suspicious that Mr. Leopold had used the EPOs for improper purposes, so he interviewed two of them in March 2011 and turned the tapes over to the Maryland State Prosecutor\u2019s Office. The County indicated in its March 30, 2012 letter that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>the only additional responsive documents <em>(i.e., </em>the Bergin tapes) were being withheld as \u201cpertaining] to the pending criminal proceedings undertaken by the State Prosecutor\u2019s Office, which likely constitute evidence in that matter, and which will not be released at this time pursuant to [SG] \u00a7 10-618(f) of the MPIA.\u201d The County ultimately provided the tapes on March 4, 2013, after Mr. Leopold\u2019s trial was complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\"><em>Second, </em>the County declined to provide e-mails that were (as the appellants requested) \u201ckept by, prepared by or for, or compiled by or for\u201d EPO personnel \u201cconcerning any individual or group, whether or not at the explicit direction of [Mr.] Leopold.\u201d Although the County provided some responsive documents on June 28, 2012, the letter stated that the County would \u201ccontinue to work on reviewing additional e-mails that may be responsive as well.\u201d It followed up on September 27, 2012, with a letter asking the appellants to narrow the scope of the requests due to the volume of potentially responsive emails:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">Each of the twenty two (22) County Executive staff employee electronic mailboxes for review includes an archived mail file and a trash file, both of which can contain anywhere from 10,000 to 15,000 or more documents to search. Consequently we are asking if you could please clarify and limit your search in some fashion to which we are able to respond.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">So far as we can tell, the appellants did not narrow their requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">4. The underlying litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">After the appellants filed their initial complaint on December 12, 2012, the parties exchanged letters and additional information, and the appellants amended their complaint and added Chief Teare as a defendant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> They ultimately alleged three categories of PIA violations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>\u2022 Count One (against Mr. Leopold, the County, and Chief Teare): \u201cImproper Collection, Use, Creation and Dissemination of Government Records Containing Personal Information.\u201d The appellants alleged that the dossiers constituted personal records under the PIA and that there was \u201cno legitimate governmental purpose\u201d for the appellees to create them. The appellants relied on SG \u00a7 10\u2014624(b) and SG \u00a7 10-626 (which we discuss further below).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-4\">\u2022 Count Two (against all defendants): \u201cImproper Denial of Access to Public Records.\u201d The appellants alleged that the appellees violated the PIA \u201cby failing to adequately search for responsive records, thus avoiding disclosure of responsive information,\u201d \u201cby invoking inapplicable exemptions to the PIA as a basis for denying or temporarily denying\u201d their requests, and when they \u201cfailed to respond to their requests for electronically stored information\u201d (citing SG \u00a7 10-623(d)(l)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-5\">\u2022 Count Three (against the County and Chief Teare): \u201cFailure to Timely Petition for Continuance of a Temporary Denial.\u201d The appellants claimed that the appellees violated SG \u00a7 10-619 by withholding the Bergin tapes without seeking approval from the court (citing SG \u00a7 10-623(d)(2)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">For each count, appellants sought a declaratory judgment and asked the court to order the appellees to search for and provide all responsive documents. They also sought \u201ccompensatory or nominal damages\u201d for violation of their rights under the PIA, along with attorney\u2019s fees and \u201csuch other relief that is just and proper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Mr. Leopold responded with a Motion to Dismiss or for Summary Judgment. On October 15, 2013, the County did the same, and Chief Teare followed with a Motion to Dismiss. The ACLU and the other appellants opposed these motions and filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment of their own on January 31, 2014. After a hearing, the circuit court issued a written order and memorandum opinion that granted the Motions to Dismiss of Mr. Leopold, the County, and Chief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Teare as to Count I; granted the Motions for Summary Judgment of Mr. Leopold, the County, Mr. Davis, and Chief Teare as to Count II; and granted the Motions to Dismiss of the County, Mr. Davis, and Chief Teare as to Count III. The court also denied the appellants\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-6\">The public\u2019s right to information about government activities lies at the heart of a democratic government. Maryland\u2019s [PIA] grants the people of this State a broad right of access to public records while protecting legitimate government interests and the privacy rights of individual citizens.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ay-\">Office of the Attorney General, Maryland Public Information Act Manual (\u201cMPIA Manual\u201d) Preface (13th ed., October 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">If there were ever a law school class on the MPIA, this appeal would frame a great exam question. It covers all three of the PIA\u2019s core purposes\u2014the public\u2019s right to information, the State\u2019s right to protect <em>legitimate </em>governmental interests, and individuals\u2019 rights to privacy\u2014although in different order,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and we agree with the circuit court\u2019s analysis as to two of the three counts. We disagree with the court\u2019s decision to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>dismiss the appellants\u2019 claims, in Count I, that the appellees misused public records and violated their privacy rights under the PIA (although we offer no views on the merits of those claims on this posture). But we agree that the appellees were entitled to dismissal of Count II, because the appellees did not improperly deny the appellants access to public records, and Count III, because the County withheld the Bergin tapes consistently with the legitimate government interest in the then-pending prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">We review a successful motion to dismiss for errors of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">The standard of appellate review of a lower court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss is well-settled: \u201c[i]n reviewing the underlying grant of a motion to dismiss, we must assume the truth of the well-pleaded factual allegations of the complaint, including the reasonable inferences that may be drawn from those allegations.\u201d <em>Debbas v. Nelson, </em>389 Md. 364, 372 [885 A.2d 802] (2005) (citations omitted). We review these issues as a matter of law. <em>See Davis v. Slater, </em>383 Md. 599, 604 [861 A.2d 78] (2004) (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGp\"><em>Williams v. Peninsula Reg\u2019l Med. Ctr., </em>440 Md. 573, 578, 103 A.3d 658 (2014). We undertake a similar <em>de novo </em>review of a successful summary judgment motion. <em>Schmerling v. Injured Workers\u2019 Ins. Fund, </em>368 Md. 434, 443, 795 A.2d 715 (2002). Because the trial court does not resolve any disputed issues of fact on that posture, see Md. Rule 2-501(a), \u201cthe standard for appellate review of a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion for summary judgment is simply whether the trial court was legally correct.\u201d <em>Beatty v. Trailmaster, </em>330 Md. 726, 737, 625 A.2d 1005 (1993). For the opposing party to defeat such a motion, it \u201cmust show that there is a genuine dispute as to a material fact by proferring facts which would be admissible in evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">We consider the claims here against the overarching principle that, as its title suggests, the PIA is meant to encourage and facilitate <em>public </em>access to <em>information </em>in the hands of State government. To that end, the spirit of the PIA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>\u201c \u2018establishes a public policy and a general presumption in favor of disclosure of government or public documents,\u2019 \u201d <em>Office of Governor v. Washington Post Co., </em>360 Md. 520, 544, 759 A.2d 249 (2000) (quoting <em>Kirwan v. The Diamondback, </em>352 Md. 74, 80-81, 721 A.2d 196 (1998)); <em>see also Comptroller of Treasury v. Immanuel, </em>216 Md.App. 259, 265, 85 A.3d 878 (2014) (\u201cThe [PIA] grants the public the right to inspect public records in a way that favors public access.\u201d), so as a general matter we err on the side of disclosure. For the same reason, we interpret and apply disclosure exceptions narrowly. <em>Fior-etti v. Maryland State Board of Dental Examiners, </em>351 Md. 66, 77, 716 A.2d 258 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">A. Count I Stated A Claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Count I of the Amended Complaint focused on the alleged dossiers. The appellants alleged that the appellees violated SG \u00a7 10-624, and they sought to recover for those violations via SG \u00a7 10-626. The appellants alleged that they \u201csuffered actual damages due to emotional distress,\u201d and sought declaratory relief, along with \u201cactual compensatory or nominal damages\u201d and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">The trial court held that the appellants were precluded from bringing this claim because, in its words, \u201crecovery for emotional distress would be inapposite under the [PIA], in particular SG \u00a7 10-626.\u201d The court concluded first that a plaintiff in a PIA action must \u201cmeet a heightened burden of proof,\u201d <em>ie., </em>that he must prove his claims by \u201cclear and convincing evidence.\u201d The court analogized to a tort claim for emotional distress, and reasoned that the appellants were required also to allege and prove \u201cmalice\u201d to overcome Mr. Leopold\u2019s public official immunity defense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-8\">[A]n essential element in a cause of action alleging intentional infliction of emotional distress is that the conduct \u201cmust be extreme and outrageous,\u201d and \u201cpled and proved with particularity.\u201d <em>Silkworth v. Ryder Truck Rental, Inc., </em>70 Md.App. 264, 271 [520 A.2d 1124] (1987). To overcome public official immunity, a plaintiff must establish that the defendant acted with actual malice. <em>Thomas v. City of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number><em>Annapolis, </em>113 Md.App. 440, 456 [688 A.2d 448] (1997). Plaintiffs admitted during oral argument ... that the term \u201cmalice\u201d does not appear in its First Amended Complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">(Footnote omitted.) In the end, the court declined to \u201cbroaden\u201d the PIA to encompass what it viewed as a claim purely for emotional damages, and dismissed Count I. The court also interpreted SG \u00a7 10-626 not to provide a right of action for a violation of SG \u00a7 10-624(b), and therefore declined to enter a declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">The appellants argue here that the circuit court erred in analyzing both whether the appellees had violated the PIA and, if they did, whether the PIA afforded the appellants any remedy under either of the relevant provisions. <em>First, </em>SG \u00a7 10-624 defines \u201cpersonal records\u201d and the purposes for which State government may or may not create them:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-8\">(a) In this section, <em>\u201cpersonal record \u201d means a public record [</em><footnotemark>10</footnotemark>] that names or, with reasonable certainty, otherwise identifies an individual by an identifying factor such as:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-9\">(1) an address;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-10\">(2) a description;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-11\">(3) a finger or voice print;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-12\">(4) a number; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-13\">(5) a picture.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-14\">(b) (1) <em>Personal records may not be created unless the need for the information has been clearly established by the unit collecting the records.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-15\">(2) Personal information collected for personal records:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>(i) shall be appropriate and relevant to the purposes for which it is collected;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">(ii) shall be accurate and current to the greatest extent practicable; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-8\">(iii) shall not be obtained by fraudulent means.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-9\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The section goes on to give detailed guidelines about how an official custodian may collect personal records, and establishes reporting requirements (which are not at issue here). SG \u00a7 10-624(c)-(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\"><em>Second, </em>\u00a7 10-626 creates remedies for violations of the PIA but does not reference SG \u00a7 10-624 expressly. It does, however, provide that people who violate their obligations under the PIA <em>willfully and knowingly </em>are liable for actual damages, attorney\u2019s fees, and litigation costs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-11\">(a) <em>A person, </em>including an officer or employee of a governmental unit, <em>is liable to an individual for actual damages that the court considers appropriate </em>if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-12\">(1) (i) <em>the person willfully and knowingly permits inspection or use of a public record in violation of this Part III of this subtitle; </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-13\">(ii) the public record names or, with reasonable certainty, otherwise identifies the individual by an identifying factor such as:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-14\">1. an address;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-15\">2. a description;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-16\">3. a finger or voice print;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-17\">4. a number; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-18\">5. a picture; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-19\">(2) [provisions not relevant here.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-20\">(b) If the court determines that the complainant has substantially prevailed, the court may assess against a defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>dant reasonable counsel fees and other litigation costs that the complainant reasonably incurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-5\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">1. Violations and remedies under SG \u00a7 10-626</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">The appellants contend that the trial judge incorrectly read SG \u00a7 10-626 not to provide a civil remedy for violations of SG \u00a7 10-624, and that without one, \u00a7 10-624 has no teeth. They argue as well that Mr. Leopold violated SG \u00a7 10-626 independently when he \u201cused\u201d the dossiers in his campaign, whether or not he violated \u00a7 10-624 when he \u201ccreated\u201d them. Mr. Leopold and the other appellees counter that they merely compiled any dossiers from existing records, and thus that they did not \u201ccreate\u201d anything for purposes of SG \u00a7 10-624, and that Mr. Leopold did not \u201cpermit inspection or use of a public record\u201d under SG \u00a7 10-626 even if he did use the dossiers for political purposes. We agree with the appellants that the trial court read the interplay between SG \u00a7 10-624 and \u00a7 10-626 too narrowly.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">We begin with the words of the statute, and from there apply well-accepted principles of statutory construction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ap-dedup-0\">The primary indicator of the Legislature\u2019s intent is the language of the statute. <em>Whack v. State, </em>338 Md. 665, 672 [659 A.2d 1347] (1995). We interpret statutes to give every word effect, avoiding constructions that render any portion of the language superfluous or redundant. <em>Warsame v. State, </em>338 Md. 513, 519 [659 A.2d 1271] (1995); <em>see also </em>2A Sutherland Statutory Construction \u00a7 46.06, at 119-20 (5th ed. 1992 &amp; 1995 Cum.Supp.). In addition, we construe the statute as a whole, interpreting each provision of the statute in the context of the entire statutory scheme. <em>Warsame, </em>338 Md. at 519 [659 A.2d 1271] (citing <em>GEICO v.

Baltimore City Police Dept., </em>341 Md. 680, 691, 672 A.2d 639 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Count I of the Amended Complaint cites generally to both SG \u00a7 10-624 and \u00a7 10-626. In one paragraph, it alleges that \u201c[t]here was no legitimate governmental purpose, nor any clearly established need, for [appellees] to create government records of personal information about any [appellants], and the compilation, use, and dissemination of these records by [Mr.] Leopold, Anne Arundel County, and [Chief] Teare violated\u201d \u00a7 10-624(b), then, in the next paragraph, alleges that these violations \u201cgive rise to claims\u201d under \u00a7 10-626. This puts us into an analytical loop: \u00a7 10-626 provides that a person is liable \u201cfor actual damages that the court considers appropriate\u201d after a finding (by \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d) that he willfully and knowingly <em>\u201cpermitted] inspection </em>or <em>use </em>of a <em>public record in violation of Part III of this subtitle,\u201d </em>a reference that encompasses \u00a7 10-624(b)(l). Although they do not say so in so many words, the appellants seem to view the act of compiling the dossiers as the creation of a new record unto itself, and thus the violation of \u00a7 10-624(b), whatever they might contain.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">We say that the appellants <em>seem to view </em>the compilation of dossiers as \u201ccreating\u201d a record because, on a close reading, the Amended Complaint does not actually allege this. To be sure, it alleges that dossiers were compiled, and wrongfully so. But it also groups forms of the verbs \u201ccreate,\u201d \u201ccompile,\u201d \u201cuse,\u201d and \u201cdisseminate\u201d whenever any one of them might apply, and never alleges that documents were created in connection with Mr. Leopold\u2019s improper political activity or that any of the documents the dossiers might have contained (and the Amended Complaint is understandably vague about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>their contents) was not properly in the hands of County government in the first place. The real gravamen of Count I is that personal records were compiled and used by individuals or agencies of County government who had not \u201cclearly established\u201d a need for them:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-5\">108. The records created, compiled, used, and disseminated by [appellees] about the [appellants] are \u201cpersonal records\u201d as defined by the MPIA, Md.Code Ann., State Gov\u2019t. \u00a7 10-624(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">109. There was no legitimate governmental purpose, nor any clearly established need, for [appellees] to create government records of personal information about any [appellant], and the compilation, use, and dissemination of these records by [appellees] Leopold, Anne Arundel County, and Teare violated the MPIA, Md.Code Ann., State Gov\u2019t. \u00a7 10-624(b), which provides that \u201c[p]ersonal records may not be created unless the need for the information has been clearly established by the unit collecting the records.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">110. [Appellees\u2019] violations of Md.Code Ann., State Gov\u2019t. \u00a7 10-624, give rise to claims against the [appellees] pursuant to Md.Code Ann., State Gov\u2019t. \u00a7 10-626.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">The Amended Complaint does not, therefore, present the potential question about whether the act of compiling records already in government files into a new file is the creation of a new record. And we need not address it anyway because, we hold, the alleged collection, dissemination, and use by these appellees\u2014the misconduct that the Amended Complaint actually alleges\u2014stated a claim under SG \u00a7 10-626 by itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\"><em>First, </em>there\u2019s no question that SG \u00a7 10-626 covers the same kind of records that SG \u00a7 10-624 does. Although SG \u00a7 10-626 uses the term \u201cpublic records\u201d rather than \u201cpersonal records,\u201d it equates the two by defining \u201cpublic records\u201d for its purposes as having <em>all </em>the characteristics that SG \u00a7 10-624 lists for personal records\u2014address, description, finger/voice print, number, or picture.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number><em>Second, </em>SG \u00a7 10-626 imposes liability for improper inspection or use \u201cin violation of this part III of this subtitle,\u201d SG \u00a7 10\u2014626(a)(l)(i), a reference broad enough (Part III includes SG \u00a7 10-601 through SG \u00a7 10-628) to encompass conduct under SG \u00a7 10-624. The MPIA Manual, published by the Office of the Attorney General, sees the pairing too. It explains that SG \u00a7 10-626(1) \u201capplies to personal records defined by [SG \u00a7 10-624].\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) MPIA Manual 8-3. We recognize that \u00a7 10\u2014624(b)(1) begins by stating that \u201c[personal records may not be created,\u201d and that at first blush this language might seem to put us back into the same analytical loop as before. But there is no dispute that the documents at issue were legitimately \u201ccreated\u201d in the first place by whatever unit of County government possessed them in the first place, nor any dispute that County government had met the \u201cestablished need\u201d requirement of \u00a7 10-624(b)(l) before the records were collected by Chief Teare or others and compiled into dossiers. So the fact that records were legitimately in the possession, custody, or control of County government cannot immunize from liability the officials or agencies who later re-collected and misused records they independently would have lacked any clearly established need to collect.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\"><em>Third, </em>Mr. Leopold tries to split hairs at this point by claiming that he (and others) did not violate SG \u00a7 10-626 because they didn\u2019t \u201cuse\u201d the documents they compiled into dossiers. We disagree. The act of compiling the dossiers is a \u201cuse\u201d of the documents they contained under any sensible definition of the word, even if the documents were already in hand for some other purpose. The dictionary definition, \u201cthe act or practice of employing something,\u201d Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary 1378 (11th ed.2011), already includes this notion of the term: the information put into the dossiers, once put there, was put to \u201cuse\u201d in that new capacity. And Mr. Leopold \u201cused\u201d the records a second time when he looked to the information for campaign purposes. Without first having \u201cclearly established\u201d a need for the documents, Mr. Leopold should not have been \u201cusing\u201d them at all, whether he wore his County Executive Hat or his Candidate Hat at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>Our reading of SG \u00a7 10-626 also squares with the purposes of the PIA. One general purpose\u2014to encourage disclosure\u2014 doesn\u2019t really come into play here: obviously, the \u201cdisclosure\u201d (which we address in a moment) is one the appellants would rather not have occurred. But another purpose is to protect privacy, and that purpose would be thwarted if the PIA is read to leave mandatory provisions like SG \u00a7 10-624 with no enforcement mechanism.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The penalty provisions of SG \u00a7 10-626 are meant to apply generally, and to read that section to exclude violations of SG \u00a7 10-624 would leave citizens whose rights have been violated without a remedy under the statute<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and defeat \u00a7 10-626\u2019s general remedial purpose, as well as the broader public policies underlying the PIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">2. Mr. Leopold and Chief Teare cannot invoke public official immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Mr. Leopold and Chief Teare contend that they are protected from liability under Count I by public official immu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>nity. Again, we disagree. The trial court held that because the Amended Complaint didn\u2019t allege \u201cmalice\u201d that the appellants could not defeat public official immunity. We don\u2019t see the absence of any allegation of \u201cmalice\u201d as dispositive and, in fact, the doctrine doesn\u2019t apply here in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">As the name of the doctrine suggests, public official immunity protects public officials from liability under certain circumstances in order to ensure that they are free to make decisions in the exercise of judgment \u201cin the absence of a hard and fast rule.\u201d <em>James v. Prince George\u2019s Cnty., </em>288 Md. 315, 326, 418 A.2d 1173 (1980) (citation omitted). The doctrine protects against errors in judgment that might expose an official to suit, and \u201cis intended to be a defense against claims that a \u2018better choice\u2019 could have been made by an official.\u201d <em>Lee v. Cline, </em>384 Md. 245, 261, 863 A.2d 297 (2004). But the doctrine also provides an exception: if a plaintiff can show that an official acted with gross negligence or malice, that official cannot be protected, and the parties here have gone straight to arguing that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">That said, we see no basis on which Mr. Leopold or Chief Teare could invoke the doctrine in the first place, if we assume (as we must, for purposes of reviewing a motion to dismiss) that the allegations in the Amended Complaint are true. The Court of Appeals explained in <em>Houghton v. Forrest, </em>412 Md. 578, 989 A.2d 223 (2010), that public official immunity \u201cis reserved for public officials ... who perform negligent acts during the course of their discretionary ... duties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 585, 989 A.2d 223. But we also have explained that the doctrine \u201cis quite limited and is generally applicable only in negligence actions or defamation actions based on allegedly negligent conduct.\u201d <em>Lee, </em>384 Md. at 258, 863 A.2d 297. Because the doctrine protects people who make <em>mistakes, </em>it\u2019s reserved for negligence and similar actions and by its nature can\u2019t shield someone who is doing something illegal or beyond their job description. So as we explained in <em>Lee, </em>\u201cmost alleged \u2018intentional torts\u2019 ... do not involve legitimate policy choices or actions\u201d of the type the doctrine protects. 384 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>at 261, 863 A.2d 297. But because there is no legitimate policy choice that justifies malice on the part of the public official, a plaintiff who properly alleges malice gets the opportunity to prove it. <em>But see Baltimore Police Dep\u2019t v. Cherkes, </em>140 Md.App. 282, 320, 780 A.2d 410 (2001) (\u201cA conclusory allegation that a public official acted \u2018maliciously\u2019 without any supporting allegation of fact is insufficient to defeat a motion to dismiss on the ground of public official immunity.\u201d).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The doctrine does not apply here <em>first, </em>because the acts alleged are, by their nature, intentional and not of the type protected by public official immunity. <em>Lee, </em>384 Md. at 258, 863 A.2d 297. Again, SG \u00a7 10-626 requires proof of a willful and knowing violation of the PIA, so officials are already safe from claims that fall short of that pleading standard. <em>Second, </em>at the outset, the doctrine requires that conduct occur \u201cwhile the actor was performing discretionary ... acts\u201d that he \u201cmust have performed ... <em>within the scope of his official </em>duties.\u201d <em>Thomas v. City of Annapolis, </em>113 Md.App. 440, 452, 688 A.2d 448 (1997) (emphasis added). Mr. Leopold (or Chief Teare, for that matter) cannot rationally claim that the conduct alleged here was grounded in \u201cdiscretionary acts\u201d falling within the \u201cscope of their duties.\u201d The Amended Complaint alleges that Mr. Leopold \u201cmisused\u201d EPOs, and improperly used the information they obtained for the dossiers, directed improper searches of criminal history databases with \u201cno legitimate law-enforcement purpose,\u201d and disseminated personal records for purposes of the campaign.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> If the allegations are true, both strayed well beyond the bounds of the duties of their offices and intentionally, whether or not mali<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>ciously, misused public information for illegal purposes. And as a result, neither was entitled to immunity as to Count I.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">3. The ACLU may pursue its SG \u00a7 10-626 claim against the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">In its Motion to Dismiss, the County argued that it cannot be liable for violating SG \u00a7 10-626 because it is not a \u201cperson\u201d within the meaning of that term. Although the trial court referred to this argument in its opinion, it did not explicitly rule on the question, presumably because it dismissed the claims on the ground that SG \u00a7 10-626 did not apply. But the issue was \u201craised in\u201d the trial court and it is \u201cdesirable to guide the trial court [and] avoid the expense and delay of another appeal\u201d by addressing it now. Md. Rule 8-131(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Section 10-626 states that \u201c[a] person, including an officer or employee of a governmental unit\u201d is liable for permitting inspection or use knowingly and willfully. At the outset, this looks like a <em>person </em>must make the decision, not an organization. Nevertheless, the term \u201cperson\u201d is defined elsewhere in the article to include not just individuals: \u201c \u2018Person\u2019 means an individual, receiver, trustee, guardian, personal representative, fiduciary, or representative of any kind and any <em>partnership, firm, association, corporation, or other </em>entity.\u201d SG \u00a7 1-101(d).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) The broad purposes of the PIA counsel in favor of interpreting any ambiguity to include the County\u2014the body for whom both Mr. Leopold and Chief Teare work, the public entity that possesses the records at documents at issue, and the government whose purposes the records were meant to fulfill in the first place. The Maryland Code includes numerous other instances where a \u201cperson\u201d includes not just people, but groups, and where willfulness and intentional conduct may be imputed to such a body,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>although the linguistic fit isn\u2019t perfect, we err in this context on the side of public accountability.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">4. Available damages</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">In its opinion, the trial court leapfrogged over the liability issue and went directly to damages, and concluded that the appellants had pled only emotional damages that weren\u2019t recoverable under the PIA. By doing so, the trial court prematurely denied the appellants any opportunity to litigate their damages. (We express no opinion as to whether the appellants could, at this stage in the game, amend the Complaint to include other damages.) The trial court saw the Amended Complaint as pleading only emotional damages, then analyzed the availability of those damages against the pleading requirement for a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress (citing <em>Silkworth, </em>70 Md.App. at 271, 520 A.2d 1124, for the proposition that a defendant\u2019s conduct must be \u201cextreme and outrageous,\u201d for a plaintiff to recover). But here, the availability of damages arises under the statutory remedy in SG \u00a7 10-626, which includes no such requirement. Instead, SG \u00a7 10-626(a) provides for \u201cactual damages\u201d and, importantly, SG \u00a7 10-626(b) permits for an award of attorney\u2019s fees \u201c[i]f the court determines that the complainant has substantially prevailed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>We agree that the \u201cactual damages\u201d language of the statute requires something other than emotional damages, and it may be that the appellants can amend the complaint to include a claim for, for example, reputational harm of the type noted by the appellants\u2019 counsel at oral argument. <em>See, e.g., Jacron Sales Co. v. Sindorf, </em>276 Md. 580, 587, 350 A.2d 688 (1976) (citing to the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., </em>418 U.S. 323, 393, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974), in which that Court had held that with respect to damages in a defamation claim brought by a private individual, \u201c \u2018actual injury\u2019 was not confined to out-of-pocket loss, but may include \u2018impairment of reputation and standing in the community, personal humiliation, and mental anguish and suffering.\u2019 \u201d). But although we do not mean to suggest one way or the other that the appellants have or ultimately could demonstrate damages sufficient to satisfy the \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d standard of SG \u00a7 10-626, the trial court evaluated the allegations against the level of proof ultimately required at trial, not, as the motion to dismiss posture required, by assuming that the allegations were true.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Importantly, the appellants also sought the remedy of declaratory relief (in the form of a declaratory judgment to the effect that the appellees had violated SG \u00a7 10-626). The trial court didn\u2019t really address this point, but we do not see how that claim would be foreclosed simply because emotional damages are not available here. Moreover, there is no reason that the appellants couldn\u2019t establish a violation and be awarded nominal damages. <em>See Brown v. Smith, </em>173 Md.App. 459, 483, 920 A.2d 18 (2007) (\u201cWhen a court ... makes a nominal damages award, ... it need not focus on the injury to the plaintiff, but merely on recognition of the right.\u201d (citation omitted)). This might qualify as \u201csubstantially prevailing]\u201d and entitle them to some award of counsel fees and litigation costs, even if their actual damages fall short. Again, we offer no views on the merits of the liability or damages issues but we reverse the trial court\u2019s decision to grant the appellees\u2019 Motion to Dismiss Count I, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>B. The Trial Court Properly Granted Summary Judgment On Count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The appellants contend next that the trial judge improperly granted summary judgment to the appellees on Count II. In that count, the appellants sought further production of documents and complained of untimely disclosure. They argue not only that the trial court erred in granting the appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment, but that it should have granted <em>their </em>motion for partial summary judgment because the appellees failed to provide timely responses to their PIA requests.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> They also argue that the trial court erred when it held that Mr. Leopold and Chief Teare were not \u201ccustodians\u201d of the records; that status arguably would have obligated each to respond to the appellants\u2019 requests independently and beyond the County\u2019s response. The County counters that it provided adequate responses within the required time period, and Mr. Leopold and Chief Teare each claim they did not serve as a custodian of records and the County responded adequately.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\"><em>First, </em>with respect to timeliness, the requests on their face covered a broad array of potentially responsive documents, and the back-and-forth regarding the scope of production revealed that producing them would not be a simple task. Although we agree that the statute provides for disclosure within 30 days, see SG \u00a7 10\u2014614(b)(1) (and even states that the requester can only consent to a 30-day extension, SG \u00a7 10-614(b)(4)), the County <em>did </em>respond to the original request within thirty days with respect to each of the five requests. In a perfect world, the process would have moved more quickly, but we find no error in the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that the ongoing dialogue among the parties that followed represented a reasonable part of the process in light of the breadth of the requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number><em>Second, </em>the trial court did not err in holding that Mr. Leopold and Chief Teare were not \u201ccustodians\u201d of the requested records. So long as the County\u2019s response included all of the documents and records in the possession, custody, or control of the individual County employees who possessed potentially responsive materials\u2014and the record reveals that it did\u2014the PIA does not require the individuals to respond independently.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><em>Third, </em>we disagree with the appellants that the trial court misread <em>Ireland v. Shearin, </em>417 Md. 401, 10 A.3d 754 (2010), to hold that Mr. Leopold and Chief Teare were not custodians. Mr. Ireland, a prison inmate, sought records relating to correctional institution medical providers by sending a letter to the institution\u2019s warden, and the warden (mis)directed him to make separate requests to each department. The circuit court dismissed Mr. Ireland\u2019s complaint, in which he alleged PIA violations and sought punitive damages, and the Court of Appeals reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">In that case, though, the higher-level official tried to kick the PIA responsibility down the chain of command. The Court of Appeals looked at SG \u00a7 10\u2014611(c), which defines a custodian \u201cas someone who is the \u2018official custodian\u2019 or \u2018any other authorized individual who has physical custody and control of a public record.\u2019 \u201d \u201cOfficial custodian,\u201d in turn, was defined at the time as \u201can officer or employee of the State or of a political subdivision who, whether or not the officer or employee has physical custody and control of a public record, is responsible for keeping the public record.\u201d The court concluded that a warden, whose position fell under the definition of \u201cmanaging official,\u201d <em>see </em>Md.Code (1999, 2008 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 l-101(k) of the Correctional Services Article, was an \u201cofficial custodian.\u201d <em>Ireland, </em>417 Md. at 409, 10 A.3d 754. As such, even if the warden believed that Mr. Ireland\u2019s requests were better directed elsewhere, it was incumbent upon him to \u201ccollect and assemble the requested records,\u201d rather than to pass that burden on to the requester. <em>Id. </em>at 410, 10 A.3d 754. The Court also pointed out that the warden <em>would </em>have complied with the PIA if he had \u201ctimely directed his subor-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>d\u00ed\u00f1ate departments to produce the requested records for inspection\u201d instead of rejecting Mr. Ireland\u2019s request altogether. <em>Id. </em>at 411,10 A.3d 754.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Here, on the other hand, the County assumed responsibility for responding on behalf of all of the appellees, including Mr. Leopold and Chief Teare. Chief Teare was no longer in office when the appellants added him to the Complaint, so he was not an \u201cofficial\u201d anything at that point, and the record reveals no suggestion that he had or controlled records beyond those in the County\u2019s files. And as to both Chief Teare and Mr. Leopold, the requests were directed to the individual employees or a custodian <em>in the alternative: </em>to \u201cMr. John Leopold <em>(Or Custodian of Records) </em>\u201d at the Office of the County Executive, and to \u201cChief James Teare (Or <em>Custodian of Records </em>\u201d at the Police Department. (Emphasis added.) Responses came from Lieutenant James Davis (who listed under his signature, \u201cCustodian of Records for this Response\u201d in one instance, and prefaced other responses with \u201cI am responding to these request as the Custodian of records for the Police Department.\u201d) David Abrams, as \u201cDirector of Communications,\u201d sent a first response to the ACLU \u201con behalf of the Office of the County Executive.\u201d We agree with the circuit court that those responses covered the parties from whom information was requested, and neither Mr. Leopold nor Chief Teare had an independent obligation to respond, at least in the absence of evidence that the County\u2019s response did not cover the individuals fully.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">C. The Trial Court Properly Granted The County\u2019s Motion To Dismiss Count III.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The parties treated the Bergin tapes differently from the remaining records because the County withheld them, for a time, on the grounds that the pending criminal proceedings against Mr. Leopold and the attendant investigation required them to do so. <em>See </em>SG \u00a7 10-618(f)(l)(i). The circuit court agreed with the County, and the appellants argue here that the tapes were not part of the investigation against Mr. Leopold, but instead were part of a <em>different </em>investigation\u2014a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>brief investigation in spring 2011 relating to \u201crumors that certain EPOs were working excessive overtime.\u201d Counsel for the appellants conceded at oral argument, though, that if we were to agree with the circuit court that the tapes constituted part of the Leopold investigation, the County properly withheld them. Based on the affidavit that the County presented with its Motion for Summary Judgment, which the ACLU did not counter with any contradictory factual allegations, the circuit court properly determined that to be the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">There are two different bases for disagreement here, but only one of them matters. <em>First, </em>the appellants claim that the County wrongly invoked SG \u00a7 10\u2014618(f) to withhold the Ber-gin tapes because, they claim, the Bergin tapes (1) could only be withheld under SG \u00a7 10-619, which would have required the County to obtain a court order, and (2) weren\u2019t part of the prosecution of Mr. Leopold but of a different investigation. <em>Second, </em>the County claims that the Count III is moot in any event, because the Bergin tapes have been produced. We agree with the County that the issue is now moot, and we therefore decline to address the appellants\u2019 arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">A declaratory judgment action is moot where it \u201cdoes not serve a useful purpose,\u201d <em>Polakoff v. Hampton, </em>148 Md.App. 13, 27, 810 A.2d 1029 (2002) (citation omitted). Although the appellants claim they are \u201cin doubt as to [their] legal rights,\u201d citing <em>Carroll Cnty. Ethics Comm. v. Lennon, </em>119 Md.App. 49, 58, 703 A.2d 1338 (1998), we see no such doubt now that the Bergin tapes have been produced. <em>Hammen v. Baltimore Cnty. Police Dep\u2019t, </em>373 Md. 440, 818 A.2d 1125 (2003), does not compel a contrary conclusion. In that case, the Baltimore County Police Department declined to disclose a surveillance tape until Mr. Hammen consented to be deposed and the deposition took place. <em>Id. </em>at 447, 818 A.2d 1125. By the time the case reached the Court of Appeals, the videotape had been disclosed, but the Court reached the merits anyway because, it held, the issue raised public concerns, was capable of repetition yet evading review, and because the Court believed it likely that \u201cthis same situation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>could repeat itself where a surveillance video is involved and the custodian of the record chooses to hold the surveillance video in spite of the MPIA request until the person making the request agreed to first be deposed in the independent administrative proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 452, 818 A.2d 1125.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">We agree with the trial court that \u201cthe matters asserted in the pending complaint are of the utmost interest and concern to the citizenry of Anne Arundel County and the State of Maryland.\u201d That said, the Bergin tapes were withheld, as the PIA permits, because they related to a pending criminal investigation that led ultimately to Mr. Leopold\u2019s conviction. Although Mr. Leopold\u2019s behavior reminds us that \u201c[t]hose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it,\u201d George Santayana, <em>The Life of Reason I </em>(quoted in <em>Bartlett\u2019s Familiar Quotations </em>584 (18th ed.2012)), the issues at stake in Count III are fundamentally fact-bound, and this case demonstrates ably that a similarly misguided future official\u2019s conduct will not evade review.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY REVERSED AS TO COUNT I, AFFIRMED AS TO COUNTS II AND III.

At the time of the appellants\u2019 requests and through the circuit court's disposition of this case, the PIA appeared in a different part of the Maryland Code. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1984, 2009 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-604 <em>et seq. </em>of the State Government Article (\"SG\u201d). The revisions substantially reorganized the PIA, but did not change any of the relevant language.

The appellants present the following questions on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-9\">1. Did the trial court err when it granted Appellees' motion to dismiss Count I, even though the Amended Complaint alleges in detail, and the undisputed facts support, that Appellees created, used, and disseminated government records containing personal information?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-10\">2. Did the trial court err when it granted summary judgment as to Count II in favor of Appellees, despite their failure timely to produce documents in response to Appellants' MPIA requests?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-11\">3. Did the trial court err when it granted Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss Count III, even though the County failed to turn over certain responsive records and failed to comply with the MPIA's specified temporary denial procedure?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-12\">4. Did the trial court err when it denied Appellants' motion for partial summary judgment as to Count II based on the County Appellees' untimely responses to Appellants' MPIA requests?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-13\">5. Did the trial court err in denying Appellant\u2019s declaratory relief, despite the on-going dispute between Appellants and Appellees?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b134-16\">. Nobody disputes that the records the appellants requested, <em>i.e., </em>the contents of the dossiers, satisfy the threshold PIA definition of \"public records,\u201d \"the original or any copy of any documentary material that: (i) is made by a unit or instrumentality of State government or of a political subdivision or received by the unit or instrumentality in connection with the transaction of public business; and (ii) is in any form,....\u201d SG \u00a7 10-611(h)(1). (The omitted portion of the subsection includes a non-exhaustive list of physical and electronic forms that public records might take.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b136-9\">. We also disagree with the trial court\u2019s analysis of the appellants\u2019 PIA claim as a tort claim for emotional damages. Count I states a purely statutory claim. And although there are, as we discuss, unresolved questions about the authority for and scope of remedies for violations of the PIA, SG \u00a7 10-626 unquestionably provides <em>some </em>cause of action, and the statute contains no suggestion that emotional distress is a required element of any PIA claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b138-10\">. And although headings inserted by publishers have no legal significance, the heading actually titles SG \u00a7 10-626 \"Unlawful disclosure of <em>personal </em>records.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b140-7\">. That purpose finds further support in one of the PIA\u2019s early sections, which prohibits certain government entities from keeping unnecessary personal information in the first instance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-8\"><em>The State, </em>a political subdivision, or a unit of the State or of a political subdivision <em>may keep only the information about a person that:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-9\">(1) <em>is needed by the State, </em>the political subdivision, or the unit <em>to accomplish a governmental purpose that is authorized or required to be accomplished </em>under:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-10\">(1) a statute or any other legislative mandate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-11\">(ii) an executive order of the Governor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-12\">(iii) an executive order of the chief executive of a local jurisdiction; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-13\">(iv) a judicial rule; <em>and</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-14\">(2) <em>is relevant to accomplishment of the purpose.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-15\">SG \u00a7 10-602 (now GP \u00a7 4-102) (emphasis added). Like the limitation in SG \u00a7 10-624, this provision contains no independent basis for recovery, but it demonstrates nonetheless the statute's purpose to keep personal information private except when a particular State need justifies retention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b140-16\">. Although the trial court noted that the appellants could conceivably have a separate tort cause of action, the potential existence of such a remedy does not justify foreclosing recovery under the PIA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b142-6\">. The trial court unwittingly turned <em>Cherkes </em>inside out: where <em>Cherlces </em>suggests that alleging \u201cmalice\u201d without more isn\u2019t enough, here the trial court held that saying everything <em>other than </em>\u201cmalice\u201d wasn\u2019t enough. We don\u2019t believe either is the case\u2014the right to immunity really depends on the circumstances surrounding particular conduct and the specific allegations in a given complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b142-7\">. To be sure, Chief Teare was not alleged to be the driver behind this scheme. But the Amended Complaint does allege that he acted with knowledge that dossiers contained information that violated local, State, and federal law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b143-8\">. Again, we cite the provision that was in effect at the time of the circuit court's decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b143-9\">. <em>See, e.g., </em>Md.Code (1974, 2007 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-210.2 of the Agriculture Article (imposing civil penalties for \u201cwillfulness\u201d of conduct and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>whether the violation was \"known\u201d by the wrong-doer, and defining \"person\u201d at \u00a7 1\u2014101 (g) as \"the State, any county, municipal corporation or other political subdivision of the State, or any of their units, or an individual, receiver, trustee, guardian, executor, administrator, fiduciary, or representative of any kind, or any partnership, firm, association, public or private corporation, or any other entity, unless otherwise provided\u201d); Md.Code (2006, 2013 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-402 of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (prohibiting \"willful\u201d and \"knowing\u201d wiretapping and electronic surveillance by persons, which under \u00a7 10-401 includes \"any employee or agent of this State or a political subdivision thereof, and any individual, partnership, association, joint stock company, trust, or corporation\u201d); Md.Code (1996, 2007 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 9-413 of the Environment Article (imposing civil penalties for \"willful\u201d violations by \"persons,\u201d defined under \u00a7 9-401 to include \"...
