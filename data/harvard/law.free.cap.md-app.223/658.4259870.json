Smith, the appellant, sued Rowhouses, Inc. (\u201cR.I.\u201d), the appellee, for negligence, alleging that she suffered injuries as a result of ingesting lead-based paint inside a property managed by R.I., in which she had lived in the early 1990\u2019s. The circuit court granted summary judgment on the basis of causation. On appeal, Smith asks whether that ruling was legally incorrect. For the reasons stated below, we shall reverse the judgment and remand the case to the circuit court for further proceedings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b682-10\">Smith was born on October 21, 1991. According to Smith\u2019s mother, Doris Plater, at the time of Smith\u2019s birth, they were living in Baltimore City, at 418 South Monroe Street (the \u201cMonroe Street Property\u201d). To Plater\u2019s observation, that property was in \u201cgood condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">No later than the spring of 1992, Plater and Smith moved to 1622 East Oliver Street (the \u201cOliver Street Property\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>About \u201cthree to four months\u201d after they moved in, the paint \u201cstarted chipping and peeling\u201d on the \u201c[wjindowsills, the banister and baseboards.\u201d Plater also saw dust on the floor. Plater frequently saw Smith putting her hands on these areas and then in her mouth. In the spring of 1993, Plater and Smith moved from the Oliver Street Property to 1508 North Collington Avenue (the \u201cCollington Street Property\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">While residing at these three properties, Plater took Smith to visit her grandmother at 2017 Ashland Avenue (the \u201cAsh-land Avenue Property\u201d) \u201c[e]very week\u201d for \u201c[t]wo, three hours.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plater never saw any chipping, flaking, or peeling paint at the Ashland Avenue Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">As a young child, Smith was tested for lead, with the following relevant blood-lead level results:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-7\">\n<em>Date Blood Lead Level</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-8\">9/25/92 11 ig/dL<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-9\">5/28/93 7 ig/dL</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-10\">9/21/93 15 ig/dL</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-11\">As noted, the Oliver Street Property was managed by R.I. at the time that Smith was living there. On October 24, 2011, Smith filed suit against R.I.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> By then, the Oliver Street <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Property had been razed. There were no lead paint abatement notices for that property or any other documents showing whether or not there was lead-based paint in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The parties engaged in discovery and identified expert witnesses. Smith named Robert K. Simon, Ph.D., as an expert in \u201ctoxicology, lead risk assessment and industrial hygiene.\u201d On October 11, 2013, he prepared a report stating that deed records \u201cshowed that the [Oliver Street Property] was built mostly [sic] likely in the early 1900s or before,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he age of this house would presume the presence of lead based paint.\u201d He opined \u201cto a reasonable degree of scientific probability that [Smith] was ... exposed to lead based paint hazards during her residence at\u201d the Oliver Street Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Dr. Simon\u2019s deposition was taken on May 5, 2014. He testified that \u201cin Maryland if your property is built before 1950, then COMAR 26.16 says you presume it contains lead-based paint unless you\u2019ve tested it to prove it doesn\u2019t... .\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Defense counsel questioned Dr. Simon about the significance of this presumption to his opinions in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Doctor, you mentioned that you presume that a property contains lead-based paint or contains lead based on its age, particularly if it is built before 1950, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-8\">[DR. SIMON]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: If we take away the age of the property in this case, are you able to make a determination or an opinion that there was lead in the property without having any information about the age if we didn\u2019t know that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-5\">[DR. SIMON]: I don\u2019t know the answer to that question because if you\u2019re taking the age away, then what do I know about the property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Assuming you have all the other information that you have here today, if you didn\u2019t know the age of the property, would you then be able to opine that there was lead or lead-based paint hazards inside [the Oliver Street Property]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-7\">[DR. SIMON]: No....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">Dr. Simon also opined that the Oliver Street Property was a \u201csubstantial contributing source[ ]\u201d of Smith\u2019s lead exposure. He stated that he based this opinion on the \u201ctestimony of deteriorated paint\u201d at the Oliver Street Property, Smith\u2019s \u201chand to mouth activity,\u201d and Smith\u2019s elevated \u201cblood lead levels\u201d while she was residing at the Oliver Street Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">R.I. filed a motion for summary judgment. It argued that Dr. Simon\u2019s opinion testimony that there was lead-based paint in the Oliver Street Property was not admissible because it lacked an adequate factual foundation; and Smith had no other admissible evidence to show that the Oliver Street Property contained lead-based paint. Without evidence that there was lead-based paint at the Oliver Street Property, Smith could not prove causation, <em>i.e., </em>that negligence on the part of R.I. was a substantial contributing factor to her injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">Smith filed an opposition in which she asserted that there was a genuine dispute of material fact precluding the grant of summary judgment. She attached an affidavit by Plater in which Plater attested that while she and Smith were living at the Oliver Street Property, Smith \u201coccasionally visited her grandmother at [the Ashland Avenue Property]\u201d but Plater \u201cnever saw chipping, peeling or flaking paint at [that] proper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>ty.\u201d Plater further attested that when they were living at the Oliver Street Property, Smith \u201chad no contact with old battery casings, lead figures, painted toys, plastic jewelry, naval paint, bullets, fishing weights, ceramic pottery, folk medicine or any other source of lead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The court held a hearing on R.I.\u2019s summary judgment motion on June 27, 2014. Following arguments of counsel, the court granted summary judgment in favor of R.I. It ruled that Dr. Simon\u2019s opinion that there was lead-based paint in the Oliver Street Property, based solely on the age of the property, was not adequate to prove the presence of lead-based paint at that property. The court further ruled that Smith did not otherwise have circumstantial evidence that the Oliver Street Property was \u201ca source of lead exposure in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">On July 2, 2014, the court entered an order granting summary judgment in favor of R.I. Smith filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">We will include additional facts as necessary to our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">Summary judgment may be granted when there is no genuine dispute of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Md. Rule 2\u2014501(f). We review a circuit court\u2019s decision to grant a motion for summary judgment <em>de novo. Kirson, </em>439 Md. at 522, 96 A.3d 714 (\u201c[T]he standard for appellate review of a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion for summary judgment is simply whether the trial court was legally correct, and is subject to no deference.\u201d (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnP\">As such, in reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we review independently the record to determine whether the parties generated a dispute of material fact and, if not, whether the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We review the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and construe any reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>able inferences that may be drawn from the well-plead facts against the moving party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-5\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). \u201c[I]n order to defeat a motion for summary judgment, the opposing party must show that there is a genuine dispute as to a material fact by proffering facts which would be admissible in evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 522-23, 96 A.3d 714 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">The parties agree that there is no direct evidence to show that there was lead-based paint at the Oliver Street Property. Smith contends the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of R.I. because she had adequate admissible circumstantial evidence that there was lead-based paint in the Oliver Street Property. Therefore, \u201cthere is a genuine dispute of fact regarding whether [the Oliver Street Property] caused [her elevated] blood-lead levels.\u201d R.I. responds that \u201c[t]here can be no dispute of fact here because [Smith] completely failed to establish the necessary predicate that [the Oliver Street Property] contained lead-based paint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-9\">We first consider whether the circuit court was legally correct in ruling that Dr. Simon\u2019s opinion that there was lead-based paint inside the Oliver Street Property lacked an adequate factual foundation, and therefore would not be admissible at trial. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-702 (In determining whether \u201c[e]xpert testimony may be admitted, in the form of an opinion or otherwise, ... the court shall determine ... whether a sufficient factual basis exists to support the expert testimony.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">To prove the causation element of negligence in a lead paint case, the plaintiff must introduce evidence to show \u201c(1) that the property contained lead-based paint and (2) that the lead-based paint at the subject property was a substantial contributor to the [plaintiffs] exposure to lead.\u201d <em>Kirson, </em>439 Md. at 529-30, 96 A.3d 714. In his deposition, Dr. Simon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>opined: 1) that the Oliver Street Property contained lead-based paint; and 2) there was chipping and peeling paint at the Oliver Street Property, so the lead-based paint at that property was a \u201csubstantial contributing source[ ]\u201d of Smith\u2019s lead exposure. As Dr. Smith acknowledged, the sole basis for his opinion that the Oliver Street Property contained lead-based paint was his presumption that, because the Property was built before 1950, it contained lead-based paint.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">The presence of lead-based paint inside a property may not be proven based upon the age of the property alone. The <em>Kirson </em>Court explained that an expert witness may not base his</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\">conclusion that [a particular] house contained lead-based paint on a presumption that houses built during a certain time period contain typically lead-based paint. Such a factual basis is insufficient for an expert to reach the conclusion that the interior of a specific property contained lead-based paint during the relevant time period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">439 Md. at 544, 96 A.3d 714. <em>See also Hamilton v. Dackman, </em>213 Md.App. 589, 612, 75 A.3d 327 (2013) (\u201c '[T]he mere fact that most old houses in Baltimore have lead-based paint does not mean that a particular old Baltimore house has a similar deficiency.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Davis v. Goodman, </em>117 Md.App. 378, 393, 700 A.2d 798 (1997))).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">Dr. Simon\u2019s opinion that there was lead-based paint inside the Oliver Street Property rested solely on an inadequate factual foundation. Therefore it was not admissible, and the circuit court correctly ruled that it could not be used to prove causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-10\">Smith contends that, even without Dr. Simon\u2019s testimony, there was sufficient admissible circumstantial evidence to permit a reasonable fact-finder to infer that the Oliver Street Property \u201cwas the only possible source of her lead exposure,\u201d and therefore there was lead-based paint at that property.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>R.I. counters that \u201cthe circumstantial evidence produced [by Smith]\u201d was legally insufficient to prove causation. Specifically, her evidence could not support a reasonable inference \u201c(i) that [the Oliver Street Property] contained lead-based paint; and (ii) that the lead-based paint at [the Oliver Street Property] was a substantial contributor to [Smith\u2019s] exposure to lead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Smith maintains that the facts here are \u201cclosely analogous to the facts of\" <em>Dow v. L &amp; R Properties, Inc., </em>144 Md.App. 67, 796 A.2d 139 (2002). In <em>Dow, </em>the plaintiff was claiming that she had been exposed to lead-based paint while living at 1237 Myrtle Avenue, a property managed by the defendant. The defendant did not dispute that the Myrtle Avenue Property \u201cwas in existence as early as 1935,\u201d that the plaintiff had consumed paint chips there, and that the plaintiff was diagnosed with lead poisoning while residing there. <em>Id. </em>at 75-76, 796 A.2d 139. It moved for summary judgment, however, on the ground that \u201cthere was no evidence that lead based paint existed\u201d in the Myrtle Avenue Property. <em>Id. </em>at 70, 796 A.2d 139 (internal quotation marks omitted). In opposition, the plaintiff submitted an affidavit by her mother, who attested that the plaintiff \u201cspent virtually all of the relevant time at\u201d the Myrtle Avenue Property and \u201ccould not have been exposed to lead anyplace else.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 75, 796 A.2d 139. The circuit court granted the summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">On appeal, this Court reversed. We held that the affidavit, \u201ccoupled with the undisputed fact that homes built before 1950 often contain lead-based paint, could indeed support an inference that the paint in question contained lead.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 76, 796 A.2d 139. \u201cViewing the circumstantial evidence and the inferences that could be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to\u201d the plaintiff \u201ccould properly establish that the paint in question was lead based and thus caused [her] alleged injuries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 74-75, 796 A.2d 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">Recently, in <em>Kirson, </em>the Court of Appeals endorsed the <em>Dow </em>method of proving causation. 439 Md. 501, 96 A.3d 714. It explained that, if \u201ca plaintiff relies on a <em>Dow </em>theory of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>causation ..., [she] must rule out other reasonably probable sources of lead exposure in order to prove that it is probable that the subject property contained lead-based paint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 536, 96 A.3d 714.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">We return to the case at bar. The evidence on the summary judgment record, when viewed in the light most favorable to Smith, showed that there was admissible evidence to prove the following facts: (1) from not long after her birth and for the next year, Smith spent the majority of her time at the Oliver Street Property, which contained peeling, chipping, and flaking interior paint; (2) the Monroe Street Property, where Smith lived before moving to the Oliver Street Property, was in \u201c[g]ood condition,\u201d meaning that it did not have the peeling, chipping, or flaking interior paint that later was seen at the Oliver Street Property;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (3) the Ashland Avenue Property, which Smith visited frequently, did not have peeling, chipping, or flaking interior paint; (4) while living at the Oliver Street Property, Smith often was seen with her hands on interior areas that had peeling, chipping, and flaking paint and then with her hands in her mouth; (5) Smith had her first elevated blood-lead level when she was living at the Oliver Street Property; (6) Smith did not have contact with any other known source of exposure to lead at that time; and (7) the Oliver Street Property was built before 1950. Under <em>Kirson </em>and <em>Dow, </em>this evidence could support a reasonable inference by the trier-of-fact that the Oliver Street Property was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>only <em>reasonably probable </em>source of the lead to which Smith was exposed before she first tested positive for lead on September 25,1992. Because there was adequate circumstantial evidence on the summary judgment record to show the presence of lead-based paint in the Oliver Street Property when Smith was living there, summary judgment should not have been granted in favor of R.I. on the negligence count.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY ON NEGLIGENCE COUNT REVERSED. JUDGMENT OTHERWISE AFFIRMED. CASE REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION. COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b682-12\">. Smith included in her complaint a count alleging unfair trade practices. The circuit court granted summary judgment on that count as well. Smith does not challenge that ruling on appeal. Accordingly, summary judgment is not being reversed on that claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b682-13\">. In her deposition, Plater testified that she and Smith moved out of the Monroe Street Property and into the Oliver Street Property in the spring of 1992. In a later filed affidavit, Plater attested that they moved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>out of the Monroe Street Property and into the Oliver Street Property in \"approximately 1991.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b683-13\">. In their briefs and during oral arguments, the parties disagreed about whether Plater testified that Smith visited the Ashland Avenue Property every week while she resided at the Oliver Street Property. During her deposition, Plater testified that, while residing at the Monroe Street Property, she took Smith to the Ashland Avenue Property \"[ejveiy week.\u201d Then, defense counsel asked Plater if she took Smith to the Ashland Avenue Property \"every other week like [she did] when [she was] at [the Monroe Street Property].\u201d Plater responded, \"Yes.\u201d Any dispute concerning this factual issue is not material to the issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b683-14\">. Smith also had elevated blood lead levels in 1994 and 1995. Those test results are not relevant to the issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b683-15\">. |xg/dl stands for micrograms per deciliter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b683-16\">. Smith also included as a defendant the owner of the Collington Avenue Property. She voluntarily dismissed the complaint against that defendant with prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b684-10\">. COMAR 26.16.01 is titled \"Accreditation and Training for Lead Paint Abatement Services.\u201d Regulation .03(A) of that chapter, titled \"Applicability of this Chapter,\u201d states: \"The presence of a lead-containing substance is presumed in any residential building constructed before 1950 unless a person determines that all painted surfaces are lead-free. ...\u201d Smith does not contend this regulation creates a presumption applicable to lead paint negligence cases. This regulation became effective on August 12, 1996, almost 18 years before the Court of Appeals held in <em>Hamilton v. Kirson, </em>439 Md. 501, 96 A.3d 714 (2014), that the age of a property alone is not a sufficient factual basis to support a finding that it contained lead-based paint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b690-6\">. The <em>Kirson </em>Court made clear that the <em>Dow </em>method is not the only way to use circumstantial evidence to prove that the property in question contained lead-based paint. For example, evidence that the property was a row house sharing common walls with two adjacent row houses that were built at the same time by a common owner, and both of which contained lead-based paint, could support a reasonable inference that the property in question also contained lead-based paint. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b690-7\">. At deposition, when asked about the condition of the Monroe Street Property, Plater stated that it was in \"[g]ood condition.\u201d Shortly thereafter, she was asked about the condition of the Oliver Street Property, and responded that it had \"[ch]ipping and peeling paint\u201d inside. In this context, it is reasonable to infer from Plater's testimony that there were no paint defects at the Monroe Street Property.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
