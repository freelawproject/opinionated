Where in an action on an account to recover for' services rendered, the petition of plaintiff is in the short form authorized by Section 5086, Revised Statutes,' such petition must be construed to contain and by implication allege, all those facts which it would otherwise be necessary to specifically aver in the statement of a sufficient cause of action, and every fact thus averred by implication is traversed and put in issue by the general denial.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b172-9\">2. When by way of answer to such a petition the defendant in addition to pleading the general denial, further alleges that the services performed by the plaintiff were rendered and performed by him under .an express contract the terms of which preclude the , recovery of compensation therefor, such averments do not constitute an affirmative defense of new matter requiring a reply, and the filing of a reply thereto does not operate to change or enlarge the issues, or to shift the burden of proof. The legal effect of such an answer taken as a whole, is merely to deny the cause - of action asserted by plaintiff in his petition, and the burden of proof upon the issues thus joined rests with the plaintiff, and the court of common pleas did not err in so instructing the jury in the present case. <em>(Sanns </em>v. <em>Neal, </em>52 Ohio St., 56, distinguished.)</syllabus>\n<docketnumber data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"docketnumber\" id=\"b172-11\">(No. 12169</docketnumber>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A4-\">Decided November 22, 1910.)</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-12\">Error to the Circuit Court of Lorain county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-13\">Arland W.

Said defendant, at that time, was the owner of certain booking rights, which in theatrical circles is known as a-\u2018franchise\u2019 for the city of Lorain, which were to expire in October, 1907, and which franchise was only valuable to said defendant in case he could procure a lease of a theater in which to commence playing shows in Lorain, prior to said date, to-wit, October 1st, 1907, and for which franchise said defendant- had expended a considerable sum of money. Said plaintiff had full knowledge of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>facts and desiring as well a commission, which is a p\u00e9rcentage upon the cost of the building for which his plans and specifications should be furnished and including the superintendence of its erection, which commission is very greatly in excess of the actual cost of the production of such plans and specifications; entered into an agreement with the said defendant as aforesaid, to furnish plans and specifications for a theater building for Lorain, as against defendant\u2019s franchise rights, and that they, together, would endeavor to secure the money by the organization of a company and sale of stock or by such other means as were feasible in order to build such theater.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-6\">\u201cIt was further agreed that said building should not cost, including the architect\u2019s commission, to exceed thirty-five thousand dollars ($35,000.00), 'rung up,\u2019 which is to say, 'complete and ready for use.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-7\">\u201cThat in the event they were successful, said plaintiff was to receive a commission of five (5) per cent, upon the full cost of said building.

Upon the trial of this cause in the court of common pleas, the evidence and arguments being closed, the court among other things instructed the jury that under the pleadings the burden of proof upon the issues joined was upon the plaintiff, and refused to charge as requested by counsel for the plaintiff, \u201cthat the burden of proof was upon the defendant to establish the defense set up in his answer.\u201d The circuit court found and held that the instruction given, which imposed upon plaintiff the burden of proof, was erroneous, and for that reason and upon that ground alone reversed the judgment of the trial court, in this we think the circuit court erred. The petition of plaintiff in this case was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>upon an account for services rendered and was in the short form authorized by Section 5086, Revised Statutes, which section so far as its provisions are here material reads as follows: \u201cIn an action * * * upon an account * * * it shall be sufficient for a party to set forth a copy of the account * * * with all credits * * * thereon and to state that there is due to him on such account * * * from the adverse party a specified sum which he claims with interest.\u201d By the enactment of this statute the legislature obviously intended that the statements therein prescribed, when adopted by the pleader, should be held the equivalent of, and should imply and import all that it would otherwise be necessary to specifically allege in the statement of a sufficient cause of action. Hence, every fact thus averred by implication must be held to be traversed and put in issue by the general denial. In the present case the defendant, A. W. Johnson, by way of answer, in addition to pleading the general denial, further alleged that the services counted upon by plaintiff in his petition were services performed' by him under and pursuant to an express agreement made and entered into between plaintiff and defendant the terms of which were fully set out in said answer. After the general denial, the pleading of this contract was wholly unnecessary, for it tendered no new or separate issue and in legal effect amounted only to a denial of the averments of plaintiff\u2019s petition; it was not a plea of new matter by way of confession and avoidance, hence no reply thereto was necessary, and the reply filed - was without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>legal effect to either change or enlarge the issues, or to shift the burden of proof. The attitude of the defendant under the pleadings in this case was purely defensive, and his answer in legal effect merely a denial of the cause of action asserted by plaintiff in his petition. The burden of proof was therefore on the plaintiff, and the court of common pleas properly so instructed the jury. <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>Green, </em>35 Ohio St., 104; <em>Mehurin </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>37 Ohio St., 49; <em>The Koppitz-Melchers Brewing Co. </em>v. <em>Schultz, </em>68 Ohio St., 407; <em>The List &amp; Son Co. </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>80 Ohio St., 42; <em>Ginn </em>v. <em>Dolan, </em>81 Ohio St., 121; 9 Cyc., 735. It would seem from the opinion of the circuit court in this case, \u2014 which opinion we now have before us, \u2014 that notwithstanding that court entertained the view that the rule as herein above announced is the correct rule, it nevertheless felt constrained to enter the judgment it did, because of the interpretation placed by it upon a former decision of this supreme court. The circuit court in its opinion says: \u201cIf the matter were one of first impression with us we should approve this rule (that the burden of proof was on the plaintiff), but we feel bound by the rule of <em>Sanns et al. </em>v. <em>Neal, 52 </em>Ohio St., 56, which we cannot distinguish in its application to the facts of that case from its equal application to the facts of this case. * * * Though logic would seem to require the plaintiff to prove as in other cases in its entirety, the contract on which his account is based, we bow reluctantly to authority and reverse the judgment for error in charging upon the burden of proof and in refusing to charge as re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>quested.\u201d In thus yielding deference to the supposed controlling effect of the decision in <em>Sanns </em>v. <em>Neal, supra, </em>we think the learned circuit court misconceived and incorrectly interpreted the scope of that decision. While certain of the language found in the majority opinion in that case is seemingly perhaps, at first glance, opposed to the conclusion reached by us in this case, yet, when the facts of that case are fully considered we very much doubt if the court thereby intended to decide anything which we are called upon to overrule or reverse in The present case. In that case, which was also an action on account for services rendered, the defendants in their answer after pleading the general denial, by way of further and particular defense alleged that all of the services performed by plaintiff were performed by him under a special contract and that full payment therefor according to the terms of said contract had been made to the, plaintiff, and while the rendition of the services sued for was put in issue by the general denial, performance of such services by the plaintiff and that he was entitled to compensation therefor was not in dispute, but on the trial was admitted by the evidence of defendants themselves. The performance of the services being admitted this averment of special contract and plea of payment under and pursuant thereto was more than a mere denial, it was in legal effect the assertion of an affirmative defense, the burden of maintaining'which was on the defendants. These facts we think so far differentiate and distinguish that case from the case at bar, as to leave it without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>controlling effect in the determination of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">\n<em>The judgment of the circuit court reversed and the judgment of the court of common pleas affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b182-7\">Summers, C.
