The defendant in error contracted with the plaintiff in error to sell and deliver to it ten thousand bushels of oats, during the month of August, 1907, at thirty-seven cents per bushel. On the 17th day of August, defendant called plaintiff over the telephone and notified it that he could not comply with the contract and desired to settle. There is conflict in the testimony as to the substance of this conversation, the defendant insisting that there was a settlement on the basis of forty cents a bushel and the plaintiff denying this. Upon the same day, August 17th, the defendant sent the plaintiff a check for $300, endorsing thereon the following words: \u201cSettlement in full August account,\u201d and</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b216-6\">accompanied it with a letter in which he stated that it was according to their telephone talk of that day and was, \u201csettlement in full for the 10,000 bushels oats sold you May 29, 1907, for August shipment.\u201d Defendant on the same evening answered as follows: \u201cNote telephone conversation with you this morning with reference to your sale of 10,000 bushels No. 3 white oats to us subject to Eastern weights and inspection, and your wish to settle that trade at 40 cents track your place, our bid of last night. This we can\u2019t consent to do now, for the reason we find ourselves short a few cars of oats, and have nothing with which we can replace this at the present time, but would be. glad to buy the. .oats for you just as quickly as we get enough to replace the amount you sold us. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>We will not charge you anything for making the purchase, only the price we are obliged to pay for the oats. Jt seems to us, however, that you can get the-matter closed up more advantageously if you hustle around and buy the oats at Mechanicsburg and ship them on the contract. If you want us to buy them in, while we are short ourselves, we will give you the first ten cars of oats we can buy subject to the same conditions on which your sale was made.\u201d Plaintiff received the check, drew the money on it, and kept it, but, at the same time, wrote a letter to the defendant, of the date of August 19th, acknowledging the receipt of the check for $300 and stating, \u201cwhich amount we place to your credit. In our conversation of Saturday we did not mean to close up that transaction as we wrote you on Saturday evening. We have bought about 6,000 or 7,000 bushels of oats to-day at forty-one to forty-two cents and are bidding forty-two cents to-night, and just, as soon as we get a sufficient amount to cover your 10,000 bushels, will advise you about the cost of them, and I think you will want to adjust the matter as we wrote you on Saturday evening.\u201d It does not appear on the record that there was any open account existing between the plaintiff and defendant, other than the $300 itfcm. The defendant made no answer to the plaintiff\u2019s letter of August 19th.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-5\">At the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony a motion was made by defendant\u2019s counsel to withdraw the case from the jury and direct a verdict for the defendant, which the court then declined to do, but at the conclusion of all the evidence the motion was renewed and the court sustained it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>upon the ground that under the facts above stated the plaintiff was not entitled to recover and that the transaction shown by the check and letters became an accord and satisfaction upon the plaintiff accepting the money. Upon petition in error the circuit court affirmed the judgment of the court of common pleas and this proceeding in error is prosecuted to reverse the judgment of both the lower courts.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b218-5\"><em>Mr. Lemuel D. Lilly, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-6\">There was error in this action for two reasons: First, because the accord was a question of fact for the jury and the facts were so disputed that the court should not have passed on them, but should have submitted the question to the jury. Second, under the circumstances of this case, the payment was not accepted by Seeds as a satisfaction and upon the receipt of the letter so stating, it was Conger\u2019s duty to insist' upon the condition if he expected to hold Seeds to it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-7\">On the first proposition stated above, it is the rule that where the defendant admits the original contract, but pleads that a substitute contract was entered into, the burden is on him to show the substitute contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-8\">In order to establish a defense of this character, there must be present in the transaction upon which it rests all the elements of a complete agreement\u2014 a lawful subject-matter, a sufficient consideration and the <em>aggregatio menttum </em>or mutual assent of the parties. <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>138 N. Y., 231.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b218-9\">If a debtor tenders to his creditor a sum of money in full of all legal claims, which the creditor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>may have against him on account, and the creditor receives- the money protesting that it is not sufficient, but saying that he will take it and pass it to the debtor\u2019s credit upon his account, and the debtor does not express any dissent to this course, the acceptance of the tender is no bar to the recovery of such sum as may be found due him exceeding the amount of the tender. <em>Gassett </em>v. <em>Andover, </em>21 Vt., 342; <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>84 Mich., 658; <em>Pottlitzer </em>v. <em>Wesson, </em>35 N. E. Rep., 1030.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-5\">The Indiana court cited and approved <em>Curran </em>v. <em>Rummell, </em>118 Mass., 482, and <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>33 N. E. Rep., 1034; <em>Cooley </em>v. <em>Kinney, </em>119 Mich., 377.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-6\">Conger knew on the receipt of Seeds\u2019 letter of August 17, that the check for $300 would not be accepted as full payment. He was advised again on the twentieth when he received Seeds\u2019 letter acknowledging receipt of the check, that it was accepted only as part payment, and Conger never insisted on the condition. This brings the case at bar substantially within the principle of the case of <em>Laroe </em>v. <em>Dairy Co., </em>73 N. E. Rep., 61, and <em>Brake Co. </em>v. <em>Prosser, </em>157 N. Y., 289, 51 N. E. Rep., 986.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b219-7\"><em>Mr. Thomas B. Ware </em>and <em>Mr. Louis D. Johnson, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b219-8\">In the case at bar, the suit is upon an unliquidated demand \u2014 damages for. the violation of the contract of sale. The doctrine of accord and satisfaction goes back to the leading case of <em>Cumber </em>v. <em>Wane, </em>1 Strange, 426. Also found in Smith Leading Cases. This rule never did hold where the demand was for an unliquidated amount and is held by the undecided weight of authority not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>apply when any part of the claim is unliquidated and that the accepting of a check for the amount admitted to be due, coupled with the; condition that it would be received in full payment operated as a release of the unliquidated portion. <em>Railway Co. </em>v. <em>Clerk, </em>178 U. S., 365; <em>De Arnaud </em>v. <em>United States, </em>151 U. S., 483; <em>Hull </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>46 Atl. Rep., 182; <em>Hussey </em>v. <em>Crass, </em>53 S. W. Rep., 986.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b220-5\">In another case upon a contract for services rendered in Japan, the employer contended that the payment should be made in yens, and not American money, and told defendant that he should take a check representing the payment in yens, or nothing. Plaintiff later accepted a check for the amount in yens, and signed a receipt stating that the amount was in full payment of the contract, with salary, interest and allowance. Held, that the receipt constituted an accord and satisfaction. <em>Komp </em>v. <em>Raymond, </em>59 N. Y. Supp., 909. Authority to the same effect is not wanting in Ohio. <em>Iron Works </em>v. <em>Hazen, </em>24 C. C., 681.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b220-6\">Davis, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ax\">In the application of the law of accord and satisfaction, a distinction between liquidated and unliquidated demands is universally recognized. Where there is a <em>bona fide </em>dispute over an unliquidated demand and the debtor tenders an amount less than the amount in dispute, upon an express condition that if accepted it shall be in full of the disputed claim, the creditor must accept it upon the condition unless the condition be waived, otherwise he must refuse it; or if he has received the amount tendered he must return it. 1 Enc. L. &amp; P., 626-628. He cannot accept the tender in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>such case and recov\u00e9r the balance which he claims, because- he is presumed to have accepted it upon the express condition on which it was offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Generally, however, the law is applied differently in cases of liquidated and undisputed claims, the reason being, as sometimes stated, that the payor pays no more than he is clearly bound in law to pay and there is therefore no consideration for a release of the remainder of the obligation. But even in such a case, it has been held that when the parties have agreed in settlement of a <em>bona fide </em>dispute between them, that the lesser sum shall be received in satisfaction of the greater, it will be regarded as an accord and satisfaction. <em>City of San Juan </em>v. <em>St. John\u2019s Gas Co., </em>195 U. S., 510. Especially if the agreement has. been fully executed. <em>Dreyfus &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>75 Ark., 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Keeping in mind the foregoing principles, it is easy to distinguish from the case in hand all of the cases cited by counsel for plaintiff in error. Indeed, some of them are distinctly against him, notably <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>138 N. Y., 231, and <em>Eames Vacuum Brake Co. </em>v. <em>Prosser, </em>157 N. Y., 289. In the latter case it was said that, \u201cOrdinarily the retention of a check inclosed in a letter which refers to the amount as the balance due on accounts between the parties, will not be held to be an accord and satisfaction so as to bar an action for the balance due. It is only where a dispute has arisen between the parties as to the amount due, and a check is tendered on one side in full satisfaction of the matter in controversy, that the other party will be deemed to have acquiesced in the amount offered, by an acceptance and retention of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>check,\u201d citing in support of the last sentence, <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>Kemp, supra, </em>and <em>Nassoiy </em>v. <em>Tomlinson, </em>148 N. Y., 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Another case, relied upon for the plaintiff in error, is <em>Gassett </em>v. <em>Andover, </em>21 Vt., 342. There the debtor tendered a sum of money in full for all legal claims which the creditor had against him upon account. The creditor received the money, protesting that it was not sufficient, but said that he would take it and pass it to the debtor\u2019s credit on the account. The debtor expressed no dissent. It was held that the acceptance of the tender did not bar the creditor\u2019s right to recover such- sum as might be found due him on the account. It is entirely clear that the supreme court of Vermont did not regard this judgment as inconsistent with its former judgment in another case, reported in the same volume, <em>McDaniels </em>v. <em>Lapham et al., </em>21 Vt., 222, in which it was held that \u201cThe doctrine, that the receiving a part of a debt due, under an agreement that the same shall be in full satisfaction, is no bar to an action to recover the balance, <em>does not apply to any cases, except </em>when the plaintiff\u2019s claim is for a fixed and liquidated amount, or where the sum could be ascertained by mere arithmetical calculation. But when a party makes an offer of a certain sum to settle a claim, when the sum in controversy is open find unliquidated, and attaches to his offer the condition, that the same, if taken at all, must be received <em>in full, or in satisfaction, </em>of the claim in dispute, and the other party receives the money, he takes it subject to the condition attached to it, and it will operate as an accord and satisfaction, even though the party, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>the time of receiving- the money, declare that he will not receive it in that manner, but only in part satisfaction of his debt so far as it will extend.\u201d In this case there is a dispute which'grew out of the inability of the defendant to fulfil his contract to deliver 10,000 bushels of oats during the month of August at thirty-seven cents a bushel. The defendant sought to limit his liability by securing a settlement at the highest market price on August 17th; and he insists that he succeeded in doing so and paid the amount agreed upon, although the plaintiff attempted to recede from the settlement and sought to hold him on the original contract. The plaintiff denies all of this, except the payment of the money. Here was a real controversy, which yet exists, over the amount of the defendant\u2019s liability. It was a dispute over a demand which was yet contingent and the amount of which was not yet determined. We have at present no concern as to the merits of this contention. It is enough for our present purpose that it plainly appears that there was such a difference between these parties; and that, the defendant sent to the plaintiff his .check, indorsed on \u2019the face of it, \u201cSettlement in full August account,\u201d and accompanied it with a letter saying, \u201cEnclosed' find my check for $300, which, according to our talk over the \u2019phone today is settlement in full for the 10,000 bushels oats sold you May 29, 1907, for August shipment.\u201d There was no othpr claim or account between them and this .plainly expressed condition of payment was never withdrawn; for mere silence by the debtor under the circumstances of this case does not amount to a withdrawal of the condition, nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>a' waiver of it. The plaintiff, had only one alternative, to accept the check as payment in full or to return it. He kept it and drew the money on it, knowing the condition imposed, and thereby completed the transaction as an accord and satisfaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The judgment of the court below is</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b224-8\">Summers, C.
