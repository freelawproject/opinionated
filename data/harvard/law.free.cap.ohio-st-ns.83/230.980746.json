It must set forth the general grounds mentioned in Section 5522, Revised Statutes, one of which is that there must be set forth at least one of the grounds of attachment mentioned in Section 5521.

The affidavit must go farther and show that it is not one of the excepted classes named in Subdivision 1 of Section 5521. <em>Thatcher </em>v. <em>Powell, 6 </em>Wheat., 119; <em>Manley </em>v. <em>Headley, </em>10 Kans., 88; <em>Kerr </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>5 B.

Zimmerman, who was and is attorney and counsel for the plaintiff in error in this action. We maintain that this renders the affidavit entirely void and the attachment issued thereon likewise void.

C., 136.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-8\">The same question was decided the same way by the circuit court of Hamilton county, affirmed by the supreme court, in <em>L. P.

This question has been determined a number of times in the state of Ohio in the following cases: <em>Eagan </em>v. <em>Lumsden &amp; McGovern, 2 </em>Dis., 168; <em>Saxton </em>v. Plymire, 3 C. C., 209; <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Tailoring Co., </em>7 C. C., 51; <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Smith, 29 </em>Ohio St., 120; <em>Manufacturing Co. </em>v. <em>Mzik, </em>3 C. C., N.

This the court held he could not do, as decided in <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>24 Ohio St., 481.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-9\">The plaintiff did not ask the privilege of filing a new perfect affidavit, with a view of issuing a new writ of attachment. That he had an undoubted right to do and the court did not refuse him such privilege. Indeed, he could have filed such an affidavit without applying to the court for leave. .Inasmuch as - the writ of attachment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>already issued was a nullity, the court was without power to grant him leave to amend the affidavit so as to give such writ validity. This is clearly decided in the insurance company case, 24 Ohio St., <em>supra. </em>The action of the court, therefore, in refusing him leave to amend, was not error.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b282-5\">Summers, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AA\">The plaintiff in error filed a petition in the court of common pleas of Mahoning county against the defendant to recover damages for a breach of contract.' At the same time the plaintiff filed an affidavit for attachment and garnishee process. Each affidavit stated as ground for attachment that the defendant was a foreign corporation. Neither affidavit nor the petition negatived the exceptions as to foreign corporations in Section 5521, Revised Statutes, and each affidavit was sworn to before a notary public, who was also the attorney for the plaintiff. The defendant, within a day or two after the levy of the order of attachment gave bond under Section 5545, Revised Statutes, and obtained possession of its property. Subsequently the defendant, without entering its appearance, filed a motion to discharge the attachments on the ground that the affidavits were defective in failing to negative the exceptions, and on the ground that the affidavits were not authorized to be made before a notary who was the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. When the motion came on for hearing the plaintiff applied for leave to amend its affidavit in attachment, said amendments to operate as of- the dates of the original affidavits, by adding to that part of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>affidavits which states the ground's of attachment as the non-residence of the defendant corporation the words \u201cand has not filed with the secretary of the state of Ohio, the statement required or provided by Section 148c, Revised Statutes of Ohio, nor procured from the secretary of the state of Ohio, the certificate required or provided by Section 148d, Revised Statutes of Ohio, nor complied with the provisions of either or both of said sections.\u201d This application was overruled and on hearing of the motion to discharge it was granted and the attachment was discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">On error the judgment was affirmed in the circuit court and error is prosecuted in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The first contention on the part of plaintiff is that the giving of the bond discharged the attachment and waived any defect in the affidavit. Section 5545, Revised Statutes, reads as follows: \u201cIf the defendant, or other person on his behalf, at any time before judgment, cause an undertaking to be executed to the plaintiff, by sufficient surety resident in the county, to be approved by the court, in double the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s claim as stated in his affidavit, to the effect that the defendant shall perform the judgment of the court, the attachment shall be discharged, and restitution made of any property taken under it, or the proceeds thereof; and such undertaking shall also discharge the liability of a garnishee in the action, for any property of the defendant in his hands; provided that, when plaintiff\u2019s claim is for causing death or a personal injury by a negligent or wrongful act, the undertaking required shall be in such amount as shall be fixed by the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>where the action is pending, or a judge thereof, if application is made in vacation.\u201d This contention is decided against the plaintiff in <em>The William Edwards Company </em>v. <em>Goldstein, </em>80 Ohio St., 303, in which case proceedings in attachment before a justice of the peace were under consideration. It was there pointed out that the provisions of Sections 5529 and 5545 were like the provisions relating to the justice of the peace. And it was there held that the defendant may, at any time before judgment, move for the discharge of the attachment, although he has previously given bond for its discharge under Section 6513. And this court, since the decision in that case, has ruled that the giving of a discharge bond under Section 5545, Revised Statutes, does not deprive the defendant of the right at any time before judgment to move for and obtain a discharge of the attachment under Section 5562, Revised Statutes. It was so held in <em>The Brown &amp; Ketcham Iron Co. </em>v. <em>L. P. Hazen &amp; Co., </em>11 C. C., N. S., 48, and that judgment was affirmed by this court without opinion in 81 Ohio State, 511, on authority of the case in 80 Ohio State, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Next it is contended that it was not necessary to negative the exceptions in Section 5521, Revised Statutes. That section reads: \u201cThat in a civil action for the recovery of money the plaintiff may, at or after the commencement thereof, have an attachment against the property of the defendant upon the grounds herein stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">\u201c1. When the defendant, or one of several defendants, is a foreign corporation, except' as provided by an act entitled \u2018An act to further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>supplement Section 148 of the Revised Statutes/ passed May 16, 1894 (91 O. L., 272), and except as provided by an act entitled 'An act to amend Section 1 of an act,' etc., passed May 19, 1894 (91 O. L., 355) (Sections 148c, 148d) ; or \u00e1 nonresident of this state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">It will be observed that the section does not provide for an attachment against all foreign corporations, but only against those that do not come within the exceptions. The proceedings in attachment are statutory remedies, and it is too well settled to need the citation of authorities that where a statute confers a right or gives a remedy unknown to the common law that the party asserting the right, or availing himself of the remedy, must in his pleadings bring himself or his case, clearly within the statute. The statute does not provide for an attachment against all foreign corporations, but only on those that do not come within the exceptions, so that it -is necessary to negative the exceptions in order that it may appear that the fact that the corporation is a foreign corporation is a ground of attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">It is -further contended that an affidavit in attachment may be made before a notary public who is the attorney for the plaintiff. Section 5264, Revised Statutes, provides that an affidavit may be made before any person authorized to take depositions. Section 5271, Revised Statutes, provides that the officer before whom depositions are taken must not be a relative or attorney of either party, or otherwise interested in the event of the action or proceeding. Section 5107, Revised Statutes, provides that the affidavit verifying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>pleading may be made before any person authorized to administer oaths, whether an attorney in the case or not. An affidavit is a written declaration under oath, made without notice to the adverse party, and in view of the very important purposes for which it may be used it would seem that it is just as important that the officer before whom it is made should be disinterested as it is in the taking of a deposition for which notice is required. This was the sole ground of objection to the affidavit in the case last above cited, and the affirmance of the judgment of the circuit court necessarily raised that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Lastly it is contended that the court erred in refusing leave to amend the affidavit. A sufficient affidavit is essential to jurisdiction in a proceeding in- attachment. In <em>Lessee of Paine </em>v. <em>Mooreland, </em>15 Ohio, 435, it is held that the court acquires jurisdiction in attachment, by the issuing of process, predicated upon the requisite affidavit, and the attaching of the property. In <em>Pope et al. </em>v. <em>The Hibernia Insurance Co., </em>24 Ohio St., 481, the attachment was based upon the ground of non-residence. The affidavit was defective in that it failed to show that the cause of action is one arising upon contract, judgment or decree. An order of attachment issued and the insurance company was garnisheed. After the service of the writ the plaintiff by leave of court amended the affidavit to show the omitted fact, but a new writ of attachment was not issued. It was held: \u201cJurisdiction of a' defendant cannot be acquired by proceedings in attachment, on the ground of his non-residence in the state, when the petition in the case, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>the affidavit for attachment, fail to show that the cause of action is one arising upon contract, judgment or decree. Jurisdiction cannot be acquired in such case, by amendment of the petition and affidavit, showing a caus\u00e9 of action arising upon contract, without the issuance of an attachment after the amendment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">In the present case it was sought not only to amend the affidavits, but also to <em>nunc pro tunc </em>the amendment so as to vivify the void writ. This, of course, could not be done. Moreover, if the amendment had been made, still the affidavits would have been fatally defective on the ground that they were made before the attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b287-9\">Crew, Spear, Davis, Shauck and Price, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
