L., 36), is as follows: \u201cThe phrase \u2018intoxicating liquor/ as used in this act shall be construed to mean any distilled, malt, vinous or any intoxicating liquor whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>The question which arises in this case is, whether a malt liquor sold in a county where this law is in operation, violates the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-6\">A proper construction of the definition in question, necessitates the determination of the intention of the general assembly in framing it. Had no such definition of the phrase \u201cintoxicating liquor\u201d been prescribed, the question as to the nature of the liquor dealt in by the defendant as intoxicating in point of fact would have been material in every prosecution instituted thereunder. The difficulty in the enforcement of the statute framed in such general terms, and the possibility of the lack of uniformity in the results of prosecution instituted under such language, have induced the general assembly to adopt the legislative policy followed in formulating various other police regulations of the state, such as the laws respecting food adulterations, those requiring the registration of physicians, druggists, stationary engineers, etc. This policy is that which eliminates disputes as to intrinsically doubtful facts, such as would have to be established by so-called expert testimony, and establishes a positive standard which though arbitrary is to be upheld by the courts, if the legislature had power to establish it. 23 Cyc., 57; <em>State </em>v. <em>Intoxicating Liquors, </em>76 Ia., 243; <em>Commissioners </em>v. <em>Timothy, </em>8 Gray, 480; <em>State </em>v. <em>Wittmar, </em>12 Mo., 407.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-7\">That the legislature intended to include all malt liquors as coming within this definition, whether in fact there was a sufficient amount of alcohol in them to make them intoxicating, is clearly shown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>by recent legislation and the decision of this court. When the municipal option law was enacted defining intoxicating liquor to mean any distilled, malt, vinous or any other intoxicating liquor, Sections 4364-20a to 4364-20i, there was doubt in the minds of the courts as to whether or not under that wording it included all malt liquors, whether intoxicating or not. This doubt arose from the decision of Justice Brewer in the Kansas case under a similar wording of the law, holding the word \u201cother\u201d showed these terms, vinous, malt and distilled, were qualified by the word \u201cintoxicating.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-6\">Following the decision of this court in <em>State, ex rel., </em>v. <em>Kauffman, </em>68 Ohio St., 635, in construing the Dow law, the legislature made the definition of intoxicating liquor to conform to it with the distinct purpose of settling this mooted question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-7\">In the General Code the codifying commission struck out the word \u201cwhatever\u201d on the theory it added nothing to the definition of intoxicating liquor. The legislative intent is \u2022 absolutely clear, both from the reading of the statute, and especially from the fact that the statute was put in its present form immediately following the construction by this court as to what similar language meant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-8\">Both laws have the same title, \u201cTo further provide against the evils resulting from the traffic in intoxicating liquor,\u201d and they were sustained on this theory of providing against the evils of the traffic. <em>Senior </em>v. <em>Ratterman, </em>44 Ohio St., 661.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>There are three theories upon which this case may be decided:</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-6\">First. That the term \u201cmalt liquor\u201d includes all malt liquids, whether they contain any alcohol or not. This might be called the literal construction placed upon the term.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-7\">Second. The term \u201cmalt liquor\u201d includes all 'malt alcoholic beverages, regardless of the amount of alcohol contained therein. This is the middle ground, and the decisions cited in this brief show the reason for such a construction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-8\">Third. The term \u201cmalt liquor\u201d includes only such malt liquors as are intoxicating in fact. This represents the other extreme from the first one named.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-9\">See definitions in Standard Dictionary, Century Dictionary and Webster\u2019s for \u201cliquor\u201d and \u201cmalt liquor.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-10\">Webster\u2019s International Dictionary defines \u201cmalt\u201d to be barley, or other grain steeped in water and dried in a kiln, thus forcing germination until the saccharine principle has been evolved. It is used in brewing and the distillation of whiskey. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cohn, </em>52 S. W.

The state contends that it was not; that when the liquor was shown to have been a malt liquor that it was, in law, intoxicating liquor; that the court was bound by the definition and could not inquire whether or not it was intoxicating.

Ragan, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-8\">The evidence upon which the judge of the common pleas court based his finding was the undisputed statements and evidence of the defendant in error, that the liquor was? made in the following manner. The malt syrup was made as weak as it could be, then the alcohol was boiled out, so it did not contain any alcohol whatever. The other ingredient was sweetened water; one-third of the first was mixed with two-thirds of the second, and then carbonated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-9\">He further testified that when so made, the liquor contained absolutely no alcohol whatever.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-10\">We need cite no authorities to define what a malt liquor is; it is a matter of common knowledge. Barley is sprouted. That changes the starch into sugar; it js then fermented, that changes the sugar into alcohol. It is'then brewed with hops; it is then beer; or instead of brewing with hops, the f\u00e9rmented mash may be distilled; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>it is then malt whiskey. The beer so made is a malt liquor, and so is the whiskey, whether distilled or brewed, the liquor when made contains alcohol, and if when made it contains no alcohol, it is not a malt liquor. This court has decided in <em>Weisbrodt </em>v. <em>State, </em>50 Ohio St., 192, that malt liquors as defined in the statutes providing against the evils resulting from the sale of intoxicating liquors, must be intoxicating 'malt liquors; if it is not intoxicating, it is not a malt liquor within the purview of those statutes. In -that case the court say, all spirituous, vinous, or malt liquors are intoxicating, but all intoxicating liquors are not necessarily either spirituous, vinous or malt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-6\">Are we to look past the substance of the law, and look only at the shadow? Is it a contravention of the statute to keep on sale distilled water, or unfermented grape juice, or unfermented cider? In the cases at bar, the liquor when made was absolutely free from alcohol, and therefore was not a malt liquor, as defined by the statute referred to. It is no answer to say that it would generate alcohol if left standing long enough after its manufacture; sweet cider, or any mash of fruit or grain that contains any sugar will do that; this is a matter of common knowledge. The judge of the common pleas court must have found that no al- . cohol had generated in the liquor that Walder sold Grandy, for he found it was not intoxicating.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-7\">It is unnecessary to turn to the decisions of other states for a definition of the phrase \u201cintoxicating liquors\u201d because a careful examination of the Rose law disposes of the question without ref<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>erence to the decisions of other states. The true scope and meaning of that statute is to stop the traffic in the prohibited locality, in all intoxicating liquors, by whatever name called'. As a means to this end, it is made unlawful after thirty days after a locality has voted dry, for any person, by himself or agent, to sell, furnish or give away intoxicating liquors to be used as a beverage. <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>State, </em>60 S. E. Rep., 1082, which is the nearest a parallel case with the one at bar that we can find.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-6\">The circuit court considered the intent of the legislature in framing the Rose law; considered the\u2019 letter of the law, analyzed it by section, and decided that the section properly understood should be construed to mean, \u201cany distilled, malt, vinous or any other kind of intoxicating liquor.\u201d We think the legislature could not have more clearly indicated its intent to make the Rose law apply to only intoxicating liquors if it had inserted the word, \u201cintoxicating,\u201d before the words, \u201cspirituous\u201d and \u201cmalt;\u201d the phrase \u201cor any intoxicating liquor whatever,\u201d can bear but one literal construction, and that is that it means, \u201cwhether it be the kind of intoxicating liquors specifically mentioned, or whether it be any other kind of intoxicating liquor.\u201d In support of this view, we cite the following authorities: <em>Mason </em>v. <em>State, </em>58 S. E. Rep., 139; <em>McDuffie </em>v. <em>State, </em>87 Ga., 687; <em>Bell </em>v. <em>State, </em>91 Ga., 227; <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>State, </em>121 Ga., 206; <em>Intoxicating Liquor Cases, 2 </em>L.

His testimony clearly showed that it was not intoxicating and admitted only a possibility of it being alcoholic; his testimony showed also that it was not a malt liquor, as malt liquor is defined by the courts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-7\">\u201cMalt liquor\u201d needs no legal definition; it is a matter of common knowledge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b124-8\">Th\u00e9 testimony being undisputed admissions of Walder, the finding of the judge of the common pleas court, that the liquor was a malt liquor, was an unwarranted conclusion from the evidence which the circuit court had a right to revise and correct.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b124-9\">Price, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_P\">This is one of the many cases which have reached this court, involving alleged violation of some provision of the county local option law. The act is designated in the statute as amended senate bill No. 345, and is entitled: \u201cAn act to provide against the evils resulting from the traffic in intoxicating- liquors, by providing for local option in counties,\u201d and was passed March 5, 1908, to take effect and be in force on and after September 1, 1908. See 99 O. L., 35. It is regarded as a case of great importance by the prosecuting attorneys of at least fifteen counties of the state who join in the brief for plaintiff in. error.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">The charge preferred against defendant in error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>is that, \u201con the 25th day of January, 1909, in the county of Fulton and state of Ohio, one August Walder did then and there sell intoxicating liquors, to-wit, a malt liquor containing .49 per cent, alcohol and no more, commonly known as \u2018Near Beer/ as a beverage to one Fred Grandy; that the selling of said liquor as aforesaid by the said August Walder was then and there prohibited and unlawful and contrary to. the local option laws of the general assembly,\u201d etc. The charge in full is found in our statement of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">We are not clearly advised as to the author of the name of \u201cNear Beer,\u201d nor as to its real significance, but it may mean next to or almost \u201cbeer.\u201d While the affidavit charges that the \u201cNear Beer\u201d so sold to Grandy was an intoxicating liquor, to-wit, a malt liquor of .49 per cent, alcohol, it was found by the trial court where the evidence was heard and' considered, \u201cthat the liquor charged in the affidavit to have been sold by defendant was a <em>malt liquor, </em>but not intoxicating\u201d and then found as a matter of law that the sale of said malt liquor is \u201cwithin the inhibition of statute and contrary to law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">The statute authorizing a local option election provided how the question should be stated on the ballots, and it was in substance whether the sale of \u201cintoxicating liquors\u201d as a beverage should or should not be prohibited: And when the m\u00e1jority of the votes cast at the election were in favor of prohibiting the sale of <em>intoxicating </em>liquors in th\u00e1t county, Section 2 of the act referred to made it unlawful, from and' after the holding of the elec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>tion, \u201cfor any person personally or by agent, within the limits of such county, to sell, furnish or give away intoxicating liquors to be used as a beverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Therefore, the sole living question in the case is,'did Walder violate the provisions of the statute by selling a malt liquor that was not in fact intoxicating? Or, was it essential to a conviction that the malt liquor sold was intoxicating?</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The accused testified in his own behalf and he undertook to give the elements composing and the method of brewing the liquor from which the sale was made. His statement is brief, and we quote from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">\u201cQues. to Deft. Tell the court whether or not you sold Mr. Grandy beer as he testified to? Ans. I did: it isn\u2019t beer \u2014 near beer. At the time Mr. Grandy purchased that beer we were making near beer on a \u2014 that is, practically it wasn\u2019t intoxicating at all; of course the beer was made, the first beer that was all made similar only far weaker than the other beer. The other beer contains four to five per cent, alcohol. We made it as weak as we could and then we boiled out the alcohol so it didn\u2019t contain any alcohol whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">\u201cQues. This near beer you sold to Grandy? Ans. Yes, sir; then the raw product, sugar, etc., and we made nothing but a syrup. These articles laid there till we got ready to use them, when we would put in one-third of the first.substance, which didn\u2019t contain any alcohol whatever, and then we took two-thirds of the other stuff which contained mostly water, and then we put them together, you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>know, and carbonated it; carbonating is what forms the foam and gives it the life; but of course there is a natural limit to that \u2014 it might be thirty hours and it might be ten hours \u2014 it depends on what kind of shape you keep it \u2014 if you keep it in a warm place it would generate alcohol right away; where if you keep it cold it might go two weeks or three weeks, as far as that is concerned, and never get alcohol. That is the reason I didn\u2019t ship any or sell any except in my own place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">He was asked to tell what ingredients entered into the beer sold to Grandy, and he said: \u201cIt was made out of that sugar \u2014 of course it had that <em>malt </em>ingredient; part of the <em>malt </em>was in there, but the alcohol part had all boiled out \u2014 there is nothing but' the nutritious part of the malt * *</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Another question: \u201cWas there any alcohol in the beer you sold Fred? (Grandy). Ans. I suppose it had generated a little, but I don\u2019t think at the time I sold it \u2014 I don\u2019t think there was probably two-tenths of one per cent. \u2014 may be not that much * *</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">On cross-examination, he admits the malt ingredient, and in another part of his testimony, he states that hops are used in lager beer, while in the near beer hop .extract is used, that is nonalcoholic but is the same thing as hops.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">Again he is asked: \u201cThis brew that you sold that day would become intoxicating if left standing there? Ans. ' Yes, if I had sold' it to somebody else, or let it go out of the place; but I don\u2019t allow it to go in a can or pail anywhere, so I was sure it wouldn\u2019t get intoxicating * *</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>The purchaser of this article called \u201cNear Beer\u201d testified that it foamed like beer \u2014 looked like beer except that it was a little lighter \u2014 and smelled like beer. He also testified that Walder told him \u201che had a brew of malt the same as they would for beer, and that the liquid was boiled until they boiled the alcohol out of it * * He said it was made from malt the same as they made their beer.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">It appears from the above and other evidence, that the trial court is fully supported in its finding that the beverage sold was a malt liquor, and it might also have been found that if given time or moderate warmth, it would generate alcohol. For this reason the accused would not sell the beverage to be taken from his premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">What is the law applicable to the finding and the facts?</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">Section 3 of the county local option statute, already referred to, provides: \u201cThe phrase 'intoxicating liquor\u2019 as used in this act shall be construed to mean any distilled, malt, vinous or any intoxicating liquor whatever.\u201d While this section of the above statute has not heretofore been before this court for construction, we borrow light from what has been said in construing certain provisions of the Dow law and of the later Aikin law, concerning the taxing of the traffic in intoxicating liquors. In <em>State, ex rel. Guilbert, Auditor, </em>v. <em>Kauffman, </em>68 Ohio St., 635, a dealer in \u201cBishop\u2019s Beer\u201d was resisting the payment of what was commonly called the Dow tax, because such beer was not intoxicating and did not come within the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>view of the taxing statute. This court held in the syllabus that, \u201cSection 4364-9, Revised Statutes, applies to the business of selling a malt liquor or beverage which contains less than two per cent, of alcohol and is not intoxicating.\u201d The court disposed of the question in the following <em>per curiam: </em>\u201cSection 4364-9, Revised Statutes, imposes a tax oh the business of trafficking in <em>any intoxicating </em>liquors, and also on the business of trafficking in spirituous, vinous or malt liquors. The generic term \u2018malt liquors\u2019 includes both non-intoxicating and intoxicating malt liquors * *</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The statute then before the court was Section 4364-9, Revised Statutes, which provides that, \u201cupon the business of trafficking in spirituous, vinous, malt, or <em>other </em>intoxicating liquors, there shall be assessed yearly and shall be paid into the county treasury * * * the sum of * * . This wording is the same as contained in the prior statute on the subject, except that the word \u201cany\u201d in the former is supplanted by the word \u201cother\u201d in the statute in force when the above Kauffman case was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">In a later case, <em>La Follette, Treasurer, </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>81 Ohio St., 474, this court considered the section (4364-9) which is worded as above quoted, viz: \u201cupon the business of trafficking in spirituous, vinous, malt or other intoxicating liquors, there shall be assessed,\u201d etc. The case was not one of \u201cNear Beef\u201d but of \u201cFriedon Beer,\u201d containing .47 of one per cent, of alcohol, which it was claimed was hot intoxicating. The statute? 'and former decisions were reviewed, and the court\u2019s conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>is stated in the following syllabus: \u201cSection 4364-9, Revised Statutes, (98 O. L., 100) in effect April 10, 1906, applies to the business of trafficking in malt liquors, whether intoxicating or nonintoxicating.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The legislature went further, in order to make clear its -meaning, and made a definition of the phrase \u201ctrafficking' in intoxicating liquors,\u201d which is found in Section 4364-16, Revised Statutes. And we find that in the statute providing for municipal local option, the legislature, in Section 4364-20c, Revised Statutes, defines the phrase \u201cintoxicating liquors\u201d as used in this act shall be construed to mean any distilled, malt, vinous, or any other intoxicating liquors.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">Now as we come to the county local option law, we find the legislature attempting to -silence all quibbles as to what the phrase \u201cintoxicating liquor\u201d means, enacting Section 3 of that act, which may again be quoted: \u201cThe phrase \u2018intoxicating liquor\u2019 as used in this act shall be construed to mean any distilled, malt, vinous, or any intoxicating liquor whatever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">This definition is very clear, and is not vexed with the word \u201cany\u201d or \u201cother\u201d which gave rise to the legal controversies in construing the taxing statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">The legislature -may have heard of \u201cBishop\u2019s Beer,\u201d \u201cFriedon Beer,\u201d and later of \u201cNear Beer,\u201d and concluded that the enforcement of the will of the majority should not be defeated by subterfuge, or the juggling in percentages of alcohol, and has said that, for the purpose of carrying out the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>tention of the people to prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquors, certain beverages shall be legally considered intoxicating, although not so in fact; and malt liquor is one of those so designated. \u201cNear Beer,\u201d being a malt liquor, the statute pronounces it an intoxicating liquor, and made proof of its real intoxicating qualities unnecessary. It is no more protected than <em>altogether beer, </em>and the attempt to evade the law by brewing a <em>near </em>or <em>almost </em>beer, is by section 3, <em>supra, </em>rendered futile:</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">The legislative fiat has gone forth, that malt liquor is intoxicating within the meaning of the act, and that is the end of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">If the law is wrong, it is for the legislatuie and not the court to correct it, but it was enacted no doubt to cover such evasions as have been, tried in many localities.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">However, this feature of legislation is not singular. it has been indulged in many other cases and on various subjects. We have seen how trafficking in intoxicating liquors is defined. We mention some other exemplifications of such legislation. Section 4200-5, Revised Statutes, defines the word \u201cdrug,\u201d and also what shall be considered .as \u201cfood.\u201d The following section determines when \u201cdrugs\u201d and when \u201cfood\u201d shall be deemed adulterated. Section 4403/, Revised Statutes, provides : \u201cAny person shall be regarded as practicing medicine or surgery or midwifery within the meaning of this act, who shall use the words or letters, \u2018Dr./ \u2018Doctor/ \u2018Professor.\u2019 \u2018M. D.,\u2019 \u2018M. B./ or any other title,\u201d etc. Section 4364-30g defines \u201cintoxicating liquor,\u201d \u201cqualified elector,\u201d \u201cresidence dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>trict;\u201d defines the words \u201cblock\u201d and \u201csaloon.\u201d Section <em>4364-30y </em>makes certain facts <em>prima f\u00e1cie </em>evidence of guilt, and Section 4387 defines' a \u201cpawnbroker.\u201d Many other illustrations may be found to show how fertile the legislature has been in settling some things by statute which might otherwise be difficult of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">The courts of other states have passed on similar legislation, and we select a few decisions from the great number of reported cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">: In <em>State of Maine </em>v. <em>Frederickson, </em>101 Me., 37, the supreme judicial court of that state held in the third section of the syllabus as follows: \u201cThe constitutional right of the legislature to regulate or prohibit the sale and keeping of intoxicating liquors, and to declare certain liquors intoxicating within the meaning of the law governing intoxicating liquors irrespective of the intoxicating character of such liquors as a matter of fact,-both under the state and federal constitutions, have been so universally answered in the affirmative, both by the decisions in our own state, and by the supreme court of the United States, that it is no longer a question for argument or even doubt..\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\"><em>Luther </em>v. <em>State of Nebraska, </em>20 L. R. A., 1146, decides that the prohibition of the sale or keeping for the purpose of sale, of malt liquors without a license so to do, applies to all malt liquors, sold or kept for sale to be used as a beverage, whether intoxicating or not; and that it was not necessary to allege or prove that the malt liquor was in fact intoxicating. This case was decided in 1909.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">To the same effect is <em>Eaves </em>v. <em>The State, </em>113 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Ga., 749. In <em>Dinkins </em>v. <em>State, </em>43 So. Rep., 114, the supreme court of Alabama held that \u201cunder acts 1886-87, p. 665, prohibiting the sale of malt liquors, it is an offense to sell a fluid containing a weak solution of malt liquor which cannot intoxicate.\u201d It seems that in that state (Alabama) the courts were called upon to investigate the sale of various beverages which appeared under such enticing names as \u201cHop Jack,\u201d \u201cCherry Bitters,\u201d \u201cHarter\u2019s Wildcherry Tonic,\u201d and \u201cCook\u2019s Malt Tonic.\u201d There, as in other states, enterprise was unbounded to prepare something to slake thirst for some, even slight intoxicant, without being caught in the meshes of law. The above case reviewed <em>Feibelman </em>v. <em>State, </em>130 Ala., 122, to which we merely refer without quotation. See also <em>State of Missouri </em>v. <em>Wittmar, </em>12 Mo., 407. A case is found in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Timothy, </em>8 Gray, 480, in which it is held: \u201cIf the liquor sold was not in fact intoxicating, still, if it was within the liquors enumerated in the first section of the statute, the keeping of it with intent to sell was, by the terms of the statute, to be punished in the same mariner as if it was intoxicating; and such an enactment is within the discretion of the legislature to pass.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Similar doctrine is laid down in <em>The State </em>v. <em>Certain Intoxicating Liquors et al., 76 </em>Ia., 243. The case is directly in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">We cite nothing further from the great array of authorities, some of which may be found in the brief for plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">The finding that the sale made which is now under consideration, was a sale of malt liquor is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>amply supported by the facts, and the statute declares malt liquor to be intoxicating within the meaning of,the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The circuit court erred in its judgment, which is now reversed, and the judgment of the court of. common pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b134-8\">Summers, C.
