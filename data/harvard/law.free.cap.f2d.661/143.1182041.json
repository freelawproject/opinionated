App.P. 34(a); Tenth Circuit R. 10(e). The cause is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">This cause was earlier partly remanded for a determination of whether appellant had exhausted administrative remedies. <em>Martinez v. Romero, </em>640 F.2d 1151 (10th Cir. 1981). The district court has now furnished a supplemental record clearly establishing the requisite exhaustion.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">This is an appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Appellant was convicted by a jury of trafficking in heroin and was sentenced to imprisonment for ten to fifty years. On appeal, appellant contends that various procedural irregularities deprived him of a fair trial. These alleged irregularities can be summarized as follows: prejudicial delay, coercive jury polling, prosecutorial misconduct, and ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">Appellant first contends that the ten-month delay between the time he allegedly committed the crime of trafficking in heroin and the date the criminal information was filed violated his right to due process. The standards by which the constitutionality of preindictment delay must be tested are (1) that the defense must be substantially prejudiced by the delay and (2) that the reasons for the prosecutor\u2019s delay must be improper. <em>See United States v. Lovasco, </em>431 U.S. 783, 788-790, 97 S.Ct. 2044, 2047-2048, 52 L.Ed.2d 752 (1977); <em>United States v. Marion, </em>404 U.S. 307, 324, 92 S.Ct. 455, 465, 30 L.Ed.2d 468 (1971); <em>United States v. Comosona, </em>614 F.2d 695 (10th Cir. 1980); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Radmall, </em>591 F.2d 548 (10th Cir. 1978). After reviewing the record before us in light of these standards, we conclude that appellant\u2019s claim of unconstitutional delay is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-13\">Further, we hold that the state court\u2019s finding that none of the jurors was coerced by the trial court during the \u00a1wiling of the jury is supported by the record. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>562 F.2d 619, 621-22 (10th Cir. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-14\">We also find that the record as a whole does not show that the prosecutor\u2019s mention of appellant\u2019s prior felony conviction violates any constitutional standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-15\">Appellant\u2019s last contention is that, for various specific reasons, both his trial and his appellate counsel were sufficiently ineffective in assisting him with his defense that he must be granted a new trial. The federal district court, on appellant\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus, addressed the merits of these ineffective assistance of counsel claims by adopting the magistrate's recommendations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> These conclusory recommendations do not meet the standards outlined in <em>Edwards v. Oklahoma, </em>577 F.2d 1119, 1121-22 (10th Cir. 1978), that, where a constitutional violation has been alleged with specificity, \u201cthe federal district court must hold an evidentiary hearing if the habeas petitioner did not receive a full and fair hearing in a state court on the matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>sought to be raised in the habeas petition.\u201d <em>See also Blackledge v. Allison, </em>431 U.S. 63, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977); <em>Townsend v. Sain, </em>372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963). We find in the record before us no evidence that \u201ca full and fair hearing\u201d has ever been held with respect to the claims supporting appellant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel theory. Under these circumstances, <em>Edwards, Blackledge, </em>and <em>Townsend </em>require that the district court make specific findings as to whether this appellant is entitled to an evidentiary hearing, and if so, that it hold such a hearing. Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s judgment as to this issue and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b232-11\">.
