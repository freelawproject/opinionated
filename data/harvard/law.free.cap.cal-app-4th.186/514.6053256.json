J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3u\">Jewel Jackson sued the County of Amador and its recorder (collectively, the County), alleging that the county recorder violated section 27203 of the Government Code by \u201cwillfully, negligently, untruly and/or in a manner other than that prescribed by [the recording statutes] caused to be recorded\u201d a durable power of attorney and two quitclaim deeds which, she asserted, had been fraudulently procured by her brother. Even though the documents had certificates of acknowledgment by a notary public, Jackson contends the county recorder breached a duty to her by failing to determine that she did not sign the power of attorney or direct her brother to sign it on her behalf and, thus, the recorder should not have recorded the documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">After sustaining the County\u2019s demurrer without leave to amend, the trial court dismissed Jackson\u2019s lawsuit. She appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">We conclude the County did not owe Jackson a duty to look beyond the notary\u2019s certificate of acknowledgment and determine whether the power of attorney was legally sufficient to confer on Norton the power to engage in real property transactions on Jackson\u2019s behalf. As we will explain, the statutory scheme explicitly states that a county recorder shall not refuse, on the basis of \u201clack of legal sufficiency,\u201d to record \u201cany instrument, paper, or notice that is authorized or required by statute or court order to be recorded\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 27201, subd. (a)). Because the documents included certificates of acknowledgment by a notary, and the requirements of Government Code section 27201 were met, the county recorder was required to record them.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">In the unpublished part of this opinion, we conclude the trial court correctly denied Jackson leave to amend her complaint against the County. Thus, we shall affirm the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">On review of a judgment of dismissal entered after the trial court sustained a demurrer without leave to amend, we assume the truth of the properly pleaded and implied factual allegations of the complaint. <em>(Schifando v. City of Los Angeles </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 1074, 1081 [6 Cal.Rptr.3d 457, 79 P.3d 569].)</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">Jackson was the owner of two rental houses in the town of lone, in Amador County. In March 2007, her brother, Willie B. Norton, fraudulently executed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>a durable power of attorney, naming himself as Jackson\u2019s attorney in fact possessing the power to enter into real property transactions on her behalf, and had it notarized and recorded. Norton signed the document: \u201cJewel A. Jackson by Attorney in Fact Willie B. Norton.\u201d The certificate of acknowledgment of the notary public, appearing below the signature line, stated among other things that Norton \u201cpersonally appeared\u201d before the notary; that Norton proved, \u201con the basis of satisfactory evidence,\u201d to be \u201cthe person whose name is subscribed to the within instrument\u201d; and that he acknowledged \u201che executed the same in his authorized capacity.\u201d This acknowledgment was signed by C.J. Wallin, notary public for the State of California.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Norton also fraudulently executed two quitclaim deeds that purported to transfer Jackson\u2019s interest in her two houses to Norton, and had them notarized and recorded. The deeds were signed by Norton, purportedly on behalf of Jackson as her \u201cattorney in fact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">After recording these documents, Norton demanded that the tenants vacate the premises. The subsequent loss of rental income resulted in Jackson\u2019s inability to timely pay the mortgages.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Jackson sued Norton, Wallin, and the surety on Wallin\u2019s notary bond, seeking to cancel the power of attorney and both quitclaim deeds. Her complaint asserted claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress against Norton, and negligence on the part of Wallin for notarizing the power of attorney without Jackson being present.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Following a settlement with Wallin and the surety, Jackson filed a first amended complaint asserting a new cause of action against the County, alleging violation of Government Code section 27203 on the ground that the County \u201cwillfully, negligently or untruly caused to be recorded\u201d the power of attorney and quitclaim deeds. (Further section references are to the Government Code unless otherwise specified.)</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">The County demurred, arguing that \u201c[n]o cause of action exists against [a] county recorder for failing to investigate and determine the legal sufficiency of a document, specifically whether such document was procured by fraud,\u201d and that section 27203 \u201cshould not be interpreted to impose liability as that would be in contravention of the duties imposed by [section] 27201 and would require the county recorder to engage in the unauthorized practice of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>The trial court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Jackson\u2019s second amended complaint alleged the County violated section 27203 by \u201cwillfully, negligently, untruly and/or in a manner other than that prescribed by Government Code section 27201, et seq.[,] caused to be recorded\u201d the durable power of attorney and quitclaim deeds, and asserted the following wrongful acts: (1) \u201c[Recording a Durable Power of Attorney when such a paper is not an \u2018instrument\u2019 \u201d entitled to be recorded, (2) \u201cfailing to determine [that Jackson] did not sign the Durable Power of Attorney and therefore the paper was not recordable,\u201d (3) \u201cfailing to determine [that Jackson] did not acknowledge the Durable Power of Attorney and therefore the paper was not recordable,\u201d (4) \u201c[flailing to determine [that Jackson] did not sign the Quit Claim Deeds and therefore the instruments were not recordable,\u201d and (5) \u201c[flailing to determine [that Jackson] did not acknowledge the Quit Claim Deeds and therefore the instruments were not recordable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The County demurred, asserting that a durable power of attorney is indeed a recordable instrument; that the deeds and durable power of attorney were properly recorded; and that county recorders are not liable for failing to determine the legal sufficiency of an instrument, including whether it was properly signed or acknowledged.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">In opposition, Jackson argued section 27203 imposes a duty on the County to \u201cspot forgeries\u201d by ensuring that instruments sought to be recorded are signed by the person whose real property is affected and, if signed by an agent, by demanding proof that the principal was present and directed the agent to sign the instrument on her behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">The trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend, stating: \u201cThey\u2019re just recorders. They receive documents and they record them. [][]... [][] If we\u2019re going to hold them responsible for every defect in a legal instrument, the County might as well turn over their coffers to the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers in this state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">Jackson filed a notice of appeal from entry of the ensuing judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">Jackson contends that she \u201cstated a cause of action against the County of Amador for negligence pursuant to Government Code [section] 27203,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>which provides that, when a county recorder records an \u201cinstrument, paper, or notice, <em>willfully or negligently, untruly, or in any manner other than that prescribed by [the Recording Act],\u201d </em>the recorder may be \u201cliable to the party aggrieved for the amount of the damages occasioned thereby . . . .\u201d (\u00a7 27203, subd. (b), italics added.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">In Jackson\u2019s view, section 27203 should be interpreted to impose upon a county recorder a \u201cduty\u201d to \u201creview [an instrument presented for recording] to determine the proper person signed the instrument.\u201d Asserting that the power of attorney presented to the County by Norton for recording was \u201chighly suspicious of a forgery,\u201d Jackson claims the County was negligent in failing \u201cto return the document to [Norton, the purported] attorney-in-fact and request authentication by [Jackson] the principal.\u201d This is so, Jackson argues, even though the instrument included a certificate of acknowledgment by a notary public.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">As did the trial court, we conclude that section 27203 did not impose such a duty on the recorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">A county recorder \u201cshall, upon payment of proper fees and taxes, accept for recordation any instrument, paper, or notice that is authorized or required by statute or court order to be recorded, if the instrument, paper, or notice contains sufficient information to be indexed as provided by statute, meets recording requirements of state statutes and local ordinances, and is photographically reproducible. The county recorder <em>shall not refuse to record any instrument, </em>paper, or notice that is authorized or required by statute or court order to be recorded <em>on the basis of its lack of legal sufficiency.\u201d </em>(\u00a7 27201, subd. (a), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Powers of attorney and quitclaim deeds are instruments that, by statute, may be recorded. (\u00a7\u00a7 27232, 27280 [quitclaim deed], 27238 [power of attorney]; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Marks </em>(1874) 47 Cal. 242, 246-248 [power of attorney authorizing agent to execute instrument affecting title to real property was authorized to be recorded].)</p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>A power of attorney authorizes \u201can attorney-in-fact to act on the principal\u2019s behalf with respect to all lawful subjects and purposes or with respect to one or more express subjects or purposes.\u201d (Prob. Code, \u00a7 4123, subd. (a).) \u201cWith regard to property matters, a power of attorney may grant authority to make decisions concerning all or part of the principal\u2019s real and personal property . . . .\u201d (Prob. Code, \u00a7 4123, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">\u201cA notary acknowledgment shall be deemed complete for recording purposes without a photographically reproducible official seal of the notary public if the seal, as described in Section 8207, is present and legible, and the name of the notary, the county of the notary\u2019s principal place of business, the notary\u2019s telephone number, the notary\u2019s registration number, and the notary\u2019s commission expiration date are typed or printed in a manner that is photographically reproducible below, or immediately adjacent to, the notary\u2019s signature in the acknowledgment.\u201d (\u00a7 27201.5, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The power of attorney and quitclaim deeds recorded in this matter contained a certificate of acknowledgment by a notary, in the proper statutory form, indicating Norton personally appeared before the notary, proved to the notary that Norton was the person who had signed the instruments, and acknowledged to the notary that Norton executed the instruments in his authorized capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">However, the notary acknowledged the power of attorney even though it was not signed by Jackson or by a person in her presence and at her direction, as required by Probate Code section 4121, which states: \u201cA power of attorney is legally sufficient if all of the following requirements are satisfied: [f] (a) The power of attorney contains the date of its execution. [][] (b) The power of attorney is signed either (1) by the principal or (2) in the principal\u2019s name by another adult in the principal\u2019s presence and at the principal\u2019s direction, [f] (c) The power of attorney is either (1) acknowledged before a notary public or (2) signed by at least two witnesses who satisfy the requirements of [Probate Code section] 4122.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Jackson contends that, because the power of attorney was not executed in compliance with the aforesaid statute, it was not an \u201cinstrument\u201d within the meaning of section 27201 that the recorder was required to accept for recordation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">Section 27201 explicitly prohibits a recorder from refusing to record an instrument \u201con the basis of its lack of legal sufficiency.\u201d (\u00a7 27201, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>subd. (a).) Whether the power of attorney complied with Probate Code section 4121 bore upon its legal sufficiency, not upon its nature as an instrument within the meaning of section 27201.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Thus, the County correctly points out that it was required to record the power of attorney because (1) Norton paid the requisite fees and taxes, (2) the document was an instrument within the meaning of section 27201 that is authorized to be recorded, (3) it contained sufficient information to be indexed, (4) it was acknowledged by a notary, and (5) it was photographically reproducible. For the same reasons, the County\u2019s recorder was required to record the two quitclaim deeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Jackson disagrees, relying on section 27203, subdivision (b), which as noted above provides that a recorder is liable for damages occasioned by its recordation of an \u201cinstrument, paper, or notice, willfully or negligently, untruly, or in any manner other than that prescribed by [the Recorder Act].\u201d In Jackson\u2019s view, this statute \u201crecognizes the obligation of a [r]ecorder and its employees [to] have some knowledge [of] what can and cannot be recorded,\u201d including \u201cknowledge of the statutory definition of a \u2018power of attorney\u2019 and alternative methods of authenticating such a document under Probate Code [section] 4121.\u201d Thus, citing policy considerations set forth in <em>Rowland </em>v. <em>Christian </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 108, 113 [70 Cal.Rptr. 97, 443 P.2d 561], Jackson argues that subdivision (b) of section 27203 should be construed to impose on a recorder the duty to \u201creview ... the document to determine the proper person signed the instrument.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">The premise of Jackson\u2019s argument is flawed. Construed in harmony with section 27201, subdivision (a), section 27203 does not recognize an obligation on the part of a county recorder to know whether a power of attorney presented for recordation satisfies the requirements of Probate Code section 4121. This is so because that question deals with the legal sufficiency of a power of attorney, and section 27201, subdivision (a) plainly says a recorder may not refuse to record an instrument \u201con the basis of its lack of legal sufficiency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">\u201c[I]t has never been the duty of the county recorder to make determinations of that type of legal sufficiency; whether a document was sufficiently or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>correctly drafted to accomplish its purpose has always been a determination made by a court of law.\u201d (67 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 93, 96 (1984); see <em>City of Irvine </em>v. <em>Southern California Assn. of Governments </em>(2009) 175 Cal.App.4th 506, 521 [96 Cal.Rptr.3d 78] [while not binding on this court, an opinion of the Attorney General \u201cis entitled to great weight and, in the absence of contrary controlling authority, persuasive\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">To read the statutory scheme as Jackson urges would not only be inconsistent with section 27201, subdivision (a), it would place a county recorder\u2019s office in the untenable position of requiring its employees to in effect practice law and to second-guess a notary, rather than presume the notary has regularly performed his or her official duty. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 664.) Here, for example, the recorder could assume that the notary\u2019s certificate of acknowledgment of the power of attorney meant Jackson was present and directed Norton to sign the power of attorney and the quitclaim deeds as her attorney in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Indeed, the County points out that \u201c[t]here was no way for the County Recorder to know that the [power of attorney presented by Norton] had not been properly executed on behalf of Jackson or properly acknowledged before a notary .... As a practical matter, the county recorder\u2019s office could not function if each and every document presented for recording had to be attested to in person by all parties named therein. The recording system is only effective through the use of acknowledgments by notaries. Because the [power of attorney and quitclaim deeds were] acknowledged by a notary and met statutory requirements, [they were] properly recorded.\u201d \u201cLiability for any deficiency in the acknowledgment lies with [the] notary,\u201d not the recorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">For the reasons stated above, we conclude the county recorder did not have a duty to determine whether the power of attorney and quitclaim deeds were fraudulent despite the fact that they were acknowledged by a notary public. To the contrary, section 27201 required the County to record those instruments.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">II<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The judgment is affirmed. Jackson shall reimburse the County for its costs on appeal. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.278(a)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Hull, J., and Cantil-Sakauye, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b515-9\"> In pertinent part, section 27203 states more fully: \u201cAny recorder to whom an instrument proved or acknowledged according to law or any paper or notice which may by law be recorded is delivered for record is liable to the party aggrieved for the amount of the damages occasioned thereby, if [the recorder] commits any of the following acts: [][]... [f] (b) Records any instrument, paper, or notice, willfully or negligently, untruly, or in any manner other than that prescribed by this chapter [of the Recording Act].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b517-9\"> As \u201cthe major\u201d policy considerations in determining whether there exists a duty of care, <em>Rowland v.
