J.</author>\n<p id=\"APl\">In an effort to force a nationwide laundry company to employ only union members and to improve their working conditions, a labor union commenced a campaign utilizing a variation of a technique known as secondary picketing. The campaign was directed at a group of hospitals that used the services of the laundry company. The union mailed postcards to prospective clients of the hospitals, warning them that the hospitals had their laundry cleaned by a company that did not ensure the cleaned linens would be free of blood, feces, and other harmful pathogens. The postcards were intended to (1) dissuade people from using the hospitals because of the laundry company\u2019s shortcomings, thus (2) put pressure on the hospitals to stop using the laundry company\u2019s services, which would (3) persuade the laundry company to agree to the union\u2019s demands in order to avoid the loss of the hospitals\u2019 business.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-6\">The hospitals fought back. Armed with evidence that their inspection control and linen handling policies ensured the delivery of hygienically clean laundry to all their patients, but that the union\u2019s postcard campaign had caused fewer patients to use the hospitals, the hospitals sued the union for defamation, trade libel, and intentional interference with prospective economic relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-7\">The union appeals from the $17 million judgment entered after a jury found in favor of the hospitals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-8\">We agree with the union that the court committed harmful error by refusing to instruct the jury that the hospitals had the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the union made the defamatory publication with actual malice, i.e., with knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard of whether it was true or false.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-9\">As we will explain, binding federal law holds that this actual malice burden of proof applies to plaintiffs who seek state remedies for defamatory labor dispute publications, and that such publications include those directed at \u201csecondary targets,\u201d i.e., companies using the services of a company that is engaged in a labor dispute with an employee union. The postcard publication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1199\">*1199</page-number>in this case was such a labor dispute communication because the union used it to advance the union\u2019s primary dispute with the laundry company by exerting pressure on the hospitals to stop using the laundry\u2019s services if the labor dispute was not resolved. Instead of giving the required actual malice instruction, the trial court told the jury that the union could be liable if it failed to use reasonable care to determine the truth or falsity of the publication. This was harmful error because the instruction omitted a vital element of the case and misinformed the jury regarding the hospital\u2019s burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-5\">Accordingly, we shall reverse the judgment. In the unpublished parts of this opinion, we will address some of the union\u2019s other claims of error for guidance to the trial court on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-7\">This case has its genesis in a labor dispute between UNITE HERE and Angelica Textile Services, Inc. (Angelica). UNITE HERE, a labor union, is the collective bargaining representative for about 450,000 workers employed in the garment industry, industrial laundries, and food service establishments across North America. Angelica is the largest healthcare laundry company in the United States, with approximately 31 laundry facilities nationwide.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-8\">By early 2005, UNITE HERE represented over 2,500 workers at approximately 21 Angelica facilities, including workers at the laundry facilities used by Sutter Health hospitals (collectively Sutter Health).</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-9\">UNITE HERE had begun a nationwide campaign in 2003 to organize the workers at all of Angelica\u2019s commercial laundry facilities. Healthcare laundries were a big priority because, according to UNITE HERE, such workers face some of the worst and most hazardous working conditions. The \u201cAngelica campaign\u201d was designed to improve the working conditions and strengthen the union in the shops where UNITE HERE represented workers employed by Angelica, and to bring those protections to workers in unorganized shops.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-10\">UNITE HERE began investigating Angelica\u2019s physical facilities and their compliance with health and safety regulations. The union had received complaints from workers that, because of unsanitary conditions and inadequate separation between \u201cclean\u201d and \u201csoiled\u201d areas of the laundry, clean linens were being exposed to blood, feces, human tissue, and other hazards. According to the union, Angelica was not regularly disinfecting work areas and was not providing hepatitis B vaccines and training on blood-borne pathogens to workers in the laundry area. UNITE HERE members visited a number of Angelica shops to see if such unsanitary conditions were unique to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>a few shops or part of a larger pattern. Similar conditions were observed at all of the shops. Indeed, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) cited Angelica for putting clean linen in dirty carts, not providing workers with protective equipment, and having working conditions that caused workers to step in blood and feces.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-4\">UNITE HERE wrote to Angelica to complain about the company\u2019s noncompliance with OSHA\u2019s blood-borne-pathogen standards, urging it to remedy the sanitation and housekeeping problems in its soiled linen departments. Angelica did not respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-5\">Sutter Health used laundry facilities owned and operated by Golden State Services, Inc.\u2014facilities which Angelica acquired in December 2004. The laundry workers had a bargaining agreement with UNITE HERE that remained in effect until December 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-6\">In May 2004, UNITE HERE prepared a report, \u201cCompromising on Quality,\u201d which presented evidence that Angelica\u2019s failure to maintain a sanitary workplace \u201cleads to the delivery of soiled, smeared, and smelly linens\u201d to hospitals. The report (1) summarized the results of UNITE HERE\u2019s \u201csystematic investigation of the working conditions and quality control throughout Angelica\u2019s nation-wide system of healthcare laundries,\u201d and (2) incorporated the results of interviews with hundreds of Angelica workers across the country, people from each stage of the production process, and hospital materials management personnel. For example, an employee reported receiving \u201cclean\u201d linens with clots of blood or feces. Hospitals reported that, with varying degrees of frequency, Angelica delivered linens that were \u201csmeared, stained, tattered, damp, foul-smelling, and tom.\u201d A materials management employee at an Angelica client hospital reported that linen delivered by Angelica smelled \u201clike urine and BM.\u201d The report stated that Angelica\u2019s practices violated OSHA\u2019s requirements, as well as those of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO).</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-7\">UNITE HERE sent its \u201cCompromising on Quality\u201d report to many of Angelica\u2019s customers, including Sutter Health. The union also wrote to Sutter Health\u2019s vice-president for procurement about Angelica\u2019s problems; advised Sutter Health of the labor dispute; warned that, if it continued to do business with Angelica, Sutter Health could face service interruptions; and suggested that Sutter Health meet with representatives of UNITE HERE.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-8\">A few months after Angelica acquired the laundry facilities used by Sutter Health, UNITE HERE began escalating its campaign to organize all of the Angelica workers nationwide. According to UNITE HERE, Angelica had not been responsive to the union\u2019s health and safety concerns, and the hospitals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number>had not contacted UNITE HERE. The only response from one medical center was to ask the union to stop leafleting in front of its hospital. UNITE HERE, which had hoped to avoid a strike, began planning one for May 2005 at Angelica facilities in New York, Kansas, Texas, North Carolina, Florida, and some facilities in Southern California.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-5\">Meanwhile, around late March 2005, UNITE HERE mailed numerous postcards (1) warning that Angelica, the laundry service used by Sutter Health, did not ensure its linens were free of harmful pathogens, and (2) urging potential Sutter Health patients to protect their newborns because Sutter Health may not be taking sufficient precautions against potential infections.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-6\">One side of the postcard stated: \u201cEXPECTING? PR] You may be bringing home more than your baby if you deliver at a Sutter birthing center.\u201d The other side said: \u201cYou will do <em>anything </em>to protect your vulnerable newborn from infection\u2014but your Sutter birthing center may not be taking the same precautions. Reports have surfaced that Angelica, the laundry service utilized by Sutter, does not ensure that \u2018clean\u2019 linens are free of blood, feces, and harmful pathogens. PR] <em>Protect your newborn. </em>PR] Choose your birthing center wisely. PR] www.thedirtylaundry.org PR] UNITE HERE is engaged in a labor dispute with Angelica Textile Services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-7\">The Web site noted on the postcard contained information about the working conditions at Angelica facilities and included a copy of the \u201cCompromising on Quality\u201d report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-8\">The text of the postcard was the collaborative effort of UNITE HERE\u2019S research coordinator, Connie Razza, UNITE HERE\u2019s director of communications, Anastasia Ordonez, and another UNITE HERE employee, Cristina Gallo.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-9\">Razza devised the \u201cSutter Escalation Plan,\u201d which involved mailing the postcard to prospective clients of birthing centers at Sutter Health hospitals. The target audience was \u201cwealthier women between 25 and 40 who are registered to vote.\u201d The focus of the campaign was on Sutter Health because the creators of the postcard were trying to think \u201ccritically\u201d about Angelica\u2019s large corporate customers, and Sutter Health had become a significant customer a few months earlier. The purpose was to dissuade individuals from doing business with Sutter Health\u2019s affiliates unless Sutter Health stopped doing business with Angelica. Angelica had refused to listen to the union\u2019s complaints, and UNITE HERE thought that, if the union reached people whose interests were also affected by the conditions in these workplaces, then the workers\u2019 voices might be heard by Angelica.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>In June 2005, a few months after the postcard was mailed, UNITE HERE and Angelica entered into an organizing rights agreement under which UNITE HERE obtained the right to organize all of the remaining Angelica workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-4\">Meanwhile, in April 2005, Sutter Health sued UNITE HERE for defamation, trade libel, and intentional interference with prospective economic relations (IIPER), based on the publication of the postcard.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1114-5\">Sutter Health presented evidence that it experienced negative effects from UNITE HERE\u2019s campaign. For example, public opinion surveys conducted by Sutter Health on a regular basis revealed that the percentage of women aged 25 to 39 who disagreed with the statement that Sutter Health offers high-quality healthcare doubled after the postcard was mailed. Other evidence indicated that fewer women chose Sutter Health facilities as a birthing option. A field survey of the postcard recipients on UNITE HERE\u2019s mailing list, which survey replicated the postcard but used a fictitious \u201cXYZ\u201d hospital name in place of Sutter Health, indicated the message on the postcard negatively affected the recipients\u2019 willingness to use or recommend the fictitious hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-6\">Sutter Health also presented testimony from a representative group of its infection control practitioners, nurses, and linen managers who described their infection control practices and testified those practices ensured that Sutter Health provided patients with clean, safe linen. In addition, Dr. William Rutala, an expert in infection control and healthcare practices, reviewed Sutter Health\u2019s written infection control and linen handling policies and the inspection reports documenting Sutter Health\u2019s inspections of the three laundry facilities it uses. Dr. Rutala testified Sutter Health hospitals take reasonable and appropriate precautions to ensure that hygienically clean linen is delivered to all patients; indeed, Sutter Health voluntarily created and implemented practices for linen sanitation that included several extra and redundant layers of protection going above and beyond what is required by California law and infection control guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>UNITE HERE representatives were not aware or did not know if anyone had ever acquired an infection from linen laundered by Angelica and used by Sutter Health. And the union knew nothing about Sutter Health\u2019s infection control procedures. However, Razza, the union\u2019s research coordinator, testified that in early March 2005, she had a series of meetings with Sutter Health employees who told her about Sutter Health\u2019s linen quality and infection control problems. According to Razza, at least one woman from Sutter Health\u2019s environmental services department told her the linen received from Angelica \u201cwas really gross\u201d and \u201cc[a]me[] with stains and materials on it that is like human excrement and things like that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-5\">David Unger, an organizer in UNITE HERE\u2019s healthcare laundry division, testified he met with Angelica workers at many facilities, including those used by Sutter Health, and he observed many health and safety problems. He passed the information on to Razza and Gallo.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-6\">Belinda Thielen, the senior health and safety officer for UNITE HERE, testified she honestly believed that Angelica did not ensure its linens were free of pathogens. This belief was based on her research, what she learned at various Angelica facilities, and what her coworkers assigned to other Angelica facilities observed about unsanitary working conditions. Thielen interviewed workers from six California facilities, plus facilities in four other states, and she inspected several facilities in California. She observed many unsafe practices, including a lack <em>of </em>protective equipment for workers, a lack of soap and hot water in the bathrooms, workers standing on what appeared to be smears of blood and feces on flooring that could not be decontaminated easily, traffic patterns between the soiled linen areas and clean linen areas that did not appear to be properly controlled, and carts that appeared to have soil on them from hospital linen. Thielen learned that workers assigned to the clean side of the plant were finding contaminants such as blood and feces they felt presented a hazard to them. However, these reported incidents did not involve Angelica facilities that laundered Sutter Health\u2019s linens.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-7\">Thielen further testified she consulted with Dr. John Rosenberg, a public health physician, to determine whether linen that appeared to have been improperly cleaned at Angelica facilities could present a risk to people receiving the linen. Dr. Rosenberg explained there could be a problem for people with suppressed immune systems. Thielen believed that this would apply to babies because they have undeveloped immune systems. Thielen also conducted a search of medical literature and found that microbes can survive and grow on linens, that linens can be recontaminated after cleaning, and that there is documentation linking illness or infection with exposure to contaminated linens.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1204\">*1204</page-number>According to Thielen, she had no reason to doubt, and she was confident in, the information upon which she relied for the postcard. She knew that Angelica as a corporation had consistent practices throughout all of the plants with which UNITE HERE was familiar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-4\">Sutter Health argued UNITE HERE\u2019s postcard was defamatory and damaged Sutter Health\u2019s prospective economic prospects because it falsely indicated that Sutter Health did not use clean sheets or adequately care for the safety of infants bom at Sutter Health hospitals.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-5\">The jury found UNITE HERE liable to 12 of the 14 Sutter Health plaintiffs on the defamation and IIPER causes of action, and awarded them between $81,825 and $2,618,000 in damages for defamation, plus identical amounts for IIPER. The jury found that another plaintiff was entitled to defamation damages but not IDPER damages. The jury did not award the Sutter Health plaintiffs any damages for trade libel. The jury found the defamation and IIPER torts were committed with malice, fraud, or oppression but did not award any punitive damages. The total award plus costs exceeded $17 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-8\">UNITE HERE contends the trial court erred in refusing to give a proposed instmction that would have told jurors that, in order to find UNITE HERE liable for defamation, the Sutter Health plaintiffs \u201cmust prove by clear and convincing evidence that UNITE HERE knew the statements were false or had serious doubts about the truth of the statements.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1117-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1205\">*1205</page-number>The proposed instruction was based on <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan </em>(1964) 376 U.S. 254 [11 L.Ed.2d 686, 84 S.Ct. 710] (hereafter <em>New York Times), </em>which held that a public official or public figure plaintiff seeking damages for defamatory statements must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant acted with actual malice, i.e., the defendant made the defamatory statement with knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard of whether it was true or false. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 279-280 [11 L.Ed.2d at pp. 706-707]; see also <em>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc. </em>(1974) 418 U.S. 323, 342-343 [41 L.Ed.2d 789, 807, 94 S.Ct. 2997].) Such reckless disregard is a subjective standard that is measured by whether \u201c \u2018the defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of [its] publication,\u2019 \u201d not by whether a reasonably prudent person would have published the statement or would have investigated before publishing it. <em>(Harte-Hanks Communications Inc. </em>v. <em>Connaughton </em>(1989) 491 U.S. 657, 688 [105 L.Ed.2d 562, 589, 109 S.Ct. 2678]; see <em>St. Amant v. Thompson </em>(1968) 390 U.S. 727, 731 [20 L.Ed.2d 262, 267, 88 S.Ct. 1323].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-5\">UNITE HERE claims that Sutter Health is a public figure, thus the <em>New York Times </em>actual malice standard applies. Alternatively, the union contends that, even if Sutter Health is not a public figure, the actual malice standard applies because UNITE HERE\u2019S publication was made during a labor dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-6\">For reasons that follow, we conclude the requested actual malice instructions should have been given because the publication was a labor dispute communication. Therefore, we need not decide whether Sutter Health is a public figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1117-8\">\u201cLabor disputes are ordinarily heated affairs; the language that is commonplace there might well be deemed actionable <em>per se </em>in some state jurisdictions. Indeed, representation campaigns are frequently characterized by bitter and extreme charges, countercharges, unfounded rumors, vituperations, personal accusations, misrepresentations and distortions. Both labor and management often speak bluntly and recklessly, embellishing their respective positions with imprecatory language.\u201d <em>(Linn v. Plant Guard Workers </em>(1966) 383 U.S. 53, 58 [15 L.Ed.2d 582, 587, 86 S.Ct. 657] (hereafter <em>Linn).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1117-9\">Thus, in <em>Linn, </em>the United States Supreme Court found it was \u201cnecessary to determine whether libel actions in such circumstances might interfere with the national labor policy\u201d contained in the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq.). <em>(Linn, supra, </em>383 U.S. at p. 58 [15 L.Ed.2d at p. 587].) The \u201cresolution [of that question] entails accommodation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>federal interest in uniform regulation of labor relations with the traditional concern and responsibility of the State to protect its citizens against defamatory attacks.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 57-58 [15 L.Ed.2d at p. 587].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-4\">The court \u201cacknowledge[d] that the enactment of \u00a7 8(c) [of the NLRA] manifests a congressional intent to encourage free debate on issues dividing labor and management\u201d <em>(Linn, supra, </em>383 U.S. at p. 62 [15 L.Ed.2d at p. 589]) and that the National Labor Relations Board leaves \u201c \u2018to opposing parties the task of correcting inaccurate and untruthful statements.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 60 [15 L.Ed.2d at p. 588].) The court noted, however, that, while \u201ctolerating] intemperate, abusive and inaccurate statements made by [a] union during attempts to organize employees,\u201d the National Labor Relations Board \u201cdoes not interpret the Act as giving either party license to injure the other intentionally by circulating defamatory or insulting material known to be false.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 61 [15 L.Ed.2d at p. 589].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-5\">Accordingly, the Supreme Court held the exercise of state jurisdiction over defamatory statements in labor disputes is not inconsistent with the NLRA \u201cprovided [that state jurisdiction] is limited to redressing libel issued with knowledge of its falsity, or with reckless disregard of whether it was true or false.\u201d <em>(Linn, supra, </em>383 U.S. at p. 61 [15 L.Ed.2d at p. 589].) Stated another way, \u201cthe availability of state remedies for libel\u201d in labor disputes is limited \u201cto those instances in which the complainant can show that the defamatory statements were circulated with malice and caused him damage.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 64-65 [15 L.Ed.2d at p. 591].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-6\">Consequently, in the context of labor disputes, the court held that, to trigger the \u201cactual malice\u201d requirements of <em>New York Times, </em>the plaintiff need not be a public figure. <em>(Linn, supra, </em>383 U.S. at pp. 64-65 [15 L.Ed.2d at p. 591].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-7\">Moreover, \u201cany publication made during the course of union organizing efforts, which is arguably relevant to that organizational activity, is entitled to the protection of <em>Linn,\u201d </em>even if it is not made during a representation election campaign, and regardless of whether the publication concerns efforts leading to recognition or postrecognition organizing activity. <em>(Letter Carriers v. Austin </em>(1974) 418 U.S. 264, 279 [41 L.Ed.2d 745, 759, 94 S.Ct. 2770] (hereafter Austin).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1118-8\">Thus, libel and slander actions in state court may be brought within the context of a labor dispute only if the defamatory publication is shown by clear and convincing evidence to have been made with knowledge of its falsity, or with reckless disregard of whether it was true or not. <em>(Austin, supra, </em>418 U.S. at p. 281 [41 L.Ed.2d at p. 760]; <em>Ruzicka Electric &amp; Sons v. International Brotherhood </em>(8th Cir. 2005) 427 F.3d 511, 523.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1207\">*1207</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-5\">UNITE HERE asserts that its postcard publication was a labor dispute communication because it was made during union organizing efforts and was a means to cause Sutter Health to pressure Angelica to improve unsanitary workplace conditions and to organize all of its laundry establishments. (See, e.g., <em>Metropolitan Opera Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Local 100 </em>(2d Cir. 2001) 239 F.3d 172, 173-174, 177 [union\u2019s actions of seeking to assert social pressure on opera association in connection with labor dispute between union and association\u2019s food service provider, by warning of \u201crepercussions\u201d against those who did not join its boycott of opera association, including such repercussions as leafleting condemning an association donor for refusing to join, constituted protected speech under 1st Amend, notwithstanding that actions might have been harassing, upsetting, or coercive].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-6\">Controlling federal law supports UNITE HERE\u2019S contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-7\">Whether a labor dispute exists within the meaning of the NLRA is a question of law. <em>(Hasbrouck v. Sheet Metal Workers Local 232 </em>(9th Cir. 1978) 586 F.2d 691, 694.) The NLRA defines a \u201clabor dispute\u201d as \u201cany controversy concerning terms, tenure or conditions of employment, or concerning the association or representation of persons in negotiating, fixing, maintaining, changing, or seeking to arrange terms or conditions of employment, regardless of whether the disputants stand in the proximate relation of employer and employee.\u201d (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(9).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1119-8\">\u201cAs the statutory definition clearly states, the existence of a labor dispute does not depend upon the existence of an employer-employee relationship. As long as the union acts for some job-related reason in order to exert economic pressure, the conflict constitutes a labor dispute. \u2018Rarely have courts found concerted union activities to fall outside this broad definition. Where the union acts for some arguably job-related reason, and not out of pure social or political concerns, a \u201clabor dispute\u201d exists.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Beverly Hills Foodland v. United Food Workers </em>(E.D.Mo. 1993) 840 F.Supp. 697, 702 (hereafter <em>Beverly Hills Foodland))</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1119-9\">Thus, the partial preemption of state libel remedies \u201ccannot depend on some abstract notion of what constitutes a \u2018labor dispute\u2019 . . . [but] must turn on whether the defamatory publication is made in a context where the policies of the federal labor laws leading to protection for freedom of speech are significantly implicated.\u201d <em>(Austin, supra, </em>418 U.S. at p. 279 [41 L.Ed.2d at pp. 758-759].) \u201cUnions have a legitimate and substantial interest in continuing organizational efforts after recognition. WLether the goal is merely to strengthen or preserve the union\u2019s majority, or is to achieve 100% employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1208\">*1208</page-number>membership . . . these organizing efforts are equally entitled to the protection of [the NLRA].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 279 [41 L.Ed.2d at p. 759], fn. omitted.) Indeed, courts have routinely found that, within the context of the NLRA, a \u201clabor dispute\u201d \u201cexists in situations which do not involve any organizing activities by a union.\u201d <em>(Beverly Hills Foodland, supra, </em>840 F.Supp. at p. 702.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-4\">Accordingly, it does not matter that UNITE HERE\u2019s primary labor dispute was with Angelica and only secondarily with Sutter Health. <em>(Overstreet </em>v. <em>United Brotherhood of Carpenters </em>(9th Cir. 2005) 409 F.3d 1199 (hereafter Overstreet).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-5\"><em>Overstreet </em>explains: \u201cDisputes, labor and otherwise, commonly spill over to affect secondary institutions, as individuals with strong opinions concerning the dispute seek to convince those with some prospect of influencing the outcome of the dispute to do so. Clothing manufacturers allegedly operate sweatshops, and activists protest institutions that buy clothing from those manufacturers. [Citation.] A nation takes controversial political or military actions, and activists pressure universities and other institutions to divest endowment or other funds from businesses supporting those actions. [Citation.] [f] Whatever one might think about the merits of these disputes, all parties involved understand that a dispute does exist between activists and the \u2018secondary\u2019 institutions. There is likely to be disagreement, true, over whether the secondary is contributing to the primary\u2019s actions in any significant way, or whether the primary\u2019s actions are objectionable at all. But any such disagreement does not affect whether, in common parlance, a \u2018dispute\u2019 exists concerning maintaining ties with an individual or institution taking controversial action. And, when the specific dispute is whether the secondary institution should sever ties with another company so that the secondary institution does not undermine regional labor standards, \u2018labor dispute\u2019 is a perfectly apt description.\u201d <em>(Overstreet, supra, </em>409 F.3d at pp. 1216-1217; see also <em>Burlington No. R. Co. v. Maintenance Employees </em>(1987) 481 U.S. 429 [95 L.Ed.2d 381, 107 S.Ct. 1841] [refused to exclude secondary picketing activity from the Norris-LaGuardia Act definition of a labor dispute (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(c)), which is virtually identical to the NLRA definition of a labor dispute (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(9))].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-6\">Here, UNITE HERE sought to advance its primary dispute with Angelica by exerting pressure on Sutter Health. It intended the postcard to cause potential patients to question Sutter Health\u2019s use of Angelica and to raise the specter that the patients would boycott using Sutter Health for the birth of their children. In this manner, UNITE HERE hoped to cause Sutter Health to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1209\">*1209</page-number>pressure Angelica to improve the working conditions of its employees and to unionize all of Angelica\u2019s facilities.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1121-5\">The postcard communication was thus part of a labor dispute, just as was the publication in <em>San Antonio Hospital v. Southern California Council of Carpenters </em>(9th Cir. 1997) 125 F.3d 1230 (hereafter <em>San Antonio Hosp.), </em>in which a carpenters\u2019 union engaged in a labor dispute with a construction subcontractor hired by the hospital displayed a banner stating, \u201c \u2018THIS MEDICAL FACILITY IS FULL OF RATS.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1232-1233.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1121-6\">Consequently, Sutter Health had to meet the standard \u201ccommonly known as the <em>New York Times </em>\u2018actual malice\u2019 standard.\u201d <em>(San Antonio Hosp., supra, </em>125 F.3d at p. 1235.) In other words, Sutter Health was required to prove by clear and convincing evidence that UNITE HERE published the offending statement in the postcard with actual malice, i.e., with knowledge of its falsity, or with reckless disregard of whether it was true or false.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-7\">Because the trial court declined to give UNITE HERE\u2019s proposed actual malice jury instruction, Sutter Health was not put to its burden of proof on that element. This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-8\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-9\">Sutter Health contends that UNITE HERE\u2019s statements were not protected by federal labor law because they did not refer to labor grievances about employees\u2019 wages, hours, or conditions of employment. (Citing <em>Labor Board v. Electrical Workers </em>(1953) 346 U.S. 464 [98 L.Ed. 195, 74 S.Ct. 172]; <em>St. Luke\u2019s Episcopal-Presbyterian Hospitals v. National Labor Relations Bd. </em>(8th Cir. 2001) 268 F.3d 575, 579; <em>Five Star Transportation, Inc. </em>(2007) 349 NLRB 42.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-10\">However, the decisions upon which Sutter Health relies for the aforesaid proposition are inapposite because they were not actions for defamation and thus did not address whether defamatory statements were made during a labor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1210\">*1210</page-number>dispute, such that the <em>Linn </em>actual malice standard applies. Rather, they concerned when an employer can discharge an employee for disloyal statements, and when it cannot because the statements are considered protected activity. (29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157, 158.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-4\">The decisions simply held an <em>employee\u2019s </em>disparaging comments about an employer, which are unrelated to employment conditions, are not a protected activity under section 7 of the NLRA, and the employer\u2019s termination of the employee for mating such comments is not an unfair labor practice under section 8 of the NLRA. They do not support Sutter Health\u2019s suggestion that similarly disparaging comments by a <em>union </em>concerning a secondary employer during the course of a labor dispute are not subject to the <em>Linn </em>actual malice standard if the comments do not explicitly address wages, hours, or working conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-5\">As demonstrated by the decision in <em>San Antonio Hosp., supra, </em>125 F.3d 1230, the actual malice standard applies to communications in furtherance of a labor dispute, even if the communications do not refer to wages, hours, or working conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-7\">Having determined that the trial court erred in refusing to give the requested actual malice instruction, we must decide whether the error was prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-8\">\u201cThe standard of actual malice is a daunting one\u201d <em>(McFarlane </em>v. <em>Esquire Magazine </em>(D.C. Cir. 1996) 316 U.S. App.D.C. 35 [74 F.3d 1296, 1308]) that focuses solely on the defendant\u2019s subjective state of mind at the time of publication <em>(Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of U. S., Inc. </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 485, 512 [80 L.Ed.2d 502, 524, 104 S.Ct. 1949]). The plaintiff must prove that the defendant was actually aware the contested publication was false or that the defendant made the publication with reckless disregard of whether it was true or false. <em>(Linn, supra, </em>383 U.S. at p. 61 [15 L.Ed.2d at p. 589]; <em>New York Times, supra, </em>376 U.S. at pp. 279-280 [11 L.Ed.2d at p. 706].) Such reckless disregard means the defendant entertained serious doubts as to the truth of the publication, i.e., that the defendant had \u201ca \u2018high degree of awareness\u2019 \u201d of its \u201c \u2018probable falsity.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Harte-Hanks Communications v.

It is not measured by what a reasonably prudent person would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1211\">*1211</page-number>published, or would have investigated before publishing. <em>(Harte-Hanks Communications </em>v. <em>Connaughton, supra, </em>491 U.S. at p. 688 [105 L.Ed.2d at p. 589]; <em>St. Amant </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>390 U.S. at p. 731 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 267].) The failure to conduct a thorough and objective investigation, standing alone, does not prove actual malice. <em>(St. Amant v. Thompson, supra, </em>390 U.S. at p. 733 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 268].) \u201cMere negligence does not suffice\u201d <em>(Masson v. New Yorker Magazine, Inc. </em>(1991) 501 U.S. 496, 510 [115 L.Ed.2d 447, 468, 111 S.Ct. 2419]), nor does \u201cgross or even extreme negligence\u201d <em>(McCoy v. Hearst Corp. </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 835, 860 [231 Cal.Rptr. 518, 727 P.2d 711]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-5\">Furthermore, the plaintiff must prove actual malice by \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence\u2014a standard of proof that imposes a \u201c \u2018heavy burden,\u2019 [citation], far in excess of the preponderance sufficient for most civil litigation.\u201d <em>(Eastwood </em>v. <em>National Enquirer, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1997) 123 F.3d 1249, 1252.) This standard requires the evidence of actual knowledge of the falsity of the statement, or reckless disregard for its falsity, must be of such a character \u201cas to command the unhesitating assent of every reasonable mind.\u201d <em>(Rosenaur v. Scherer </em>(2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 260, 274 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 674].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-6\">Rather than give an actual malice instruction, the court told the jurors they could find UNITE HERE liable if Sutter Health proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the union failed to use reasonable care to determine the truth or falsity of the publication. This instruction omitted a vital element of the case and misinformed the jurors regarding Sutter Health\u2019s burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-7\">Surely, \u201c \u2018it seems probable\u2019 \u201d that such a significant error \u201c \u2018prejudicially affected the verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Soule v. General Motors Corp. </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 548, 580 [34 Cal.Rptr.2d 607, 882 P.2d 298]; accord, <em>Green v. State of California </em>(2007) 42 Cal.4th 254, 266 [64 Cal.Rptr.3d 390, 165 P.3d 118].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-8\">Sutter Health disagrees, arguing the error is harmless because its attorney argued to the jury that UNITE HERE knew the publication was false; there is substantial evidence that UNITE HERE fabricated the publication about Sutter Health; and the jury\u2019s verdict on punitive damages\u2014which required a finding of malice, fraud, or oppression (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3294; CACI No. 3946)\u2014demonstrates that the jury necessarily found UNITE HERE acted with actual malice. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1212\">*1212</page-number>The instructions given by the court said Sutter Health could establish defamation by proving \u201cUNITE HERE failed to use reasonable care to determine the truth or falsity of the statement(s).\u201d Thus, Sutter Health counsel\u2019s argument that UNITE HERE knew the publication was false did not cure the instructional error that in effect told the jurors they could find the union liable for defamation even if UNITE HERE (fid not know the publication was false or did not have serious doubts about its truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-4\">Even if Sutter Health is correct in asserting that there is substantial evidence that UNITE HERE fabricated the implication regarding Sutter Health\u2019s poor sanitary conditions, this does not make the instructional error harmless. Whether UNITE HERE can be considered to have purposely avoided the truth and fabricated the publication, or whether it merely made a good faith reasonable inference based on the investigation it made and the scientific evidence available to it, is a question of fact for the jury; and we cannot say, as a matter of law, that UNITE HERE fabricated the publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-5\">The jury\u2019s verdict that UNITE HERE acted with \u201cmalice, fraud, or oppression\u201d with respect to the issue of punitive damages is not the equivalent of a finding of \u201cactual malice\u201d necessary for a union to be liable for a defamatory publication made as part of a labor dispute. The court instructed the jury that \u201cmalice,\u201d as used in the phrase \u201cmalice, fraud, or oppression\u201d for purposes of punitive damages, \u201cmeans that UNITE HERE acted with intent to cause injury or that UNITE HERE\u2019s conduct was despicable and was done with a willful and knowing disregard of the rights or safety of another. A person acts with knowing disregard when he or she is aware of the probable dangerous consequences of his or her conduct and deliberately fails to avoid those consequences.\u201d Based on this instruction, the jury might have found that UNITE HERE\u2019s conduct satisfied the definition of malice simply because the statements in the postcard were made with the intent to injure Sutter Heath\u2014which is not the same as acting with knowledge that the statements were false or with deliberate disregard for whether they were true or false.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number>For the reasons stated above, Sutter Health has failed to show that the instructional error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-5\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-6\">UNITE HERE argues that it is entitled to entry of judgment in its favor, as a matter of law, because Sutter Health cannot meet the burden of proof necessary to establish liability. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-7\">Whether there is sufficient evidence to permit a finding of actual malice is a question of law. <em>(Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of U. S., Inc., supra, </em>466 U.S. at pp. 510-511 [80 L.Ed.2d at p. 523].) The evidence could be interpreted as showing that, based on their research and investigation, UNITE HERE\u2019s employees had a good faith belief that the three main statements conveyed by the postcard were true: (1) reports surfaced that Angelica was not ensuring its laundered linens were free of harmful pathogens; (2) Sutter Health used Angelica\u2019s linens; and (3) this meant Sutter <em>might </em>not be doing everything it could to protect vulnerable newborns from infections, since UNITE HERE\u2019s research indicated that persons with compromised immune systems could be harmed by pathogens on improperly laundered sheets. On the other hand, Sutter Health presented evidence that (1) its infection control and linen handling policies and practices included extra and redundant layers of protection beyond what is required by California law and infection control guidelines; (2) its policies and practices ensured that hygienically clean and safe linen was delivered to all patients in Sutter Heath hospitals; and (3) UNITE HERE representatives had no evidence that any Sutter Health patient had ever been harmed by linens laundered by Angelica and used by Sutter Health. Based on this evidence, a jury could conclude that UNITE HERE\u2019s knowledge of Angelica\u2019s laundry facilities\u2019 problems in other parts of the country, and the union\u2019s extrapolation to what this meant concerning Sutter Health\u2019s sanitary precautions, was an unjustified fabrication based on purposeful avoidance of the truth, rather than on a mere negligent and inadequate investigation. Thus, whether UNITE HERE acted with actual malice is a question for the jury to resolve, and the matter must be remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-8\">II-V<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-4\">\u25a0 The judgment is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-5\">Blease, J., and Raye, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1126-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied August 18, 2010, and the petition of plaintiffs and appellants for review by the Supreme Court was denied November 10, 2010, S185894.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1114-7\"> UNITE HERE\u2019s methodology might be construed as an unlawful labor practice, but Sutter Health chose not to pursue recourse on this ground.

This was pointed out by the United States District Court when it rejected UNITE HERE\u2019s attempt to remove the action to federal court. The district court observed that Sutter Health likely could have raised a federal question by alleging an unfair labor practice claim, but it chose not to avail itself of that remedy\u2014instead pursuing state law remedies in its quarrel with UNITE HERE, which the federal district court referred to as a labor dispute. <em>(Sutter Health v.
