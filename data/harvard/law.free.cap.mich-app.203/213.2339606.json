In a prior opinion, we upheld the Michigan Employment Relations Commission\u2019s finding that respondent, Michigan Department of Mental Health (dmh) is a joint employer with respondent Louisiana Homes, Inc., a nonprofit residential home care provider, of the direct-care workers at three Louisiana Homes facilities. <em>Michigan Council 25, AFSCME v Louisiana Homes, Inc, </em>192 Mich App 187; 480 NW2d 280 (1991) . Following our decision, the dmh filed an application for leave to appeal to our Supreme Court, which was originally denied, 440 Mich 879 (1992) ; however, after the dmh filed a motion for reconsideration, raising for the first time the issue of lack of jurisdiction by virtue of federal preemption under the National Labor Relations Act, 29 USC 141 <em>et seq., </em>our Supreme Court vacated our prior opinion and remanded the case to this Court for \"consideration of the jurisdictional question in light of <em>Int\u2019l Longshoremen\u2019s Ass\u2019n v Davis </em>[476 US 380; 106 S Ct 1904; 90 L Ed 2d 389 (1986)].\u201d 441 Mich 883 (1992). We conclude that the merc had jurisdiction to decide this case, and, therefore, we reaffirm our prior opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Subject to limited exceptions, when an activity is \"arguably\u201d subject to the provisions of the nlra, states must defer to the exclusive competence of the National Labor Relations Board. <em>Davis </em>at 381, 394; <em>San Diego Building Trades Council v Garmon, </em>359 US 236, 245; 79 S Ct 773; 3 L Ed 2d 775 (1959). When a party asserts that state proceedings are preempted because the conduct at issue is within the purview of the nlra, the claim represents a challenge to the subject-matter jurisdiction of the state court or tribunal; it is '.'a claim that the state court has no power to adjudicate the subject mat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>ter of the case.\u201d <em>Davis </em>at 393. Thus, when a claim of nlra preemption is raised, <em>Davis </em>directs that \"it must be considered and resolved by the state court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The issue of nlra preemption having been raised here by the dmh, we are now called upon to consider and resolve it.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-3\">In the instant case, the petitioner filed a petition with the merc seeking certification as the collective bargaining agent for certain workers who provide direct care to mentally ill or mentally retarded persons in three residential facilities operated by Louisiana Homes. The dmh was named as a joint employer of the direct-care workers. Following a hearing, the merc found that, given the extent of the dmh\u2019s power and control over employment matters involving the direct-care workers, it was a joint employer with Louisiana Homes of the direct-care workers. The facts of this case relative to the relationship between the dmh and Louisiana Homes, and the extent of the dmh\u2019s power and control over employment matters involving the Louisiana Homes direct-care workers, are set forth in our prior opinion. <em>Louisiana Homes, supra, </em>192 Mich App 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">In this case, resolution of the nlra preemption issue turns on the status of the relationship between the dmh and Louisiana Homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">An \"employer\u201d subject to the provisions of the nlra does not include a \"State or political subdivision thereof.\u201d 29 USC 152(2). The parties do not dispute that the dmh, because it is a department created directly by the state, is an exempt political subdivision. See <em>NLRB v Natural Gas Utility Dist of Hawkins Co, </em>402 US 600, 604-605; 91 S Ct 1746; 29 L Ed 2d 206 (1971). In the context of the \"political subdivision\u201d exemption, the nlrb has recognized that an otherwise statutory employer may also be exempt from the nlrb\u2019s jurisdiction if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>an exempt governmental entity exerts a substantial degree of control over it. <em>Human Development Ass\u2019n v NLRB, </em>290 US App DC 339, 342-343; 937 F2d 657 (1991), cert den \u2014 US \u2014; 112 S Ct 1512; 117 L Ed 2d 649 (1992); <em>NLRB v Parents &amp; Friends of the Specialized Living Center, </em>879 F2d 1442, 1449 (CA 7, 1989); Res-Care, <em>Inc v Indiana Joint Bd, Retail, Wholesale &amp; Dep\u2019t Store Union, </em>280 NLRB 670 (1986). See also <em>Long Stretch Youth Home, Inc v Maryland State Employees Council 92, </em>280 NLRB 678 (1986). In deciding whether an employer is exempt from the nlrb\u2019s jurisdiction because of its ties to an exempt governmental entity, the nlrb examines \"not only the control over essential terms and conditions of employment retained by the employer, but also the scope and control exercised by the exempt entity over the employer\u2019s labor relations, to determine whether the employer in issue is capable of engaging in meaningful collective bargaining.\u201d <em>Res-Care </em>at 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\">We disagree with the petitioner\u2019s contention that resolution of the preemption issue is controlled by the merc\u2019s finding that the dmh and Louisiana Homes are joint employers. <em>Davis </em>makes clear that it is not within the competence of a state court to adjudicate whether a particular case falls within the purview of the nlra. <em>Davis </em>at 390, 397. Quoting from <em>Garmon, </em>the <em>Davis </em>Court stated, \"It is essential to the administration of the [nlra] that these determinations be left in the first instance to the [nlrb].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 390. According to <em>Davis, </em>when faced with a preemption claim, the court must first \"decide whether there is an arguable case for pre-emption; if there is, it must defer to the Board, and only if the Board decides that the conduct is not protected or prohibited may the court entertain the litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 397. Thus, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>this case, resolution of the preemption issue depends not on whether the dmh and Louisiana Homes are joint employers under state law as the merc decided but on whether this case is \"arguably\u201d one where the nlrb, applying its own standards, could legally decide to assert jurisdiction over Louisiana Homes. Cf. <em>Davis </em>at 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-3\">The record in this case indicates that, while the dmh exercises significant control over various aspects of Louisiana Homes\u2019 labor relations, Louisiana Homes continues to retain some control over essential terms and conditions of employment. Whether the control retained by Louisiana Homes over employment matters rises to a level such that the nlrb could legally decide to assert jurisdiction over it notwithstanding the control over labor relations exercised by the dmh is, in our view, at least arguable.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">Nonetheless, notwithstanding our conclusion that an \"arguable\u201d case for preemption exists, if it can be shown that the nlrb, within its discretion as provided in \u00a7 164(c) of the nlra,* <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2has declined or would decline to assert jurisdiction, then a state court or tribunal would be free to assert its jurisdiction. <em>Int\u2019l Union of Operating Engineers, Local No 3 v Bing Construction Co of Nevada, </em>90 Nev 183, 186; 521 P2d 1231 (1974); <em>Russell v Electrical Workers Local 569, </em>64 Cal 2d 22, 25; 48 Cal Rptr <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>702; 409 P2d 926 (1966). In order to prevent fruitless submissions to the nlrb, it is not necessary under \u00a7 164(c) for a party to first submit a given case to the nlrb for a determination of the jurisdictional question; rather, a party need only show on the basis of \"rule of decision or by published rules\u201d that the nlrb has or would have declined jurisdiction. 29 USC 164(c)(1); <em>Russell, supra </em>at 25. In ruling on such a claim, a state court would not be determining \"the operative provisions or the coverage of the [nlra],\u201d nor substituting its own view \"for that of the Board.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28. Rather, it would merely be \"applying] standards which the Board has [already] laid down.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Here, although the parties did not raise the issue of nlra preemption before the merc, the issue did not go unaddressed. Our review of the merc\u2019s written decision discloses that the merc recognized that its jurisdiction might be questioned, and, therefore, it, sua sponte, undertook to address the issue of nlra preemption before proceeding to a decision on the merits. In addressing the preemption issue, the merc noted that twice before labor disputes involving the dmh and an employer health-care institution like Louisiana Homes had been submitted to the nlrb.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In both cases, the merc noted, the dmh exercised control over the employer\u2019s labor relations pursuant to the \"same type of contract\u201d that exists in this case. Both cases resulted in a decision in which the nlrb declined to assert jurisdiction on the basis that extensive control by the dmh over the employer\u2019s labor relations made meaningful bargaining impossible._</p>\n<p id=\"b235-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Because the dmh is the same governmental entity and Louisiana Homes is the same type of employer as was involved in each of these other cases, and because the control exercised by the dmh over the Louisiana Homes\u2019 direct-care workers is governed by the same type of contract that existed in these other cases, we agree with the merc that a sufficient showing has been made that the nlrb would refuse to assert jurisdiction over the labor dispute in this case. Therefore, under 29 USC 164(c)(2), the merc was free to assert its jurisdiction. Again, our resolution of this issue stems not from our own interpretation of the nlra, but from our application of the nlrb\u2019s own decisions under like circumstances.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\">Accordingly, we find, as did the merc, that state jurisdiction was not lacking because of preemption under the nlra, and, therefore, the merc had jurisdiction to decide this case. In view of this conclusion, we hereby reaffirm our prior opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b233-5\"> 29 USC 164(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-6\">(1) The Board, in its discretion, may, by rule of decision or by published rules . . . decline to assert jurisdiction over any labor dispute involving any class or category of employers, where, in the opinion of the Board, the effect of such labor dispute on commerce is not sufficiently substantial to warrant the exercise of its jurisdiction. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-7\">(2) Nothing in this subchapter shall be deemed to prevent or bar any agency or the courts of any State . . . from assuming and asserting jurisdiction over labor disputes over which the Board declines, pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection, to assert jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b234-6\"> See <em>Residential Systems, Inc, </em>unpublished decision of the nlrb Seventh Region Director, decided April 7, 1988 (Case No. 7-RC-18529) and <em>CK Homes, </em>unpublished decision of the nlrb Seventh Region Director, decided February 14, 1986 (Case No. 7-RM-1275).
