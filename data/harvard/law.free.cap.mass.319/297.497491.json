G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 34, as amended. Since the latter date the insurer, pursuant to an approved agreement under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 34A, inserted by St. 1935, c. 364, as amended by St. 1943, c. 276, has paid weekly compensation. On May 3, 1945, at the request of the insurer under \u00a7 34A, as amended, there was a hearing on the question of total and permanent disability before a single member of the Industrial Accident Board, at which the insurer offered to show that the employee was able to do some work. In response to questions by the single member, counsel for. the insurer stated that he could present no evidence that the employee had earned any wages since the making of the agreement to pay compensation. The single member then ruled, subject to the insurer\u2019s exception, that in the absence of such evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>dence he had no jurisdiction to hear the case, and dismissed the insurer\u2019s \u201cclaim for a hearing on\u201d the question of total and permanent disability. The reviewing board affirmed the decision of the single member. In the Superior Court a decree was entered that the insurer\u2019s \u201cappeal from findings and decision of the Industrial Accident Board be dismissed,\u201d and the insurer appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The point to be determined is whether, after an approved agreement under \u00a7 34A, jurisdiction to review the question of total and permanent disability depends solely upon whether the employee subsequent to the agreement has in fact earned wages. Section 34A, as amended, provides, \u201cAt any time before or after an injured employee has received the maximum compensation to which he is or may be entitled under sections thirty-four and thirty-five, or either of them, such employee and the insurer may agree, or, on application for a hearing by either party, a member or, on review, the board may find, .that the disability suffered by the injured employee is total and permanent. After such an agreement or finding, during the continuance of such total and permanent disability, the insurer shall make or continue to make payments to the injured employee under section thirty-four so long as compensation is payable under said section, and thereafter during such continuance shall pay to the injured employee a weekly compensation equal to one half his average weekly wages . . . [subject to certain maximum and minimum requirements J. If an employee who has been agreed or found to be totally and permanently disabled earns wages at any time thereafter, payments of compensation may be suspended in the manner provided in section twenty-nine. If such wages are earned before the injured employee has received the maximum compensation to which he is or may be entitled as aforesaid, such employee, during the period of suspension, may, if otherwise entitled thereto, receive payments under section thirty-five; but if such wages are earned after he has received such maximum, no payments shall be made during such period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The reasoning of the decision of the single member, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>adopted by the board, was that there is no general provision in \u00a7 34A, as amended, for inquiry as to whether an employee is totally and permanently disabled; that the only reason for which compensation paid under \u00a7 34A may be suspended is the actual earning of wages by the employee; and that the one method of relief open to the insurer is to ask for a suspension of payments \u201cunder\u201d \u00a7 29.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The only case cited in the decision is <em>Bott\u2019s Case, </em>230 Mass. 152, which held that, under the workmen\u2019s compensation act as it then stood (St. 1911, c. 751, Part II, \u00a7 6, as amended), the widow of an employee did not by remarriage lose the right to receive compensation awarded to her, as the act made no provision for inquiry into any subsequent change in her condition of dependency. See now G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 31, as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Our concern, however, is whether inquiry into changed conditions is permissible under \u00a7 34A, as amended, which expressly requires payments only during \u201ccontinuance\u201d of total and permanent disability. And we have recently said, \u201cIt is apparent from the terms of \u00a7 34A, as amended, that total and permanent disability is intended to mean total and permanent disability to earn wages.\u201d <em>Frennier\u2019s Case, </em>318 Mass. 635, 639. We do not think that the provision for the suspension of payments, not \u201cunder\u201d, but \u201cin the manner\u201d provided in, \u00a7 29, as amended, where the employee \u201cearns wages,\u201d offers the only method and specifies the only ground for determination of \u201ccontinuance\u201d of such disability. Such a restrictive interpretation seems to us utterly unjustified. Under that construction, instead of prescribing payments during the \u201ccontinuance\u201d of permanent and total disability, \u00a7 34A, as amended, would require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>payments to be made indefinitely to an employee who, although capable of doing so, chose not to earn wages. In that event the \"continuance\u201d of permanent and total disability would be wholly artificial, and could be prolonged contrary to fact at the option of the employee. We cannot believe that the Legislature intended that result or has used language requiring it. We conclude that there was error in the ruling in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">' Our conclusion is in conformity with other decisions under the workmen\u2019s compensation act. The agreement for compensation is a final determination of the facts of liability, employment, and injury arising out of and in the course of employment, but not of the extent of the injury, or the payments to be made except for the period covered. <em>MacKinnon\u2019s Case, </em>286 Mass. 37, 38-39. <em>West\u2019s Case, </em>313 Mass. 146, 153. <em>Amon\u2019s Case, </em>315 Mass. 210, 216. The nature of the inquiry under \u00a7 34A is the same as under \u00a7\u00a7 34 and 35, relating respectively to total disability and partial disability. <em>Hummer\u2019s Case, </em>317 Mass. 617, 624. <em>Frennier\u2019s Case, </em>318 Mass. 635, 639. Weekly payments under \u00a7\u00a7 34 and 35 may be changed if the employee\u2019s condition warrants. <em>Johnson\u2019s Case, </em>242 Mass. 489, 494. <em>Korobchuk\u2019s Case, </em>280 Mass. 412, 416. <em>MacKinnon\u2019s Case, </em>286 Mass. 37, 38-39. <em>Casieri\u2019s Case, </em>286 Mass. 50, 53-55. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 12, as amended. This may involve determining from time to time whether incapacity is total or partial. \"It is common knowledge that a condition, which, as in the case at bar, originally was one of total disability may by improvement change to partial disability, and if at the request of the insurer and after a hearing it appears that total disability has ceased the amount of compensation is to be accordingly reduced.\u201d <em>Ginley\u2019s Case, </em>244 Mass. 346, 348. \"After a period of total incapacity there may be a period of partial incapacity, followed by another period of total incapacity.\u201d <em>Paterno\u2019s Case, </em>266 Mass. 323, 326. See <em>Hunnewell\u2019s Case, </em>220 Mass. 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The decree of the Superior Court is reversed, and the insurer\u2019s \"claim\u201d is to stand for hearing before the Industrial Accident Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b349-6\"> Section 29, as appearing in St. 1937, c. 382, reads: <em>. </em>. except under section thirty-five, no compensation shall be paid for any period for which any wages were earned. When compensation shall have begun it shall not be discontinued except with the written assent of the employee, or with the approval of the department or a member thereof, granted only after an impartial examination or after a personal interview with the employee by a member or employee of the department or after failure of the employee to report for or submit to such examination or interview after reasonable notice by the department; provided, that such compensation shall be paid in accordance with section thirty-five if the employee in fact earns wages after the original agreement or decision is filed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
