The essential facts need not necessarily be proved by direct evidence but may be established by reasonable inferences drawn from facts shown to exist. <em>Rich\u2019s Case, </em>301 Mass. 545, 547. <em>Sawyer\u2019s Case, </em>315 Mass. 75, 76. <em>Griffin\u2019s Case, </em>318 Mass. 282, 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">The insurer contends that the evidence would not warrant the finding that the employee\u2019s disability resulted from an injury arising out of and in the course of his employment. There was evidence of the following facts: The employee had worked as a bench molder for the Fremont Casting Company for five or six years prior to May 31, 1944, the date of the alleged injury. His work was described as \u201cheavy.\u201d On May 31, 1944, after handling some iron flasks he \u201cfelt so badly he started to cry and had to leave everything.\u201d His back felt \u201clike somebody stick a knife in it.\u201d The employee called as his witness one Dr. Mulhern who had examined him on August 29, 1944. His report of the examination, which was introduced in evidence without objection, under the heading \u201cHistory\u201d stated \u201cLifting heavy casting \u2014 150 to 200 lbs., May 31, 1944 strained his back. Had to quit work.\u201d The diagnosis was \u201cOld lumbosacral strain superimposed upon and aggravating a previously existing chronic proliferative arthritis with a weak lumbo-sacral angle.\u201d Dr. Mulhern testified that his diagnosis was based on the assumption that the employee strained his back in lifting a one hundred fifty to two hundred pound weight on the morning of May 31, 1944, and that if that is not a fact it \u201ctakes the prop out from under\u201d his diagnosis. He was of the opinion that the employee was still unable to perform the kind of work he was doing at the time he was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The only support for a finding that the employee was lifting a weight of one hundred fifty to two hundred pounds on May 31, 1944, is the statement mentioned above under the heading \u201cHistory\u201d appearing in Dr. Mulhern\u2019s report. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>insurer, relying on <em>Perangelo\u2019s Case, </em>277 Mass. 59, 64-65, argues that this cannot be treated as affirmative evidence of that fact and that without it the medical testimony on which the board\u2019s findings were based was of no value. But we need not decide this because we think that there was other evidence from which the board could infer that the employee on May 31, 1944, while engaged in lifting heavy objects suffered a back sprain. The employee\u2019s work was described as \u201cheavy,\u201d and there was evidence that on May 31 he was handling iron flasks shortly before he complained of the pain in his back. We cannot\" say in view of this that the assumption on which Dr. Mulhern\u2019s opinion was based was unsupported by evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-3\"><em>Decree </em>affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
