When on May 1, 1944, the plaintiffs reoccupied the apart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>ment, and requested the defendant to supply gas, the defendant refused to turn on the gas until certain charges for gas made during the time when the apartment was unoccupied, that were contested by the plaintiffs, should be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-3\">A demurrer to the bill was sustained, and the bill was dismissed. The plaintiffs appealed. The plaintiffs also appealed from the denial of their motion to amend the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Without discussing other objections, it is enough to say that the Legislature has provided an exclusive remedy for such cases by application to the department of public utilities.
