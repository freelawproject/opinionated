The plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-14\">On the issue whether the plaintiffs produced a customer ready, willing, and able to buy on terms satisfactory to the defendant the evidence in its aspect most favorable to the plaintiffs tended to show that the plaintiffs interested one Frechette in the property; that the defendant said he would let the property go for $8,000; that one of the plaintiffs told the defendant\u2019s wife that \u201cthe Frechettes would pay $8,000\u201d; that the defendant\u2019s wife arranged for the parties to meet at an attorney\u2019s office \u201cto have an agreement drawn for the sale of the property and to make sure that they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>to receive \u2018$8,000 cash\u2019\u201d; that thereafter there was further talk between the plaintiffs and the defendant in which the defendant said he wanted it understood before he went to the attorney that he was to have $8,000 in cash, but one of the plaintiffs said that the defendant was \u201csupposed\u201d to pay the commission; and that the plaintiffs refused to go to the attorney\u2019s office \u201cunder those conditions.\u201d So far as appears this was the end of the matter, and no agreement was drawn up.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-3\">The defendant\u2019s price of $8,000, whether a commission was to be paid out of it, as the plaintiffs insisted, or whether it was to be net to the defendant, as he seems to have insisted, in the absence of any other qualification upon it, was an offer to sell for cash down in full. <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Rosenberg, </em>238 Mass. 138, 141. There was no evidence that Frechette ever in fact made to the defendant or to the plaintiffs an offer of $8,000 cash down, whatever one of the plaintiffs may have told the defendant\u2019s wife \u201cthe Frechettes would pay.\u201d There was no evidence that the defendant\u2019s wife was the defendant\u2019s agent to receive offers coming through the plaintiffs. There was no evidence that Frechette had more than $4,200 in cash or that he could get the remaining $3,-800. A finding was tiot warranted that Frechette was ready, willing, and able to pay $8,000 in cash. Even if such a finding could have been made, there would still have been no evidence that Frechette\u2019s readiness to pay that sum in cash had been communicated to the defendant before the defendant had insisted that he receive the $8,000 free of commission. In short, the evidence would not warrant a finding that the plaintiffs had ever produced a purchaser ready, willing, and able to buy on terms satisfactory to the defendant.
