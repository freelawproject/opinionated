The defendant excepted to the denial of his motion for a directed verdict of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">The facts which the jury could have found may be stated briefly., Patrick Curtin was the owner of Rouillard\u2019s Caf\u00e9 at the corner of Copeland and Common streets, Quincy, in which there was a bar with alcoholic beverages in bottles. On two occasions in July, 1945, two such bottles were taken during the nighttime, and on one of those occasions a police box key of the Quincy police department was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>found on the floor behind the bar. On August 4, 1945, about 2:30 a.m., one Ralph Moreau, a police officer, on whose tour of duty the caf\u00e9 was situated, entered by the front door, which had been locked, and while making his way about with a flashlight found himself in the presence of Curtin, and of a captain and of <em>k </em>lieutenant of the Quincy police department, and was taken into custody. In the meantime, the defendant, another Quincy polices officer, who was supposed to be patrolling his beat at least two fifths of a mile away, was found seated with a young woman in his own automobile on the premises of a filling station on Center Street at a point over one hundred eighty feet from the caf\u00e9. The automobile could not be seen from the caf\u00e9, nor the caf\u00e9 from the automobile. Over an hour before, about 1:20 a.m., the defendant, who was driving his automobile, had met Moreau at Brewer\u2019s Corner on Moreau\u2019s beat, and about 1:40 a.m. they saw the woman walking away from an altercation between two men, and took her into the automobile to drive her to Quincy Square. The defendant drove to two police boxes which Moreau rang. When passing a caf\u00e9 known as Lucien\u2019s, Moreau said, \u201cI\u2019m going to see a man about a jug,\u201d to which the defendant replied, \u201cWhen are you going to see him, tonight?\u201d and Moreau responded, \u201cYes. After I ring in my next box.\u201d After driving to the Willard School, where Moreau rang a box, the defendant said, \u201cWhere do you want to go now, Ralph?\u201d and Moreau said, \u201cTo try doors at the gasoline station.\u201d They drove two or three blocks to the gasoline station, where' the defendant parked \u25a0 his automobile off the street between the pumps and the building. Moreau asked the woman, \u201cHow would you lik\u00e9 a drink?\u201d to which she responded, \u201cYes, I\u2019d love it.\u201d Moreau left, and the woman asked the defendant, \u201cWhere has he gone?\u201d and the defendant replied, \u201cHe\u2019ll be right back.\u201d After a short time the police lieutenant, who had been in the caf\u00e9 when Moreau entered, appeared and told the defendant to get out of the automobile. The lieutenant said, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to see you here, Bill,\u201d and the defendant replied, \u201cWhy? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>At police headquarters the captain said, \u201cBill, I am greatly surprised to see you in this mess.\u201d The defendant asked, \u201cWhat mess, Captain?\u201d The captain answered, \u201cTo be involved with Moreau in this break,\u201d and the defendant replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you are talking about, Captain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b687-3\">The Commonwealth contends that the defendant was a principal in the second degree present, aiding and abetting in the breaking and entering of Rouillard\u2019s Caf\u00e9 with intent to commit larceny. The principle of law is well established. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>9 Pick. 496, 517-519. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>11 Cush. 422, 428. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lucas, 2 </em>Allen, 170. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clune, </em>162 Mass. 206, 214. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>195 Mass. 100, 110-111. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baldi, </em>250 Mass. 528, 534. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lavery, </em>255 Mass. 327, 333. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mannos, </em>311 Mass. 94, 109-110. But the evidence fails to bring the defendant within it. Undoubtedly the evidence shows that Moreau, to the knowledge of the defendant, had gone to get intoxicating liquor, and it is fairly inferable that all three persons were to drink it. It was also an hour when intoxicating liquor could not be lawfully purchased. See G. L. c. 138, \u00a7 12, as appearing in St. 1935, c. 468, \u00a7 1; \u00a7 15, paragraph 2, as appearing in St. 1938, c. 353. There is nothing, however, to show that the defendant was present, aiding and abetting in breaking and entering the caf\u00e9 with felonious intent. All this cannot be supplied by the defendant\u2019s statement to the woman that Moreau would be right back or from the conversations with the police captain and with the police lieutenant. The denial of the motion for a directed verdict of not guilty was error. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Altenhaus, </em>317 Mass. 270, 273-274, and cases cited. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Portnoy, </em>318 Mass. 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
