SMITH, Circuit Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This appeal involves a dispute between two insurance companies that arose after the settlement of certain claims brought against their insureds. After Westport Insurance Corporation (Westport) defended and settled claims for $ 15.8 million brought by three former students against Moraga School District (the District) and three of its school administrators, it sought repayment from the administrators' insurer, California Casualty Management Company (California Casualty). The two insurers cross-moved for summary judgment, and the district court held that California Casualty owed Westport $ 2.6 million plus $ 755,637.20 in prejudgment interest. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Westport, through a predecessor company, issued primary general liability insurance policies (Westport's Primary policy) to the District from 1991 through 1997. From October 1, 1994 to October 1, 1997, Westport also issued a series of annual excess policies that covered the District and its employees (Westport's Excess policy).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   California Casualty issued successive annual liability policies to the Association of California School Administrators from at least July 1, 1986 to July 1, 2000. California Casualty provided excess liability to the District's school administrators under\n   this policy's Coverage A plan, titled Administrators Excess Liability (California Casualty's policy).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   To provide a framework for our analysis, we first outline the claims included in the underlying lawsuits. On January 29, 2013, Doe 1 and Doe 2, two former students of the Moraga School District, filed suit in the Superior Court for Contra Costa County, California against the District and three of its school Administrators-William Walters, John Cooley, and Paul Simonin. Earlier that same month, another former student, Doe 3, also sued the three Administrators and the District. In these lawsuits, the several Does alleged that the District's employee, Daniel Witters, sexually molested them in the mid-1990s while he was their middle school teacher. The Does alleged that the Administrators received warnings about the molestations, but the Administrators failed to act to stop Witters. When the students came forward in 1996, Witters killed himself. In their lawsuits, Doe 1 alleged that Witters molested her during policy periods 1993-94, 1994-95, and 1995-96; Doe 2 alleged that she was molested in the 1995-96 and 1996-97 periods; and Doe 3 alleged that she was molested in the 1996-97 period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In January 2013, both Westport and California Casualty attended an unsuccessful mediation of the Does' lawsuits. The Doe 3 lawsuit eventually settled separately for $ 1.8 million in August 2013, but Westport appears to have paid the settlement on July 29, 2013, prior to the signing of the settlement agreement. In June 2014, California Casualty and Westport also attended a mediation for the lawsuit brought by Does 1 and 2. At the mediation, Does 1 and 2 settled their lawsuit for $ 7 million each. On June 26, 2014, Westport paid Does 1 and 2. California Casualty subsequently refused to contribute to any of the Does' settlements (the Settlements), and Westport funded the entirety of these Settlements in the aggregate sum of $ 15.8 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 11, 2014, Westport demanded that California Casualty pay its share of the Settlements, but received no response. Westport wrote to California Casualty three additional times, and received no response. After Westport's October 30, 2014 demand, California Casualty finally replied and refused to reimburse Westport.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Westport then filed suit against California Casualty on April 13, 2015 in federal court. After the parties brought cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court entered summary judgment in favor of Westport for $ 2.6 million plus interest. A month later, the district court added $ 755,637.20 of prejudgment interest to the judgment. California Casualty timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Nevertheless, we affirm the district court's conclusion that \u00a7 825.4 does not preclude Westport's claim because \u00a7 825.4 does not contain a blanket ban on an employee's insurer contributing to the employee's defense and settlement costs. Here, the obligation to defend and indemnify still rests with the public entity and its insurer despite contribution from the employee's insurance. We find support for our holding in the principles animating the several \u00a7 825.4 cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Oxnard\n   </em>\n   , the California Court of Appeal held that although the teacher-employee's school district was \"obligated to pay in full\" the settlement of an automobile crash negligence action against the teacher, the school district had discharged its liability by using the teacher's insurance as primary coverage and its own insurance as excess coverage.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=99%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20478\">\n    99 Cal.Rptr. at 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Oxnard\n   </em>\n   's progeny similarly involved automobile accidents committed by employees during the scope of their employment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In the first case, the teacher-employee's automobile insurer, GEICO, defended a negligence suit against the teacher, paid the settlement, and then sought to recoup the amount paid from the school district's insurer.\n   <em>\n    Gov't Emps. Ins. Co. v. Gibraltar Cas.

After considering the relevant portions of the automobile policy and the insurance code, the court concluded that the school district \"was\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   an insured\n   under the GEICO policy,\" due to the language in GEICO's policy that defined persons insured as \"any other person or organization for his or its liability because of the acts or omissions of any insured.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=229%20Cal.%20Rptr.%2057\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=229%20Cal.%20Rptr.%2057\">\n    at 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

The court then held that the county properly looked to the employee's insurer to fulfill its own statutory obligation, thereby rejecting the employee's argument that using the proceeds of his policy for the settlement contravened \u00a7 825.4.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=285%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20319\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=285%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20319\">\n    at 323-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In contrast, the court in\n   <em>\n    Pacific Indemnity\n   </em>\n   barred an insurer's attempt for settlement cost recovery from the employee's insurance.

First, indemnification pursuant to \u00a7 825.4 is not wholly inconsistent with contribution from an employee's insurer. In\n   <em>\n    Oxnard\n   </em>\n   and its progeny, the courts expressly permitted the employees' personal insurance, albeit automotive, to pay the entirety or majority of the settlement, even though the courts first found that the public entities were liable pursuant to the provisions of Section 825. Even in\n   <em>\n    Pacific Indemnity\n   </em>\n   , the court noted that another insurer could contribute to settlement costs if the language of that insurance policy also covered the public entity's obligation.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=105%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20295\">\n    105 Cal.Rptr. at 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Second, the employee and his employer do not occupy equivalent positions for purposes of indemnification analysis. In both\n   <em>\n    Younker\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Gibraltar\n   </em>\n   , the courts differentiated between the employee and his insurer when considering whether Section 825's prohibition on a public entity seeking\n   indemnity from its employee required the entities' insurers to reimburse the employees' insurers. The courts rejected the employees' insurers' position in part because none of the employees had personally contributed to the settlement costs.\n   <em>\n    Younker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=285%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20319\">\n    285 Cal.Rptr. at 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting the employee \"did not foot the bill\");\n   <em>\n    Gibraltar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=229%20Cal.%20Rptr.%2057\">\n    229 Cal.Rptr. at 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting employee \"paid nothing\" of the settlement).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Third, where the employee's policy is available to the public entity as an insured, contribution to the defense and settlement costs may be permitted.\n   <em>\n    Pacific Indemnity\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Younker\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Gibraltar\n   </em>\n   all recognized this principle either explicitly, as in\n   <em>\n    Pacific Indemnity\n   </em>\n   , or implicitly by first finding that the entity-employer was an insured under the employee's policy, as in\n   <em>\n    Younker\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Gibraltar\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Here, policy concerns regarding the proper placement of the burden of settlement costs are assuaged. The District furnished primary and excess insurance to its Administrators through Westport. There is no evidence in the record, and neither party claims, that any of the Administrators personally contributed to the settlement. That their insurer, California Casualty, is now being called upon to provide its excess coverage to cover the employees' settlements does not violate the intent behind \u00a7 825.4 indemnification. In addition, California Casualty's policy is limited to claims arising in the course of employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Furthermore,\n   <em>\n    Pacific Indemnity\n   </em>\n   held that a \"concession\" or \"contract provision which renders the employee's insurance available for the satisfaction of the public entity's obligation\" would satisfy \u00a7 825.4.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=105%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20295\">\n    105 Cal.Rptr. at 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . California Casualty's policy contemplates this exact situation when it states that the underlying primary insurance must be provided under one of several sections of the Education Code,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20825\">\n    Cal.

Interpretation of Westport's and California Casualty's Policies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   California Casualty next claims that it is not obligated to contribute to the Settlements because its policy covers excess payments only when all other policies have been exhausted, and Westport's Primary and Excess policies are sufficient to cover the total amount of the Settlements. Westport counters that this claim is contrary to the plain text of California Casualty's policy.

First, the court divided each Doe's settlement equally across the policy period(s) in which she alleged she was molested. Next, the court reduced each policy period amount by 25 percent to reflect the District's liability. Then, the court deducted $ 1 million from each policy period in accordance with Westport's Primary policy limit. Finally, the court assessed liability against California Casualty up to $ 150,000 for each Administrator in each policy period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In total, the district court found California Casualty liable for $ 2.6 million of the $ 15.8 million paid to the Does collectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   California Casualty contends that it should not contribute to the Settlements for the following reasons: (1) the allocation of liability among the defendants was erroneous; (2) Westport did not pay the mandatory $ 1 million per administrator per student per policy period; (3) California Casualty's policy does not trigger until $ 1 million is paid per administrator per student for each policy period; and (4) even if California Casualty were obligated to contribute, its apportioned contributions for the Administrators should prorate along with Westport's policies.

Allocation of Liability Among the Administrators and the District\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   California Casualty first argues that the district court was unable to properly apportion any liability to it. Although California Casualty's duty to defend did not rise until exhaustion of the primary layer of coverage, it denied excess\n   coverage in the face of settlement demands far exceeding the primary layer.

Under California law, trial courts have \"equitable discretion to fashion a method of allocation suited to the particular facts of each case and the interests of justice, subject to appellate review for abuse of that discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Golden Eagle Ins.

In\n   <em>\n    Great American\n   </em>\n   , the court determined that it had the discretion to allocate liability equally between the co-defendants in a case where the settlement agreement did not specifically allocate responsibility for the amounts to the defendants and both causes of action were alleged against both defendants.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20844819\">\n    2016 WL 844819\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12.

Doe 3's complaint brought all claims against all defendants. The three settlement agreements released the District and the Administrators from liability and did not differentiate among the defendants. Given the blended pleadings and wording of the settlement agreements, the district court did not abuse its discretion in allocating the liability equally among the District and the three Administrators.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Westport's Contribution\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   California Casualty challenges the district court's finding that Westport only needed to pay $ 1 million per occurrence instead of $ 1 million per occurrence per insured, totaling $ 3 million. We find California Casualty's arguments to be without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Although California Casualty's policy and Westport's Primary policy define \"occurrence\" similarly, they differ on how they cover liability per occurrence. Westport's Primary policy defines an occurrence as \"an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which ... results in injury, or damages to which this insurance applies.\" California Casualty's\n   policy defines an occurrence as \"an event, including injurious exposure to conditions, which results in injuries and/or damage to one or more persons or legal entities .... An occurrence can involve a single sudden event or the continuous or repeated injurious exposure to conditions.\" The district court held that, because under California Casualty's policy each Administrator is an insured, California Casualty was required to pay $ 150,000 per Administrator per occurrence per student for each policy period. Conversely, Westport's Primary policy contains a clause that states the policy applies to each separate insured, but \"nothing herein shall operate to increase the Company's liability ... beyond the amount or amounts for which the Company would have been liable if only one person or interest had been named as insured.\" Thus, the district court held that under Westport's Primary policy, Westport was required to cover $ 1 million per occurrence per student for each policy period, but\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   per administrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   California Casualty does not now challenge the district court's decision that, under its policy, each \"occurrence\" requires coverage per student per administrator for each policy period. Instead, California Casualty now contends that if each occurrence is so defined, then Westport should have been required to pay $ 3 million per policy period because there were three Administrators, in the same manner the district court ordered California Casualty to pay up to $ 450,000 per policy period. This argument is unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As noted, Westport's Primary policy contains a provision explaining that although its policy insures each individual employee separately, if multiple insureds are named, the policy operates to limit liability as \"if only one person ... had been named as insured.\" This provision clearly limits Westport's liability in the present situation wherein multiple insureds-three Administrators and the District-all allegedly failed to supervise the teacher. California Casualty's policy contains no such limitation clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    C. California Casualty's Contribution\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   California Casualty next contends that its own obligation does not arise until $ 1 million is paid per insured regardless of the source-the Westport Primary policy, any other policy, or through self-insurance. California Casualty's policy defines \"the insured\" as \"a member of the Association of California School Administrators who is employed by a school board, board of trustees or similar governing body of an educational unit.\" According to California Casualty, Westport only paid $ 333,333.333 per each insured; therefore, California Casualty's policy does not trigger under its terms until some entity pays $ 1 million per insured. Keeping in mind that under California law insurance coverage is to be construed broadly, we find Westport's payment of $ 1 million per period did trigger California Casualty's policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   First, California Casualty's policy text does not support its interpretation of when its policy is triggered. California Casualty's policy states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   At the time of an occurrence there must be underlying primary collectible insurance or self-insurance available to the insured ... with a minimum per occurrence limit of $ 1,000,000.00. There shall be no insurance afforded under this policy until the required $ 1 million limit of liability afforded the insured\n   <em>\n    by such other insurance\n   </em>\n   or self-insurance is exhausted. (Emphasis added).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The phrase \"such other insurance\" is an antecedent phrase referring back to the previous sentence, which defines the requisite primary insurance as insurance \"with\n   a minimum per occurrence limit of $ 1,000,000.\" Although California Casualty's policy denotes a per occurrence limit, it does not require that the $ 1 million limit in the primary policy must also apply per insured, as California Casualty now suggests it should.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co. v. Partridge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2299823\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-3d/10/94/\">\n    10 Cal.3d 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=109%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20811\">\n    109 Cal.Rptr. 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=514%20P.2d%20123\">\n    514 P.2d 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1973) (holding \"all ambiguities in an insurance policy are construed against the insurer-draftsman\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Furthermore, the Administrators complied with the written requirements of California Casualty's policy in obtaining their primary policy. The California Casualty policy requires primary collectible insurance with a \"minimum per occurrence limit of $ 1 million\" be available to the insured pursuant to the Education Code or other provisions governing insurance for public entities. Westport's Primary policy was issued pursuant to the Education Code provisions explicitly mentioned in California Casualty's policy and provided a per occurrence limit of $ 1 million. Therefore, each Administrator had the requisite $ 1 million of primary insurance available to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Second, California Casualty's policy only requires that this underlying insurance of $ 1 million \"afforded the insured by such other insurance or self-insurance is exhausted.\" This language does not clearly require that $ 1 million be exhausted per insured or even for the same occurrence, just that it be exhausted. Westport's Primary policy covering $ 1 million was exhausted according to its terms. To interpret California Casualty's policy to require its insureds to obtain additional insurance in the event their primary insurance exhausts prior to reaching the $ 1 million contribution would create yet another potential layer of insurance coverage that is not required by the policy itself. On its face, California Casualty's policy requires only the exhaustion of the underlying $ 1 million primary insurance before California Casualty's coverage begins. That occurred here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Imagine a hypothetical scenario wherein a prior settlement or series of settlements exhausts Westport's primary insurance up to its annual aggregate limit of $ 3 million rendering Westport's primary policy unable to contribute to the $ 1 million of underlying insurance required by California Casualty's policy. If California Casualty's interpretation of its policy were correct, California Casualty would then provide zero coverage-because the $ 1 million per insured was not reached-contrary to its policy language that it pays all damages in excess of the required underlying insurance. This hypothetical illustrates the untenable position California Casualty advances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Given that insurance exclusions must be \"interpreted narrowly against the insurer,\"\n   <em>\n    TRB Invs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20597\">\n    50 Cal.Rptr.3d 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=145%20P.3d%20472\">\n    145 P.3d at 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we construe the ambiguity of California Casualty's policy against it and in favor of its insureds. In sum, we hold that California Casualty's policy coverage began upon exhaustion of Westport's Primary policy when Westport paid $ 1 million per policy period per student.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Proration of the Policies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   California Casualty also contends that its coverage should prorate with Westport's coverage. A pro rata clause \"provides that if there is other valid and collectible insurance, then the insurer shall not be liable for more than his pro rata share of the loss.\"\n   <em>\n    Olympic Ins. Co. v. Emp'rs Surplus Lines Ins.

California courts tend to prorate the loss among co-insurers with conflicting excess clauses.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . This situation often occurs when both insurers\n   <em>\n    on the same level\n   </em>\n   have\n   excess clauses that deem the policy excess to other valid and collectible insurance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=178%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20908\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=178%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20908\">\n    at 912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (prorating two primary insurers' policies where both purported to be excess to the other).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The text of the insurance policies in this case belies California Casualty's claim that they prorate. California Casualty's policy plainly states that it \"shall not be construed to be pro rata, concurrent or contributing with any other insurance or self-insurance which is available to the Insured.\" Further, California Casualty's policy does not occupy the same level of insurance coverage as either of Westport's policies. As discussed, the exhaustion of Westport's Primary policy triggers liability under California Casualty's policy. Only when California Casualty's policy is exhausted does Westport's Excess policy become liable. Westport's Excess policy clearly states, \"If there is any other collectible insurance available to the insured that covers a loss that is also covered by this policy, the insurance provided by this policy will apply in excess of other collectible insurance.\" Accordingly, California Casualty's policy is sandwiched between Westport's Primary and Excess policies. There is no conflict between California Casualty's policy and either of Westport's policies such that they should prorate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Prejudgment Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   California Casualty asserts that the district court should have awarded prejudgment interest at seven percent, running from July 11, 2014-the date of Westport's first demand letter for payment. The district court awarded prejudgment interest at ten percent, running from the dates Westport paid each of the Settlements. We find no abuse of discretion in the district court's determination to award prejudgment interest at ten percent from the dates Westport paid the Settlements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   State law governs prejudgment interest in a diversity action.\n   <em>\n    U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar.

The California Constitution generally affixes the rate of prejudgment interest at seven percent per annum for judgments rendered in state courts unless specified otherwise by the legislature. Cal.

However, the California Civil Code sets prejudgment interest on contract actions at ten percent per annum if the rate is not otherwise stipulated in the contract.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203289\">\n    Cal. Civ. Code \u00a7 3289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . California Casualty argues that because Westport labeled its cause of action \"equitable contribution,\" which is not a contract action, Westport should only receive prejudgment interest at the rate of seven percent. Westport counters that the district court correctly determined that despite the characterization, its action was one for equitable subrogation, which sounds in contract, and that the district court properly awarded prejudgment interest at ten percent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The California Court of Appeal explained the difference between equitable contribution and equitable subrogation in\n   <em>\n    Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. v.

Where the challenge concerns the interpretation of the relevant policy language, the parties present a pure legal question.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 736.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   California Casualty asserts that California's mediation privilege prevents disclosure of Westport's letters it received on May 30, 2014, June 10, 2014, and October 9, 2014, and of the settlement agreements themselves, and, therefore, that damages did not become certain until July 11, 2014, as opposed to July 29, 2013 and June 26, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   California's mediation privilege prohibits any writing \"prepared for the purpose of, in the course of, or pursuant to, a mediation or mediation consultation\" to be admissible in any civil action in which \"testimony can be compelled to be given.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201119\">\n    Cal.

In addition, \"all communications ... by and between participants in the course of a mediation\" shall remain confidential.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201119\">\n    Cal.

While the district court erred in overruling California Casualty's objection to the disclosure of these letters,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   though not to the settlement agreements,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   this\n   error does not affect resolution of this issue, because the damages were certain on the Settlements' payment dates regardless of the admissibility of the demand letters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Continental Insurance\n   </em>\n   , the court rejected the insurer's argument that damages were uncertain because the companies disputed the number of covered occurrences.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513850\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/223/716/\">\n    223 Cal. Rptr.3d at 737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court determined that this dispute posed a question of liability that did not affect the certainty of damages.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12513850\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/223/716/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The appellate court then upheld the trial court's award of mandatory prejudgment interest from the date of judgment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 720.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The present case also concerns the interpretation and prioritization of the insurance policies at issue-all legal questions. Accordingly, California Casualty is liable for prejudgment interest from the \"date of settlement because that is the date that the loss is certain or capable of being made certain by calculation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 735. We hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding prejudgment interest from the dates on which Westport paid the Settlements-July 29, 2013, and June 26, 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Highlands Ins.

On these dates, Westport's primary layer of coverage was exhausted, and Westport overpaid on its Excess policy due to California Casualty's failure to provide its coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   We hold that California Government Code Section 825.4 does not preclude Westport's lawsuit against California Casualty, and we affirm the district court's decision on all the remaining issues raised on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    The exceptions set forth in \u00a7 825.6 contemplate whether the employee or former employee \"acted or failed to act because of actual fraud, corruption, or actual malice, or willfully failed or refused to conduct the defense of the claim or action in good faith.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20825.6\">\n     Cal.

Nevertheless,\n    <em>\n     Oxnard\n    </em>\n    's progeny involved automobile accidents committed by employees and public entity indemnification under \u00a7 825.4.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Pacific Indemnity\n    </em>\n    , the court was particularly concerned because the employee's personal policy did not just cover claims arising in the course of employment but any acts or omissions that were not within the scope of the employment. The court noted that this impermissibly placed the burden of insurance on the employee personally.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    California Casualty also notes that its low premium is indicative of its position as extreme excess coverage. This argument deserves only short shrift. California Casualty does not point to any authority that premium size determines priority of coverage. Moreover, California Casualty's corporate designee testified that the amount of the premium does not determine the policy's order of payment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    To illustrate, Doe 1's $ 7 million settlement was divided into three amounts of $ 2,333,333 for each of the policy periods 1993-94, 1994-95, and 1995-96. Next, in each of these periods, the court reduced the amount by 25 percent to $ 1.75 million. Then, the court deducted $ 1 million of Westport's primary limit, leaving $ 750,000. The court then assessed $ 150,000 per administrator for a total of $ 450,000 against California Casualty.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    California Casualty argues that it was not the primary insurer, unlike the insurer in\n    <em>\n     Great American\n    </em>\n    , and therefore the four defendants should not share liability evenly. However, the\n    <em>\n     Great American\n    </em>\n    court's division of liability between co-defendants did not turn on the status of the insurance companies, but rather on the pleadings and settlement agreements.\n    <em>\n     Great American\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20844819\">\n     2016 WL 844819\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *12. In fact, in terms of actual monetary liability, the court ordered the co-primary insurer to pay its $ 1 million limit, not half of the total $ 3 million settlement, despite its insured being apportioned \"equal\" liability.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at *13.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    The district court overruled the objection pertaining to the letters, finding that because they were between California Casualty's corporate representative and attorney and Westport's attorney, they were not between the \"disputants in the mediation.\" The district court defined the disputants solely as the Does, the District, and the Administrators. However, the mediation privilege \"extends beyond discussions carried out directly between the opposing parties to the dispute, or with the mediator, or during the mediation proceedings themselves\" to \"all oral or written communications ... made for the purpose of or pursuant to a mediation.\"\n    <em>\n     Cassel v.
