He was sentenced to a combination of concurrent and consecutive terms totaling 50 years of imprisonment with parole eligibility after 20 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During Rodney's trial, victim Ralph Monko (\"Monko\") testified that Rodney and a co-defendant beat and robbed him in the garage of his home after Rodney observed him win thousands of dollars at a casino. Monko testified that his skull was crushed during the beating and he was stabbed in the head with a large knife, which sliced his skin down to the skull, cracked his orbital bone, and cut every nerve. He further testified that, as a result of the attack, he had permanent scars and suffered from dizziness, frequent seizures, short-term memory problems, a loss of smell and taste due to brain damage, numbness on the left side of his head, and post-traumatic stress disorder. In addition, Monko testified that one of the weapons used in the attack caused an infection in the back of his neck that medical providers worried would enter his brain and kill him. Rodney's trial attorney did not object to Monko's medical testimony, did not use medical records to impeach the testimony, and did not call an expert witness or any treating medical providers to testify regarding Monko's injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After his convictions were affirmed on direct appeal, Rodney filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   state post-conviction petition for writ of habeas corpus (\"PCR Petition\") and requested the appointment of post-conviction counsel. The trial court found that Rodney was not entitled to the appointment of counsel and denied the PCR Petition on the merits. The Nevada Supreme Court affirmed. Rodney then filed a second\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   PCR Petition and again requested the appointment of counsel. The trial court again declined to appoint post-conviction counsel, and it denied the second PCR Petition as procedurally barred. The Nevada Supreme Court again affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Rodney then filed a timely\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   petition for writ of habeas corpus under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada. He later amended the petition with leave of Court. After denying Rodney's request for appointment of habeas counsel, and without allowing discovery, holding an evidentiary hearing, or engaging in a\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   analysis, the district court found, in relevant part, that two of Rodney's IAC claims were procedurally defaulted. The district court then denied Rodney's \u00a7 2254 petition after rejecting on the merits the only claim that it found to be properly exhausted. We granted a certificate of appealability on the issue of whether the district court erred in finding that Rodney's IAC claims were procedurally defaulted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We review the district court's denial of Rodney's habeas petition and its procedural default determinations de novo.\n   <em>\n    Runningeagle v.

We reject this argument. Rodney did not clearly raise a\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   argument in his response to Respondents' motion to dismiss his habeas petition on procedural grounds; however, he did raise the issue of\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   in a surreply. The surreply was filed without prior authorization, but the district court denied Respondents' motion to strike it from the docket. Rodney again raised a\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   argument in his notice of abandonment of unexhausted claims. In analyzing the issue of waiver, we must be mindful that documents filed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   are to be liberally construed.\n   <em>\n    Erickson v.

Furthermore, Respondents raised the\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   issue in their reply in support of their motion to dismiss, and the applicability of\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   was clear under the circumstances of Rodney's case.

Because the district court did not allow discovery or hold an evidentiary hearing, the evidence in the district-court record is limited. The severity of Monko's injuries was potentially relevant to elements of several of the charges of which Rodney was convicted. The district-court record contains excerpts of Monko's medical records; however, in arguing whether there is a reasonable probability that the jury's verdict would have been different if not for counsel's alleged deficiencies, both parties refer extensively to additional medical records that were not before the district court.
