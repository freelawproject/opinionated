The Ordinance requires health warnings on advertisements for certain sugar-sweetened beverages (\"SSBs\"). Plaintiffs argue that the Ordinance violates their First Amendment right to freedom of speech. Relying on the United States Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    National Institute of Family &amp; Life Advocates v.

Under section 4202, though, an \"SSB Ad\" does not include advertising in or on: periodicals; television; electronic media; SSB containers or packaging; menus; shelf tags; vehicles used by those in the business of manufacturing, selling, or distributing SSBs; or logos that occupy an\n   area of less than 36 square inches.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206937\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/626/#p651\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Ordinance defines \"SSB\" as \"any Nonalcoholic Beverage sold for human consumption, including, without limitation, beverages produced from Concentrate, that has one or more added Caloric Sweeteners and contains more than 25 calories per 12 ounces of beverage.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206937\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/626/#p651\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But \"SSB\" does not include drinks such as milk, plant-based milk alternatives, natural fruit and vegetable juices, infant formulas, and supplements.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206937\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/626/#p651\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Ordinance provides detailed instructions regarding the form, content, and placement of the warning on SSB Ads, including a requirement that the warning occupy at least 20% of the advertisement and be set off with a rectangular border.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206937\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/626/#p651\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4203(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant's stated purpose in requiring the warning is, among other reasons, to \"inform the public of the presence of added sugars and thus promote informed consumer choice that may result in reduced caloric intake and improved diet and health, thereby reducing illnesses to which SSBs contribute and associated economic burdens.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206937\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/626/#p651\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4201.

The district court denied Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. Concluding that Plaintiffs likely would not succeed on the merits of their First Amendment challenge, the district court held that the warning is not misleading, does not place an undue burden on Plaintiffs' commercial speech, and is rationally related to a substantial governmental interest. But the court stayed implementation of the Ordinance pending this timely interlocutory appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A three-judge panel of this court reversed the district court's denial of a preliminary injunction,\n   <em>\n    Am.

Although\n   <em>\n    NIFLA\n   </em>\n   did not define \"uncontroversial,\" the warning here requires the advertisers to convey San Francisco's one-sided policy views about sugar-sweetened beverages. The record shows this is a controversial topic, and therefore, the ordinance does not qualify as \"uncontroversial information\" under the third prong of\n   <em>\n    NIFLA\n   </em>\n   . Finally, the warning does not relate to the terms on which the advertisers provide their services. The warning merely relates to the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, which is a product rather than a service, and does not address the terms on which that product is provided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Even if the warning requirement provided factual and uncontroversial information about the terms of service, the requirement would fail because it is unduly burdensome. As the majority acknowledges, the warning's size, required font size, contrasting color, and other requirements contribute to the severity of the warning's burden. Maj. Op. at 756-57.\n   <em>\n    NIFLA\n   </em>\n   makes clear that requiring commercial speakers, like the unlicensed clinics in\n   <em>\n    NIFLA\n   </em>\n   , to fight a government-scripted message that drowns out their own advertisements is unduly burdensome. Moreover, the record indicates that the warning label would have a chilling effect, causing some manufacturers of sugar-sweetened beverages to cease advertising on covered media. Therefore, the\n   <em>\n    Zauderer\n   </em>\n   exception does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Nor does any other exception apply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The majority is wrong to the extent it suggests that \"\n   <em>\n    NIFLA\n   </em>\n   preserved the exception to heightened scrutiny for health and safety warnings.\" Maj.

In a case involving restrictions on cigarette advertisements, the Court held that the \"First Amendment also constrains state efforts to limit the advertising of tobacco products, because so long as the sale and use of tobacco is lawful for adults, the tobacco industry has a protected interest in communicating information about its products and adult customers have an interest in receiving that information.\"\n   <em>\n    Lorillard Tobacco Co. v.

Under intermediate scrutiny, even assuming that there is a substantial state interest in warning the public of health dangers from drinking sugar-sweetened beverages, the warning requirement is not sufficiently drawn to that interest. First, the requirement is underinclusive both as to the covered products and as to the means of advertisement. The ordinance does not even apply to all sugar-sweetened beverages, much less all sugar-sweetened products. Moreover, it applies to posters and billboards, but not digital ads or other types of media. Like the notices in\n   <em>\n    NIFLA\n   </em>\n   , the warning requirement is \"wildly underinclusive.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   138 S.Ct. at 2367.

Despite focusing primarily on the undue burden prong, the majority fails to provide any guidance regarding when a warning is unjustified or unduly burdensome. Instead of following\n   <em>\n    NIFLA\n   </em>\n   in considering the totality of the requirements of the unlicensed notice and their effect on the speaker (there, the clinics) to conclude that the unlicensed notice was unduly burdensome,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   138 S.Ct. at 2378, the majority seems to suggest that the test is whether a smaller warning would accomplish San Francisco's stated goals. Maj.

The majority concedes that it does not \"preclude [San Francisco] from arguing that the Ordinance survives heightened scrutiny.\" Maj. Op. at 756 n.5. And here, San Francisco has done just that, arguing vigorously that its ordinance survives intermediate scrutiny. The majority fails to address this argument, apparently on the ground that \"logically\" any such argument would be futile because \"if the warning does not meet a lower standard, it necessarily does not meet a higher standard.\" Maj. Op. at 756 n.5. This reasoning is flawed.

Additionally, the compelled speech must relate to the speaker's services or products. Where I differ is with the majority's application of the test. The majority skips whether San Francisco's compelled warning is factually accurate and jumps straight to asking whether the proposed warning is \"unjustified or unduly burdensome.\" The court reasons that\n   <em>\n    NIFLA\n   </em>\n   made clear that \"a government-compelled disclosure that imposes an undue burden fails for that reason alone,\" but the same is true of\n   <em>\n    Zauderer\n   </em>\n   's other requirements. The majority's decision to follow\n   <em>\n    NIFLA\n   </em>\n   and address the \"unduly burdensome\" question first overlooks that there was no dispute in\n   <em>\n    NIFLA\n   </em>\n   about the factual accuracy of the compelled speech. We have no precedent addressing a government proposal to appropriate commercial advertising space for the purpose of conveying a factually inaccurate message, but where, as here, the parties disagree about the veracity of compelled speech, the court should begin by asking whether the government's message is objectively true. Deciding whether a compelled message is controversial or unduly burdensome will often entail much more subjective judgments. If compelled speech is not factually accurate, the court's inquiry should end.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   San Francisco seeks to require that advertisements for sugar-sweetened beverages include the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   WARNING: Drinking beverages with added sugar(s) contributes to obesity, diabetes, and tooth decay.

To the contrary, \"diabetes\" is an umbrella term referring to both type 1 diabetes (sometimes called juvenile-onset or insulin-dependent diabetes ) and type 2 diabetes. Rather than using the generic term \"diabetes,\" medical studies investigating causation are careful to differentiate between the two forms of the disease.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The precise causes of type 1 diabetes are unknown, but genetic and environmental factors, including viruses, are thought to contribute to its development.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Research demonstrates a correlation between the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and the development of type 2 diabetes,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   but San Francisco has not shown that there is any association at all between consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and the development\n   of type 1 diabetes. Ironically, the American Diabetes Association directly addresses this on its \"Diabetes Myths\" webpage, stating that type 1 diabetes is not caused by sugar, it \"is caused by genetics and unknown factors that trigger the onset of the disease.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The message that drinking sugar-sweetened beverages \"contributes to\" diabetes (including type 1 diabetes ) is not only not \"purely factual and uncontroversial,\" it is devoid of scientific support.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zauderer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206937\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/626/#p651\">\n    471 U.S. at 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206937\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/626/#p651\">\n    105 S.Ct. 2265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In this particular case, it cannot be doubted that the government's proposed message is controversial: it would require that manufacturers, retailers, and advertisers include in their ads, under a banner that begins \"Warning,\" the message that their product contributes to diabetes even though the causes of type 1 diabetes are not actually known.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, in addition to being factually inaccurate, San Francisco's proposed warning also fails\n   <em>\n    Zauderer\n   </em>\n   's requirement that the compelled speech be uncontroversial. Though I would strike the warning under either the first or second part of\n   <em>\n    Zauderer\n   </em>\n   's test, my view is that, given the facts of this case, we should treat\n   <em>\n    Zauderer\n   </em>\n   's \"purely factual\" inquiry as the threshold question because it provides a much more objective basis for disqualifying San Francisco's compelled speech. It is possible to envision a scenario in which the \"unjustified or unduly burdensome\" inquiry could provide a more objective basis for striking a government-mandated message. For example, that could occur if determining the accuracy of a proposed message was not as cut-and-dried as it is here, or if the government tried to commandeer the majority of available ad space. This is not one of those cases. Because San Francisco's compelled warning undeniably fails\n   <em>\n    Zauderer\n   </em>\n   's \"purely factual\" hurdle, we should not reach whether the message is uncontroversial or unduly burdensome; both of those inquiries require the court to make more subjective judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   San Francisco argues that its warning must not be read too literally, and that consumers will understand that its warning refers to type 2 diabetes. But the contention that a reasonable person would understand San Francisco's intended message is in tension with the goal of having a public health message understood by the maximum number of consumers, not just those with sophisticated levels of health literacy. Because the message would be conveyed to sophisticated and unsophisticated consumers, we must read it literally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Relatedly, San Francisco acknowledges that not every consumer of sugary drinks will become obese or suffer from tooth decay or diabetes. It argues that readers will understand that its warning is intended to convey a community-wide message: that consuming sugar-sweetened beverages will lead to more instances of obesity, diabetes, and tooth decay within the City and County as a whole. But even if the qualifier \"may\" is read into the message, and the warning is understood as \"sugary drinks may contribute to obesity, diabetes and tooth decay on a community-wide basis,\" it remains untrue with regard to type 1 diabetes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Finally, San Francisco's compelled message is problematic because it suggests that sugar is always dangerous for diabetics. In fact, consuming sugar-sweetened beverages can be medically indicated for a\n   type 1 diabetic when there are signs of hypoglycemia, a complication of type 1 diabetes, because drinking fruit juice or soda raises blood sugar levels quickly.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Insisting that compelled speech be purely factual may seem persnickety, but there are significant constitutional implications whenever the government seeks to control our speech.
