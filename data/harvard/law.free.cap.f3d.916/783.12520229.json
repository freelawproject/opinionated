Katherine Miller, a Washington childcare provider, challenges that arrangement as an infringement of her First Amendment rights of free speech and association. We have jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and we affirm the district court's order granting summary judgment to SEIU and Washington State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Washington provides financial assistance to qualifying families for childcare costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Under the terms of this program, families choose independent childcare providers and pay them on a scale commensurate with the families' income levels. The State covers the remaining cost.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before 2006, Washington unilaterally determined subsidy levels and other policies governing its childcare assistance programs, through legislation and regulations. But in 2006, Washington re-categorized the providers as \"public employees\" for purposes of the State's collective bargaining legislation and authorized the providers to elect an exclusive collective bargaining representative to negotiate with the State on their behalf.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wash.%20Rev.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2041.56.028\">\n    Wash. Rev. Code \u00a7 41.56.028\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the childcare providers are state employees only for purposes of collective bargaining, they are considered \"partial\" state employees, rather than full-fledged state employees, and Washington law limits the scope of their collective bargaining agent's representation. For example, families continue to be the providers' primary employers,\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 41.56.028(4)(a) ; the providers are not allowed to strike,\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 41.56.028(2)(e) ; and the bargaining agent cannot negotiate about certain issues,\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 41.56.028(2)(c) (\"[r]etirement benefits shall not be subject to collective bargaining\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The childcare providers elected SEIU as their exclusive bargaining representative, and SEIU negotiated a number of terms and conditions for them as part of a state-wide collective bargaining agreement. Childcare providers are not required to join SEIU, but SEIU is nonetheless \"required to represent[ ] all the public employees within the unit without regard to membership.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00a7 41.56.080. SEIU members pay union dues to support SEIU.

Miller is a former SEIU member; the record is unclear about whether Mentele was a member. Both plaintiffs alleged that their First Amendment right to expressive association was violated when Washington recognized SEIU as the exclusive bargaining representative for all childcare providers because SEIU necessarily spoke and negotiated on their behalf. Miller and Mentele sought declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But the Court noted that strict scrutiny may be more appropriate due to the First Amendment rights at stake.\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . The Court did not need to resolve that question in\n    <em>\n     Janus\n    </em>\n    because the statute at issue failed even exacting scrutiny,\n    <em>\n     id\n    </em>\n    ., but we note that the Court previously applied exacting scrutiny to challenges of free association rights.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Roberts v.

If we concluded that Miller's First Amendment rights were infringed by SEIU's representation, we would be obliged to apply \"exacting scrutiny\" to decide whether the infringement is constitutionally permissible, because this was the test the Court applied in\n    <em>\n     Roberts\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Knox\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Harris\n    </em>\n    , and\n    <em>\n     Janus\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Agostini\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915883\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/203/#p237\">\n     521 U.S. at 237\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915883\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/203/#p237\">\n     117 S.Ct. 1997\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurrence\">\n  <author id=\"p-51\">\n   GRABER, Circuit Judge, concurring:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   I concur in full in the opinion. I write separately only to state my view that the conclusion we reach in Part II-B is less tenuous than the opinion makes it sound.

I would follow the Eighth Circuit's analysis and hold that, with respect to Plaintiffs' associational rights, there is no \"meaningful distinction\" between this case and the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Minnesota State Board for Community Colleges v.
