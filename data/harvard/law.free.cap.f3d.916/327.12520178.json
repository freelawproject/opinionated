However, because a genuine issue of material fact remains as to whether Hannah provided notice of her disability and interest in FMLA leave sufficient to trigger Appellee's duty to inquire, we hold that summary judgment as to Hannah's FMLA interference claim was not warranted.

Hannah immediately informed at least two of her supervisors of her diagnosis, but she did not request any accommodations at that time. Hannah treated her depression by seeing a counselor and a psychiatrist and by taking prescribed medication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In November 2013, Hannah was assigned to coordinate the responses of the National Intelligence Director and Principal Deputy Director to Edward Snowden's unauthorized disclosures.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   This role was \"high stress\" and required \"frequent long hours and weekend work coupled with meeting tight deadlines and dealing with a demanding [National Security Council] customer.\" J.A. 412. In fact, to accommodate the schedule change that this role required, Appellee moved Hannah to a \"maxi flex\" schedule.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n    at 350-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A \"maxi flex\" schedule requires an analyst to work a certain number of hours -- 80 hours over a two-week period -- but does not dictate the exact hours that the analyst must work per day. For Hannah, that meant starting and ending work later than traditional business hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Snowden assignment lasted 18 months and completed in January 2015. However, Hannah continued her atypical working hours beyond the completion of the Snowden assignment. Hannah's supervisor \"was expecting\" that when the Snowden assignment ended, Hannah's hours \"might become more normal.\" J.A. 353. However, for the first few months, he did not communicate with Hannah about returning to normal business hours. Rather, he explained, he was \"primarily concerned about establishing what [Hannah's] next task was going to be.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   By March 2015, Hannah's co-workers perceived her schedule to be \"erratic.\" J.A. 413. Hannah arrived to work well after normal business hours and racked up numerous unplanned absences. On some occasions Hannah was \"extremely late,\" sometimes arriving after 2 PM.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On other occasions Hannah was unreachable for hours, often missing and failing to return \"repeated phone calls to her cell and home phone.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   When Hannah's supervisors were able to reach her, they noted that she seemed \"either lethargic or almost unconcerned\" about her lateness and absences.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   They also noted that her demeanor was \"sad, very flat, and almost trance like.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Around that time, Hannah informed her supervisors that she \"had a recent change in medication.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Appellee made some accommodations for Hannah following the Snowden assignment. First, after consulting with Hannah in January 2015, Appellee lightened Hannah's workload \"to give her a chance to decompress\" from the stress of the Snowden assignment. J.A. 413 (internal quotation marks omitted). Second, multiple of Hannah's supervisors had \"informal counseling sessions\" with her \"to discuss any issues that she might be having\" and to \"urge her\" to notify them if she was going to be late or absent.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On March 19, 2015, one of Hannah's supervisors met with Hannah directly to address her attendance issues. Together, Hannah and her supervisors developed a plan to reconcile Hannah's depression with Appellee's staffing needs. According to that plan, Hannah was to arrive to work by 10 AM. If she was going to be absent or later than 10 AM, Hannah was to contact one of her supervisors in advance. If Hannah had not arrived at work or contacted a supervisor by 11 AM, a supervisor would call her to determine when she would arrive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   But, Hannah did not follow the plan. For example, the very next day after she and her supervisors developed the plan, Hannah emailed her supervisors at 11:05 AM to inform them that she would be arriving after 12 PM. Similarly, on March 31, Hannah emailed her supervisors at 11:56 AM to inform them that she would not be coming into work at all that day. On April 1, after Hannah had not arrived to work or contacted her supervisors, Hannah's second-level supervisor called her at 12:30 PM, at which time Hannah reported \"being unable to just get going.\" J.A. 413. Later that day, when Hannah finally arrived to work, her supervisor informed her that the plan they created was not working.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At that same time, her supervisor revised the plan to require Hannah to arrive at work by 10 AM or report to her supervisors in advance if she was going to be late or absent. This \"put the onus\" on Hannah to contact her supervisors, rather than asking her supervisors to contact her if she had not arrived at work by 11 AM. J.A. 90. Hannah failed to follow this modified plan as well. In fact, she failed to comply on April 2 and April 3, the two days following the meeting where the plan was modified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   According to Appellee, Hannah's timeliness and attendance issues impacted her performance, the performance of her peers, and the performance of her supervisors. Per Appellee, Hannah's \"erratic\" schedule was \"noted by her teammates\" and affected \"unit cohesion.\" J.A. 413. Hannah's failure to report her tardiness and absences as well as her unresponsiveness required her management team to spend \"significant time and energy\" tracking\n   her down.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Additionally, because of Hannah's absences, Hannah's supervisors were often forced to assign work that might have been assigned to Hannah to other analysts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On April 9, 2015, just three weeks after the initial work plan was developed to attempt to accommodate Hannah's needs, Hannah again met with her supervisors. At this meeting, Hannah's supervisors informed her that they were referring her to the Employee Assistance Program (\"EAP\"). EAP is a voluntary counseling service for employees and their family members that provides \"free, confidential, short-term mental health[,] financial, and addictions counseling and referral to cleared community providers.\" J.A. 132. Hannah's supervisors made an EAP appointment for her for the following day, Friday, April 10. At that time, Hannah explained to her supervisors that her psychiatrist recommended she take four weeks of medical leave. But, Hannah's supervisors insisted that she would need to meet with EAP before they could approve her request for medical leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On the next business day following Hannah's EAP session -- Monday, April 13 -- Hannah's supervisor told Hannah he was willing to authorize her to take medical leave. However, at that point, Hannah informed her supervisor that her leave request was \"on hold,\" without further explanation. J.A. 170, 178.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On April 16, Hannah's supervisor noted in an email that he had an \"extended\" 40-minute discussion with Hannah's EAP psychologist. J.A. 604. Hannah alleges that the EAP psychologist \"shared with [Hannah's supervisor] details of what Hannah had revealed in confidence at the EAP sessions.\" Appellant's Br. 17. Specifically, Hannah alleges that the EAP psychologist told her supervisor that Hannah was concerned about Appellee's records retention policies, and that Hannah's \"difficulties in getting to work were the result of a lack of motivation, not related to depression.\" J.A. 540.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Despite Hannah's participation in EAP, her attendance problems persisted. For example, on April 13, 2015, Hannah emailed her supervisors at 10:58 AM to inform them that she would arrive to work by 11:30 AM. Similarly, on April 14, Hannah emailed her supervisors at 11:08 AM to inform them that she would arrive to work by 12 PM. That day, Hannah's supervisors were not able to confirm her arrival to work until after 1:50 PM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A week after advising her supervisors that her leave request was \"on hold,\" on April 21, Hannah renewed her request for four weeks of medical leave. Hannah's supervisors approved that request on May 5. They required her to use her annual leave to account for four-fifths of the four week leave period, and allowed her one day of sick leave per week to make up the rest. Hannah began her leave the day it was approved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On May 4, the day before Hannah began her leave of absence, Hannah's supervisors gave her a letter of expectations. That letter confirmed the revised attendance and reporting plan. This plan required Hannah to arrive to work by 10 AM or report to her supervisors by 9:30 AM if she was going to be late or absent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   During this time, Hannah applied for three permanent positions within the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. In February 2015, Hannah interviewed for two permanent positions for\n   which she was not selected. Shortly before taking her leave of absence in May 2015, Hannah applied for a third full-time position, the Program Mission Manager Cyber Position (\"Cyber position\"). She was interviewed for the Cyber position on June 9, eight days after she returned from leave, and the interview panel recommended her for the position. Her application was then forwarded to Appellee's Chief Management Officer, Mark Ewing, who recommended that Hannah not be selected for the position \"at this time,\" stating that Hannah's \"recent performance is not consistent with a potentially good employee.\" J.A. 232. Hannah was informed that her application had been rejected in early July 2015, and she did not apply for any other positions. Hannah completed her five-year term with Appellee in March 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Hannah exhausted her administrative remedies and filed this lawsuit on August 12, 2016. She alleged that Appellee violated the Rehabilitation Act in five ways: (1) failing to accommodate her mental illness; (2) creating a hostile work environment; (3) requiring her to undergo a medical examination; (4) disclosing her confidential medical information; and (5) refusing to hire her for the Cyber position. Additionally, Hannah alleged that Appellee violated the FMLA in two ways: (1) by interfering with her ability to take medical leave; and (2) by retaliating against her when she took medical leave. After the close of discovery, Appellee moved for summary judgment on all counts. The district court granted that motion on July 27, 2017. Hannah filed this timely notice of appeal challenging the district court's decisions on all but the hostile work environment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We review a district court's decision to grant summary judgment de novo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vannoy v.

Additionally, Hannah asserts that Appellee interfered with and retaliated against her for using leave under the FMLA. We will address each of these claims in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    Rehabilitation Act Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Rehabilitation Act prohibits federal agencies from discriminating against its employees on the basis of disability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For the reasons explained below, Hannah failed to satisfy her burden on each of her claims under the Rehabilitation Act. Specifically, Hannah failed to: (1) demonstrate that Appellee failed to accommodate her depression; (2) demonstrate that Appellee's EAP amounted to a required medical examination; (3) demonstrate that Appellee disclosed or misused confidential medical information; and (4) rebut Appellee's legitimate, nondiscriminatory\n   reason for rejecting her application for a permanent position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    Reasonable Accommodation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Turning first to Hannah's claim that Appellee failed to accommodate her depression, the district court correctly concluded that Hannah did not establish a prima facie case because Hannah failed to demonstrate that Appellee refused to make a reasonable accommodation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   To establish a prima facie claim of failure to accommodate under the Rehabilitation Act, a plaintiff must demonstrate that (1) she was a qualified person with a disability; (2) the employer had notice of the disability; (3) the plaintiff could perform the essential functions of the position with a reasonable accommodation; and (4) the employer nonetheless refused to make the accommodation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reyazuddin v. Montgomery Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233458\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/789/407/#p414\">\n    789 F.3d 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 414 (4th Cir. 2015). The district court concluded that Hannah could not establish the fourth element -- specifically, the district court determined that Appellee provided Hannah with at least two reasonable accommodations. And, on appeal, the parties dispute only the fourth element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Here, as detailed above, Appellee provided Hannah with a reasonable accommodation. When Hannah failed to follow that plan, Hannah's supervisors attempted a new accommodation -- referring Hannah to EAP. Yet, despite Hannah's participation in EAP, her attendance problems persisted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Hannah argues that Appellee's accommodations were not reasonable for two reasons. First, she claims that the accommodation was improperly rescinded when her supervisors concluded that the first plan was not working. Hannah asserts that the Rehabilitation Act requires a collaborative process. Hannah argues that rather than collaborating with her to identify a workable accommodation, Appellee unilaterally decided that the first plan was not working, then unilaterally decided that Hannah should participate in EAP counseling instead. Although employers have a duty to engage with their employees in an \"interactive process to identify a reasonable accommodation,\"\n   <em>\n    Wilson v. Dollar Gen. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3576070,4179535\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/717/337/\">\n    717 F.3d 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 346 (4th Cir. 2013), the employer \"has the ultimate discretion to choose between effective accommodations.\"\n   <em>\n    Reyazuddin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233458\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/789/407/#p414\">\n    789 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   415-16 (citing\n   <em>\n    Hankins v.

Nonetheless, even under Hannah's view of the record, Appellee\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   , in fact, collaborate with Hannah in establishing the first accommodation and only acted unilaterally when that accommodation did not work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Second, Hannah claims that a reasonable accommodation that she requested -- a leave of absence -- was improperly delayed. Hannah posits that she \"suffered immense emotional stress during this one month lapse of [Appellee's] compliance with the law.\" Appellant's Br. 37. This argument is without merit and is not supported by the record, even when viewed in the light most favorable to Hannah. Hannah first requested the leave of absence on April 9, 2015. Then, on April 13 -- just two business days later -- Hannah withdrew her request without explanation, telling her supervisor that her leave request was \"on hold.\" J.A. 170, 178. Hannah then renewed her request for leave on April 21, and her request was approved on May 5.

But the evidence does not support or create a genuine issue of fact about that argument. The record indicates that only the March 2015 disclosure was made in response to an inquiry, and that inquiry was not medical -- it was about her attendance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 23 (Hannah's deposition testimony) (\"[H]e was concerned about unpredictability in my schedule.... I told him at that time I had depression.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Hannah asserts that this inquiry about her attendance was de facto an inquiry into her depression because (according to Hannah) the inquiring supervisor knew she was depressed and knew her attendance issues were linked to her depression. Hannah cites only out-of-circuit cases for the proposition that asking a question \"likely to elicit\" information about a disability amounts to a medical inquiry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harrison v.

Hannah points to the supervisor's statement that when he spoke to Hannah on the phone before confronting her about her attendance, \"she didn't sound well on the other end of the phone.\" J.A. 466. Hannah also points to her supervisor's statement that Hannah's \"demeanor [wa]s sad, very flat, and almost trance like.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5700863\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/502/324/#p338\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5700863\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/502/324/#p338\">\n    at 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is not enough to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the inquiring supervisor knew Hannah had been medically diagnosed with clinical depression, or whether by asking about her attendance, the supervisor was fishing for medical information about Hannah's illness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Second, even if Hannah's supervisor had an inkling that Hannah may have had depression, this is not evidence that he knew asking about her repeated absences and tardiness -- indisputably bad work behavior -- would elicit medical information related to her depression. Indeed, Hannah's absences could have been the result of a world of other, nonmedical possibilities, such as transportation issues or oversleeping. Adopting Hannah's argument would require us to find that where an employer might know that a particular bad work behavior is connected to a medical condition, the employer cannot inquire into the behavior without running afoul of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act's prohibition on medical inquiries. We have held expressly the opposite: \"[T]he ADA does not require an employer to simply ignore an employee's blatant and persistent misconduct, even where that behavior is potentially tied to a medical condition.\"\n   <em>\n    Vannoy v.

Specifically, Hannah alleges that the EAP psychologist told her supervisor that Hannah was concerned about Appellee's records retention policies, and that Hannah's \"difficulties in getting to work were the result of a lack of motivation, not related to depression.\" J.A. 540.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Perhaps that is true. The record does indicate that the EAP psychologist shared some information with Hannah's supervisors and maybe it was unique information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 192 (EAP psychologist statement) (noting that the psychologist provided Hannah's supervisors updates regarding Hannah's \"EAP attendance\" and \"cooperation and progress toward resolving the referral issues\"). But there is no evidence that the EAP psychologist shared\n   <em>\n    medical information\n   </em>\n   .

Of note, Hannah did not point to any evidence in the record contradicting the psychologist's assertions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Therefore, the information shared by the EAP psychologist did not trigger the Rehabilitation Act's confidentiality protections\n   because the record indicates that the EAP psychologist shared only nonmedical information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   c.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <em>\n    Non-Reliance on Medical Information\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Finally, even if either Hannah's supervisors or the EAP psychologist disclosed Hannah's medical information, Appellee still did not violate the Rehabilitation Act because Appellee did not rely on Hannah's depression diagnosis or any other medical information in deciding not to hire Hannah for the Cyber position. Rather, the record overwhelmingly indicates that Appellee's decision was based on Hannah's attendance issues.

But in the email, sent on June 30, 2015, Ewing references\n   two memos that he received from Hannah's supervisors, both of which note Hannah's depression.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 413 (April 9, 2015 memo) (\"Early in her tenure ... and reaffirmed recently, [Hannah] informed us that she was meeting with a psychiatrist and counselor and taking medication for depression.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 606 (April 23, 2015 memo) (\"While ... medical considerations (i.e., depression and/or ADD) do make this situation worse, these factors are under her control based upon treatment plans with her psychologist and psychiatric care providers.\"). Underscoring the significance of this inconsistency, Hannah argues, is the fact that Ewing did not provide the June 30, 2015 email to the EEOC. Hannah argues that the inconsistency, coupled with Ewing's failure to disclose the email evidencing the inconsistency, illustrates \"clear pretext.\" Appellant's Br. 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Despite Hannah's arguments to the contrary, this apparent discrepancy does not create a genuine issue of material fact that Appellee's proffered reason for rejecting Hannah's application is pretextual. First, nothing in the record indicates that Ewing had first-hand knowledge of Hannah's disability. Although the memos mention that Hannah self-reported that she had depression, the second memo also describes Hannah's depression as \"under her control.\" J.A. 606. Indeed, Ewing's email suggests that he did not know that Hannah had an ongoing disability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 635 (\"I am informed that EAP concluded that [Hannah] does not have a medical problem, rather she is a disciplinary problem.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   More significantly, Hannah's asserted contradiction between Ewing's EEOC statements and his June 30, 2015 email do not create a genuine issue of material fact about pretext because Ewing's email and the memos written by Hannah's supervisors focus on Hannah's attendance problems, not on her disability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 413 (April 9, 2015 memo) (noting that \"[Hannah's] schedule has become increasingly erratic\" and that \"frequent absences and late arrivals [have begun] to affect her assigned unit and individual performance\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 606 (April 23, 2015 memo) (describing Hannah's history of attendance issues and Appellee's attempts to accommodate Hannah and noting that, despite those attempts, \"[Hannah's] late attendance has continued\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 635-36 (Ewing's June 30, 2015 email) (detailing Hannah's problem with \"attendance at work,\" noting that Hannah's \"absences and late arrivals were affecting her assigned staff element and her individual performance,\" and concluding that Hannah's \"recent performance is not consistent with a potentially good employee.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Accordingly, Hannah did not point to any genuine issue of material fact that Appellee's purported basis for not hiring her was merely a pretext for discriminating against her on the basis of her depression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   b.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <em>\n    Appellee's Nondiscriminatory Explanation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   i.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Moreover, the record indicates that Appellee's proffered explanation for not hiring Hannah for the Cyber position is genuine, legitimate, and nondiscriminatory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   As the district court concluded, a continuous attendance issue is a legitimate reason for withholding an employment benefit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tyndall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10522976\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/31/209/#p213\">\n    31 F.3d at 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding an employee who cannot satisfy their employer's attendance policy cannot be considered \"qualified\" for the purposes of the ADA).

We have no doubt that Hannah's struggle with depression was the cause of her attendance issues, and we are sympathetic to the toll this condition took on a highly talented employee. However, Appellee was nevertheless permitted to take Hannah's attendance issues into account in its decision whether to hire her for the Cyber position.

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (\"ODNI\") entrusted her with the high-stress, high-profile Edward Snowden case. She worked tirelessly and impeccably on that assignment, and ODNI praised her performance. For the duration of that assignment, Hannah kept nonconventional work hours with the knowledge and consent of her supervisors, and her attendance was not considered a problem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   It was only after the Snowden project ended, and Hannah's depression worsened, that her supervisors found fault with her work hours, though she remained formally on a flexible schedule. When Hannah requested an accommodation for her depression-a leave of absence recommended by both of her medical professionals-Hannah's supervisors refused to timely grant the request. This was despite the fact that her supervisors had offered to grant her leave just a few months earlier-before her depression was triggered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The result of this was tragic. Hannah was denied a permanent position for which it is undisputed that she was exceptionally qualified and for which the interview panel unanimously selected her. ODNI concedes that Hannah's depression qualifies as a disability protected by the Rehabilitation Act. Yet, the employer denied Hannah, a dedicated and valuable employee, the protection that the law requires.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   The majority mistakenly fails to see the force of Hannah's claims. Though the majority cites repeatedly to our decision in\n   <em>\n    Vannoy v. Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond\n   </em>\n   , it fails to grapple with the stark distinctions between the \"blatant and persistent misconduct\" by the employee in that case and Hannah's cooperative attempts to satisfy her supervisors' expectations, despite the increasingly severe symptoms of her disability.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334113\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/296/#p300\">\n    827 F.3d 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 300 (4th Cir. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   While I concur in Parts III.A.2.a, III.A.3, and III.B.1 of the Court's opinion, I cannot agree that no genuine issue of material fact exists with respect to Hannah's claims that ODNI violated the Rehabilitation Act and Family and Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\") when it discriminated against her on the basis of her disability, failed to reasonably accommodate her depression, wrongfully required a medical\n   examination of her as a current employee, and chose not to hire her for permanent employment in retaliation for her FMLA-qualifying leave. I believe that several disputes of fact exist and that Hannah is entitled to her day in court. Therefore, I respectfully dissent with respect to those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Hannah's supervisors were informed early in her employment that she suffered from depression. She was under the treatment of a psychiatrist and a licensed clinical social worker and did not initially request any work accommodations because she \"was adequately handling [her] depression at the time with medication and counseling.\" J.A. 19-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Despite her depression, Hannah excelled at her job. In her position as the disclosures coordinator for the Edward Snowden project, her \"leadership, poise, and performance were impeccable.\" J.A. 412. She was described by her supervisors as \"an outstanding employee combining energy/drive, technical competence, superb communication and networking skills, and superior analytic tradecraft.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334113\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/296/#p300\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In short, Hannah was considered \"an invaluable intelligence officer and a future [Intelligence Community] leader.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334113\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/296/#p300\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   The high-profile Snowden project required long work hours, and Hannah was not required to maintain an established \"core\" hours schedule. Instead, she worked a \"maxi flex\" schedule, which permitted her to vary her schedule so long as she put in 80 hours of work in each two-week period. J.A. 492-93. She often came in later than other ODNI employees (around noon), but stayed later as well. J.A. 494.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   In November or December 2014, as the Snowden project was coming to a close, Hannah's supervisors encouraged her to take leave, a common practice for ODNI employees \"after finishing a burn-out job.\" J.A. 173. Hannah did not take her supervisors up on the offer, however, not only because she was interviewing for permanent employment, but also because \"there was still ambiguity over whether the [Snowden] disclosures responsibilities had truly finished.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334113\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/296/#p300\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   During this time, Hannah's depression became more serious. She had trouble arriving at work before noon and had unscheduled absences. Hannah remained on a maxi flex schedule, however, and it was not until March 19, 2015, that she was informed that her attendance and arrival time were problematic. J.A. 461, 495. In fact, her first-line supervisor had no concerns about her attendance or work hours in early 2015 and asked Hannah to fill in as acting chief of their division while he was out of the office in late February. J.A. 494-95, 498.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   When Hannah's supervisor spoke with her about her work hours on March 19, 2015, Hannah was not told that she was required to return to a \"core\" schedule. Rather, Hannah and her first-line supervisor agreed that Hannah would either arrive at work by 10:00 a.m. or contact her supervisors if she was unable to arrive by that time; if she neither arrived at work nor contacted the office by 11:00 a.m., her supervisor would reach out to her by phone. J.A. 114. Hannah's second-line supervisor had no objection to the arrangement; he \"wanted to see what would happen.\" J.A. 345.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   The day after making this arrangement, Hannah did not report for work by 10:00 a.m. When she did not arrive by 11:00 a.m., her supervisors did not call her. Instead, she emailed them at 11:05 a.m., advising she would be in around 12:30 p.m. J.A. 118.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   After that work day, Hannah began a pre-scheduled week-long leave during which she was preoccupied with home renovations. J.A. 114. At the end of the week, she emailed her supervisors to inform them she would not be in Monday, the next business day, because of the renovations. J.A. 120. On Tuesday, Hannah emailed her supervisors notifying them that she would not be in that day either. J.A. 122.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   On Wednesday, when Hannah did not come in by 10:00 a.m., Hannah's second-line supervisor called her. J.A. 174. According to Hannah, her supervisor was \"angry\" and demanded to know why Hannah had not arrived.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334113\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/296/#p300\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Hannah apologized, explained she was having trouble getting out of bed, and indicated that she would be in as soon as possible.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334113\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/296/#p300\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   When she arrived at work, her supervisor told her that the arrangement they had made \"was not working.\" J.A. 175. She was told that she was solely responsible for contacting the office in the event she would be late or absent, and that her supervisors would not be contacting her. J.A. 90. The arrangement had been in place for a total of four days on which Hannah was scheduled to work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Hannah asked that her supervisors \"give the current accommodation more time to work.\" J.A. 175. Her supervisor, who was aware of Hannah's depression, insisted that Hannah propose an alternative plan \"right then.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334113\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/296/#p300\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   She was ultimately given \"a day or two\" to propose an alternative.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334113\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/296/#p300\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   The next day, on April 2, 2015, Hannah emailed her supervisors at 11:02 a.m., notifying them that she would be in by noon. J.A. 124. That day, Hannah's supervisors met with ODNI's Employee Management Relations Officer, the head of ODNI's Equal Employment Opportunity and Diversity Office, and the head of ODNI's Human Resources Division to discuss how to best address Hannah's attendance and reporting. J.A. 66, 128, 149. They collectively decided to refer Hannah to the Central Intelligence Agency's Employee Assistance Program (\"EAP\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   J.A. 326-29. Although Hannah's supervisors were well aware of her depression, she was referred to the EAP to \"help identify what her challenges were and provide her any support she needed,\" such as \"accommodation with work hours, ... counseling or any other type of support.\" J.A. 139-40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Hannah's supervisors drafted a memorandum, which they dated April 9, 2015, referring Hannah to the EAP. The memo outlined Hannah's \"impressive capabilities\" and her work with ODNI, commented on her recent attendance, and explained that Hannah had disclosed to her supervisors that she was meeting with a psychiatrist and counselor and taking medication for depression. J.A. 412-13. The memo also noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n   Hannah has indicated that she is struggling to get out of bed in the morning and admits to feeling almost paralyzed. She has also indicated that she had a recent change in medication and that the upheaval in her living arrangements negatively impacted some of her physical coping mechanisms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   J.A. 413. The memo explained that \"as senior intelligence officials,\" Hannah's supervisors \"ha[d] a duty to identify and if possible help vulnerable employees.\" J.A. 414.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Meanwhile, Hannah met with her psychiatrist and counselor. Both professionals agreed that Hannah should take four weeks of leave. J.A. 175. Accordingly, Hannah met with her supervisors on April 9, 2015 and requested a four-week leave of absence. J.A. 424, 449, 468. Her supervisors did not ask her for any medical documentation to support the leave request because they expected to receive a \"quick answer\" from EAP. J.A. 95. They also believed that Hannah's medical providers did not have \"the expertise to provide\" an opinion on \"all of the items\" that they were planning to submit to EPA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334113\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/296/#p300\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Hannah's supervisors denied her leave request; they had already determined before meeting with Hannah that if Hannah asked for leave, they would \"defer that decision until after meeting with EAP.\" J.A. 422. One of Hannah's supervisors explained in her deposition that she \"wanted to get a sense [Hannah] was in a good place.\" J.A. 431. According to that supervisor, the \"rationale\" of the group that decided to refer Hannah to EAP first was:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-164\">\n   If this were ... a bad behavior problem, there would be no need to grant immediate leave.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n   If it were a medical mental health problem, the thought was, granting leave and isolating [Hannah] from day-to-day contact with her coworkers and her managers when we didn't know her state of mind and how much medical care she was receiving could, potentially, be dangerous.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   J.A. 422-23. Hannah's second-line supervisor told her that the decision was made because of concern that \"since [Hannah] was a single woman if [she] took leave [she] would be home by [herself] and that could make [her] depression worse.\" J.A. 176. It was made clear that Hannah was required to attend EAP counseling; if she refused, her temporary position would be deemed \"as excess\" and she would lose her job \"immediately.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334113\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/296/#p300\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Hannah's first-line supervisor disagreed with the others' proposed course of action; he believed that the supervisors should not \"substitute [their] judgment for [Hannah's] doctor's.\" J.A. 504. Nonetheless, Hannah signed the memo to EAP and attended an appointment with an EAP counselor the next day, April 10, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   On Monday, April 13, 2015, Hannah met again with one of her supervisors to discuss her leave request. Her supervisor told her that her leave request was approved but \"was pushing\" her to take only two weeks off, not the four she had requested. J.A. 524, 528. He explained that Hannah would have to submit to a medical evaluation if she wished to take leave beyond the two weeks. J.A. 524. Hannah felt uncomfortable with her supervisor's pushiness and confused about the status of her leave request so she responded that her request was \"on hold.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334113\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/296/#p300\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   She wanted to figure out what the EAP counselor had told her supervisor and to confirm her legal options.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334113\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/296/#p300\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Hannah continued to arrive at work later than 10:00 a.m. during April 2015. During that month, Hannah also continued attending the EAP sessions. In those sessions, Hannah testified, she was questioned about her medical history, her family's medical history, and the medication she was taking and its dosage. J.A. 531-32. In the third session, Hannah was given a diagnostic questionnaire \"to assess depression or severity of those sorts of things.\" J.A. 534.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   On April 16, 2015, the EAP counselor had an extended forty-minute discussion with Hannah's second-line supervisor. During that discussion, the counselor disclosed that Hannah's \"lack of motivation/inability to come to work\" was primarily influenced by feelings of frustration over not securing\n   a permanent position at ODNI. J.A. 604. At some point, the counselor also indicated that Hannah was not cooperating with the EAP process because she was spending \"more than half the session at times\" expressing concerns over the record retention policy. J.A. 192.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   A week later, Hannah's second-line supervisor circulated a status update via email to ODNI leadership outlining the information shared by the EAP counselor. That information included Hannah's explained reasons for her inability to arrive punctually for work, as well as Hannah's concerns that the EAP process would \"create a paper trail that [would] adversely impact her future employment and career.\" J.A. 606. The email also indicated that the EAP counselor had identified \"non-medical\" factors as the primary cause of Hannah's attendance problems. J.A. 607.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   On April 28, 2015, Hannah met with one of her supervisors and reiterated her request for four weeks of leave. J.A. 41. She was told that her leave request would be approved if she met with the EAP counselor once more on May 1, 2015 and signed a Letter of Expectations. J.A. 42. Hannah attended the May 1 appointment and signed the Letter of Expectations on May 4, 2015. J.A. 43. The Letter of Expectations provided that, \"[e]ffective immediately,\" Hannah would begin work by 10:00 a.m. and would contact her office no later than 9:30 a.m. in the event she would be late. J.A. 614.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Beginning on May 5, 2015, Hannah took a four-week leave of absence. She returned to work on June 1, 2015 and was immediately tasked with leading a significant study. J.A. 44-45. Her attendance problem \"largely disappeared as Hannah responded to the need for daily meetings all over the community.\" J.A. 612.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   On June 9, 2015, Hannah interviewed for a permanent position with ODNI-Program Mission Manager Cyber (\"Cyber\"), a job she had applied for at the end of April or beginning of May 2015. J.A. 620-21. She was unanimously selected by the interview panel as the most qualified candidate for the position. J.A. 206, 625. A week later, the interview panel forwarded its recommendation to ODNI's Chief Management Officer, Mark Ewing. J.A. 206-07. Ewing was already aware of the decision to refer Hannah to the EAP and had been consulted in that decision-making process. J.A. 216. As Ewing testified, the EAP referral was intended not only to address Hannah's issues with the temporary job she had at the time; Ewing's \"concern was her conduct in relationship to being selected for a permanent government position.\" J.A. 217, 585.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Hannah's application for the Cyber position stalled for several weeks, despite the fact that the approval process typically only took a few days. J.A. 443, 630. On June 25, 2015, members of the interview panel began questioning the holdup. J.A. 633. In response, Ewing sent an email to the Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence (\"PDDNI\") recommending that Hannah not be approved for the Cyber position based on her recent attendance history. J.A. 635-36. Ewing also represented that the EAP counselor had concluded that Hannah did not have a medical problem, \"rather she is a disciplinary problem.\" J.A. 635.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   The PDDNI shared that email with the Director of National Intelligence (\"DNI\"). Neither the PDDNI nor the DNI approved Hannah for the permanent position. J.A. 722. On July 7, 2015, Hannah was notified that she was not selected for the position. J.A. 638. Hannah completed her temporary term at ODNI on March 27, 2016 as a high performer, yet did not secure a permanent position with the department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   I first take issue with the Court's treatment of Hannah's discrimination claim under the Rehabilitation Act. The majority concludes that Hannah's 13 \"attendance issues\" between March 19, 2015 and May 4, 2015 constituted a \"significant attendance and reporting problem.\" Maj. Op. at 343-44. Accordingly, the majority credits this proffered legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for ODNI's failure to hire Hannah for the permanent Cyber position.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The majority also concludes that Hannah has failed to satisfy her burden at this stage of presenting sufficient evidence that ODNI's explanation for rejecting her application is pretext for disability discrimination. Maj. Op. 342-43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   I disagree with the majority's conclusions for several reasons. Fundamentally, ODNI's proffered reason for not hiring Hannah reflects a misunderstanding of Hannah's disability.

To the contrary, Hannah openly communicated with her supervisors, even if she did so later in the day than they had expected. She informed her supervisors of her depression and cooperated by attending the sessions with the EAP counselor. During the 46-day period between the first accommodation and Hannah's written agreement to begin work at a specified time, she had four unscheduled absences and came into work after 10:00 a.m. nine times. J.A. 556. On all but two occasions she communicated her anticipated schedule to ODNI. And on one of those two occasions, Hannah arrived by 11:00 a.m., the time after which her supervisors were to contact her.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20791\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   During this time she actively worked with her medical professionals to design an alternative solution, and she requested, on more than one occasion, that ODNI grant the recommended leave of absence. In fact, Hannah was absent only once and arrived after 10:00 a.m. only twice before her initial leave request was denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20791\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Had her supervisors granted her leave of absence on April 9 when she first requested it, many of her attendance issues would have been avoided. A jury could reasonably conclude that Hannah's late arrivals to work continued only because her depression was not effectively accommodated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J.A. 175 (both medical professionals recommended four-week leave); J.A. 612 (noting Hannah's attendance problem \"largely disappeared\" upon her return from leave). On this record, I find unfounded the characterization of Hannah's conduct as blatant and persistent as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Furthermore, Hannah has sufficiently shown that ODNI's proffered reason for not hiring her-her attendance problems-may be pretext for disability discrimination. At the summary judgment stage, Hannah need not conclusively prove discrimination. But she must proffer sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that she was in fact the victim of intentional discrimination by ODNI.\n   <em>\n    Reyazuddin v. Montgomery Cty., Md.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233458\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/789/407/#p414\">\n    789 F.3d 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 419 (4th Cir. 2015). I would find that she has met this burden for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   First, as Hannah argues, questions of fact exist as to whether her attendance was a serious problem, or whether her attendance even violated any work-hours policy. The record suggests that it was not until May 4, 2015 that Hannah was given a formal time by which to arrive at work.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , J.A. 108 (\"[D]ifferent people had different schedules ....\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233458\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/789/407/#p414\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (explaining that while most employees arrived at work around 9:00 a.m., there was no \"explicit\" requirement to do so); J.A. 518 (denying that a \"core hours expectation\" existed before September or October 2015). Although her supervisors told her on March 19, 2015 that she was to report by 10:00 a.m., they also initially agreed to contact her if she did not report by 11:00 a.m. Had the 10:00 a.m. start time been deemed a requirement, it would make little sense to have made any further arrangements. When one of her supervisors attempted to unilaterally change that arrangement, he acceded to Hannah's request for time to propose an alternative. Hannah requested the doctor-recommended leave of absence as an alternative, but she was never told that she was required to work specific hours; she remained formally on a maxi\n   flex schedule. It was not until the Letter of Expectation on May 4, 2015 that a formal start time was imposed. The department itself did not move to \"core\" hours until October 2015. J.A. 518. Therefore, Hannah's work schedule during the relevant time may have been \"erratic,\" Maj. Op. 343, but a reasonable jury could conclude that it did not violate any established work-hours requirement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Second, I would find that Mark Ewing's inconsistent statements regarding his knowledge of Hannah's disability, coupled with the above evidence, are sufficient evidence of pretext to survive summary judgment. The majority emphasizes that Ewing did not have first-hand knowledge of her condition and that he was informed that her depression was under control. Maj. Op. 342-43. But depression is not like physical illnesses; it does not simply dissipate overnight. Its symptoms may be under control one day yet triggered the very next.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sidney H. Kennedy, M.D.,\n   <em>\n    A Review of Antidepressant Therapy in Primary Care: Current Practices and Future Directions\n   </em>\n   , Primary Care Companion for CNS Disorders, vol. 15(2), PCC.12r01420 (Apr. 11, 2013) (noting that major depressive disorder, the disease with which Hannah was diagnosed, is \"chronic and episodic\" in nature). Indeed, Hannah was able to control her symptoms for years while working at ODNI. Ewing was consulted by Hannah's supervisors in connection with their decision to refer Hannah to EAP. J.A. 216. The EAP memo, a copy of which Ewing possessed, explicitly stated: \"[Hannah] informed us that she was meeting with a psychiatrist and counselor and taking medication for depression.\" J.A. 413. And the memo implicitly made the connection between Hannah's \"struggling to get out of bed in the morning\" and recent upheavals in her life that \"negatively impacted some of her physical coping mechanisms.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233458\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/789/407/#p414\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In fact, it noted that Hannah \"appear[ed] to gain more energy and become aware as the day progress[ed] into early evening.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4233458\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/789/407/#p414\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On this evidence, a reasonable jury could determine that Ewing was aware that Hannah's depression affected her ability to get to work by 10:00 a.m. and required medical intervention and that Ewing's initial statement that he was unaware of her condition was intended to cover up the true reason for his desire not to hire her: her disability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   In sum, because a reasonable jury could conclude on this record that Hannah's attendance issues were far from \"blatant and persistent misconduct,\"\n   <em>\n    Vannoy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334113\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/296/#p300\">\n    827 F.3d at 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and that ODNI's proffered reason for failing to hire Hannah for the Cyber position was pretext for discrimination on the basis of her disability, I would reverse the district court's grant of summary judgment on the discrimination claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   I also take issue with the Court's conclusion that no question exists as to the reasonableness of the accommodations made by ODNI.

Maj. Op. 337. I submit that questions of fact exist with respect to whether ODNI made a good-faith effort to respond to Hannah's needs and whether either of these accommodations was effective,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , whether the accommodations were reasonable. And because a question of fact exists as to that issue, I agree with Hannah that a question also exists as to whether her employer engaged in the required interactive process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Hannah argues that her supervisors' initial commitment to contact her if she did not contact them or arrive by 11:00 a.m. was the\n   <em>\n    sine qua non\n   </em>\n   of the first accommodation. But Hannah's supervisors allowed that accommodation to remain in place for only four working days before unilaterally modifying it and, according to Hannah, angrily pressuring her to propose an alternative accommodation on the spot. When Hannah did propose an alternative-four weeks of leave, as recommended by both of her treating medical professionals-her supervisors denied the request because they had already decided that EAP counseling was more appropriate. Speculating that they knew better than both of Hannah's medical professionals, her supervisors believed that her medical providers lacked \"the expertise to provide\" an opinion on \"all of the items\" they wanted to submit to the EAP. J.A. 95. And while Hannah's supervisors had suggested that she take leave a few months earlier, prior to any signs that Hannah's disability would affect her ability to get into work in the morning, J.A. 173, they threatened to terminate her employment if she did not first attend EAP sessions after she requested medically recommended leave to cope with her depression, J.A. 176. On this evidence, the question of whether the first accommodation and the decision to require EAP counseling before granting medically recommended leave were made in good faith and were effective to address Hannah's disability should be submitted to the jury, as reasonable minds could conclude that they were not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Likewise, the reasonableness of ODNI's delay in granting Hannah leave should be decided by a jury. Concededly, the short duration of the delay (from April 9, 2015 to May 4, 2015) undercuts Hannah's argument of unreasonableness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Terrell v.

Despite the voluntary nature of EAP counseling highlighted by the majority, Maj. Op. 338, two of Hannah's supervisors testified that the sessions were in fact \"mandatory.\" J.A. 448, 474. As Hannah explained, she was told by her supervisor that she had \"no choice\" in the matter and that if she did not participate in the EAP counseling, her temporary position with ODNI would be declared \"as excess\" and she \"would be out of a job immediately.\" J.A. 176.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   The majority emphasizes the EAP counselor's testimony that she did not conduct a medical examination. Yet, the Court's opinion says nothing about Hannah's testimony regarding the substance of her sessions with the counselor. According to Hannah, she was asked for a family medical history, questioned about her medication and dosage, and even administered a diagnostic tool used to assess depression. J.A. 531-32, 534.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   In light of this testimony, a reasonable jury could conclude that the EAP sessions were in fact required and that the diagnostic tool constituted a \"procedure or test that seeks information about an individual's physical or mental impairments or health.\" E.E.O.C.,\n   <em>\n    Enforcement Guidance: Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations of Employees Under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)\n   </em>\n   (EEOC Notice 915.002) (July 27, 2000).

Their decision was predicated on a concern that granting Hannah the doctor-recommended leave could \"make [her] depression worse\" and could even \"be dangerous.\" J.A. 176, 422-23.

Therefore, the question is whether those supervisors had objective evidence that Hannah was unable to perform an essential function of her job. For the period including Hannah's \"egregious\" attendance issues, she received an overall performance rating of 4.53 out of 5.00-a rating of \"Excellent.\" J.A. 406-10. Yet the majority concludes that her poor attendance precluded her from performing an essential function of her job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   I submit that this conclusion cannot be reached as a matter of law on this record, a record that seriously calls into question ODNI's sincerity in its assertion that Hannah was unable to perform an essential function of her job. For the entirety of Hannah's time as the disclosures coordinator on the Snowden project, she started work and left work later than other ODNI employees. J.A. 25, 494. Although she came in later, she got the job done, and she did it \"impeccabl[y].\" J.A. 412. She was able to manage her depression and worked long hours in a stressful environment while excelling. J.A. 19-20, 412. Her supervisors had no qualm with her attendance, and\n   aside from the maxi flex schedule, there was no formal work-hours requirement in place. J.A. 492-94, 518. When that project winded down in late 2014 and early 2015, Hannah's supervisors did not institute \"core\" hours or otherwise formally remove Hannah from the maxi flex schedule. J.A. 461, 518. In light of Hannah's ODNI-sanctioned history of beginning her work day later than others (a practice which simply continued into April 2015), the apparent lack of any formal policy requiring that her schedule be otherwise, and her consistent \"excellent\" performance reviews, there is at the very least a question of fact regarding ODNI's \"reasonable belief based on objective evidence that [Hannah] was unable to perform the essential functions of her job.\"\n   <em>\n    Wright\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4331759\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/513/#p524\">\n    798 F.3d at 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   This is not to say that the essential functions of Hannah's job did not include regular attendance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tyndall v.

However, as discussed above, a jury could reasonably conclude that ODNI had no \"reason to suspect abuse of an attendance policy,\"\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5743905\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/483/516/#p527\">\n    483 F.3d at 527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted), when no such policy formally existed and when Hannah had been allowed for over a year to begin work later than other department employees. And although Hannah requested leave, her supervisors had decided before Hannah's request that they would defer a decision on any leave request until after the EAP referral because they expected a \"quick answer\" from EAP. J.A. 95. But \"mere expediency\" is insufficient to establish business necessity.\n   <em>\n    Coursey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4199707\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/577/167/#p173\">\n    577 F. App'x at 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   In light of these considerations, I would submit the issue of whether the EAP sessions were job-related and consistent with business necessity to the jury for resolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   Finally, I would reverse the district court's grant of summary judgment on Hannah's FMLA retaliation claim. ODNI argues that Hannah cannot prove this claim because her non-selection for the Cyber position was due to \"her significant attendance and reporting problems prior to her first leave request.\" Resp. Br. 48. For largely the same reasons that I would reverse with respect to Hannah's discrimination-in-hiring claim, I would find that there is sufficient evidence in the record to create a material issue of fact for the jury to decide on this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   Hannah suffered from a disability, one that could effectively be accommodated with leave. Unfortunately, her leave was granted only after she struggled to manage her disability-a struggle which a reasonable jury could readily conclude did not violate any attendance policy. Despite Hannah's rebound upon her return, ODNI used her late arrivals during the time for which she requested but was denied leave as grounds for denying her a permanent position, a position for which it is undisputed that she was exceptionally qualified. J.A. 623-25, 635-36. In essence, ODNI assigned Hannah to a high-stress position after which her depression worsened; delayed her request for FMLA-qualifying leave to accommodate her depression, thereby intensifying her symptoms; then refused to hire her for a permanent role when she returned from leave. Because of this, and for the reasons I articulate above, a jury could reasonably conclude that ODNI's rejection of Hannah's application for permanent employment was based on the exercise of her FMLA rights in requesting and taking a qualifying leave of absence to accommodate her disability.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-219\">\n    Hannah was referred to the CIA's EAP program because ODNI did not have one of its own. The EAP provides employees with \"free, confidential, short-term mental health[,] financial, and addictions counseling and referral to cleared community providers.\" J.A. 132.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-220\">\n    ODNI does not dispute that Hannah's depression qualifies as a disability under the Rehabilitation Act.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-221\">\n    Hannah's supervisors testified that, because she arrived later than other employees, they were forced to reassign work that would have fallen to her. There is evidence that the work assignments were made around 9:00 or 9:30 a.m. J.A. 108-09. Had Hannah's supervisors truly been concerned about being able to assign her work, one would expect the accommodation they offered to Hannah to have required her to come into the office by 9:00. No such requirement was ever made of her.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-222\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    J.A. 422 (\"The recommendation of the group was if Hannah were to ask for leave, we should defer that decision until after meeting with EAP.\"); J.A. 176 (\"EAP was concerned that since I was a single woman if I took leave I would be home by myself and that could make my depression worse.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-223\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    J.A. 176 (Hannah's statement that she was told she had \"no choice\" but to attend the EAP sessions or her job would be terminated immediately).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-224\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    J.A. 584-85 (Mark Ewing's deposition testimony that EAP referral \"wasn't initially just about\" Hannah's temporary position but also because Ewing \"knew she was looking for permanent employment\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
