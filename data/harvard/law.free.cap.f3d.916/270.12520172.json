She then sought permanent resident status for her son, Dario, based on a related provision of the INA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201255\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (m)(3), which empowers the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") to grant that status to certain family members, including a \"child,\" of an immigrant in Carmen's situation. But that application hit a snag: while it was pending Carmen's son reached the age of twenty-one, which made him ineligible under a DHS regulation that implements \u00a7 1255(m)(3). Citing that regulation, it denied the application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Carmen and her son challenge the regulation as contrary to \u00a7 1255(m)(3) as well as being arbitrary and capricious. But we cannot sustain that challenge. Instead we hold that \u00a7 1255(m)(3) unambiguously requires DHS to assess the familial relationship required under that statute as it exists when DHS decides the application, even though this means a child can \"age out\" of eligibility while an application is pending. The DHS regulation in question adheres to this unambiguous meaning of the statute, as did DHS's denial of Carmen's application. We thus affirm the District Court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the Government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Legal Framework\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2000 Congress passed legislation that created a new nonimmigrant visa classification-the U Visa-within the INA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, Pub.

It is a temporary legal status offered to victims of rape and other specified crimes who have cooperated, or are likely to cooperate, in the investigation and prosecution of those crimes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(15)(U)(i). Congress passed the statute to \"strengthen the ability of law enforcement agencies to detect, investigate, and prosecute\" the specified crimes, and to \"offer[ ] protection to victims of such offenses in keeping with the humanitarian interests of the United States.\" Pub. L. No. 106-386, \u00a7 1513(a)(2)(A). The statute also gives a pathway to permanent resident status: after three years of holding a U Visa, an alien may apply for permanent resident status under a provision of the INA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201255\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (m)(1), that applies specifically to holders of U Visas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Certain U-Visa benefits also extend to qualifying family members.

The victim of a rape in New York City, she assisted law enforcement with their investigation and, on that basis, obtained a U Visa from DHS. After holding the U Visa for more than three years, she obtained permanent resident status under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201255\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (m)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After doing so, Carmen began the process to obtain the same status for her son, Dario.

Text\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Government contends the plain terms of the statute require DHS to determine eligibility at the time it rules on a \u00a7 1255(m)(3) application. For this argument, the Government leans on the grammatical structure of the provision, which, by its literal terms, only authorizes DHS to grant permanent resident status to \"a spouse, a child, or ... a parent\" of the principal U-Visa holder. It argues that, in the case of a child application, it cannot grant the application if the person in question has reached the age of twenty-one before his status is adjusted, as he no longer is a child under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Government's reading of \u00a7 1255(m)(3) finds support in\n   <em>\n    Robinson v.

There we reviewed Immigration Services' denial of a U.S. citizen's application for permanent resident status for his spouse under a provision of the INA that allows those applications for \"immediate relatives\" of U.S. citizens.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684893\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/554/358/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684893\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/554/358/\">\n    at 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Immigration Services then denied the application, ruling the widow was not a \"spouse\" under the INA at the time the application was decided; hence the widow could not obtain permanent resident status as an \"immediate relative.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684893\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/554/358/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684893\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/554/358/\">\n    at 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We agreed with Immigration Services' interpretation of the statute, holding that \"eligibility for an immediate relative visa depends upon the alien's status at the time [Immigration Services] adjudicates the [applicable] petition, not when that petition was filed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684893\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/554/358/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3684893\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/554/358/\">\n    at 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The grammatical structure of the statute in\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   is similar to the structure of \u00a7 1255(m)(3) in that both statutes, by their literal terms, imply an equivalence in time between the eligibility criteria (\"immediate relative\" in\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   ; a \"child\" here) and DHS's authority to grant benefits (\"shall ... approve\" in\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   ; \"may adjust\" here).\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   's approach to a similar statute thus cuts in favor of the Government's interpretation of \u00a7 1255(m)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   For their textual argument, Carmen and Dario focus on the phrase \"[u]pon approval of adjustment of status\" in \u00a7 1255(m)(3). They contend this phrase establishes the timing of the \"child\" determination DHS must make because the word \"upon\" is a temporal word and the rest of \u00a7 1255(m)(3) is linked to this timing. We are not persuaded. \"Upon approval of adjustment of status\" imposes a precondition to DHS's consideration of an application under \u00a7 1255(m)(3) ; it does not require DHS to determine eligibility under \u00a7 1255(m)(3) by looking back to the state of affairs when the principal U-Visa holder obtained LPR status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In sum, the text favors the Government's position that a potential beneficiary's status as a \"child\" must be evaluated\n   when DHS rules on the \u00a7 1255(m)(3) application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Statutory Context\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We next consider other provisions of the U-Visa statute and the INA to probe further the meaning of \u00a7 1255(m)(3). Two provisions of the statute stand out as relevant. The first is\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(15)(U)(ii)(I), which extends derivative U-Visa eligibility to the \"unmarried siblings\" of a U-Visa holder. They are siblings who are \"under 18 years of age\n   <em>\n    on the date on which such alien applied for\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    U-Visa\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    status\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). This provision suggests that, when Congress wants a derivative U-Visa applicant's age to be determined as of the application date, it says that explicitly. Similarly, the U-Visa statute expressly protects against the age-out problem for derivative U-Visa applications as opposed to the permanent resident application we review here. For the former, a child applicant \"shall continue to be classified as a child\" for purposes of the derivative U-Visa application even if the child attains the age of twenty-one while the parent's application is pending.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201184\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (p)(7)(A). No equivalent safeguard applies to applications under \u00a7 1255(m)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   A similar suggestion stems from provisions of the Child Status Protection Act. Pub. L. No. 107-208,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=116%20Stat.%20927\">\n    116 Stat. 927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Among other things, it protects child asylum applicants by fixing their ages for asylum purposes as of when they submit their applications, thus protecting them against the age-out problem.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(B). But, as the District Court observed, that implies that other children seeking immigration benefits could still age out of eligibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In short, the broader context of the statute also favors the Government's interpretation of \u00a7 1255(m)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Absurdity Principle\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Appellants urge that several \"absurd\" results would flow from reading \u00a7 1255(m)(3) as containing an age-out mechanism for child applicants. It would put child applications at the whim of agency processing times, over which applicants have absolutely no control. It also would make it impossible to predict a child's eligibility under the statute at the time of filing an application. And it would mean that two identically situated children-twin children of a woman who obtains U-1 immigrant status, for example-might be denied or granted LPR status based purely on how quickly DHS processes their separate applications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   There is heft to these arguments and, were we writing on a blank slate, we may well be swayed. But, unfortunately, we are not because Congress and the Supreme Court do not appear to view \"aging out\" of immigration benefits as an absurdity. Congress made that viewpoint clear in, among other laws, the Child Status Protection Act, which protects certain categories of children from aging out of immigration benefits while their applications are pending. The incomplete coverage of that Act implies Congress knows but has not addressed when children not protected by it may still be subject to aging out of eligibility due to the vagaries of the application process. Similarly, in a recent decision, the Supreme Court acknowledged without pause the potential for \"aging out\" under the immigration laws.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scialabba v. Cuellar de Osorio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=573%20U.S.%2041\">\n    573 U.S. 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 45,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581215\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2191/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581215\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2191/\">\n    189 L.Ed.2d 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014) (discussing the \"aging out\" phenomenon in the immigration context and observing that \"someone who was a youngster at the start of the process may be an adult at the end, and no longer qualify for an immigration status given to minors\"). We view these authorities\n   as fatal to appellants' arguments based on the arguably absurd results of a literal interpretation of \u00a7 1255(m)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   * * * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We hold that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201255\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (m)(3) unambiguously requires DHS to determine qualifying family member status when it decides an application per that provision. It adhered to that interpretation of the statute when it denied Carmen's \u00a7 1255(m)(3) application for permanent resident status on behalf of her son because he was no longer a child when it ruled on the application. Hence our analysis concludes here, and we affirm the District Court's entry of summary judgment for the Government.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Although we do not rest our interpretation of the statute on legislative history, we thank the\n    <em>\n     amicus curiae\n    </em>\n    , Her Justice, for its thorough and valuable submission on that subject.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
