He challenges the district court's\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   application of the crime of violence enhancement under the sentencing guidelines, contending that his Illinois attempted robbery conviction does not qualify as a career offender predicate under the guidelines's force clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1). \"We review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   the district court's determination that a conviction constitutes a crime of violence.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518119\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/659/#p662\">\n    899 F.3d 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 662 (8th Cir. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We recently held that Illinois robbery is a \"violent felony\" under the force clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act\n   (\"ACCA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(b).\n   <em>\n    Dembry v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519877\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/914/1185/#p1187\">\n    914 F.3d 1185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1187-88 (8th Cir. 2019). \"The relevant definition of a violent felony under the ACCA and the definition of a crime of violence under the guidelines are so similar that we generally consider cases interpreting them interchangeably.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Sykes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519947\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/914/615/#p620\">\n    914 F.3d 615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 620 (8th Cir. 2019) (internal quotation marks omitted). Applying this logic, we hold that Illinois robbery is a crime of violence under the guidelines. And because Illinois robbery is a crime of violence, so too is Illinois attempted robbery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1) n.1 (noting that a \"crime of violence\" includes attempts to commit such an offense). This conclusion is consistent with Seventh Circuit decisions, which have \"repeatedly held that Illinois robbery is a crime of violence under the 'force' clause of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1).\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.
