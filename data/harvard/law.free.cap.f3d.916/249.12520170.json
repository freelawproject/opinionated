The statutory provisions governing supervised release do not contain plain language-or indeed any language-that expressly resolves that question. But, as the majority of Courts of Appeals to address the question have concluded, a defendant does not in fact serve his supervised release term while he deliberately absconds from the court's supervision. Accordingly, a defendant's supervised release term tolls while he is of fugitive status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Defendant Donte Island appealed to challenge the District Court's order revoking his supervised release and sentencing him to a term of imprisonment. Island primarily contended that under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203583\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i) the Court's jurisdiction terminated at the end of his three-year supervised release term. Island asserted the Court accordingly lacked authority to revoke his release based on his involvement in a police officer shooting first raised to the court a few days after those three years had passed. The government maintained the Court had jurisdiction to revoke Island's supervised release for the officer shooting violation based on an earlier-issued warrant for unrelated violations. We have no occasion to resolve that jurisdictional dispute, however, because we join the majority of Circuits that have addressed the issue to hold Island's supervised release term tolled while he was fugitive from the court's supervision. As a result of that tolling, Island's term of supervised release had not yet expired when the later warrant was issued. Because the District Court therefore had jurisdiction over the second warrant and underlying petition of violation, we will affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Following a jury trial in 2004, the District Court sentenced Island to 110 months' imprisonment and 3 years' supervised release for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). Island commenced that three-year supervised release term on June 26, 2013, and it was scheduled to end on June 25, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Island completed the first two years of his release term without incident, but on September 18, 2015, Island's probation officer filed a petition of violation. The petition alleged Island had breached the terms of his release by committing several technical,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , noncriminal or minor, violations, such as failing to notify his probation officer of a changed address and failing several drug tests. The petition noted that \"[m]ore troublesome\" among the violations was Island's failure to report to his probation officer. App'x 34. The officer relayed that Island \"ceased reporting as instructed\" on July 17, 2015, after which his \"whereabouts [were] unknown.\" App'x 34, 28. The petition chronicled over half a dozen attempts to contact Island in the coming months, none of which were successful. Island failed to report for a scheduled meeting, then did not respond to phone calls, voicemails, letters, or emails sent to him at several possible numbers and addresses. The Court issued a warrant on the basis of that petition the day it was filed, but that warrant remained outstanding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 27, 2016-just over three years after Island's supervised release term had begun-the probation office filed a second petition of violation, styled as an \"[a]mended\" version of the first. App'x 35. The Court again issued a warrant the same day, now based on a new violation. The second petition alleged Island had committed a serious violation of the terms of his release on June 21-just under three years after Island's supervised release term had begun-by firing a weapon at\n   two police officers, hitting one. Island was arrested and taken into custody by Delaware County authorities that day. The District Court held a teleconference with the government and Island's counsel soon after receiving the petition, and the parties then agreed to delay a hearing on both petitions of violation until after the disposition of Island's Delaware County charges. Island was convicted in July 2017 of attempted murder and other charges, then sentenced in the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County, Pennsylvania to 33 to 100 years' imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The District Court held a supervised release revocation hearing on December 13, 2017. The government sought the statutory maximum revocation term of 24 months' imprisonment; at the hearing, it stressed the severity of the officer shooting underlying the second violation petition. The government further emphasized Island \"wasn't within hours of completing his sentence on this.... He was 11 months a fugitive, right, so it's not like he committed the crime on the 11th hour.\" App'x 57-58. In response, Island emphasized he would already be serving 33 to 100 years in prison and argued \"it would be excessive and unnecessary based on the practical realities of his case\" to also enforce a revocation term of imprisonment. App'x 62. The court imposed the government's recommended revocation sentence of 24 months, to run consecutively after Island's state sentence, on the basis of only the second violation petition. Island now appeals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Island asserts on appeal that the District Court lacked jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203583\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i) to revoke his supervised release because the warrant underlying revocation-based on the shooting-was untimely issued after the three-year calendar on his supervised release term had run. The government responds that the earlier warrant for unrelated technical violations endowed the District Court with ongoing jurisdiction, but also contends the warrant was timely because Island's three-year supervised release term was tolled while he was of fugitive status.

We found \"persuasive Cole's argument that the canon of\n   <em>\n    expressio unius est exclusio alterius\n   </em>\n   suggests that where Congress has explicitly allowed for tolling only when the defendant is imprisoned on another charge, it does not intend for district courts to toll supervised release under any other circumstance.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3650683\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/567/110/\">\n    567 F.3d at 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Section 3583(i) concerns the extension of a court's jurisdiction, but it is undisputed that a court has jurisdiction during the defendant's service of his supervised release term. We here begin with the question whether Island in fact served his supervised release term. Because, as we have explained, a defendant does not serve his term while fugitive, part of a fugitive defendant's term remains to be served. During the remainder of that supervised release term, the district court correspondingly has jurisdiction. As the Second Circuit has recognized, it is not \" \u00a7 3583(i) itself\" which \"authoriz[es] the tolling of the supervised-release period based on the defendant's fugitive status.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Instead, as discussed, \"such tolling is consistent with the traditional principle that an absconder should not benefit from his fugitivity and is consistent with Congress's sentencing scheme of supervision to facilitate the defendant's transition to a law-abiding life in free society.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275493\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/865/99/#p106\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   For at least the period between the court's issuance of the first warrant for violating supervised release in September 2015 and the shooting leading to Island's apprehension by law enforcement in June 2016, Island was of fugitive status.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   As Island's probation officer timely notified the court and the government confirmed at the revocation hearing, Island repeatedly failed to report for scheduled meetings and drug tests.

I believe this is\n   incorrect for two reasons. First, the proper focus should be on the plain language of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203583\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i), which states that the court has the power to extend the term of supervised release only when a warrant is issued prior to the expiration of the term of supervised release. Second, two precedential opinions of this court-\n   <em>\n    United States v. Merlino\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    United States v. Cole\n   </em>\n   -should lead us to conclude that tolling does not apply. Thus, tolling does not apply and the District Court was without the power to extend the term of Island's supervised release based upon tolling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Section 3583(i) grants the court the power to extend supervised release \"beyond the expiration of the term of supervised release for any period reasonably necessary for the adjudication of matters arising before its expiration if, before its expiration, a warrant or summons has been issued on the basis of an allegation of such a violation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203583\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i). By its plain language, a court has the power to adjudicate matters\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the expiration of supervised release\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   a warrant or summons had been issued\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the expiration of supervised release. There is no dispute that the District Court here issued the warrant\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the technical term of supervised release expired. When faced with a similar issue we held in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Merlino\n   </em>\n   that \u00a7 3583(i) is \"in fact jurisdictional,\" and thus cannot be equitably tolled.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4184110\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/785/79/#p86\">\n    785 F.3d 79\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 86 (3d Cir. 2015). I suggest that, in light of the express statutory directive of \u00a7 3583(i) and our opinion in\n   <em>\n    Merlino\n   </em>\n   , the Majority's holding that \"a supervised release term tolls while a defendant is of fugitive status\" is wrong.

Far from confirming the fugitive tolling doctrine, in\n   <em>\n    Cole\n   </em>\n   we reasoned appropriately, and contrary to the Majority, that if tolling has not been provided for, it is not authorized: \"Congress has provided for an exception to this rule in only one situation: where the defendant is imprisoned for more than 30 days for another conviction ... the canon of\n   <em>\n    expressio unius est exclusio alterius\n   </em>\n   suggests that where Congress has explicitly allowed for tolling only when the defendant is imprisoned on another charge, it does not intend for district courts to toll supervised release under any other circumstance.\"\n   <em>\n    Cole\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3650683\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/567/110/\">\n    567 F.3d at 114-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The fact that tolling for fugitive status, as opposed to tolling for deportation, is a \"traditional principle,\" Maj. Op. at 256 (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v. Barinas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275493\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/865/99/#p106\">\n    865 F.3d 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 109 (2d Cir. 2017) ), makes it\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   , not less, likely that it would have been contemplated and incorporated by Congress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   While the Majority suggests that defendants would receive a windfall without a tolling provision, the opportunity to benefit from absconding is small. \"If an offender absconds before the expiration of his supervised release term, he will not do so with impunity.\"\n   <em>\n    Hernandez-Ferrer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222864\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/599/63/#p67\">\n    599 F.3d at 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As long as the Government issues a warrant before the expiration of the term of supervised release, it may extend the term of supervised release \"for any period reasonably necessary for the adjudication of matters arising before its expiration[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203583\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i). And because absconding from supervision is, on its own, grounds to revoke supervision, there is little excuse for the Government failing to issue a timely warrant in most circumstances. Although it is possible for an eleventh hour violation to go unpunished, such a circumstance is rare \"given the ease with which the statute can be satisfied,\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Janvier\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222418\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/599/264/#p268\">\n    599 F.3d 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 268 (2d Cir. 2010), and such is the nature of jurisdictional statutes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dolan v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641976,12454866\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/605/\">\n    560 U.S. 605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 610,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641976,12454866\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/605/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641976,12454866\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/605/\">\n    177 L.Ed.2d 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) (describing the prohibition of a jurisdictional statute as \"absolute\"). And in such a\n   case, the only disadvantage to the Government occasioned by adhering to \u00a7 3583(i) is that the new warrant must stand on its own,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , it is a warrant for a violation of law, not a violation of supervised release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The ease and clarity of the current regime of a defined term of supervised release only makes the decision to permit tolling for fugitivity more troubling, especially considering the difficulties associated with defining a \"fugitive\" in the supervised release context. Contrary to the Majority's assertion, Maj. Op. at 256, n.4, in the Ninth Circuit, district courts have extended the deadline of supervised release for \"merely [ ] failing to comply with the terms of supervised release.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ertell\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 1:11-cr-00278-SAB\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207491630\">\n    2016 WL 7491630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *3 (E.D. Cal. December 29, 2016) (quoting\n   <em>\n    U.S. v. Murguia-Oliveros\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8936004\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/421/951/#p954\">\n    421 F.3d 951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 953 (9th Cir. 2005) ). As a result, the clock may stop and start again when, for example, a supervisee fails to immediately notify his supervisor of a change in address, but does so a week later, fails to show up for a drug test, but calls his supervisor two hours after the missed appointment, and misses a required Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, but shows up to the meeting the following week. The best answer to these complex factual questions is found in the certainty of the text of the statute: \"as long as a warrant or summons issues before the expiration of the term, an offender who remains a fugitive will still be subject to the court's jurisdiction once located, and his conduct while a fugitive will be considered at sentencing.\"\n   <em>\n    Hernandez-Ferrer\n   </em>\n   , 599 F.3d at 69. Instead, the Majority's judicially created exception to \u00a7 3583(i) transforms a \"minimal burden,\"\n   <em>\n    Merlino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4184110\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/785/79/#p86\">\n    785 F.3d at 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , on the Government into an onerous task for the courts, and a complicated regime for the supervisee in attempting to determine the applicable period of tolling, and thus, when his term of supervised release ends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The First Circuit correctly noted that, \"[i]n the end, this dispute boils down to a matter of statutory construction.\"\n   <em>\n    Hernandez-Ferrer\n   </em>\n   , 599 F.3d at 66. Congress chose not to toll when a person absconds from supervised release, and in the absence of clear congressional intent, the plain language of \u00a7 3583(i) should control. Moreover, requiring the Government to fulfill the minimal burden of issuing a warrant before the expiration date is preferable to creating a new amorphous exception to a strictly jurisdictional statute. Thus, I respectfully dissent and would vacate the sentencing order and remand to the District Court for further proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Section 3624(e) provides: \"A term of supervised release does not run during any period in which the person is imprisoned in connection with a conviction for a Federal, State, or local crime unless the imprisonment is for a period of less than 30 consecutive days.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203624\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (e).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Prior case law in the probation context lends further support to the conclusion that Congress intended \u00a7 3583(i) 's warrant requirement to govern the extension of a term of supervised release for fugitivity. In\n    <em>\n     United States v. Martin\n    </em>\n    , the Tenth Circuit addressed a defendant who absconded from federal supervision for three years, and determined that the period of supervision \"tolled from the time the New Jersey court\n    <em>\n     issued its violator warrant\n    </em>\n    until the time Martin was returned to federal supervision after release from the Colorado state prison.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1556566\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/786/974/#p975\">\n     786 F.2d 974\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 975 (10th Cir. 1986) (emphasis added). Similarly, in\n    <em>\n     Nicholas v. United States\n    </em>\n    , the Ninth Circuit held \"the five-year probationary period prescribed by section 3651 was extended by operation of law by the amount of time within the five-year period during which a probationer, in violation of the terms of his probation,\n    <em>\n     and for whom an arrest warrant has issued\n    </em>\n    , has voluntarily absented himself from the jurisdiction.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1084305\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/527/1160/#p1162\">\n     527 F.2d 1160\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1162 (9th Cir. 1976) (emphasis added). In both cases, and just like under \u00a7 3583(i), the issuance of a valid warrant was a prerequisite to the court maintaining jurisdiction for an offender who absconded from supervision.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    I can only speculate as to what those proceedings might entail. There would remain the issue of whether the Court would re-sentence Island believing that it had jurisdiction over the violation contained in the June warrant based on the earlier September warrant issued for factually unrelated violations.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Maj. Op. at 251. I would conclude that it does not have jurisdiction.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Of course, the Court could then consider whether to sentence Island for the violations alleged in the September warrant. It is unclear whether the Court previously did so. The District Court found that Island had committed those violations but stated that it chose \"not ... to impose punishment[.]\" App. 69. It may have done so knowing it would impose punishment based on the later warrant.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
