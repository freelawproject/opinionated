This appeal concerns only the first definition and requires us to determine whether an entity that acquires debt for the \"purpose of ... collection\" but outsources the actual collection activity qualifies as a \"debt collector.\" The District Court held that it does, and we agree: an entity that otherwise meets the \"principal purpose\" definition cannot avoid the dictates of the FDCPA merely by hiring a third party to do its collecting. We therefore will affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Appellant Crown Asset Management (\"Crown\") is a purchaser of charged-off receivables, that is, accounts on which a consumer has stopped paying the debt owed. When Crown purchases an account, it determines if the debtor has filed for bankruptcy or is deceased. If neither is the case, Crown does not collect on the account itself; rather, it refers the charged-off receivable to a third-party servicer for collection or it hires a debt collection law firm to file a collection lawsuit on its behalf. Although Crown does not contact consumers directly, it principally derives revenue from liquidating the consumer debt it has acquired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In this case, Appellee Mary Barbato obtained a consumer credit card from GE Electric Capital Corporation and GE Money Bank (collectively \"GE\") in 2007. She made her last payment on the account in November 2010, leaving an outstanding balance. GE subsequently charged off that balance and, after a number of sales and assignments, Crown purchased Barbato's debt. Pursuant to its standing service agreement with collection agency Turning Point Capital, Inc. (\"Turning Point\"), Crown then referred that debt to Turning Point for collection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Crown's service agreement with Turning Point explained that Crown was seeking \"to procure certain collection services\" from Turning Point, and Turning Point was agreeing to \"undertake collection on each Account placed\" with it by Crown. App. 376. In addition, the agreement said that Crown had the \"sole and absolute discretion,\" App. 378, as to which accounts it would forward, that Crown's obligation to pay Turning Point was contingent upon Turning Point's success, and that Crown could establish settlement guidelines from which Turning Point would have to obtain permission in order to deviate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Pursuant to this agreement, Turning Point sent Barbato a collection letter in February 2013, identifying itself as a \"National Debt Collection Agency\" and Crown as its client. Turning Point also called Barbato and left her two voicemail messages. For its part, Crown did not have any direct communication with Barbato regarding her account, nor did it review or approve the letter sent to her by Turning Point. When Barbato filed for bankruptcy, however, Crown recalled Barbato's account from Turning Point and subsequently closed it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Several months later, after Turning Point was absorbed by Greystone Alliance, LLC (\"Greystone\"), Barbato filed a state court complaint against Greystone, alleging that it had violated the FDCPA. And after Greystone removed the action to federal court, Barbato filed an amended complaint in which she added Turning Point and Crown as defendants and alleged that each was a \"debt collector\" as defined by the FDCPA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Turning Point was served but never answered. Barbato eventually dismissed both Turning Point and Greystone from the action, leaving only Crown as a defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Barbato and Crown subsequently filed cross-motions for summary judgment on,\n   among other issues, the question whether Crown was a debt collector. Barbato did not argue that Crown satisfied the \"regularly collects\" definition, i.e., that it \"regularly collect[ed]\" debts \"owed or due another.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(6). Rather, she argued that Crown was a \"debt collector\" because: (1) it purchased debts when they were in default, which, under then-controlling precedent, was a prerequisite to being considered a \"debt collector\" as opposed to a \"creditor\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   -statuses we had deemed mutually exclusive under \u00a7 1692a(6),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    F.T.C. v. Check Inv'rs, Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5526333\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/502/159/#p171\">\n    502 F.3d 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 171 (3d Cir. 2007) -and (2) it satisfied the statute's \"principal purpose\" definition because the principal purpose of its business was the collection of those defaulted debts, even if it hired third-party debt collectors to do the collecting. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(6) ; App. 209-10 (citing\n   <em>\n    Pollice v. Nat'l Tax Funding, L.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11232111\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/225/379/#p403\">\n    225 F.3d 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 403-04 (3d Cir. 2000) ). Crown countered that, regardless of the default status of the debt, Barbato could not prove it fit the \"principal purpose\" definition because it took no collection action towards her and its principal purpose was not the collection of debt but, rather, its acquisition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Siding with Barbato on these issues, the District Court held that Crown was \"acting as [a] 'debt collector' \" because: (1) it acquired debts like Barbato's when they were in default and (2) the summary judgment record supported that Crown's \"principal purpose\" was the \"collection of 'any debts.' \"\n   <em>\n    Barbato v. Greystone All., LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:13-CV-2748,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201193731\">\n    2017 WL 1193731\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 (M.D. Pa. Mar. 30, 2017). As to the second ground, the Court found little difference between collecting on charged-off receivables and referring charged-off receivables to third-party independent servicers for collection. Instead, given that Crown purchased debt, that ninety to ninety-five percent of that debt came from consumers, and that Crown referred all of that debt out for collection, the District Court concluded that \"Crown's principal purpose is to acquire accounts in 'default' for the purpose of collection.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201193731\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The District Court nevertheless denied Barbato's motion for summary judgment, holding that she had not established that Crown was vicariously liable for Turning Point's conduct because (1) in the District Court's view, vicarious liability could be imputed to Crown in these circumstances only if the agent too was a \"debt collector,\" and (2) the evidence in the record was insufficient to hold that Turning Point was a debt collector under the FDCPA. The Court granted the parties leave to file renewed motions for summary judgment to address Turning Point's status as a debt collector.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   While these proceedings continued in the District Court, however, the Supreme Court issued a decision that prompted Crown to seek reconsideration of the District Court's ruling that it was a \"debt collector.\" In\n   <em>\n    Henson v. Santander, Consumer USA Inc.\n   </em>\n   , in interpreting the \"regularly collects\" definition and deciding whether the entity there \"regularly collect[ed] ... debts owed or due another,\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(6), the Supreme Court held that it was irrelevant whether the debt acquired and sought to be collected was in default; instead, it held \"[a]ll that matters is whether the target of the lawsuit regularly seeks to collect debts for its own account or does so for 'another,' \" --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604742\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1718/#p1721\">\n    137 S.Ct. 1718\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1721, 1724,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604742\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1718/#p1721\">\n    198 L.Ed.2d 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). Construing that language to apply to \u00a7 1692a(6) generally, Crown urged that it could no longer be considered a debt collector, even under the \"principal purpose\" definition, because it\n   too was collecting debts on its own behalf and not for another. The District Court disagreed, holding that\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   pertained only to the \"regularly collects\" definition of \"debt collector\" and did not affect its holding that Crown was a debt collector under the \"principal purpose\" definition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barbato v. Greystone All., LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. CV 3:13-2748,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205496047\">\n    2017 WL 5496047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1, *9-*10 (M.D. Pa. Nov. 16, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Nevertheless, the District Court certified its decision for interlocutory appeal and presented a controlling question of law to this Court: \"whether\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   requires a finding that Crown is not a debt collector in this case when it was a third-party buyer of the debt, and the debt was in default at the time it purchased it.\" App. 34. Crown then filed a petition for permission to file the interlocutory appeal and to appeal the District Court's denial of its motion for reconsideration, which we granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On appeal, Crown contends that it does not qualify as a \"debt collector\" under the \"principal purpose\" definition for three reasons: First, the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   undermined our prior precedent that would render it a debt collector. Second, its principal purpose is the acquisition-not the collection-of debt, and a faithful interpretation of the statute requires that we distinguish between the two. And third, the legislative history demonstrates that Congress intended to regulate the proverbial \"repo man,\" not a \"passive debt owner\" like Crown. Appellant Br. 32. We begin with a brief overview of the FDCPA and, with that context for Crown's arguments, address-and reject-each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The FDCPA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Congress enacted the FDCPA in 1977 \"to eliminate abusive debt collection practices by debt collectors\" and \"to insure that those debt collectors who refrain from using abusive debt collection practices are not competitively disadvantaged.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201692\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e).

The only element at issue in this case is the second-whether Crown qualifies as a \"debt collector.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As noted, the statute defines \"debt collector\" as any person (1) \"who uses any instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails in any business the principal purpose of which is the collection of any debts\" (the \"principal purpose\" definition), or (2) \"who regularly collects or attempts to collect, directly or indirectly, debts owed or due or asserted to be owed or due another\" (the \"regularly collects\" definition).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(6).

Until\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   , as we explained, we relied on the \"default\" test to determine whether an entity was a creditor or a debt collector: either the entity obtained the debt before default and was a creditor or it acquired the debt afterwards and was a debt collector.\n   <em>\n    Tepper\n   </em>\n   , 898 F.3d at 366-67.

True,\n   <em>\n    Pollice\n   </em>\n   predated\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   , but for the reasons we explain below, we continue to find its logic persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Statutory Interpretation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   To determine whether Crown is a \"debt collector\" under the \"principal purpose\" definition, we look first to the plain meaning of the statutory text.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    S.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3700850\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/729/248/#p257\">\n    729 F.3d 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 257 (3d Cir. 2013). The text states that \"any person who uses any instrumentality of interstate commerce or the mails in any business the principal purpose of which is the collection of any debts\" is a \"debt collector.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(6). Focusing on the word \"collection,\" which it defines as \"the act or process of collecting,\" Crown argues that the \"principal purpose\" definition applies only to those that engage in \"overt acts of collection\" by interacting with consumers-not entities like Crown that purchase debt and outsource the collection. Appellant Br. 25, 31, 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As much as Crown might wish that it were otherwise, nothing suggests that the definition is so limited. An entity qualifies under the definition if the \"principal purpose\" of its \"business\" is the \"collection of any debts.\" \"Principal\" is defined as \"most important, consequential, or influential,\"\n   <em>\n    Principal\n   </em>\n   , Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1802 (1976) (\"Webster's Third\"), and \"purpose\" is defined as \"something that one sets before himself as an object to be attained : an end or aim\" and \"an object, effect, or result aimed at, intended, or attained,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1847. Thus, an entity that has the \"collection of any debts\" as its \"most important\" \"aim\" is a debt collector under this definition. While it is true that \"collection\" can be defined as \"the act or process of collecting,\" it can also be defined as \"that which is collected.\"\n   <em>\n    Collection\n   </em>\n   , Random House Dictionary of the English Language 290 (1973). So defined, the focus shifts from the\n   <em>\n    act\n   </em>\n   of collecting to\n   <em>\n    what\n   </em>\n   is collected, namely, the acquired debts. As long as a business's\n   <em>\n    raison d'\u00eatre\n   </em>\n   is obtaining payment on the debts that it acquires, it is a debt collector. Who actually obtains the payment or how they do so is of no moment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The statutory context of the \"principal purpose\" definition casts further doubt on Crown's argument that Congress meant to limit it to only those entities that actively collect from consumers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allen ex rel. Martin v. LaSalle Bank, N.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079180\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/629/364/#p367\">\n    629 F.3d 364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 367 (3d Cir. 2011) (\"If the plain language fails to express Congress' intent unequivocally ... we will examine the surrounding words and provisions in their context.\") (citing\n   <em>\n    Tavarez v.

In contrast to the \"regularly collects\" definition, where Congress explicitly used the verb \"to collect\" in describing the actions of those it intended the definition to cover, in the \"principal purpose\" definition, Congress used the noun \"collection\" and did not specify who must do the collecting or to whom the debt must be owed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(6) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tepper\n   </em>\n   , 898 F.3d at 370. Thus, by its terms, the \"principal purpose\" definition sweeps more\n   broadly than the \"regularly collects\" definition, and we must presume that the \"legislature says ... what it means and means ... what it says.\"\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604742\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1718/#p1721\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Dodd v.

This is especially problematic, Crown contends, because the \"regularly collects\" definition does specify that an entity can collect \"directly or indirectly,\" while Congress omitted this qualifier from the \"principal purpose\" definition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We are unpersuaded. Again, the fact that the \"regularly collects\" definition employs a verb and the \"principal purpose\" definition employs a noun is critical. In the \"regularly collects\" definition, the \"directly or indirectly\" qualification is necessary because one could reasonably interpret \"collect\" to refer to only direct efforts to collect-it is, after all, \"a verb that requires action.\" Appellant Reply Br. 15 (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The \"principal purpose\" definition, however, needs no such qualification. \"Collection\" by its very definition may be indirect, and that is the type of collection in which Crown engages: it buys consumer debt and hires debt collectors to collect on it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The existence of a middleman does not change the essential nature-the \"principal purpose\"-of Crown's business. As Barbato points out, Crown could buy debt for the charitable purpose of forgiving it, or it could buy debt for the purpose of reselling it to unrelated parties at a profit. In both of those cases, the entity's \"principal purpose\" would not be collection. But Crown does neither of those things. Indeed, the record reflects that Crown's only business is the purchasing of debts for the purpose of collecting on those debts, and, as Crown candidly acknowledged at oral argument, without the collection of those debts, Crown would cease to exist. In short, Crown falls squarely within \u00a7 1692a(6) 's \"principal purpose\" definition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Crown's Purpose and Legislative History Argument\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Finally, Crown argues that the legislative history of the FDCPA demonstrates that Congress did not intend for the statutory definition of \"debt collector\" to apply to a \"passive debt owner\" like itself but only to a repo man who was personally hounding debtors to hand over the money they owe. Appellant Br. 32. This argument is flawed in two respects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   First, it proves too much. There is no doubt that \"[d]isruptive dinnertime calls, downright deceit, and more besides drew Congress's eye to the debt collection industry.\"\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604742\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1718/#p1721\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1720\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But even if the purpose of the statute was to reach repo men, that purpose is furthered by recognizing Crown as a debt collector under \u00a7 1692a(6). Unlike a traditional creditor, such as a bank or a retail outlet\n   that has its own incentive to cultivate good will among its customers and for which debt collection is one of perhaps many parts of its business, an independent debt collector like Crown has only one need for consumers: for them to pay their debts. As market-based incentives go, that makes it far more like a repo man than a creditor and gives it every incentive to hire the most effective repo man to boot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Second, while the Supreme Court acknowledged in\n   <em>\n    Henson\n   </em>\n   that \"[e]veryone agrees that the term embraces the repo man,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604742\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1718/#p1721\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , the language on which Congress settled sweeps more broadly to include \"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   business the principal purpose of which is the collection of any debts,\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692a(6) (emphasis added), without regard to whether that entity delegates its collecting activities. The statute is clear, and Crown's argument fails for this reason as well: \"[R]ecourse to legislative history or underlying legislative intent is unnecessary when a statute's text is clear and does not lead to an absurd result.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Phila.

Excluded from the definition's reach are, among others, a creditor's officers and employees who collect debts for the creditor, an entity collecting a debt it originated, and an entity collecting a debt it obtained that was not in default at the time of purchase.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11232111\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/225/379/#p403\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7\u00a7 1692a(6)(A), (F).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    At both oral argument and in its supplemental briefing, Crown argued that the word \"collection\" is a verb. It is not. It is a noun.\n    <em>\n     See Collection\n    </em>\n    , Webster's Third at 444 (denoting with the abbreviation \"\n    <em>\n     n\n    </em>\n    \" that the word being defined is a noun).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Although not addressed by the District Court or the focus of the parties' arguments on appeal, Barbato has suggested that Crown itself collects debt because it is the named plaintiff in many collection lawsuits. Because Crown's litigation efforts did not give rise to this appeal and we conclude that Crown otherwise satisfies the \"principal purpose\" definition, we need not address this argument. We note, however, that Crown's answer to it-that its litigation efforts are irrelevant because its counsel, not Crown itself, does the collecting by, for example, drafting the pleadings-is in tension with our precedent,\n    <em>\n     e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Pollice\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11232111\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/225/379/#p403\">\n     225 F.3d at 404-05\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (recognizing that a debt collector may be held vicariously liable for the conduct of its attorneys), and squarely refuted by our holding today.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
