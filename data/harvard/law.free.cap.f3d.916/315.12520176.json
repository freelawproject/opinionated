In 2017, it was assessed a stormwater charge of $ 416,748.28 for that parcel. Much of Norfolk Southern's property is covered by railroad track and ballast. Ballast is the crushed stone surface beneath railroad tracks that stabilizes the tracks and drains stormwater away from them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Norfolk Southern claims that its ballasted property should be exempt from the charge.

On the one hand, the stormwater management charge applies to a broad class of property owners, suggesting that it is a tax. But on the other hand, it isn't assessed\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   on the basis of property ownership. Rather, the amount assessed is proportional to the amount of impervious surface on an owner's property. And property owners may receive credits against the assessment if they engage in certain stormwater management practices. These features suggest that the charge is a measure of the stormwater management obligations that each parcel imposes upon the City, rather than a measure of ability to pay. And this makes the charge more like a fee. These features also distinguish the stormwater management charge from the charge in\n   <em>\n    Valero\n   </em>\n   , which applied to all waste disposers regardless of their contribution to the burden that the charge was designed to address-closing underfunded landfills.

The\n   <em>\n    McLeod\n   </em>\n   court reached a similar result, noting that \"[s]torm water management was and is the type of service that is often funded through general tax revenue.\" 254 F.Supp.2d at 1347-48. The\n   <em>\n    Homewood Village\n   </em>\n   court, however, reached the opposite conclusion, noting that although all residents receive a benefit from stormwater management, \"those paying the charge receive a special benefit\" because the county treats polluted water on their properties, facilitating compliance with state and federal requirements. 132 F.Supp.3d at 1381 (citing\n   <em>\n    Homewood Vill., LLC v. Unified Gov't of Athens-Clarke County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3652920\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/292/514/\">\n    292 Ga. 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3652920\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/292/514/\">\n    739 S.E.2d 316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 318 (2013) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Norfolk Southern argues that Roanoke's stormwater management charge serves two purposes that both benefit the general public: reducing water pollution and improving flood control. It analogizes these purposes to maintaining the safety of the state's groundwater, which we held to be a public benefit in\n   <em>\n    Valero\n   </em>\n   . Defendants respond that they are obligated by law to operate a stormwater management system and to use all revenue generated from the charge for specific stormwater management activities. Thus, although the charge may benefit the public, its primary purpose is to satisfy regulatory requirements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Norfolk Southern's rejoinder is that the charge isn't regulatory in the sense recognized by\n   <em>\n    San Juan Cellular\n   </em>\n   because the City is a regulated entity, rather than a regulator. The railroad notes that the stormwater Utility doesn't directly regulate its activity or issue any permit for its stormwater discharges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We think the charge's purpose is more consistent with that of a fee than a tax, because the charge forms part of a comprehensive regulatory scheme. Although municipalities may have traditionally provided stormwater management as a public benefit at the discretion of their legislatures, the Clean Water Act's regulatory scheme now requires the City to take myriad concrete actions to reduce discharges and pollutant concentrations-many of them relating directly to runoff from Norfolk Southern's property and the waters\n   that receive it.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , J.A. 140-44, 169-80, 262, 284-86, 554-58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   What's more, if the City elects to assess a charge to offset the costs of complying with these regulatory obligations, it must do so consistent with the state authorizing statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2015.2-2114\">\n    Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 15.2-2114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This statute restricts the funds to specific uses related to stormwater management, and it requires that the charge incentivize stormwater management practices by crediting property owners who adopt them.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2015.2-2114\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 15.2-2114(D). These requirements have removed much of the legislative discretion that was traditionally associated with stormwater management. The City is now a participant in a comprehensive scheme regulating stormwater management and the assessment of charges to pay for it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Of course, the City doesn't directly regulate Norfolk Southern or other stormwater dischargers, nor does it issue permits for their discharges. Thus, rather than defraying the City's costs of regulating, the charge primarily defrays the City's costs of complying with regulations imposed upon it. At bottom, however, a classic regulatory fee is designed to address harmful impacts of otherwise permissible activities, and to ensure that the actors responsible for those impacts bear the costs of addressing them. That is exactly the function served by Roanoke's stormwater management charge, which ensures that owners of impervious surfaces bear the cost of managing stormwater runoff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In sum, the charge is part of a regulatory scheme, rooted in the Clean Water Act, whose purpose is to remedy the environmental harms associated with stormwater runoff and to hold stormwater dischargers responsible for footing the bill. EPA's regulations ensure that the harms of stormwater discharge are addressed, and the City levies a charge (as directed by the state) upon those whose activity creates the need for regulation. The charge also serves the regulatory function of incentivizing property owners to reduce the amount of impervious surface on their land and engage in stormwater management practices that qualify them for credits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As a result, the third\n   <em>\n    San Juan Cellular\n   </em>\n   factor suggests that the charge is a fee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Finally, we consider the three\n   <em>\n    San Juan Cellular\n   </em>\n   factors collectively, in light of all the relevant circumstances, to decide whether the City's stormwater management charge is a tax subject to the 4-R Act's requirements, or a fee beyond the reach of those requirements. As the district court acknowledged, this is a \"close question.\"\n   <em>\n    Norfolk S.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206599008\">\n    2017 WL 6599008\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8. The first factor suggests that the charge is a tax because it's imposed by the legislature. The second factor is largely inconclusive because the charge is levied upon most properties but based on contributions to stormwater runoff rather than ability to pay. The third factor suggests that the charge is a fee because it forms part of a comprehensive regulatory scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Applying the principle we articulated in\n   <em>\n    Valero\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11455856\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/205/130/#p133\">\n    205 F.3d at 134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we give the third factor controlling weight here because the charge's regulatory purpose provides a better indication of its overall nature than the body that implemented it or the class of persons it is levied upon.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Club Ass'n of W.

All share a common goal and corresponding common burdens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The response to the problem of stormwater runoff demonstrates the necessity of cooperation between all levels of government and private actors. Stormwater is of particular concern to environmental restoration: when it falls on impervious surfaces like streets or parking lots, it picks up pollutants like motor oil, animal waste, or just plain dirt, and washes them into the local streams. These pollutants contain chemical contaminants and the nutrients that feed algal blooms. They make their way through streams and tributaries, causing harm along the way, until they collect in the estuary where the rivers meet the ocean. William H. Funk, \"Virginia Artificial Wetland a Game-Changer for Stormwater Pollution,\" Chesapeake Bay Magazine (June 13, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The scheme that regulates stormwater runoff begins with the federal government which, through the Clean Water Act, mandates that states set water quality standards that any given river must meet.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201313\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the river does not meet the water quality standards, the state government steps in and works with the EPA to put the river on a \"pollution diet\" or Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201313\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The TMDL establishes the total amount of each pollutant that is allowed to drain into the river, and slowly reduces that amount to a level consistent with federally mandated water quality standards.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201313\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   One of the ways the state then implements the TMDL is by adjusting the permits it gives to entities within the river's watershed so that the total amount of pollution these entities are allowed to drain into the river is below the overall limit. Local governments must obtain one of these permits to manage the flow of stormwater from their sewer system into local waterways.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The City of Roanoke's stormwater clean-up scheme, which is governed by its permit, is what's at issue here. While not in the Bay's watershed, the Roanoke River is itself worthy of protection, and the City of Roanoke's program is a prime example of the type of stormwater remediation efforts that localities in the Bay's watershed must enact. A ruling for Norfolk Southern here would have deleterious implications for comparable municipal stormwater programs that are within the Bay's watershed like Richmond, Charlottesville, and Lynchburg. Richmond, Va., Code art. V., \u00a7 14-336 (2017); Lynchburg, Va., Code art. V., \u00a7 16.2-56 (2018); Charlottesville, Va. Code art. VI., \u00a7 10-104 (2018). And so while this case does not deal directly with the Chesapeake's waters, its health is very much at stake here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Under its permit, the City of Roanoke has the burden of reducing stormwater pollution, but it can only do this with the cooperation of its residents. In addition to maintaining its sewer infrastructure, the City coordinates with local \"watershed associations, environmental advisory committees, and other environmental organizations.\" J.A. 156. The City also helps its residents install features like rain gardens and detention ponds that soak up the stormwater rather than allowing it to drain immediately into the river. And, importantly, the City relies on its residents to help fund its stormwater clean-up efforts through the fee at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In seeking to avoid paying a fee that the City uses to fund its stormwater clean-up scheme, Norfolk Southern, one of the largest property owners in Roanoke, is seeking\n   to absolve itself of responsibility. Stormwater runs off the railroad's property into the City's sewer system. The City must then treat and manage this water to comply with its permit. This costs money. If the City could not charge a fee to Norfolk Southern, Roanoke would bear the burden of managing the railroad's runoff alone. Erroneously deeming this fee a tax under the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act would, as the railroad knows, run the decided risk of limiting its contribution to the broader project of stormwater management. The City would thus lose important revenue needed to offset the costs of building and maintaining municipal gutters and drains, monitoring pollution levels, policing illegal discharges of polluted water, and educating the public on proper environmental practices. Norfolk Southern would, in effect, be shifting its burden to the City. What we have here is the irony of a railroad seeking a free ride.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   This is unacceptable. As Judge Diaz aptly notes, \"the charge is part of a regulatory scheme, rooted in the Clean Water Act, whose purpose is to remedy the environmental harms associated with stormwater runoff and to hold stormwater dischargers responsible for footing the bill.\" Maj. Op. at 322. The arteries of the Chesapeake Bay wend through six states, including three in the Fourth Circuit (Maryland, West Virginia, and Virginia). Numerous localities in the Bay's watershed have clean-up schemes with fees comparable to Roanoke's. Norfolk Southern's position would put these projects at risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Our rivers and estuaries are complex, interconnected ecosystems. It follows, therefore, that efforts to restore them are correspondingly complex and interconnected. Without the cooperation of all levels of government, as well as of private companies and citizens, our waters will continue to be compromised by pollution. The restoration effort imposes burdens on many people; happily, the benefits of clean waters (economic; health; scenic; recreational) accrue to just as many if not more. Everyone, including the owners and employees of Norfolk Southern, are better off when our streams run clear and estuarine flora and fauna are flourishing. It is only fair to ask those who benefit to shoulder some of the burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   No one is so na\u00efve as to believe that the Chesapeake Bay can be restored to the pristine condition viewed by John Smith and William Byrd, or that the Roanoke River and its tributaries such as Peters Creek and Tinker Creek can be restored to the condition in which this country's earliest inhabitants found them. We would be fortunate to preserve a wholesome fraction of what once there was. This case is but a tiny chapter in the story of our nation's effort to reconcile the just demands of development with the imperative of preserving an environment that can help make productive enterprise worth having. A reversal here might seem just a small setback. But a series of such setbacks accelerates rather than retards the degradation of the natural world. We happily accepted the abundance that came down from our forebears.

Rather,\n   <em>\n    San Juan Cellular\n   </em>\n   highlighted three \"facts of th[e] case\"-which \"facts\" the Ninth Circuit later denominated as \"factors\"-because those facts indicated that the assessment at issue was \"close to the 'fee' end of the spectrum,\" \"with a paradigmatic tax at one end and a paradigmatic fee at the other.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519129\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/967/683/#p685\">\n    967 F.2d at 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It elevates the significance of enumerated factors, relative to non-enumerated factors. It suggests that the enumerated factors warrant equal significance in the ultimate weighing, notwithstanding that some facts may be more important than others. It also discourages courts from considering factors that are not enumerated in the test, but may be highly relevant in a particular case. And it serves as an invitation to lower courts to simply tick through the enumerated factors and determine whether more factors favor treating an assessment as a tax or a fee.

They do not apply a set of rigid rules or elements and then reach a mechanical conclusion\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In this case, we conclude that the first two factors have little or no bearing on our ultimate determination that the assessment at issue constitutes a fee. Additionally, the decisive third factor-which appears to be coextensive with the purpose of the entire three-factor inquiry-encompasses numerous considerations that bear significant weight in the ultimate determination-such as whether the funds are kept in a segregated fund and whether the assessment incentivizes decisions that advance the program's regulatory objectives-but which are not elevated to separate \"factors\" in the three-factor framework. Thus, though we characterize our analytical framework as a \"three factor test,\" the analysis adheres moreso to the governing \"totality-of-the-circumstances\" inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In sum, the three \"factors\" from\n   <em>\n    San Juan Cellular\n   </em>\n   provide helpful guidance in analyzing the fundamental question of whether an assessment serves revenue raising purposes, and therefore is a tax, or serves a regulatory purpose, and therefore is a fee.

The majority opinion engages in a thorough and persuasive analysis of numerous facts and circumstances bearing on that question and concludes the assessment is a fee. Accordingly, I concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
