Because the Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands has not yet interpreted the Virgin Islands Civil Rights Act (VICRA) or the Virgin Islands Discrimination in Employment Act (VIDEA) as to age discrimination, our task is \"to predict how the Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands would decide\" the issue.\n   <em>\n    Edwards v.

We agree with the District Court that the Virgin Islands Supreme Court is unlikely to hold that VIESA violated VICRA or VIDEA for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   First, we expect the Virgin Islands Supreme Court would try to harmonize the three statutes if at all possible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Virgin Islands Taxi Ass'n v. W. Indian Co., Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12451397\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vi/66/473/#p484\">\n    66 V.I. 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 484-85 (2017). The Court presumes that when the legislature enacts a new law, the law is intended to operate in harmony with existing statutes because it deems the legislature to have knowledge of existing law when it legislates.\n   <em>\n    Haynes v. Ottley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4345372\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vi/61/547/#p566\">\n    61 V.I. 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 566-67 (2014). So the Court strives to give effect to multiple statutes on the same subject \"unless doing so would be impossible.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4345372\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vi/61/547/#p566\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   There is no conflict among the three statutes if, as with federal law, they are read to mean that targeting years of service alone does not constitute age-based discrimination under VICRA or VIDEA. We do not suppose the Court would find that VIESA repealed parts of VICRA or VIDEA by implication, because such repeals are generally disfavored.\n   <em>\n    Simmonds v. People\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3589171\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vi/59/480/#p499\">\n    59 V.I. 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 499 (2013). And\n   invalidating the more recent and more specific Section 7(k) (for violating a statute already on the books when it was enacted) would run contrary to the Court's typical approach to statutory interpretation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Haynes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4345372\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/vi/61/547/#p566\">\n    61 V.I. at 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So harmonizing the statutes is not only possible, but practical as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Second, for the reasons discussed already regarding the federal claims, the Virgin Islands statutes' bar on discrimination \"because of age,\" 10 V.I.C. \u00a7 64(1)(a), is unlikely to apply to Section 7(k)'s distinction based on credited years of service. Beyond the distinction between age and years of service in\n   <em>\n    Hazen Paper\n   </em>\n   , by enacting VIESA, the Virgin Islands legislature was responding to a crisis that threatened the welfare of all of the Territory's residents, young and old. It therefore acted because of several reasons, none of them age.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   For these reasons, we perceive no error in the District Court's dismissal of Bryan and Thomas's territorial law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Although other reasonable measures could have also achieved the Government's cost-saving goals, we do not second-guess an employer's choice among reasonable, nondiscriminatory alternatives.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Karlo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277234\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/849/61/#p70\">\n    849 F.3d at 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Requiring that long-tenured employees who declined to retire contribute 3% more of their salaries to the pension system each year was reasonably related to maintaining the System's solvency and it did not discriminate based on age. We will thus affirm the District Court in all respects.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Rather than point to such evidence, Bryan and Thomas claim a former Government Director of Personnel's testimony in another case establishes cost savings could\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    have been a reason for the 3% contribution. Even if that were so, it does not follow that age\n    <em>\n     was\n    </em>\n    a but-for reason. But more importantly, it's not so. Using the increased contribution to encourage employees to retire from the Government payroll directly reduces costs as those retirees cease to draw Government salaries and begin to draw pensions from the System. Additionally, requiring employees who get more out of the System to pay more into the System contributes to its solvency. Although the contribution does not result in direct cost-savings for the Government because the System is a separate fisc, the 3% contribution does lower costs for that System-to which the Government must contribute directly to prevent insolvency. And it directly reduces payroll costs by increasing employee turnover.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    The Government does not also assert a \"bona fide employee benefit plan\" defense.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20623\">\n     29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (f)(2). Bryan and Thomas argue that Section 7(k) does not satisfy the \"equal benefit or equal cost rule\" of Section 623(f)(2)(B), but that is beside the point. That rule provides an exception to an affirmative defense the Government does not assert, not a standalone ground for liability.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Am. Ass'n of Retired Persons v. E.E.O.C.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3484235\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/489/558/#p561\">\n     489 F.3d 558\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 561-62 (3d Cir. 2007) (referring to the ADEA's equal benefit or equal cost\n    <em>\n     defense\n    </em>\n    ). So even assuming Section 7(k) \"violates\" the rule, it does not bear on the Government's liability here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
