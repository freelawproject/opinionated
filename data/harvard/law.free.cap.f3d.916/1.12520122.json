BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The plaintiffs are eighteen Palestinians who mostly reside in the disputed territory and a Palestinian village council. The defendants, all American citizens or entities, are eight high-net-worth individuals, thirteen tax-exempt entities, two banks, eight construction and support firms and a former United States deputy national security advisor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint alleges that the defendants engaged in a conspiracy to expel all non-Jews from the disputed territory. Specifically, the individual defendants (excluding Abrams) funneled millions of dollars through the defendant tax-exempt entities and banks to Israeli villages called \"settlements.\" Armed with this financial assistance, the settlement leaders hired full-time security coordinators who trained a militia of Israeli settlers to kill Palestinians and confiscate their property. The defendant construction and support firms destroyed property belonging to the plaintiff Palestinians and built settlements in its place and, here in the United States, the deputy national security advisor publicly endorsed the settlements. All defendants knew their conduct would result in the mass killings of Palestinians residing in the disputed territory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plaintiffs' complaint includes four claims: (1) each defendant, save four of the individual defendants as well as the banks\n   and construction and support firms, engaged in a civil conspiracy to rid the disputed territory of all Palestinians; (2) each defendant committed or sponsored genocide and other war crimes in violation of the law of nations; (3) seven individual defendants, the two banks, four construction and support firms and the former U.S. government official aided and abetted the commission of genocide and other war crimes; and (4) each of the banks and construction and support firms trespassed on the plaintiff Palestinians' property. All plaintiffs bring their claims under the Alien Tort Statute (\"ATS\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201350\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Forfeiture\n    <em>\n     Vel Non\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Before reviewing the district court's political question analysis, we address a preliminary issue. The defendants argue that the plaintiffs forfeited their challenge to the district court's political question holding by improperly incorporating their argument made at a preliminary stage of their appeal into their opening merits brief. The plaintiffs had initially moved for summary reversal, challenging in full in their supporting brief the district court's political question analysis. In their opening merits brief, the plaintiffs did not repeat their political question argument but instead incorporated it by reference-that is, they directed the court to refer to their brief in support of the earlier motion for summary reversal. The defendants claim the plaintiffs forfeited their political question argument by not making their supporting argument anew-and in full-in their opening merits brief. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A party forfeits an argument by failing to raise it in his opening brief.\n   <em>\n    Herron v. Fannie Mae\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276123\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/861/160/#p165\">\n    861 F.3d 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 165 (D.C. Cir. 2017). Mentioning an argument \"in the most skeletal way, leaving the court to do counsel's work, create the ossature for the argument, and put flesh on its bones\" is tantamount to failing to raise it.\n   <em>\n    Schneider v. Kissinger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3440903,8968279\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/412/190/\">\n    412 F.3d 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 200 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v. Zannino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10526539\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/895/1/#p17\">\n    895 F.2d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 17 (1st Cir. 1990) ). We ordinarily reject a party's attempt to evade this rule by incorporating by reference an argument made at an earlier stage of the litigation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gerlich v. DOJ\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3662404,3804407\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/711/161/\">\n    711 F.3d 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 173 (D.C.

PBGC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4235591,3718407\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/734/1161/\">\n    734 F.3d 1161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1167 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (incorporation by reference of argument made in district court insufficient);\n   <em>\n    Corson &amp; Gruman Co. v.

Cir. 1990) (incorporation by reference of argument made before agency insufficient). We do this for at least two reasons. First, incorporation by reference can be used to evade word limits.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gerlich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3662404,3804407\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/711/161/\">\n    711 F.3d at 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting appellants' incorporation explanation that \"appellee's counsel would not consent to an extension of the 14,000-word space limitation\");\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4235591,3718407\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/734/1161/\">\n    734 F.3d at 1167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting incorporation of argument made in district court on basis it \"would circumvent the court's rules ... regarding the length of briefs\"). Second, opponents may not have a fair chance to respond to arguments that are incorporated by reference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Corson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10526217,3479631\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/899/47/\">\n    899 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   50 n.4 (rejecting incorporation of argument made to agency \"to prevent 'sandbagging' of appellees ... and to provide opposing counsel the chance to respond\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In their opening merits brief, the plaintiffs \"ask[ed] this Court to reverse the lower court's ruling that the litigation cannot go forward because of the political question doctrine,\" maintaining that the \"issue ha[d] been thoroughly briefed ... in their memorandum in support of their summary reversal motion.\" Appellants' Br. 14. Although we would otherwise reject\n   this maneuver, here we find the plaintiffs' incorporation by reference unobjectionable. First, before merits briefing was due, we warned the parties that we \"look[ ] with extreme disfavor on repetitious submissions.\" April 12, 2018 Per Curiam Order. Although our order was aimed at the defendants, who were allowed to submit three briefs notwithstanding risk of repetition, it was reasonable for the plaintiffs to believe the warning applied equally to them. Further, the plaintiffs' opening brief was concise enough that they could have inserted their entire summary disposition brief into it without exceeding the word limit. In other words, they were not seeking to, and did not, evade the word limit. Moreover, the defendants' responding merits brief-in the main-defended the district court's political question holding. They therefore had a fair opportunity to respond to the plaintiffs' opposing political question arguments. In light of these considerations, we conclude that the plaintiffs have not forfeited their challenge to the district court's political question holding, the central issue on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Political Question Doctrine is Jurisdictional\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The district court treated the political question doctrine as jurisdictional and therefore dismissed the complaint pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) before considering whether dismissal for failure to state a claim was appropriate under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). \" 'Jurisdiction is power to declare the law, and when it ceases to exist, the only function remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause.' \"\n   <em>\n    Steel Co. v.

The defendants believe this case presents two additional political questions: (6) Do the equities favor Israelis or Palestinians in the West Bank? and (7) Is the root cause of violence in the disputed territory the Palestinian landowners or the Israeli settlers?

The elements of civil conspiracy are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (1) an agreement between two or more persons; (2) to participate in an unlawful act, or a lawful act in an unlawful manner; (3) an injury caused by an unlawful overt act performed by one of the parties to the agreement; (4) which overt act was done pursuant to and in furtherance of the common scheme.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Halberstam v.

Cir. 1983). Count I charges as the requisite \"unlawful acts\" genocide and theft and destruction of private property. To determine whether Israeli settlers committed genocide, we must answer only one of the seven political questions identified by the district court and the defendants-Question #4 (Do the Israeli settlers' actions in the disputed territory constitute genocide and ethnic cleansing?). And to determine whether Israeli settlers engaged in theft and destruction of private property, we must answer only Question #2 (What are the rights of private landowners in the disputed territory?).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In Count II, the plaintiffs allege that the defendants committed war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide in violation of the law of nations. Specifically, they allege the defendants committed \"murder, ill treatment of a civilian population in occupied territory, pillage, destruction of private property, and persecution based upon religious or racial grounds.\" And in Count III, the plaintiffs allege that the\n   defendants aided and abetted the crimes alleged in Count II. Counts II and III therefore require the court to determine whether Israeli settlers committed murder, pillage, destruction of private property, persecution based upon religious or racial grounds or ill-treatment of a civilian population in occupied territory. To determine whether Palestinians constitute a \"civilian population in occupied territory,\" the court must answer only Question #1 (What are the limits of state sovereignty in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem?). To determine whether the Israeli settlers pillaged or destroyed private property, the court must answer only Question #2 (What are the rights of private landowners in the disputed territory?). And to determine whether Israeli settlers murdered or persecuted Palestinians based upon religious or racial grounds, the court must answer only Question #4 (Do the actions of Israeli settlers in the disputed territory constitute genocide and ethnic cleansing?). Finally, Count IV alleges that the defendants committed aggravated and ongoing trespass. To resolve Count IV, the court must answer only Question #2 (What are the rights of private landowners in the disputed territory?).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Thus, only three of the seven purported political questions identified by the district court or the defendants are questions-political or otherwise-potentially presented by this case. Of the three, two (Questions #1 and #2) can be reduced to a single question:\n   <em>\n    who has sovereignty over the disputed territory\n   </em>\n   ? The other (Question #4) can be restated as:\n   <em>\n    are Israeli settlers committing genocide\n   </em>\n   ? A close reading of the two-hundred-page complaint confirms that these are the only two potential political questions raised by the plaintiffs' claims.

Here, the Department of Justice expressed its opinion that judicial resolution of the plaintiffs' complaint could create an inter-branch conflict because, \"[g]iven the level of political and military support provided Israel by the American government, a judicial finding that the Israeli armed forces had committed the alleged offenses would 'implicitly condemn American foreign policy by suggesting that the [government's] support of Israel is wrongful.' \" Gov't Appellee's Br. 16.

A legal determination that Israeli settlers commit genocide in the disputed territory would not decide the ownership of the disputed territory and thus would not directly contradict any foreign policy choice.

Indeed, the court could rule in the plaintiffs' favor on at least Counts I, II and\n   III, without touching the sovereignty question, if it concluded that Israeli settlers are committing genocide. Although the court might have to make a sovereignty determination in order to resolve some of the property-based allegations in Count IV, that might not be true for every allegation.
