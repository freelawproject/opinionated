Whether tribal officers violated the civil rights of a non-Indian traveling on the reservation unquestionably has a direct effect on the political integrity and welfare of the Tribe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In this case, the federal court has jurisdiction but whether Stanko has a federal cause of action is highly questionable. Though there is no case pending in tribal court, \"the reasons for exhaustion cited in\n   <em>\n    National Farmers Union\n   </em>\n   -- the policy of supporting tribal self-government, the advantages of allowing a full record to be developed in tribal court, and the benefit of receiving the tribal court's expertise on these issues of tribal sovereignty -- apply whether or not the dispute is already pending in tribal court.\"\n   <em>\n    Duncan Energy Co. v.

Moreover, there is an important additional reason to exhaust tribal court remedies in this case. As we have explained, Stanko has no damage claim under ICRA in federal court. However, \"[t]ribal forums are available to vindicate rights created by the ICRA, and \u00a7 1302 has the substantial and intended effect of changing the law which these forums are obliged to apply.\"\n   <em>\n    Santa Clara\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490382\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/49/#p58\">\n    436 U.S. at 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490382\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/49/#p58\">\n    98 S.Ct. 1670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, tribal court resolution of a tribal law claim under ICRA might well moot or otherwise affect Stanko's assertion of a direct federal claim for violation of his federal constitutional rights. Though this antecedent issue is a question of tribal law rather than state law, the circumstances warrant application of what is called\n   <em>\n    Pullman\n   </em>\n   abstention -- \"federal courts should abstain from decision when difficult and unsettled questions of state law must be resolved before a substantial federal constitutional question can be decided.\"\n   <em>\n    Hawaii Hous.
