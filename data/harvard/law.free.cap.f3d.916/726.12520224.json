Before trial, the district court granted Rodriguez's motion to suppress, finding the encounter with law enforcement was not consensual at its inception\n   and did not become consensual at any time before Rodriguez's arrest. Because we find the evidence in the record establishes Rodriguez's encounter with law enforcement was consensual and Rodriguez consented to the pat-down search, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 13, 2017, at approximately 1:18 a.m., Officer Brandon Condon, a West Des Moines, Iowa, police officer, arrived at an apartment complex after receiving a citizen's report of suspicious activity involving \"two black males walking around.\" While driving through the parking areas of the complex, Officer Condon saw Rodriguez and Rodriguez's friend, M.A. Rodriguez, who is Hispanic, was in high school at the time. M.A. is a juvenile black male. M.A. testified that in April 2018, he had recently turned 17 years old and will graduate from high school in 2020. M.A. and Rodriguez attend the same high school. The parties presented no direct evidence of Rodriguez's age prior to the time the court entered its suppression order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   M.A. testified that Officer Condon parked his patrol car along the curb, approximately 15 to 20 feet behind Rodriguez and M.A., who were walking from M.A.'s apartment and heading toward Rodriguez's apartment. M.A. identified the vehicle as a police car. Officer Condon exited his vehicle and approached Rodriguez and M.A. Officer Condon called their attention by saying something to the effect of \"Hey, guys.\" M.A. interpreted Officer Condon's words as a request to speak with them. He testified he was unsure if he was free to walk away from the officer at that point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Once Officer Condon, Rodriguez, and M.A. were in close proximity, Officer Condon asked them either what was going on or why they were out so late and also requested their names. Rodriguez and M.A. provided their names. Officer Condon communicated their names back to the department. M.A. testified he believed the officer appeared because of a report made by a neighbor. Rodriguez and M.A. told the officer they were walking to Rodriguez's apartment for a sleep over. The officer learned where Rodriguez and M.A. went to school and they talked about the sports teams Rodriguez and M.A. were on. M.A. testified that Officer Condon was generally \"friendly\" and was not \"overaggressive.\" After the small talk, Officer Condon offered to give Rodriguez and M.A. a ride to Rodriguez's apartment. Both Rodriguez and M.A. accepted Officer Condon's offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Before allowing Rodriguez and M.A. in his patrol car, Officer Condon advised Rodriguez and M.A. that he would have to pat them down for his safety. Neither Rodriguez nor M.A. protested the pat-down. M.A. testified that Officer Condon told them to lift their arms. Officer Condon testified Rodriguez lifted his arms without being asked to do so. Officer Condon noticed that Rodriguez moved his arms but was not moving his feet very far apart to facilitate the pat-down of his lower body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Officer Condon directed Rodriguez to spread his legs once or twice. After Rodriguez complied, Officer Condon discovered an item concealed in the groin area of Rodriguez's pants. Upon feeling the item, Rodriguez admitted it was a gun. Officer Condon retrieved the gun when it fell down Rodriguez's pant leg. He then immediately called for backup, ordered M.A. to get on the pavement, and handcuffed Rodriguez. M.A. was questioned and released. Rodriguez was taken into custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Rodriguez was charged with being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm and ammunition. He filed a motion to suppress all evidence pertaining to the firearm, asserting Officer Condon's contact with Rodriguez and M.A. constituted an unconstitutional seizure. The district court agreed and granted Rodriguez's suppression motion. The government filed this interlocutory appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Officer Condon was the only responding officer to the suspicious activity report and did not position himself in a way to restrict Rodriguez's or his friend's movement. Officer Condon did not draw his weapon, but rather called out to get the attention of Rodriguez and M.A. Rodriguez and M.A. met up with the officer. Officer Condon asked for their names, inquired about what they were doing outside given the early morning hours and in response to the suspicious activity report, and made small talk. When Rodriguez and M.A. explained they were walking to Rodriguez's apartment, Officer Condon investigated no further. M.A. confirmed the officer\n   was friendly to them. Under these circumstances, the encounter was consensual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The district court's extensive and virtually exclusive focus on Rodriguez's high school age was in error. \"The test for whether a person has been 'seized' within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment is an 'objective standard.' \"\n   <em>\n    Grant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5864972\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/780/#p784\">\n    696 F.3d at 784\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Michigan v.

Rodriguez neither verbally nor nonverbally protested the requested pat-down. M.A. testified he thought they responded to Officer Condon's request by saying \"yeah.\" Rodriguez willingly lifted his arms to permit Officer Condon to perform the pat-down. He did not entirely resist Officer Condon's requests to move his feet further apart. Rodriguez never indicated, verbally or nonverbally, a desire to walk away from Officer Condon. Rodriguez presented no evidence demonstrating his consent to the pat-down was coerced or made under duress. The record establishes that the pat-down search was an objectively reasonable measure to protect officer safety.
