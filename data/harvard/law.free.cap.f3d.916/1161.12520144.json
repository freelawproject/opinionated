J.B. is an attorney who accepts appointments from the California Supreme Court to represent indigent criminal defendants in capital cases. On July 25, 2013, J.B. and P.B. received a letter in the mail from the IRS, indicating that they had been \"selected at random for a compliance research examination.\" J.B. and P.B., who had already been selected for audits in 2008 and 2009, recognized that the 2011 audit was unlike the 2008 and 2009 audits. The 2011 audit was part of the IRS's National Research Program (NRP), which randomly selects taxpayers for exhaustive audits to help the IRS \"better understand tax compliance and improve the fairness of the tax system.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the NRP is so demanding\n   and so unpopular with taxpayers, Congress discontinued a prior iteration of the NRP, known as the Taxpayer Compliance Measurement Program, in 1988.\n   <em>\n    A Closer Look at the Size and Sources of the Tax Gap: Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Taxation and IRS Oversight of the Senate Comm. on Finance\n   </em>\n   , 109th Cong. 3 (2006) (statement of Mark J. Mazur, director of research, analysis, and statistics, IRS). The IRS reinstated the program under its current name in 1998. Internal Revenue Manual (hereinafter IRM) 4.22.1.1.1 (Sept. 6, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The IRS letter instructed J.B. and P.B. to contact a revenue agent at the IRS to discuss items on their 2011 tax return, as well as the \"examination process\" and \"[a]ny concerns or questions you may have.\" In the same mailing, the IRS enclosed a two-page notice entitled \"Your Rights as a Taxpayer.\" The IRS refers to this notice as \"Publication 1\" or \"The Taxpayer Bill of Rights.\" On the second page of the notice, under a heading entitled \"Potential Third Party Contacts,\" the notice warns:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Generally, the IRS will deal directly with you or your duly authorized representative. However, we sometimes talk with other persons if we need information that you have been unable to provide, or to verify information we have received. If we do contact other persons, such as a neighbor, bank, employer, or employees, we will generally need to tell them limited information, such as your name. ... Our need to contact other persons may continue as long as there is activity in your case. If we do contact other persons, you have a right to request a list of those contacted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Two months later, in September 2013, the IRS requested documents from J.B. and P.B. J.B. and P.B. asked the IRS to excuse them from the NRP audit because of J.B.'s poor health and the couples' advanced age. J.B. remitted doctor's declarations to the IRS showing that the NRP audit would worsen his hypertension and contribute to hypertensive retinopathy, a deteriorating eye condition, as well as his serious hearing loss. The IRS refused the couple's request for an exemption, leading J.B. and P.B. to file a separate suit to stop the audit in the Northern District of California in May 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   No. CV 15-2138 (YGR) (N.D. Cal.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Even after J.B. and P.B. filed suit, however, the IRS marched forward with its NRP audit. In September 2015, the IRS issued a summons to the California Supreme Court seeking \"copies of billing statements, invoices, or other documents ... that resulted in payment to\" J.B. for the 2011 calendar year.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The second page of the four-page summons warned that the IRS had the power to \"enforce obedience to the requirements of the summons and to punish such person for his default or disobedience.\" The penalties for noncompliance included a fine of \"not more than $1,000\" or imprisonment \"not more than 1 year, or both, together with costs of prosecution.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   J.B. and P.B. did not learn that the IRS had issued the summons until after-the-fact, when J.B. and P.B.'s daughter, whom they had listed as a personal representative,\n   received a notice of service of summons in the mail.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In October 2015, the couple filed a timely petition to quash the summons in the Northern District of California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The district court evaluated J.B. and P.B.'s petition under\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The IRS, it concluded, had not provided sufficient notice to J.B. and P.B. that it would contact the California Supreme Court, in violation of I.R.C. \u00a7 7602(c)(1) 's requirement that the IRS provide \"reasonable notice in advance\" to the taxpayer. The district court rejected the IRS's argument that IRS Publication 1 provided sufficient advance notice, and instead concluded that \"the advance notice procedure cannot be satisfied by the transmission of a publication about the audit process generally.\" It then instructed that \"advance notice should be specific to a particular third party,\" reasoning that \"the implementing regulations contemplate notice for each contact, not a generic publication's reference that the IRS may talk to third parties throughout the course of an investigation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Because the district court's decision conflicts with the decisions of other district courts in our Circuit,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estate of Chaiken\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%208255575\">\n    2016 WL 8255575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6, we must clarify I.R.C. \u00a7 7602(c)(1) 's notice requirement for the Circuit.

While \u00a7 7609 gives the taxpayer an opportunity to quash the summons in a federal district court, \u00a7 7602(c)(1), in comparison, protects the taxpayer's reputational interest. It gives the taxpayer a meaningful opportunity to resolve issues and volunteer information before the IRS seeks information from third parties, which would be unnecessary if the relevant information is provided by the taxpayer himself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S.

I.R.C. \u00a7 7602(c)(3) waives the advance notice requirement if (a) the taxpayer already authorized the contact; (b) the Commissioner, with good cause, believes that notice may jeopardize the IRS's tax collection efforts or open a third party to reprisal; or (c) there is a pending criminal investigation against the taxpayer. I.R.C. \u00a7 7602(c)(3). These exceptions demonstrate that Congress intended \u00a7 7602(c)(1) 's advance notice requirement to give the taxpayer a meaningful opportunity to respond to the IRS's request; it is only if the taxpayer knows who the IRS plans to contact or the documents that the IRS plans to request that the taxpayer may authorize the contact, or more cynically, impede the contact by jeopardizing tax collection efforts, retaliating against third parties, or interfering in a pending criminal investigation. Publication 1, alone, does not offer this level of specificity. It simply tells the taxpayer that the IRS may \"sometimes talk with other persons if we need information that you have been unable to provide ...\"; it does not reference specific documents or people, or even categories of documents or people.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   When the IRS uses Publication 1 as it was used here, mailed with an introductory letter and divorced from any specific request for documents, we do not think it reasonable for the IRS to fear that a person who received the publication would have enough information to spoil a criminal investigation or retaliate against a potential third-party source.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The IRS counters that I.R.C. \u00a7 7602(c)(1) cannot require the IRS to provide advance notice \"specific to a particular third party,\" as the district court held, because that would render superfluous the post-contact notice provision, \u00a7 7602(c)(2), which requires the IRS to provide the taxpayer with a \"record of persons contacted\" after the contact is made. This argument fails for two reasons. First, we do not require the IRS to provide the taxpayer with a list of the people it may contact in advance. Rather, we require what the statute requires: \"reasonable notice in advance.\" I.R.C. \u00a7 7602(c)(1). What is reasonable depends on the facts. Second, even if we required the IRS to provide the taxpayer with a list of people it may contact in advance, the IRS's argument nonetheless fails because the group of people covered by the advance notice provision, I.R.C. \u00a7 7602(c)(1), is larger than the group of people covered by the post-contact notice provision, I.R.C. \u00a7 7602(c)(2). The advance notice provision covers every third-party contact that the IRS \"may\" make, while the post-contact notice provision covers only \"persons contacted\" and excludes every third-party contact where the IRS sent a copy of the third-party summons to the taxpayer.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   I.R.C. \u00a7 7602(c)(1)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   I.R.C. \u00a7 7602(c)(2) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Treas.%20Reg.%20%C2%A7%20301.7602-2\">\n    Treas.

In J.B. and P.B.'s case, for example, the advance notice provision would have required the IRS to notify J.B. and P.B. before contacting the California Supreme Court. But, because J.B. and P.B. received a copy of the summons that the IRS ultimately sent to the California Supreme Court, the IRS would not need to include the California Supreme Court on a list of \"persons contacted\" if J.B. and P.B. later requested such a list from the IRS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Treas.%20Reg.%20%C2%A7%20301.7602-2\">\n    Treas.

In 1999, when it used Notice 1219, the IRM cautioned that \"providing the taxpayer with Notice 1219 alone does not constitute adequate notification of third-party contacts. It must be attached to another letter that contains the required information found in Letter 3164.\" IRM 4.10.1.6.12.2.1 (5) (May 14, 1999);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   IRM 13.1.10.2.3 (1) (August 21, 2000) (\"Under [ \u00a7 7602(c) ] you must provide taxpayers with prior notification that third parties may be contacted during the determination or collection of\n   <em>\n    that specific taxpayer's\n   </em>\n   federal tax liability.\" (emphasis added)).

The IRS sent J.B. and P.B. Publication 1 as part of its initial, introductory letter to the couple explaining that they had been selected for an audit; an audit the couple sought to stop. The Publication did not accompany a specific request for documents, nor is there any evidence that the IRS revisited the notice later in the audit when it knew that J.B. and P.B. had requested an exemption from the research audit and had not provided documents for the audit. More than two years elapsed between when the IRS sent Publication 1 to J.B. and P.B., and when the IRS subpoenaed the billing records and invoices from the California Supreme Court. We do not think that an agency that actually desired to inform a taxpayer of an impending third-party contact would consider Publication 1 adequate notice in these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Nothing about the audit required the government to move quickly. The IRS issued the summons to the California Supreme Court as part of its National Research Program audit, not an audit in the normal course. The research program is designed to help the IRS improve its tax collection system, but unlike an audit in the normal course where the subjects are selected because of red flags in their tax returns, the subjects of a research program audit are randomly selected, without any reason to believe that they are deficient on their taxes. The IRS had no reason to believe that J.B. and P.B. might evade its review, hide assets, or abscond. Nor was the California Supreme Court going anywhere soon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Indeed, with a research audit, where the taxpayer is offering information to help the United States in its tax collection efforts, the IRS has every reason to proceed cautiously,\n   ensuring that the taxpayer has adequate notice that the IRS may contact third parties and that the taxpayer's reputational interests are protected. The lack of urgency is further reflected in the IRS's willingness to wait two years between requesting the documents from J.B. and P.B. in September 2013 and issuing the summons to the California Supreme Court in September 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Moreover, the IRS should have known that it was requesting information from a particularly sensitive source. The IRS sent the summons to J.B.'s employer, not a remote third party like a bank or financial institution. A taxpayer's reputational interests is heightened when the IRS requests information from an employer, which knows the taxpayer intimately and upon which the taxpayer relies for decisions about hiring and firing, and promotion. And, the IRS did not just request this information from any employer. The IRS sought billing records and invoices for J.B.'s work representing capital defendants for the state government. The IRS should have known that these materials were potentially covered by the attorney-client privilege and other litigation-related privileges, and could have revealed J.B.'s litigation strategy representing persons on death row. Issuing the summons without specifically notifying J.B. and P.B. is rendered even more unnecessary because the billing records and invoices that the IRS requested are exactly the type of records that the IRS should have expected J.B. to have in his possession, and to have readily been able to provide once the dispute as to whether J.B. and P.B. should have remained in the research audit was resolved. In fact, federal law requires J.B. and P.B. to maintain exactly those records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   I.R.C. \u00a7 6001 (requiring taxpayers to maintain income records).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   We think there were several reasonable additional steps that the IRS could have taken to notify J.B. and P.B. before turning to the California Supreme Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276521\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/220/#p226\">\n    547 U.S. at 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276521\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/220/#p226\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The ongoing litigation between J.B. and P.B., and the IRS, meant that IRS lawyers had opportunities to notify the couple that, despite the litigation, it would begin contacting third parties to collect information that J.B. and P.B. continued to withhold. Another reasonable step would have been for the IRS to, once again, renew its request for documents, and tell J.B. and P.B. that, if the documents were not provided, it would begin reaching out to third parties. Because more than two years had elapsed between the date the IRS sent Publication 1 to the couple, and the date the IRS issued its summons to the California Supreme Court, it is not unreasonable to expect the IRS to renew its request for documents and to remind J.B. and P.B. that if they did not comply, the IRS would begin contacting third parties. Other reasonable notice measures, directed at the possibility that J.B. and P.B. did not understand or remember the third-party contacts notice in Publication 1, would have been to re-mail Publication 1, call the taxpayer, or issue a more tailored letter indicating that the IRS would begin contacting third parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   But, because the IRS took no additional steps to notify J.B. and P.B. that it would be sending a summons to the California Supreme Court, we affirm the district court's conclusion that issuing Publication 1 two years before the third-party contact did not satisfy I.R.C. \u00a7 7602(c)(1) 's \"reasonable notice in advance\" requirement in this instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The IRS must comply with its statutory obligation to provide reasonable notice in advance of contacting third parties. Courts are not in the position to prescribe the exact form of notice that is reasonable in\n   every circumstance. Under the circumstances here, however, reliance on Publication 1 was plainly unreasonable, and there are no doubt numerous other circumstances where the IRS needs to take further steps to provide the reasonable and meaningful notice Congress mandated. When the IRS seeks information from an employer of a party with whom it is currently in litigation and much of the information sought is covered by common law and state-recognized privileges, additional reasonable measures must be taken to provide meaningful notice and an opportunity to respond, in order to avert the potential third-party contact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The district court's order quashing the 2011 summons to the California Supreme Court is therefore\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    APPENDIX A\n   </strong>\n   --------\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Because Title 26 of the U.S. Code contains the entire Internal Revenue Code (I.R.C.), we refer interchangeably to Title 26 and the I.R.C.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    A version of Publication 1, updated September 2017, is publicly available at https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p1.pdf.
