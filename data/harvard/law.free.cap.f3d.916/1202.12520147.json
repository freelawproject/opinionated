The three plaintiffs filed a putative class action against the United States, the FBI, and two FBI officers in their official capacities (\"Government\" or \"Government Defendants\"), and against five FBI agents in their individual capacities (\"Agent Defendants\"). Alleging that the investigation involved unlawful searches and anti-Muslim discrimination, they pleaded eleven constitutional and statutory causes of action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Attorney General of the United States asserted the state secrets privilege with respect to three categories of evidence assertedly at issue in the case, and the Government moved to dismiss the discrimination claims pursuant to that privilege. The Government expressly did not move to dismiss the Fourth Amendment and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (\"FISA\") unlawful search claims based on the privilege. Both the Government and the Agent Defendants additionally moved to dismiss Plaintiffs' discrimination and unlawful search claims based on arguments other than the privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The district court dismissed all but one of Plaintiffs' claims on the basis of the state secrets privilege-including the Fourth Amendment claim, although the Government Defendants had not sought its dismissal on privilege grounds. The district court allowed only the FISA claim against the Agent Defendants to proceed. Plaintiffs appeal the dismissal of the majority of their claims, and the Agent Defendants appeal the denial of qualified immunity on the FISA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   We conclude that some of the claims dismissed on state secrets grounds should not have been dismissed outright. Instead, the district court should have reviewed any state secrets evidence necessary for a determination of whether the alleged surveillance was unlawful following the secrecy-protective procedure set forth in FISA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201806\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f). After addressing Defendants' other arguments for dismissing Plaintiffs' claims, we conclude that some of Plaintiffs' allegations state a claim while others do not. Accordingly, we remand to the district court for further proceedings on the substantively stated claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   At this stage in the litigation, we \"construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff[s], taking all [their] allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences from the complaint in [their] favor.\"\n   <em>\n    Doe v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8939644\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/419/1058/#p1062\">\n    419 F.3d 1058\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1062 (9th Cir. 2005). \"Conclusory allegations and unreasonable inferences, however, are insufficient to defeat a motion to dismiss.\"\n   <em>\n    Sanders v. Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2947550\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/504/903/#p910\">\n    504 F.3d 903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 910 (9th Cir. 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Plaintiffs are three Muslims who were residents of Southern California: Sheikh Yassir Fazaga, Ali Uddin Malik, and Yasser AbdelRahim. Fazaga was, at the times relevant to this litigation, an imam at the Orange County Islamic Foundation (\"OCIF\"), a mosque in Mission Viejo, California. Malik and AbdelRahim are practicing Muslims who regularly attended religious services at the Islamic Center of Irvine (\"ICOI\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The complaint sought relief against the United States, the FBI, and two federal officials named in their official capacities, as well as five individual Agent Defendants-Kevin Armstrong, Paul Allen, J. Stephen Tidwell, Barbara Walls, and Pat Rose-named in their individual capacities. Armstrong and Allen were FBI Special Agents assigned to the Orange County areas; Tidwell was the Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI's Los Angeles Field Office from August 2005 to December 2007; Walls was the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI's Santa Ana branch office, a satellite office of the FBI's Los Angeles field office; and Rose was a Special Agent assigned to the FBI's Santa Ana branch office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Because of the sensitivity of the issues in this case, we particularly stress the\n   usual admonition that accompanies judicial determination on motions to dismiss a complaint: the facts recited below come primarily from Plaintiffs' allegations in their complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The substance of those allegations has not been directly addressed by the defendants. At this point in the litigation, the truth or falsity of the allegations therefore is entirely unproven.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   For at least fourteen months in 2006 and 2007, the FBI paid a confidential informant named Craig Monteilh to gather information as part of a counterterrorism investigation known as Operation Flex. Plaintiffs allege that Operation Flex was a \"dragnet surveillance\" program, the \"central feature\" of which was to \"gather information on Muslims.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   At some point before July 2006, Stephen Tidwell, then the Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI's Los Angeles Field Office, authorized first the search for an informant and later the selection of Monteilh as that informant. Once selected, Monteilh was supervised by two FBI handlers, Special Agents Kevin Armstrong and Paul Allen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In July 2006, Monteilh began attending ICOI. As instructed by Allen and Armstrong, Monteilh requested a meeting with ICOI's imam, represented that he wanted to convert to Islam, and later publicly declared his embrace of Islam at a prayer service. Monteilh subsequently adopted the name Farouk al-Aziz and began visiting ICOI daily, attending prayers, classes, and special events. He also visited \"with some regularity\" several other large mosques in Orange County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Armstrong and Allen closely supervised Monteilh during the course of Operation Flex, explaining to him the parameters and goals of the investigation. Monteilh was \"to gather information on Muslims in general,\" using information-gathering and surveillance tactics. The agents provided him with the tools to do so, including audio and video recording devices. They also gave Monteilh general goals, such as obtaining contact information from a certain number of Muslims per day, as well as specific tasks, such as entering a certain house or having lunch with a particular person. Sometimes, Allen and Armstrong prepared photo arrays with hundreds of Muslim community members and asked Monteilh to arrange the photos from most to least dangerous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Armstrong and Allen did not, however, limit Monteilh to specific targets. Rather, \"they repeatedly made clear that they were interested simply in Muslims.\" Allen told Monteilh, \"We want to get as many files on this community as possible.\" To the extent Allen and Armstrong expressed an interest in certain targets, it was in particularly religious Muslims and persons who might influence young Muslims. When Monteilh's surveillance activities generated information on non-Muslims, the agents set that information aside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In accordance with his broad directive, Monteilh engaged with a wide variety of individuals. As instructed by his handlers, he attended classes at the mosque,\n   amassed information on Muslims' charitable giving, attended Muslim fundraising events, collected information on community members' travel plans, attended lectures by Muslim scholars, went to daily prayers, memorized certain verses from the Quran and recited them to others, encouraged people to visit \"jihadist\" websites, worked out with targeted people at a gym to get close to them, and sought to obtain compromising information that could be used to pressure others to become informants. He also collected the names of board members, imams, teachers, and other leadership figures at the mosques, as well as the license plate numbers of cars in the mosque parking lots during certain events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Virtually all of Monteilh's interactions with Muslims were recorded. Monteilh used audio and video recording devices provided to him by the agents, including a cellphone, two key fobs with audio recording capabilities, and a camera hidden in a button on his shirt. He recorded, for example, his interactions with Muslims in the mosques, which were transcribed and reviewed by FBI officials. He also recorded meetings and conversations in the mosque prayer hall to which he was not a party. He did so by leaving his possessions behind, including his recording key fob, as though he had forgotten them or was setting them down while doing other things. Monteilh told Allen and Armstrong in written reports that he was recording conversations in this manner. The agents never told him to stop this practice, and they repeatedly discussed with Monteilh the contents of the recordings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Armstrong and Allen occasionally instructed Monteilh to use his secret video camera for specific purposes, such as capturing the internal layout of mosques and homes. They also told Monteilh to obtain the contact information of people he met, and monitored his email and cellphone to obtain the email addresses and phone numbers of the people with whom he interacted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Although Monteilh spent the majority of his time at ICOI, he conducted surveillance and made audio recordings in at least seven other mosques during the investigation. During Monteilh's fourteen months as an informant for Operation Flex, the FBI obtained from him hundreds of phone numbers; thousands of email addresses; background information on hundreds of individuals; hundreds of hours of video recordings of the interiors of mosques, homes, businesses, and associations; and thousands of hours of audio recordings of conversations, public discussion groups, classes, and lectures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In addition to the surveillance undertaken directly by Monteilh, Allen and Armstrong told Monteilh that electronic surveillance equipment had been installed in at least eight mosques in the area, including ICOI. The electronic surveillance equipment installed at the Mission Viejo mosque was used to monitor Plaintiff Yassir Fazaga's conversations, including conversations held in his office and other parts of the mosque not open to the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   At the instruction of Allen and Armstrong, Monteilh took extensive handwritten notes each day about his activities and the surveillance he was undertaking. Allen and Armstrong met with Monteilh roughly twice each week to discuss his assignments, give him instructions, receive his daily notes, upload his recordings, and give him fresh devices. Monteilh was also required to call either Allen or Armstrong each day to apprise them of his activities. They told Monteilh that his daily notes were read by their supervisors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The operation began to unravel when, in early 2007, Allen and Armstrong instructed Monteilh to begin more pointedly asking questions about jihad and armed conflict and to indicate his willingness to\n   engage in violence. Implementing those instructions, Monteilh told several people that he believed it was his duty as a Muslim to take violent action and that he had access to weapons. Several ICOI members reported Monteilh to community leaders. One of the community leaders then called the FBI to report what Monteilh was saying, and instructed concerned ICOI members to call the Irvine Police Department, which they did. ICOI sought a restraining order against Monteilh, which was granted in June 2007.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Around the same time, Allen and Armstrong told Monteilh that Barbara Walls, then Assistant Special Agent in Charge of the FBI's Santa Ana office, no longer trusted him and wanted him to stop working for the FBI. In October 2007, Monteilh was told that his role in Operation Flex was over. At one of the final meetings between Monteilh and Agents Allen and Armstrong, Walls was present. She warned Monteilh not to tell anyone about the operation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Monteilh's identity as an informant was revealed in February 2009 in connection with a criminal prosecution for naturalization fraud of Ahmadullah (or Ahmed) Niazi, one of the ICOI members who had reported Monteilh's statements to the Irvine Police Department. FBI Special Agent Thomas Ropel testified at a bail hearing in Niazi's case that he had heard several recordings between Niazi and a confidential informant, and that the informant was the same person Niazi had reported to the police. Ropel's statements thus indicated that Monteilh was a confidential informant and that he had recorded numerous conversations for the FBI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Several sources subsequently confirmed that Monteilh worked for the FBI, including the FBI and Monteilh himself. Although the FBI has disclosed some information about Monteilh's actions as an informant, including that he created audio and video recordings and provided handwritten notes to the FBI, the FBI maintains that \"certain specific information\" concerning Operation Flex and Monteilh's activities must be protected in the interest of national security.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Plaintiffs filed the operative complaint in September 2011, asserting eleven causes of action, which fall into two categories: claims alleging unconstitutional searches (\"search claims\") and claims alleging unlawful discrimination on the basis of, or burdens on, or abridgement of the rights to, religion (\"religion claims\"). The religion claims allege violations of the First Amendment Religion Clauses, the equal protection guarantee of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Privacy Act, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (\"RFRA\"), the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (\"FISA\"), and the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Plaintiffs filed the complaint as a putative class action, with the class defined as \"[a]ll individuals targeted by Defendants for surveillance or information-gathering through Monteilh and Operation Flex, on account of their religion, and about whom the FBI thereby gathered personally identifiable information.\" The complaint sought injunctive relief for the individual Plaintiffs and the class, and damages for themselves as individuals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Agent Defendants\n   moved to dismiss the claims against them on various grounds, including qualified immunity. The Government moved to dismiss the amended complaint and for summary judgment, arguing that Plaintiffs' statutory and constitutional claims fail on various grounds unrelated to the state secrets privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Government also asserted that the religion claims, but not the search claims, should be dismissed under the\n   <em>\n    Reynolds\n   </em>\n   state secrets privilege,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Reynolds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"372534\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/345/1/\">\n    345 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"372534\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/345/1/\">\n    73 S.Ct. 528\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20L.%20Ed.%20727\">\n    97 L.Ed. 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1953), on the ground that litigation of the religion claims could not proceed without risking the disclosure of certain evidence protected by the privilege. The assertion of the state secrets privilege was supported with a previously filed public declaration from then-U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder; a public declaration from Mark Giuliano, then Assistant Director of the FBI's Counterterrorism Division; and two classified declarations and a classified supplemental memorandum from Giuliano. The Attorney General asserted the state secrets privilege over three categories of evidence: (1) \"[i]nformation that could tend to confirm or deny whether a particular individual was or was not the subject of an FBI counterterrorism investigation\"; (2) \"[i]nformation that could tend to reveal the initial reasons (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , predicate) for an FBI counterterrorism investigation of a particular person (including in Operation Flex), any information obtained during the course of such an investigation, and the status and results of the investigation\"; and (3) \"[i]nformation that could tend to reveal whether particular sources and methods were used in a counterterrorism investigation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In one order, the district court dismissed the FISA claim against the Government, brought under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201810\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , concluding that Congress did not waive sovereign immunity for damages actions under that statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Al-Haramain Islamic Found., Inc. v. Obama\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Al-Haramain II\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3660566,3660319\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/705/845/\">\n    705 F.3d 845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 850-55 (9th Cir. 2012). Plaintiffs do not challenge this dismissal. In the same order, the district court permitted Plaintiffs' FISA claim against the Agent Defendants to proceed, rejecting the argument that the Agent Defendants were entitled to qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In a second order, the district court dismissed all the other claims in the case on the basis of the\n   <em>\n    Reynolds\n   </em>\n   state secrets privilege-including the Fourth Amendment claim, for which the Government Defendants expressly did not seek dismissal on that ground. Relying \"heavily\" on the classified declarations and supplemental memorandum, the district court concluded \"that the subject matter of this action, Operation Flex, involves intelligence that, if disclosed, would significantly compromise national security.\" It held that the Government Defendants would need to rely on the privileged material to defend against Plaintiffs' claims, and that the privileged evidence was so inextricably tied up with nonprivileged material that \"the risk of disclosure that further litigation would engender [could not] be averted through protective orders or restrictions on testimony.\" The district court declined to use, as a substitute for dismissal, the\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   procedures set out in \u00a7 1806(f) of FISA, on the ground that FISA's procedures do not apply to non-FISA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Agent Defendants timely filed notices of appeal from the denial of qualified immunity on Plaintiffs' FISA claim. The\n   district court then approved the parties' stipulation to stay all further proceedings related to the remaining FISA claim pending resolution of the Agent Defendants' appeal and, at Plaintiffs' request, entered partial final judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), allowing immediate appeal of the majority of Plaintiffs' claims. The Plaintiffs' appeal and the Agent Defendants' appeal from the denial of qualified immunity on the FISA claim were consolidated and are both addressed in this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   We begin with the only claim to survive Defendants' motions to dismiss in the district court: the FISA claim against the Agent Defendants. After addressing the FISA claim, we turn to Plaintiffs' argument that in cases concerning the lawfulness of electronic surveillance, the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   procedures set out in \u00a7 1806(f) of FISA supplant the dismissal remedy otherwise mandated by the state secrets evidentiary privilege.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   Part II.

Specifically, the complaint details one occasion on which Allen and Armstrong asked Monteilh about something that had happened in AbdelRahim's house that Monteilh had not yet communicated to them, and explained that they knew about it because they had audio surveillance in the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege sufficient facts with regard to those two Agent Defendants in support of their allegation of electronic surveillance of Fazaga's office in the OCIF mosque in Mission Viejo: Allen and Armstrong told Monteilh that electronic surveillance was \"spread indiscriminately\" across \"at least eight area mosques including ICOI, and mosques in Tustin, Mission Viejo, Culver City, Lomita, West Covina, and Upland,\" and that \"they could get in a lot of trouble if people found out what surveillance they had in the mosques.\" They also instructed Monteilh to use a video camera hidden in a shirt button to record the interior of OCIF and \"get a sense of the schematics of the place-entrances, exits, rooms, bathrooms, locked doors, storage rooms, as well as security measures and whether any security guards were armed.\" Armstrong later told Monteilh that he and Allen used the information he recorded to enter OCIF.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   As to Tidwell, Walls, and Rose, however, the complaint does not plausibly allege their personal involvement with respect to the planted devices.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint details\n   Tidwell, Walls, and Rose's oversight of Monteilh, including that they read his daily notes and were apprised, through Allen and Armstrong, of the information he collected. But the complaint never alleges that\n   <em>\n    Monteilh\n   </em>\n   was involved in planting devices in AbdelRahim's house, car, or phone, or in Fazaga's office; those actions are attributed only to unnamed FBI agents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The complaint also offers general statements that Tidwell, Walls, and Rose supervised Allen and Armstrong.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   But \"[g]overnment officials may not be held liable for the unconstitutional conduct of their subordinates under a theory of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiffs have not done so as to this category of surveillance with regard to Tidwell, Walls, and Rose. The complaint does not allege that the supervisors knew of, much less ordered or arranged for, the planting of the recording devices in AbdelRahim's home or Fazaga's office, so the supervisors are entitled to qualified immunity as to that surveillance.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Chavez v.

As to all other categories of surveillance, the Agent Defendants either did not violate FISA; are entitled to qualified immunity on the FISA claim because Plaintiffs' reasonable expectation of privacy was not clearly established; or were not plausibly alleged in the complaint to have committed any FISA violation that may have occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The State Secrets Privilege and FISA Preemption\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Having addressed the only claim to survive Defendants' motions to dismiss in the district court, we turn to the district court's dismissal of the remaining claims pursuant to the state secrets privilege.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs argue that reversal is warranted \"on either of two narrower grounds.\" First, Plaintiffs argue that, at this preliminary stage, the district court erred in concluding that further litigation would require the disclosure of privileged information. Second, Plaintiffs maintain that the district court should have relied on FISA's alternative procedures for handling sensitive national security information. Because we agree with Plaintiffs' second argument, we do not decide the first. We therefore need not review the Government's state secrets claim to decide whether the standard for dismissal at this juncture-whether the district court properly \"determine[d] with certainty ... that litigation must be limited or cut off in order to protect state secrets, even before any discovery or evidentiary requests have been made,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <em>\n    Mohamed v.

The question is a fairly novel one. We are the first federal court of appeals to address it. Only two district courts, both in our circuit, have considered the issue. Those courts both held that FISA \"displace[s] federal common law rules such as the state secrets privilege with regard to matters within FISA's purview.\"\n   <em>\n    Jewel v. NSA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4049759\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/965/1090/#p1105\">\n    965 F.Supp.2d 1090\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1105-06 (N.D.

Cal. 2008). We rely on similar reasoning to that in those district court decisions, but reach a narrower holding as to the scope of FISA preemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Our analysis of this issue proceeds as follows. First, we offer a brief review of the state secrets privilege. Second, we discuss one reason why the district court should not have dismissed the search claims based on the privilege. Third, we explain why FISA displaces the dismissal remedy of the common law state secrets privilege as applied to electronic surveillance generally. Then we review the situations in which FISA's procedures under \u00a7 1806(f) apply, including affirmative constitutional challenges to electronic surveillance. Finally, we explain why the present case fits at least one of the situations in which FISA's procedures apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Before we go on, we emphasize that although we hold that Plaintiffs' electronic surveillance claims are not subject to outright dismissal at the pleading stage because FISA displaces the state secrets privilege, the FISA procedure is, not surprisingly, extremely protective of government secrecy. Under that procedure, Plaintiffs' religion claims will not go forward under the open and transparent processes to which litigants are normally entitled. Instead, in the interest of protecting national security, the stringent FISA procedures require severe curtailment of the usual protections afforded by the adversarial process and due process.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Yamada v.

Dismissing claims based on the privilege where the Government has expressly told the court it is not necessary to do so-and, in particular, invoking the privilege to dismiss, at the pleading stage, claims the Government has expressly told the court it need not dismiss on grounds of privilege-cuts directly against\n   <em>\n    Jeppesen\n   </em>\n   's call for careful, limited application of the privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Although the Government Defendants expressly did not request dismissal of the search claims under the state secrets privilege, the Agent Defendants did so request. In declining to seek dismissal of the search claims based on the state secrets privilege, the Government explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   At least at this stage of the proceedings, sufficient non-privileged evidence may be available to litigate these claims should they otherwise survive motions to dismiss on non-privilege grounds. The FBI has previously disclosed in a separate criminal proceeding that Monteilh collected audio and video information for the FBI, and some of that audio and video information was produced in that prior case. The FBI has been reviewing additional audio and video collected by Monteilh for possible disclosure in connection with further proceedings on the issue of whether the FBI instructed or permitted Monteilh to leave recording devices unattended in order to collect non-consenting communications. The FBI expects that the majority of the audio and video will be available in connection with further proceedings. Thus, while it remains possible that the need to protect properly privileged national security information might still foreclose litigation of these claims, at present the FBI and official capacity defendants do not seek to dismiss these claims based on the privilege assertion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   The Agent Defendants note that the Government focuses on the public disclosure of recordings collected by Monteilh, and point out that Plaintiffs also challenge surveillance conducted without Monteilh's involvement-namely, the planting of recording devices by FBI agents in Fazaga's office and AbdelRahim's home, car, and phone. Allegations concerning the planting of recording devices by FBI agents other than Monteilh, the Agent Defendants argue, are the \"sources and methods\" discussed in the Attorney General's invocation of the privilege. The Agent Defendants thus maintain that because the Government's reasons for not asserting the privilege over the search claims do not apply to all of the surveillance encompassed by the search claims, dismissal as to the search claims is in fact necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The Agent Defendants, however, are not uniquely subject to liability for the planted devices. The Fourth Amendment claim against the Government Defendants likewise applies to that category of surveillance.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   Part III.A. The Agent Defendants-officials sued in their individual capacities-are not the protectors of the state secrets evidence; the Government is. Accordingly, and because the Agent Defendants have not identified a reason they specifically require dismissal to protect against the harmful disclosure of state secrets where the Government does not, we decline to accept their argument that the Government's dismissal defense must be expanded beyond the religion claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   In short, in determining\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   that particular claims warrant dismissal under the state secrets privilege, the district court erred. For these reasons, we will not extend FISA's procedures to challenges to the lawfulness of electronic surveillance to the degree the Government agrees that such challenges may be litigated in accordance with ordinary adversarial procedures\n   without compromising national security.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

FISA prohibits, for example, electronic surveillance of a U.S. person \"solely upon the basis of activities protected by the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"242\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201805\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A). Here, Plaintiffs allege they were surveilled solely on account of their religion. If true, such surveillance was necessarily unauthorized by FISA, and \u00a7 1810 subjects any persons who intentionally engaged in such surveillance to civil liability.

Such a dismissal also would undermine the overarching goal of FISA more broadly-\"curb[ing] the practice by which the Executive Branch may conduct warrantless electronic surveillance on its own unilateral determination that national security justifies it.\" S. Rep. No. 95-604, pt. 1, at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   FISA's legislative history confirms that \u00a7 1806(f) 's procedures were designed to apply in both civil and criminal cases, and to both affirmative and defensive use of electronic surveillance evidence. The Senate bill initially provided a single procedure for criminal and civil cases, while the House bill at the outset specified two separate procedures for determining the legality of electronic surveillance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the end, the conference committee adopted a slightly modified version of the Senate bill, agreeing \"that an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   proceeding is appropriate for determining the lawfulness of electronic surveillance in both criminal and civil cases.\" H.R.

Under our rulings regarding the reach of the \u00a7 1806(f) procedures, almost all of the search-and-seizure allegations will be subject to those procedures. Thus, regardless of whether a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy is available, Plaintiffs' underlying claim-that the Agent Defendants engaged in unlawful electronic surveillance violative of the Fourth Amendment-would proceed in the same way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Moreover, if the Fourth Amendment\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claim proceeds, the Agent Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on Plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claim to the same extent they are entitled to qualified immunity on Plaintiffs' FISA claim. In both instances, the substantive law derives from the Fourth Amendment, and in both instances, government officials in their individual capacity are subject to liability for damages only if they violated a clearly established right to freedom from governmental intrusion where an individual has a reasonable expectation of privacy.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part I.B.

The Government does not challenge the First and Fifth Amendment claims substantively. It argues only that injunctive relief is unavailable and that litigating the claims is not possible without risking the disclosure of state secrets. We have already concluded that injunctive relief, including expungement, is available under the Constitution where there is a substantively viable challenge to government action,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Part III.A, and that dismissal because of the state secrets concern was improper because of the availability of the \u00a7 1806(f) procedures,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Part II.

Again, the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a, creates a set of rules governing how such records should be kept by federal agencies.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part III.A.

That determination will include, to the extent we have concluded that the complaint states a claim regarding each such provision, whether Defendants violated any of the constitutional and statutory provisions asserted by Plaintiffs in their complaint. As permitted by Congress, \"[i]n making this determination, the court may disclose to [plaintiffs], under appropriate security procedures and protective orders, portions of the application, order, or other materials relating to the surveillance only where such disclosure is necessary to make an accurate determination of the legality of the surveillance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"361\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201806\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   The Government suggests that Plaintiffs' religion claims cannot be resolved using the \u00a7 1806(f) procedures because, as the district court found, \"the central subject matter [of the case] is Operation Flex, a group of counterterrorism investigations that extend well beyond the purview of electronic surveillance.\" Although the larger\n   <em>\n    factual\n   </em>\n   context of the case involves more than electronic surveillance, a careful review of the \"Claims for Relief\" section of the complaint convinces us that all of Plaintiffs'\n   <em>\n    legal\n   </em>\n   causes of action relate to electronic surveillance, at least for the\n   most part, and in nearly all instances entirely,\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   and thus require a determination as to the lawfulness of the surveillance. Moreover, \u00a7 1806(f) provides that the district court may consider \"other materials\n   <em>\n    relating\n   </em>\n   to the surveillance as may be necessary to determine whether the surveillance of the aggrieved person was lawfully authorized and conducted,\" thereby providing for consideration of both parties' factual submissions and legal contentions regarding the background of the surveillance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"362\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201806\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   As we concluded in Part I,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , not all of the surveillance detailed in the complaint as the basis for Plaintiffs' legal claims constitutes electronic surveillance as defined by FISA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1801(k). Only the surveillance in the mosque prayer hall and of Fazaga's office and AbdelRahim's house fits within FISA's definition. But once the district court uses \u00a7 1806(f) 's procedures to review the state secrets evidence\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   to determine the lawfulness of that surveillance, we see no reason why the district court could not then rely on its assessment of the evidence-taking care to avoid its public disclosure-to determine the lawfulness of the surveillance falling outside FISA's purview, should Plaintiffs wish to proceed with their claims as applied to that set of activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   The same categories of evidence will be required to defend against Plaintiffs' surviving claims no matter the particular surveillance at issue. That is, whether the official-capacity defendants targeted Plaintiffs for surveillance in violation of the First Amendment, for example, will in all likelihood be proven or defended against using the same set of evidence regardless of whether the court considers the claim in terms of surveillance in the mosque prayer hall or conversations to which Monteilh was a party. It would be an exercise in empty formalism to require the district court to consider the state secrets evidence\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   to determine the lawfulness of the FISA surveillance, but then ignore that same evidence and so dismiss Plaintiffs' surviving claims as to the non-FISA surveillance. As we explained in our discussion of why FISA's \u00a7 1806(f) procedures may be used both for claims arising under \u00a7 1810 and under other constitutional and statutory provisions,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Part II.D, once the sensitive information has been considered\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   , the small risk of disclosure-a risk Congress thought too small to preclude careful\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   consideration by a federal judge-has already been incurred.

We answer them on purely legal grounds, but of course realize that those legal answers will reverberate in the context of the larger ongoing national conversation about how reasonably to understand and respond\n   to the threats posed by terrorism without fueling a climate of fear rooted in stereotypes and discrimination. In a previous case, we observed that the state secrets doctrine strikes a \"difficult balance ... between fundamental principles of our liberty, including justice, transparency, accountability and national security,\" and sometimes requires us to confront \"an irreconcilable conflict\" between those principles.\n   <em>\n    Jeppesen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3706299\" index=\"383\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/614/1070/#p1081\">\n    614 F.3d at 1073\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In holding, for the reasons stated, that the Government's assertion of the state secrets privilege does not warrant dismissal of this litigation in its entirety, we, too, have recognized the need for balance, but also have heeded the conclusion at the heart of Congress's enactment of FISA: the fundamental principles of liberty include devising means of forwarding accountability while assuring national security.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   Having carefully considered the Defendants' various arguments for dismissal other than the state secrets privilege, we conclude that some of Plaintiffs' search and religion allegations state a claim, while others do not. We therefore affirm in part and reverse in part the district court's orders, and remand for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-275\">\n    Specifically, the Plaintiffs alleged violations of the First Amendment's Establishment Clause and Free Exercise Clauses; the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000bb\n    <em>\n     et seq.\n    </em>\n    ; the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause; the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a ; the Fourth Amendment; the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"384\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201810\">\n     50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1810\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ; and the Federal Tort Claims Act,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"385\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201346\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-276\">\n    In addition to the facts alleged in the complaint, this opinion at some points refers to facts contained in two public declarations submitted by the Government in support of its invocation of the state secrets privilege.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-277\">\n    In a public declaration, the FBI frames Operation Flex differently, contending that it \"focused on fewer than 25 individuals and was directed at detecting and preventing possible terrorist attacks.\" The FBI maintains that the goal of Operation Flex \"was to determine whether particular individuals were involved in the recruitment and training of individuals in the United States or overseas for possible terrorist activity.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-278\">\n    \"The liberty protected by the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause contains within it the prohibition against denying to any person the equal protection of the laws.\"\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Plaintiffs' RFRA claim, their Fifth Cause of Action, is not limited to surveillance. Plaintiffs broadly allege that \"[t]he actions of Defendants substantially burdened [their] exercise of religion.\" The FTCA claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, the Eleventh Cause of Action, is also more broadly pleaded. It is far from clear, however, that as actually litigated, either claim will involve more than the electronic surveillance that is otherwise the focus of the lawsuit.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"51\">\n   <p id=\"p-329\">\n    None of Plaintiffs' legal claims is pleaded to apply only to a particular subset of surveillance activity.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"52\">\n   <p id=\"p-330\">\n    As could happen if, for instance, Plaintiffs are unable to substantiate their factual allegations as to the occurrence of the surveillance.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
