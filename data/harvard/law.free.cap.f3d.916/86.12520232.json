Plaintiff-Appellee Easthampton Congregational Church (the \"Church\") had a property insurance policy (the \"Policy\") with Defendant-Appellant Church Mutual Insurance Company (the \"Insurance Company\"). On April 25, 2016, the ceiling in one section of the Church collapsed. The Church filed a claim pursuant to the Policy, which the Insurance Company denied. The Church then filed suit, seeking a declaratory judgment that the claim was covered. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court ruled for the Church. Noting that the Policy did not define the word \"decay,\" the court adopted a dictionary definition of the word and used that definition to conclude that the Policy provided coverage. We affirm, albeit for different reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Insurance Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Policy was in effect at the time of the collapse and carries a coverage limit of $5,353,000. The parties agree that the damaged section of the Church, Fellowship Hall, \"is among the [covered] premises described in the [P]olicy's Declarations Page.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The coverage provisions are governed by two primary forms. The first is the \"Building and Personal Property Coverage Form,\" which covers \"direct physical loss of or damage to Covered Property ... caused by or resulting from any Covered Cause of Loss.\" The second is the \"Causes of Loss - Special Form.\" That form sets forth various exclusions and limitations in Sections B and C, respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Insurance Company argues that two exclusionary clauses are relevant to this case. First, in Section B-2(d), the Policy includes a \"Wear and Tear Exclusion\" which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   We will not pay for loss or damage caused by or resulting from any of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   d. (1) Wear and tear;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (2) Rust, or other corrosion, decay, deterioration, hidden or latent defect, or any quality in property that causes it to damage or destroy itself;\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Second, in Section B-3(c), the Policy includes a \"Faulty Construction Exclusion\" which excludes coverage for:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   loss or damage caused by or resulting from any of the following [sections] but if an excluded cause of loss that is listed in [the following sections] results in a Covered Cause of Loss, we will pay for the loss or damage caused by that Covered Cause of Loss.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   c. Faulty, inadequate, or defective:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (2) Design, specifications, workmanship, repair, construction, renovation, remodeling, grading, compaction;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (3) Materials used in repair, construction, renovation, or remodeling; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (4) Maintenance;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   of part or all of any property on or off the described premises.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In Section B-2(j), the Policy also includes a \"Collapse Exclusion\" which excludes coverage for:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Collapse, except as provided below in the Additional Coverage - Collapse [provision]. But if collapse results in a Covered Cause of Loss at the described premises, we will pay for the loss or damage caused by that Covered Cause of Loss.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Additional Coverage - Collapse provision, Section D-2, in turn states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   The term Covered Cause of Loss includes the Additional Coverage - Collapse as described and limited in [the sections] below.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   1. With respect to buildings:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   a. Collapse means an abrupt falling down or caving in of a building or any part of a building with the result that the building or part of the building cannot be occupied for its intended purpose;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   2. We will pay for direct physical loss or damage to Covered Property, caused by collapse of a [Covered Property] ... if the collapse is caused by one or more of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   b. Decay that is hidden from view, unless the presence of such decay is known to an insured prior to collapse;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   f. Use of defective material or methods in construction, remodeling, or renovation if the collapse occurs during the course of the construction, remodeling, or renovation. However, if the collapse occurs after construction, remodeling, or renovation is complete and is caused in part by a cause of loss listed in [the previous sections]; we will pay for the loss or damage even if use of defective material or methods, in construction, remodeling, or renovation, contributes to the collapse.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Therefore, although Section B-2(j) excludes coverage for collapses generally, Section D-2 effectively reinstates coverage under limited circumstances, including where the collapse was caused in part by \"[d]ecay that is hidden from view.\" It is noted that the Policy does not define the word \"decay.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Ceiling Collapse\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On April 25, 2016, the ceiling in the Fellowship section of the Church fell to the floor. The Church promptly reported the incident to the Insurance Company. Eight days later, at the request of the Insurance Company, forensic engineer Joseph Malo inspected the ceiling collapse and detailed his findings in a written report. The parties accepted the contents of Malo's report as \"agreed material facts.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In that report, Malo wrote that the ceiling \"consist[ed] of three different types of materials installed one over the other with a total thickness of approximately 3 [and] 3/4 inches.\" \"The original ceiling [was] constructed with wood lath and plaster attached to boards\" spaced twelve inches apart. The boards themselves \"were attached\n   to the ceiling joists\" by \"cut nails with approximately 1 [and] 3/4-inch penetration.\" Although the boards were nailed to the joists, the wood lath and plaster were attached only to the boards. Sometime after the original ceiling was constructed, two more ceiling layers were installed. The second layer consisted of drywall affixed to boards, which were then nailed directly into the plaster. The third layer consisted of ceiling tiles that were attached directly to the surface of the drywall. Neither the second nor third layers were attached to the ceiling joists. In addition, there was approximately ten inches of insulation blown into the space above the ceiling. Therefore, the only support for the three layers of ceiling materials and insulation was the original nails that fastened the first layer of boards to the ceiling joists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Malo concluded that \"nail withdrawal\" by the smooth nails used to secure the original boards to the joists caused the ceiling collapse. He observed that \"cyclical volumetric changes induce[d] by normal temperature and moisture changes in the building materials\" had caused the nails' connection to the joists to weaken. Eventually, the nails completely pulled out, \"leaving only holes in the bottoms of the ceiling joists.\" In other words, the collapse was caused by the \"progressive failure of the fasteners used to attach the layers of ceiling to the ceiling joists due to the weight of the ceiling.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Denial of Coverage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On May 19, 2016, the Insurance Company denied the Church's claim, relying on Malo's report. As relevant here, the Insurance Coverage cited the Faulty Construction Exclusion, stating that \"[t]he fasteners used to uphold the ceiling were inadequate for the size/weight of the ceiling, and the ceiling system was not adequately fastened to the structure.\" The Church asked the Insurance Company to reconsider its decision, arguing that the collapse was covered under the Additional Coverage - Collapse provision. However, on July 1, 2016, the Insurance Company denied the reconsideration request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On September 26, 2016, the Church, through counsel, sent the Insurance Company a letter detailing its position that the loss caused by the ceiling collapse was a covered event under the Policy. The Church disputed the application of the Faulty Construction Exclusion, claiming that because the ceiling lasted approximately sixty years, its construction was \"entirely effective.\" In addition, the Church argued that the collapse was caused by hidden decay and so was covered by the Additional Coverage - Collapse provision. It noted that Malo's report concluded that the collapse occurred because of nail withdrawal, which was a \"progressive failure\" that \"could have taken a period of years to occur.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Insurance Company replied by letter through counsel on October 21, 2016, reiterating its prior position that the collapse occurred because of \"faulty construction.\" Specifically, it argued that Malo's report concluded that the ceiling's construction was flawed because the second and third layers were not securely fastened to the ceiling joists. The letter also rejected the Church's allegation that hidden decay contributed to the collapse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Church filed suit in Massachusetts Superior Court in April 2017 seeking a declaratory judgment that the Policy provided coverage for the collapse. The Insurance Company timely removed the case to federal court based on diversity jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both parties consented to have the case heard by a magistrate judge and filed cross-motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   On May 10, 2018, the district court granted summary judgment for the Church.\n   <em>\n    Easthampton Congregational Church\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Church Mut. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526407\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/322/230/\">\n    322 F.Supp.3d 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Mass. 2018). The court concluded that the collapse resulted at least in part from \"hidden decay\" such that the Additional Coverage - Collapse provision applied.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526407\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/322/230/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526407\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/322/230/\">\n    at 235-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After noting that the Policy failed to define \"decay,\" the court looked to dictionary definitions of that term and adopted a definition that encompassed \"a gradual deterioration or decline in strength or soundness.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526407\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/322/230/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526407\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/322/230/\">\n    at 236-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . From there, the court held that there was sufficient evidence (i.e., the Malo report) to show that the collapse \"was 'caused in part' by 'decay' \" \"hidden from view\" -- namely, the gradual nail withdrawal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526407\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/322/230/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526407\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/322/230/\">\n    at 236-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, it held that the collapse fell within the Additional Coverage - Collapse provision.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526407\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/322/230/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because that provision expressly provided coverage, the court declined to address the Insurance Company's arguments that the Wear and Tear and Faulty Construction Exclusions applied.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526407\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/322/230/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526407\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/322/230/\">\n    at 241-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

That is, a \"gradual decline in strength\" or \"progressive decline\" as opposed to a narrower definition that entails organic rotting.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526407\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/322/230/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526407\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/322/230/\">\n    at 236-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, it suggests that the cases the district court relied upon were inapposite because the \" 'decay' that was the actual subject of each [case] was uniformly, and more narrowly, associated with a discrete physical impairment to the material quality of a component of the collapsed property.\" However, that argument does nothing to refute the core holding of the cited cases -- namely, that those \"physical impairments\" were covered because they fell within a broader definition of \"decay\" that included gradual degradation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Second, the Insurance Company complains that the district court's chosen definition would encompass all collapses, because \"it is difficult to imagine\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   collapse, of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   structure, being caused by\n   something other than 'decay.' \" But, even if the Insurance Company did not intend to provide coverage for collapses like the one in question, that is a self-inflicted problem. The Insurance Company, which wrote the Policy, could simply have defined \"decay\" narrowly or limited the coverage period. Despite the Insurance Company's protestations, our interpretation of the Policy would not result in coverage for all collapses. As the district court correctly noted, \"[t]he insured still has to prove that one of the ... enumerated causes of loss contributed to the collapse, and where an insured relies on hidden decay, the insured still has to show a gradual deterioration or decline in strength or soundness that was not apparent to the insured.\"\n   <em>\n    Easthampton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526407\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/322/230/\">\n    322 F.Supp.3d at 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Finally, the Insurance Company argues that the district court's decision \"cannot be reconciled with [the First Circuit's] opinion in\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Worcester Ins.

However, in dicta, the decision expressed skepticism as to the merits of the claim, cautioning that the policy excluded coverage for loss \"due to faulty construction of the foundation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11105181\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/247/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11105181\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/247/1/\">\n    at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While there was a coverage provision for \"hidden decay,\" the decision also stated that \" 'decay' is not a backdoor to coverage for poor construction materials and workmanship.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11105181\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/247/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Here, because the second and third layers of the ceiling were never fastened to the joists, the Insurance Company argues that the collapse was attributable to defective workmanship and that the above-quoted dicta from\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   compels reversal. It argues that to do otherwise would be to \"sneak in through the backdoor of coverage in the guise of 'hidden decay.' \" In support, the Insurance Company claims that \"[t]he policy language in the two [cases] is essentially the same.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Even ignoring the fact that the cited language was dicta, which is not binding, there are important distinctions between\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   and this case. In\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   , the insurer limited coverage for collapses attributable to \"defective material or methods\" only to situations where the collapse occurred \"\n   <em>\n    during\n   </em>\n   construction.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11105181\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/247/1/\">\n    247 F.3d at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By contrast, in this case, the Insurance Company explicitly granted coverage for collapses occurring\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   construction, provided\n   the collapse was caused\n   <em>\n    in part\n   </em>\n   by hidden decay. Moreover, in\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   , because the concrete that caused the collapse was defective to begin with, it was doubtful that it \"could be called 'decay,' \" so the hidden decay provision was inapplicable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11105181\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/247/1/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11105181\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/247/1/\">\n    at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
