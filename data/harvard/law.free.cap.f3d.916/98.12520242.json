That Fiscal Plan was automatically \"deemed approved by the Governor\" under \u00a7 201(e)(2).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202141\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2141(e)(2) (\"If the Oversight Board develops a Fiscal Plan under subsection (d)(2), such Fiscal Plan shall be deemed approved by the Governor ....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The April Fiscal Plan incorporated many aspects of the Governor's proposed Fiscal Plan. It also included a labor reform package not proposed by the Governor. This was one among a set of \"comprehensive structural reforms to the economy of Puerto Rico\" set forth in the Plan. These comprehensive reforms, to Puerto Rico's labor laws, business regulations, and infrastructure (among other areas), were designed by the Board to \"revers[e] the negative trend [of economic] growth over the last 10 years and enabl[e] the Island to become a vibrant and productive economy going forward.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"[I]ncreasing labor force participation may be the single most important reform for long-term economic well-being in Puerto Rico,\" the April Plan stated. It identified three \"labor market reforms\" intended \"[t]o reduce the cost to hire and encourage job creation, including movement of informal jobs to the formal economy.\" The three \"initiatives to change labor conditions\" were: a shift to at-will employment; a \"[r]eduction of mandated paid leave, including sick leave and vacation pay;\" and an end to \"mandated Christmas bonuses.\" The called-for adoption of at-will employment required the repeal of Puerto Rico's Law No. 80 of May 30, 1976, P.R. Laws Ann. tit 29 \u00a7\u00a7 185a - 185m, which bars termination of many private-sector employees without cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As to this first reform, the Plan noted that \"49 out of 50 U.S. states are employment at-will jurisdictions, giving employers the flexibility to dismiss an employee without having to first prove just cause.\" It acknowledged that \"some employees benefit from Puerto Rico's lack of at-will employment\" but credited evidence that for-cause employment \"makes it more costly\n   and risky not only to dismiss, but also to hire, an employee.\" \"For example,\" the Plan summarized, \"studies have found that laws preventing unfair dismissal caused reductions in employment, particularly in labor-intensive industries.\" It concluded that switching to at-will employment \"will lower the cost and risk of hiring in Puerto Rico.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Plan quantified the impact of the labor reform package on the Commonwealth's annual budget surplus over thirty years. It projected that, with the adoption of at-will employment, Puerto Rico would have a $39 billion cumulative surplus over that period, compared with a $2 billion cumulative surplus without the enactment of at-will employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The April Fiscal Plan also cut the operating budget of the Puerto Rican Legislative Assembly. These \"reductions for the Legislative Assembly\" were \"informed by benchmarking against other full-time legislatures\" in the United States, the Plan explained. The Puerto Rican Legislative Assembly's expenditure in Fiscal Year 2018 was about 300% greater than the (population-weighted) national average of full-time U.S. legislatures, according to an analysis by the Board of publicly available data.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Plan stated that these reductions would achieve \"reinvestment savings\" of between $23.6 and $25 million per year for the next five years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    May 30, 2018 Fiscal Plan\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Governor and the Board continued negotiating about the labor reform package and other matters after the April Fiscal Plan had been certified. Eventually, the Board agreed to certify a revised Fiscal Plan that it had developed. It did so on May 30, 2018. Two aspects of the Board's May Fiscal Plan are relevant to these appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   First, the May Fiscal Plan provided for a shift to at-will employment. Specifically:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   The Legislature shall introduce and the Governor shall sign a bill that repeals Act No. 80 ... on or before June 27, 2018, which shall become effective on or before January 1, 2019.... The Bill shall state that, for the avoidance of doubt, an employee hired for an indefinite period of time does not have a cause of action against their employer merely for the employer's termination of the employment relation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   That is, the government of Puerto Rico would repeal Law 80 and clarify that employment is at will.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Second, the cut to the Legislative Assembly's budget was removed from the May version of the Fiscal Plan. In addition, cuts to the budget of the judiciary included in the April Fiscal Plan were \"reduced by half each year\" in the May version, a change that increased the court system's budget by up to $23 million per year over what had been budgeted in the April version. According to a statement of understanding between the Governor and the Board, these operating budgets were to \"be revisited annually,\" and these funding levels were made contingent on Puerto Rico's \"compliance with the then-applicable fiscal plan.\" That is, the May Fiscal Plan stated that the allocations for the Legislative Assembly and the judiciary\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   are pursuant to Puerto Rico becoming an employment at-will jurisdiction by repealing Law 80 of May 30, 1976 on or before June 27, 2018 .... If the repeal does not occur, none of these changes and alterations [to the Legislative Assembly's and the judiciary's budgets] shall be implemented.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Legislative Assembly did not repeal Law 80. Instead, the day the Board certified the May Fiscal Plan, May 30, Puerto Rico's Senate passed Senate Bill 1011, which made at-will employment the rule for employees hired after the date of the bill's enactment, while retaining Law 80's for-cause rule for those already employed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The House of Representatives immediately began considering Senate Bill 1011. Recognizing that the bill did not fully repeal Law 80, the President of the House Government Affairs Committee sent a letter to the Board asking about the \"effect on the Fiscal Plan and the budget to be certified by the Financial Oversight Board\" were the House to pass Senate Bill 1011. The Board responded that same day, June 4, that, if the Legislative Assembly \"fails to comply exactly with the understanding reached with the Oversight Board concerning the repeal of Law 80, the Oversight Board will amend the Fiscal Plan and Budget to,\" among other things, \"[m]aintain the cuts to the budgets of the Legislature and Judiciary as outlined in the April 19 Fiscal Plan.\" Ten days later, on June 14, the House passed Senate Bill 1011. The parties agree that Senate Bill 1011 never became law; the record does not explain why.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    June 29, 2018 Fiscal Plan\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On June 29, 2018, the Board informed the Governor and the Legislative Assembly by letter that it was certifying a new Fiscal Plan. As had been promised in the May Fiscal Plan and in the Board's June 4 letter, the Board's June Fiscal Plan funded the judiciary and the Legislative Assembly at the levels stated in the April Plan. The letter explained, \"Unfortunately, we now know that the Government of Puerto Rico will not implement the [May] Fiscal Plan in full because the Legislature ... failed to pass the most important component of the Labor Reform Package -- the repeal of Law 80 and turning Puerto Rico into an at-will employment jurisdiction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The labor reform package was absent from the Board's June Fiscal Plan, certified June 29, 2018. On that subject, the June Plan stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   [W]hile successful human capital and welfare reforms would have been projected to generate approximately $39 billion in additional revenues by FY2048 and over ~$320 million from FY2018-FY2023, the Legislature's demonstrated noncompliance with the comprehensive labor reform requirements of previous fiscal plans has forced the removal of these projected revenues from the New Fiscal Plan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    2019 Territory Budget\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   PROMESA \u00a7 202 grants the Board exclusive authority to review, approve, and certify Territory Budgets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202142\">\n    48 U.S.C. \u00a7 2142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aurelius Inv.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520105\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/915/838/#p842\">\n    915 F.3d at 856-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%20642328\">\n    2019 WL 642328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *12 (recognizing the Board's \"significant\" power to approve and reject Commonwealth budgets).

Of this, and consistent with the June Fiscal Plan, $65,292,000 was allocated to the Legislative Assembly ($35,228,000 to the House and $30,064,000 to the Senate).

That determination was the basis for the Board's decision to certify, under \u00a7 201(e)(2), the June Fiscal Plan. And \u00a7 106(e) bars district courts from reviewing the reasons for certification determinations as much as the certification determinations themselves. Nor did the district court have jurisdiction to review whether the Board erred in deeming the Legislative Assembly's Budget non-compliant with the applicable Fiscal Plan and in certifying instead a Board-developed Territory Budget. These decisions, which \u00a7 202 expressly empowers the Board to make,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202126\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2142(d)-(e), are prototypical \"certification determinations under this chapter,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202126\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2126(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Rivera-Schatz's argument that the Board's determinations about Territory Budgets adopted by the Legislative Assembly are reviewable runs headlong into the text of \u00a7 106(e). His argument rests on the following attempted contrast of \u00a7\u00a7 201 and 202: \u00a7 201 states that the Board has \"sole discretion\" to determine whether to certify a Fiscal Plan or a Budget proposed by the Governor,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202126\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2141(c)(3), (c)(1), while \u00a7 202 does not use the phrase \"sole discretion\" in granting the Board authority to \"determine whether the [Legislature-]adopted Territory Budget is a compliant budget,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202126\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2142(d)(1). From this, Rivera-Schatz asks us to infer first that the Board's authority to make determinations about Legislature-adopted Budgets is non-exclusive. Rivera-Schatz urges that a second inference -- that such determinations are subject to judicial review -- follows. Section 106(e)'s text forecloses these inferences. It plainly bars judicial review of \"challenges to the Oversight Board's certification determinations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202126\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2126(e).

Second, we read the complaint as alleging that the Board's decision to certify a Board-developed Budget that cut the Legislative Assembly's funds was punitive and therefore \"contraven[ed] ... the limited powers delegated by Congress to the [Board].\" Third, we read the complaint to allege that the Board's decision to certify its Budget over the Legislative Assembly's impinged on the Legislative Assembly's power under Puerto Rico's Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The district court chose to exercise jurisdiction over these claims that the Board exceeded its authority under PROMESA, a choice we do not evaluate,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   and to dismiss them for failure to state a claim to relief. We affirm the dismissal, taking the three remaining arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   First, the complaint's assertions that the Board violated \u00a7\u00a7 204 and 205 rest on an inaccurate factual premise: that the Board forced the Legislative Assembly to repeal or that the Board otherwise nullified Law 80. The Board did nothing of the sort; Law 80 remains on the books and the applicable Fiscal Plan does not call for its repeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   As to \u00a7 204, the complaint alleges that the Board \"invalidate[d]\" Law 80 and, in doing so, exceeded its authority under\n   \u00a7 204(a) to review laws that were enacted \"\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   , rather than\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the [Board] became operational.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   That provision authorizes the Board to review, for consistency with the governing Fiscal Plan, legislation that \"a territorial government duly enacts ... during any fiscal year in which the Oversight Board is in operation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202144\">\n    48 U.S.C. \u00a7 2144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). It also empowers the Board to \"direct the territorial government to ... correct the law to eliminate\" any \"significant[ ] inconsisten[cy]\" with the Fiscal Plan.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202144\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2144(a)(4)(B). And if \"the territorial government fails to comply with\" such a directive, the Board may \"take such actions as it considers necessary ... to ensure that the enactment or enforcement of the law will not adversely affect the territorial government's compliance with the Fiscal Plan, including preventing enforcement or application of the law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202144\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2144(a)(5).

That provision allows the Board to \"at any time submit recommendations to the Governor or the Legislature on actions the territorial government may take to ensure compliance with the Fiscal Plan.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202144\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2145(a). The Governor and the Legislative Assembly may then decide \"whether the territorial government will adopt the recommendations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202144\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2145(b)(1). The complaint alleges that the labor reform package was a \u00a7 205 recommendation and that, because \u00a7 205 empowers the Legislative Assembly to reject such recommendations, the Board violated that provision in making the reforms mandatory. But the Board did not impose any reforms. Instead, it removed the labor package from the Fiscal Plan after the Legislative Assembly chose not to repeal Law 80.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Next, the sequence of events leading to the certification of the 2019 Budget refutes the second alleged theory. On that theory, the complaint specifically says that, although the Board lacks \"the power to impose penalties on Commonwealth officers or employees,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Board certified a 2019 Budget with a cut to the Legislative Assembly's budget, a cut which the complaint alleges was a punitive response to the Legislative Assembly's decision not to repeal Law 80. Yet, the recommendation that the Legislative Assembly's budget should be reduced, along with the budgets of other government entities, originated in the April Fiscal Plan, and preceded by months the Legislative Assembly's actions on Law 80. Further, after the Legislative Assembly declined to repeal Law 80, the Board acted within its authority when it certified a June Fiscal Plan and 2019 Territory Budget that included the previously proposed cuts to the Legislative Assembly's operating budget. PROMESA authorizes the Board to adopt Fiscal Plans and Budgets incentivizing the Legislative Assembly to enact the Board's recommended policies and accounting for the Legislative Assembly's responses to those recommended policies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202144\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 2141-2151.

In any event, both arguments are also inconsistent with the events of the winter, spring, and summer of 2018. The arguments overlook the lineage of the Board's June Fiscal Plan: That Fiscal Plan was the culmination of the formal development process and the informal negotiation process between the Governor and the Board between January and May. And the June Fiscal Plan was also identical, in all respects relevant to this case, to the April Fiscal Plan.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    The issue of whether \u00a7 106(e) also precludes jurisdiction over these claims is not free from doubt, but we bypass it here and assume statutory subject matter jurisdiction because the merits of the remaining claims are quite easily resolved against the party invoking our jurisdiction.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Moriarty\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Colvin\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357156\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/806/664/#p668\">\n     806 F.3d 664\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 668 (1st Cir. 2015) (using hypothetical jurisdiction where the sidestepped jurisdictional question is statutory);\n    <em>\n     Umsted\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Umsted\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2839424\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/446/17/\">\n     446 F.3d 17\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 20 n.2 (1st Cir. 2006) (citing\n    <em>\n     Restoration Pres.
