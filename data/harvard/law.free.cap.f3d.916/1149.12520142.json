We conclude that the IJ did not deny Arrey her due process rights to counsel and an unbiased factfinder. As to Arrey's asylum and withholding of removal claims, we conclude that the Board erred as a matter of law in its analysis and application of the \"firm resettlement\" rule. As to Arrey's claim for relief under CAT, we conclude that substantial evidence does not support the Board's determination that Arrey could safely relocate in another area of Cameroon. We grant the petition in part and remand for reconsideration of Arrey's claims consistent with our opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Arrey is a native and citizen of Cameroon. In October 2015, she used her Cameroonian passport to obtain a Mexican visa in Nigeria. After traveling to Mexico, she applied for admission to the United States at a port of entry in California. Because her passport had been taken from her in Mexico, she did not possess or present a valid passport or entry document. The Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") personally served her with a Notice to Appear, charging that Arrey was removable from the United States as an immigrant who, at the time of application for admission, did not possess a valid entry document or passport. The Notice ordered\n   Arrey to appear before an IJ to show why she should not be removed from the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Arrey first appeared before an IJ on December 3, 2015. Arrey said that English was her best language. The IJ explained the process and informed Arrey of her right to hire an attorney, her appellate rights, and the consequences of removal. Arrey said that she was not ready to proceed, so the IJ continued her case for another four weeks. The IJ also told Arrey that if she appeared at the next hearing without an attorney, or with a recently-hired attorney who was not ready to proceed, the IJ would nonetheless proceed with her case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Arrey's second hearing was held on December 30, 2015. Arrey told the IJ that she had not found an attorney, though she had \"tried to get [her] family friends out there to get me one.\" The IJ questioned whether Arrey had taken \"any concrete action\" to get an attorney. He told her that \"the questions aren't that hard really\" and asked her whether she would \"have the attorney here in a week.\" Arrey responded \"a week is too early.\" The IJ then found that Arrey had not established good cause for a continuance and proceeded to take the pleadings. Based on Arrey's admissions, the IJ sustained the charge of removability. On DHS's recommendation, the IJ designated Cameroon as the country of removal. After Arrey expressed a fear of harm or persecution in Cameroon, the IJ told her to fill out Form I-589 and suggested that she could also look for an attorney before her next hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After filing her asylum application, Arrey appeared for her third hearing on January 27, 2016. There, the IJ scheduled a March 28 hearing to address the merits of her applications for relief and protection. The IJ told Arrey, \"if you show up [at the next hearing] and tell me you're not ready ... I'm going to finish your case on that day with an order of removal.\" Arrey stated that she understood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At the March 28 hearing, the DHS attorney told the IJ that Attorney Ronald Richey had recently filed a motion for continuance on Arrey's behalf. The IJ asked Arrey if she was seeking a continuance in her case, and she said that she was. The IJ asked her \"why [she] did exactly specifically what I told you exactly not to do?\" noting that she had had two months since her January hearing to prepare. He reminded her that \"the only way you can have a hearing is to steal a hearing from someone else, and that there are people there who are threatening suicide because they can't get hearing dates.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The IJ's expressed hostility continued: When Arrey asked for \"another short time\" because her attorney was not available, the IJ told her that he considered her actions \"inconsiderate and extremely selfish.\" He noted that, according to the motion for continuance, Arrey had only contacted her retained attorney \"basically less than a week\" before the present hearing. The IJ found \"no good cause for a continuance\" and made a \"finding of dilatory tactics based on the advisal that [he] gave [Arrey] previously.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Notwithstanding the IJ's finding of dilatory tactics, the IJ continued Arrey's case for another week, to April 6. He advised her that \"no continuance is going to be granted on April 6, 2016, [and if she was] not ready on that date, [he would] finish [her] case with an order of removal,\" whether or not her attorney was present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   One day before the rescheduled merits hearing, the Immigration Court received from Richey a motion to appear telephonically, or in the alternative to withdraw as counsel, and a list of intended evidence. A note on these filings indicates that the IJ did not receive the filings before the April\n   6 hearing, but the record does not indicate why.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Arrey's final hearing occurred on April 6. The IJ asked whether Arrey was ready to go forward, and she said \"my attorney said he will come, he could call you through the hearings today.\" The IJ told her-incorrectly-that Richey \"didn't put in any motion for a telephonic hearing.\" The IJ asked if Arrey wanted to proceed. Arrey responded, \"Your Honor, no.\" The IJ further asked, \"are you going to be presenting any evidence today ma'am?,\" and she said, \"Your Honor, I don't know. [Richey] might be on the line because he told me he will have to talk to, he has to be on the line to know-.\" The IJ told her \"[w]e can go forward today by yourself or I can just finish your case with an order of removal, and then, you know, you can talk to your attorney about it later.\" At that, Arrey told the IJ: \"Your Honor, I think you are the good one to take the decision.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The IJ then reminded Arrey about the warnings he had previously given her, and again asked \"do you want to present a case today?\" Arrey responded, \"Your Honor, I'm not ready.\" The IJ \"[found] [Arrey's] application [for asylum] has been abandoned,\" but he continued to ask Arrey whether she wanted to proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The IJ explained that there was no way that Richey could appear by telephone for the merits hearing, but the IJ nevertheless agreed to call Richey. The person who answered the phone indicated that \"Mr. Richey is not in right now. He should be in any second though.\" The IJ ended the call and asked Arrey what she wanted to do. He told her that her choices were to \"go forward ... by [herself]\" or accept an order of removal. The transcript indicates that Arrey responded \"I can [indiscernible].\" The IJ then proceeded to ask for documentary evidence from both Arrey and the DHS attorney, to place Arrey under oath, to ask her questions about her claims for relief and protection, and to allow the DHS attorney to cross-examine her. What follows is a summary of Arrey's testimony, which the Board credited as true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Arrey testified that she was born in 1976 in Cameroon and lived with her family in the village of Nchang until she was twelve years old. Female genital mutilation was practiced in Nchang, but the practice was prohibited in Arrey's Roman Catholic religion. To protect Arrey, her family arranged for her to stay with friends, Jean Thomas and his wife, in the city of Victoria, Cameroon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Arrey lived in Thomas's home for twenty-six years. During that time, Thomas sexually and physically abused her. He refused to send her to school, beat her, forced her to have sex with him, impregnated her, threatened to kill her, and told her that her \"family would never see her corpse\" if she told anyone that he had impregnated her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On one occasion, Arrey was hospitalized as a result of Thomas's abuse. She then told hospital staff that she was \"beaten at home,\" but she did not identify Thomas as her abuser, and his identity was not reported to police. After Arrey was released from the hospital, she went to a friend's home. Thomas found her there because he knew most of her friends and where they lived. Thomas brought her home and proceeded to viciously beat her with a whip and cables. He told her that she had no right to leave his home and stay elsewhere.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   When Arrey was twenty-six, she became pregnant with Thomas's child. Thomas did not want his wife to discover that he was the father, so he threatened to kill Arrey unless she accused one of her friends of impregnating her. Thomas also threatened the friend, who accepted responsibility. Arrey\n   believed that Thomas had abused and threatened her because, against Arrey's wishes and her Catholic faith, he wanted to \"marry her like a second wife.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Thomas sometimes brought Arrey to the local police station and accused her of stealing and \"do[ing] bad things\" in his house. According to Arrey, Thomas was able to convince the police to detain her because he was an influential businessman in the community. Arrey's fear of the police and Thomas prevented her from reporting Thomas's abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Arrey stayed with Thomas despite the abuse, because she believed he protected her from other \"assaults in the community\" and because her parents could not support her. Although she occasionally stayed with friends, her friends did not have enough room in their homes to allow her to live with them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Arrey did not tell her friends about Thomas's sexual abuse, but she told them that he physically abused her. Eventually, Arrey's friends helped her flee from Cameroon and relocate to South Africa. She arrived in South Africa in 2007, was granted refugee status, and remained there for seven years. While Arrey lived in South Africa, Thomas searched for her. He attempted to kidnap their two children from the home of Arrey's friend, where they had been living since Arrey left Cameroon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Arrey left South Africa in 2014 and returned to Cameroon following two incidents. First, in 2011, she was robbed and assaulted while walking home from work. Her assailants stabbed her in the leg and left her bleeding in the street. She spent three months recovering from her injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Second, in 2014, her brother was shot and killed in South Africa. Arrey explained that in her village in Cameroon, when a person dies, it is customary to bury him \"in his land.\" Although she feared returning to Cameroon, she returned with her brother's body, using community donations to pay for the trip. Arrey believed that she was the only person who could return her brother's body because her parents died in 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   To avoid being abused by Thomas upon her return, Arrey hid with her church community in Douala. But Thomas knew that she had returned; her friends and family members told him so after he threatened them. After some time, Thomas found Arrey and attempted to rape her on the street outside the church where she was hiding. Arrey was able to escape. She did not report the incident to the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Following her encounter with Thomas, Arrey fled Cameroon and traveled through Nigeria and Mexico to get to the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Arrey is not in contact with anyone in Cameroon, and she does not know whether Thomas is presently searching for her. Arrey is afraid to return to Cameroon because she fears Thomas and the Cameroonian police. Arrey is also afraid that she would be forced to undergo female genital mutilation in Cameroon; she knows that the practice still exists in her village and community, although it is typically practiced on girls soon after they reach the age of maturity and not on older women.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In addition to her fears of returning to Cameroon, Arrey testified that she fears returning to South Africa, because of the \"bad things she saw in South Africa,\" including \"a lot of blood.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    C\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In an oral decision, the IJ denied Arrey's claims and ordered her removed to Cameroon. He found that Arrey had not provided credible testimony, doubting that her passport was stolen and that she experienced decades of abuse without reporting it or leaving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The IJ also found that Arrey was permanently resettled in South Africa between\n   2007 and 2014. Based on that finding, the IJ reasoned that he should only consider the abuse Arrey suffered following her return to Cameroon in 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The IJ then concluded that Arrey had not suffered past persecution on the ground that she was not in a relationship with Thomas upon her return to Cameroon; instead, it was as if Arrey experienced \"random crimes against women,\" which the IJ held did not qualify as persecution on account of a protected ground. Likewise, the IJ determined that Arrey's fear of Thomas amounted to a general fear of violence against women. The IJ rejected Arrey's fear that she would be subjected to female genital mutilation in Cameroon, because the Country report established that there were no credible reports of Cameroonian women over the age of eighteen being subjected to female genital mutilation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On the basis that Arrey had not established that she suffered persecution based on a protected ground, the IJ concluded that Arrey necessarily had not met her burden of establishing that she merited withholding of removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On Arrey's claim for protection under CAT, the IJ determined that Arrey's fear was of Thomas, and not of the Cameroonian government or any public official. The IJ noted that Arrey had never reported the abuse she claimed to suffer to the Cameroonian police. The IJ also rejected Arrey's claim that Thomas would be able to find her anywhere in Cameroon, despite Arrey's contention that Thomas was well-connected. The IJ explained that Thomas's connections would not make Arrey easily identifiable in Cameroon or make her location easily known to Thomas, especially if she relocated to another part of Cameroon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Arrey, represented by Richey, filed an administrative appeal of the IJ's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    D\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Board issued a written decision on Arrey's appeal. Significantly, in our view, the Board rejected the IJ's adverse credibility determinations as clearly erroneous and assumed Arrey was credible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Board agreed that Arrey had resettled in South Africa before she \"voluntarily\" returned to Cameroon in 2014. Like the IJ, the Board reasoned that because Arrey was firmly resettled in South Africa, \"her claim for asylum from Cameroon relates only to the events after she returned.\" The Board rejected Arrey's argument that she was persecuted in South Africa on the basis that it was irrelevant, because she was not going to be removed to South Africa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Board then held that Arrey had not demonstrated that the harm she suffered in Cameroon upon her return in 2014-threats and one attempted assault of rape-rose to the level of past persecution. In addition, the Board concluded that Arrey had not shown a nexus between the harm she experienced or feared and a protected ground, because Arrey did not claim to be in a domestic relationship with Thomas after she returned in 2014. Finally, the Board agreed that Arrey did not have an objectively reasonable fear of being forced to undergo female genital mutilation in Cameroon due to her age.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Based on those conclusions, the Board affirmed the IJ's denial of asylum. The Board also determined that because Arrey had not met her burden of proof with regard to asylum, she necessarily did not qualify for withholding of removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Board affirmed the IJ's denial of CAT protection. It reasoned that Arrey had not shown that it was more likely than not that Thomas would find her and torture her were she to relocate. The Board agreed with the IJ that Arrey's contention that Thomas was a well-connected businessman did not mean that she could not safely relocate within Cameroon to avoid him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Lastly, the Board concluded that Arrey had not demonstrated good cause for another continuance and affirmed the IJ's denial of relief and protection in Arrey's case and dismissed her appeal. Arrey timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   We examine the BIA's \"legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for substantial evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Bringas-Rodriguez v.

Determining whether the firm resettlement rule applies involves a two-step process: First, the government presents \"evidence of an offer of some type of permanent resettlement,\" and then, second, \"the burden shifts to the applicant to show that the nature of his [or her] stay and ties was too tenuous, or the conditions of his [or her] residence too restricted, for him [or her] to be firmly resettled.\"\n   <em>\n    Maharaj v.

First, the Board improperly concluded that Arrey had firmly resettled in South Africa. It completed step one of the analysis, noting that Ms. Arrey received an offer of refugee status. But it did not proceed to step two to consider Arrey's evidence that \"the conditions of [her] residence [were] too restricted[ ] for [her] to be firmly resettled.\"\n   <em>\n    Maharaj\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3089342\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/450/961/#p976\">\n    450 F.3d at 976-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In fact, the Board explicitly declined to consider Arrey's \"claim[ ] that she experienced past persecution in South Africa, and that she will not be safe there.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   That evidence could rebut the\n   finding of firm resettlement in light of our previous holding that \"firmly resettled aliens are by definition no longer subject to persecution,\"\n   <em>\n    Yang v.

The Board's decision to ignore that evidence made its firm resettlement determination incomplete, and erroneous as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Second, the Board incorrectly applied the firm resettlement rule not as a mandatory bar to Arrey's claim for asylum-as the regulations intend it to operate,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201158\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A)(vi) -but instead as a limitation on the evidence the Board considered in support of her claim. This error infected both the Board's past persecution and protected ground analyses. It ignored the abuse Arrey experienced at the hands of Thomas and the police before she left for South Africa. And it ignored Arrey and Thomas's relationship, which informed his reasons for targeting her, her need to seek shelter with her friends to avoid him, and the nature of his abuse. The firm resettlement rule does not tell the Board to ignore evidence of the petitioner's persecution in a country to which she is to be removed because she was for a while resettled, firmly or otherwise, elsewhere. We conclude that doing so was improper in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Third, the Board erred by applying the firm resettlement rule to limit the evidence it considered in support of Arrey's withholding of removal claims.

Arrey-whom the Board found credible-testified that she could not escape Thomas due to his connections. The Board did not rebut that testimony with country conditions evidence or any other evidence.
