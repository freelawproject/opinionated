L. c. 29, \u00a7\u00a7 9B and 9C (1988 ed.), to withhold $210,000,000 in local school aid funds, commonly called Chapter 70 aid, appropriated in the fiscal year 1990 budget. St. 1989, c. 240, \u00a7 2, line item 7061-0008. We further hold, on an entirely separate issue, that \u00a7 6 of St. 1989, c. 240, lawfully limits distributions of certain State lottery proceeds to cities and towns during the 1989 and 1990 fiscal years.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-14\">A judge of the Superior Court reported the case to the Appeals Court on a statement of agreed facts. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-15\">1. In its fiscal year 1990 general appropriation act (St. 1989, c. 240), the Legislature appropriated funds for Chapter 70 school aid (line item 7061-0008) to be distributed to cities and towns. Purporting to act pursuant to G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 9C, the Governor has withheld $210,000,000 of the Chapter 70 aid appropriation from distribution, pending receipt of sufficient revenues. We conclude that the funds appropriated by line item 7061-0008 are not subject to reduction pursuant to G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 9C.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Line item 7061-0008, under the headings of Department of Education, Board of Education and Commissioner\u2019s Office, appropriated more than $1,218,000,000 for \u201cschool aid to cities, towns, regional school districts, counties maintaining agricultural schools and independent vocational schools to be distributed pursuant to the provisions of section three of this act.\u201d Section 3 in turn recites that the \u201camounts to be distributed from item 7061-0008 of [\u00a7 2] are hereby deemed to be in full satisfaction of the amounts due under\u201d G. L. c. 70, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 6, and 7. Section 3 also states that \u201c [n] othwithstanding the provisions of any general or special law to the contrary, the total amounts to be distributed and paid to each city, town\u201d and other political subdivision from item 7061-0008 of \u00a7 2 of the act \u201cshall be [as] set forth\u201d in the list included in this section. That list recites the precise dollar amount of 706\u00cd-0008 Chapter 70 aid to be distributed to each municipality and political subdivision. Section 3 also provides that the State Treasurer shall make no payments to cities and towns pursuant to \u00a7 3 after November 30 of the fiscal year until he receives (1) certification from the Commissioner of Revenue concerning the prior year\u2019s financial reports submitted pursuant to G. L. c. 44, \u00a7 43 (1988 ed.), and (2) certification from the Commissioner of Education of acceptance of the end of year pupil and financial report submitted pursuant to G. L. c. 72, \u00a7 3 (1988 ed.). Section 4 of St. 1989, c. 240, directs the State Treasurer to make \u201ctwo equal payments\u201d of various assistance programs to cities and towns during each fiscal year.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">What these sections of the annual appropriation act provide is a specific amount of money for school aid to each city and town, in lieu of the amounts provided for in Chapter 70, notwithstanding the provisions of any general or special law to the contrary. The State Treasurer must pay to each city and town its specific amount in two equal payments during the fiscal year, but he may do so only after certain certifications have been delivered. These provisions are self-contained guidelines for the furnishing of Chapter 70 school aid in the 1990 fiscal year. They bar the application of G. L. c. 29, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 9B and 9C, or any other general or special law, to the determination of the amounts that must be paid as Chapter 70 aid. No party argues that \u00a7 3 of St. 1989, c. 240, is unlawful in any aspect because it is an improper provision for an annual appropriation act.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Even if \u00a7 3 did not bar the application of \u00a7\u00a7 9B and 9C to the appropriation for Chapter 70 aid, those sections do not authorize the Governor to reduce Chapter 70 local aid amounts set forth in \u00a7 3 of the 1990 fiscal year appropriation act. Section 9C of G. L. c. 29, which is set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> allows the Governor to reduce allotments under \u00a7 9B, in certain circumstances, when available revenues during a fiscal year will be insufficient to meet authorized expenditures. Section 9B, the first part of which is set forth in the margin,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>is the crucial statutory provision here. It describes which monies or allotments the Governor may reduce under \u00a7 9C. These monies or allotments are funds \u201cmade available by appropriation or otherwise, to state agencies under the control of the governor or a secretary.\u201d Section 9B also directs the Governor to divide each agency\u2019s funds into allotment periods. In this way, it is generally expected that an appropriation will be expended proportionately over the course of a fiscal year.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">The short answer to the question whether the Governor may use \u00a7 9C to reduce amounts appropriated by line item 7061-0008 is that the school aid funds appropriated by that line item, and assigned in specific amounts to cities and towns by \u00a7 3 of the fiscal year 1990 appropriation act, are not \u201cmade available\u201d to any State agency \u201cunder the control of the governor or a secretary.\u201d Neither the requirement that the Commissioners of Revenue and Education must certify certain information before the State Treasurer may distribute those school aid funds, nor the fact that the appropriation appears under the heading \u201cDepartment of Education\u201d makes those school aid funds available to any State agency described in \u00a7 9B. Moreover, the provision in \u00a7 4 of St. 1989, c. 240, that the school aid funds be distributed twice a year is inconsistent with the allotment provisions described in \u00a7 9B.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The provision in \u00a7 9C concerning reductions in \u00a7 9B allotments obviously has no application to amounts that are not subject to allotment, and amounts not available to agencies under the control of the Governor or one of his secretaries simply are not subject to allotment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>2. The plaintiffs claim that \u00a7 6 of St. 1989, c. 240, which purports to limit the distribution of State lottery funds as local aid in fiscal years 1989 and 1990, is unlawful. Their argument is that \u00a7 6, an outside section of the fiscal year 1990 general appropriation act, attempts to enact general legislation and that a general appropriation act may not lawfully be used for that purpose. We need not now decide whether an outside section not related to an appropriation may constitutionally be included in a general appropriation act because we conclude that \u00a7 6 is sufficiently related to the subject of the appropriation of funds that, even if the premise of the plaintiffs\u2019 argument is correct, \u00a7 6 is lawful.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> For the same reason, we need not decide whether G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 7L (1988 ed.), would apply to invalidate a nonappropriation-related outside section of a general appropriation act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Each quarter the balance in the State Lottery Fund, after deduction for expenses and prizes, is credited to the Local Aid Fund, established under G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 2D (1988 ed.). G. L. c. 10, \u00a7 35 (1988 ed.). Under G. L. c. 58, \u00a7 18C <em>(a) </em>(1988 ed.), the State Treasurer quarterly must distribute amounts credited to the Local Aid Fund to cities and towns \u201cwithout further appropriation.\u201d It is thus apparent that, under the General Laws, the Legislature has appropriated the net proceeds of the State lottery to cities and towns through the Local Aid Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Section 6 of St. 1989, c. 240, the second paragraph of which is quoted in the margin,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> if lawful, eliminated the planned automatic distribution of certain lottery funds to cities and towns for fiscal years 1989 and 1990. Under \u00a7 6, certain amounts of lottery funds in excess of $306,000,000 in each year are to be treated differently from the manner in which the General Laws provide. In modifying the normal appropriation of lottery funds made by the General Laws, the Legislature engaged in a process that directly concerns the appropriation of funds for local aid. See <em>Slama </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>384 Mass. 620, 625-626 (1981), and cases cited; G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 1 (1988 ed.), defining \u201cappropriation\u201d for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>purpose of G. L. c. 29; G. L. c. 29, \u00a7 7L, which, in turn, includes local aid within the permissible range of subjects to be included in an appropriation law. Cf. <em>Massachusetts Coalition for the Homeless </em>v. <em>Secretary of Human Servs., </em>400 Mass. 806, 816-817 (1987) (fixing the aid for dependent children standard of need in annual budget \u201cis not unambiguously a provision on a \u2018subject matter\u2019 other than an appropriation\u201d). Because \u00a7 6 relates to an appropriation, we need not consider the plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional and statutory challenges to \u00a7 6.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">We do not understand the defendants to argue that the plaintiffs lack standing to challenge \u00a7 6 on the ground that \u00a7 6 violates \u00a7 7L. The defendants do challenge the plaintiffs\u2019 standing to argue that \u00a7 6 could not constitutionally replace the local aid distribution procedure described in the General Laws. We have answered this challenge unfavorably to the plaintiffs, and, therefore, the standing question (which is not a jurisdictional one) need not be resolved.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">3. The plaintiffs urge us, in a generalized argument, to enforce G. L. c. 29B (1988 ed.), which provides in part for a \u201cgeneral appropriation bill which shall constitute a balanced budget for the commonwealth\u201d (G. L. c. 29B, \u00a7 2). Section 7 of G. L. c. 29B authorizes this court, and the Superior Court, to enforce its provisions on the petition of twenty-four taxable inhabitants, not more than six of whom shall be from any one county.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>The plaintiffs have made no specific proposal for judicial action under G. L. c. 29B. The defendants properly question the right of the Legislature and Governor to restrict their respective successors through G. L. c. 29B. The defendants also suggest that any order under G. L. c. 29B would present art. 30 (separation of powers) questions. We put aside the constitutional issues and simply state that the plaintiffs have failed to present an adequate basis for judicial action under G. L. c. 29B.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">4. A judgment shall be entered in the Superior Court declaring that (1) the procedures set forth in G. L. c. 29, \u00a7\u00a7 9B and 9C, did not authorize a reduction in the amounts of Chapter 70 aid provided in St. 1989, c. 240; (2) Statute 1989, c. 240, \u00a7 6, lawfully authorized the Legislature to limit the distributions to cities and towns from the proceeds of the State lottery during the 1989 and 1990 fiscal years; and (3) the plaintiffs are not entitled to relief under G. L. c. 29B.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b394-6\">General Laws, c. 29, \u00a7 9C (1988 ed.), provides: \u201cWhenever, in the opinion of the commissioner of administration, available revenues as determined by him from time to time during any fiscal year under the provisions of section five B will be insufficient to meet all of the expenditures authorized to be made from any fund, whether by appropriation or distribution, he shall immediately notify the governor and the house and senate committees on ways and means of the amount of such probable deficiency of revenue and the governor, within fifteen days of such notification, shall reduce allotments under section nine B or he shall submit to the general court specific proposals to raise additional revenues by a total amount equal to such deficiency.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">\u201cAs an alternative to the submission of such proposals to raise additional revenues and to the extent funds are available, the governor may recommend an appropriation equal to such deficiency from the Commonwealth Stabilization Fund in the manner provided in section two H.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b394-8\">General Laws c. 29, \u00a7 9B (1988 ed.), provides, in pertinent part: \u201cAny monies made available by appropriation or otherwise, to state agencies under the control of the governor or a secretary, but not including the courts, the office of the governor, or the office of the lieutenant governor, shall be expended only in such amounts as may be allotted as provided in this section. The governor shall from time to time divide each fiscal year into allotment periods of not less than one month nor more than four months. The governor or the commissioner when designated in writing by the governor shall allot to each such state agency the amount which it may expend for each such period out of the sums made available to it by appropriation or otherwise. The amount so allotted initially by the governor or the commissioner shall be equal to an amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: the annual sum available for expenditure divided by twelve multiplied by the number of months in the allotment period, unless the full legislative objective of an appropriation would be ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>complished, without amendment, by a lesser allocation than that required by the formula.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Because we rule that the Governor had no statutory authority to reduce the line item 7061-0008 amounts (appropriated in lieu of Chapter 70 aid), we need not address the plaintiffs\u2019 various constitutional arguments, including (1) a challenge to \u00a7 9C as an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority in violation of the separation of powers principles expressed in art. 30 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights and (2) a challenge to \u00a7 9C\u2019s validity because it was adopted as an outside section of a general appropriation act (St. 1976, c. 283, \u00a7 3F). If \u00a7 9C had a dubious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>birth, it may have been legitimized by its amendment in 1986 (St. 1986, c. 488, \u00a7 13). We need not address the defendants\u2019 argument that the plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 9C.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Certain amici have raised other arguments challenging the Governor\u2019s action with specific reference to the time of his action in relation to other steps taken in the budget process. In a case such as this, we normally would not pass on issues that a party has not raised and argued or adopted by reference to an amicus brief. In any event, resolution of the arguments of certain amici is not necessary because of our decision, on other grounds, that the Governor lacked authority to withhold local aid funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">The constitutional issues would be worthy of attention, however, to the extent that a construction of \u00a7 9B and \u00a7 9C that avoids those issues would be appropriate to resolve any ambiguity in those sections. See <em>Adamowicz </em>v. <em>Ipswich, </em>395 Mass. 757, 763-764 (1985). We need not resort to that principle of statutory construction because this case presents no statutory ambiguity concerning the Governor\u2019s authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b396-8\">The Justices have noted the question whether such separable provisions may properly be included in a general appropriation bill. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>384 Mass. 820, 826 (1981). The court has never decided the question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b396-9\">General Laws c. 29, \u00a7 7L, states that a \u201claw making an appropriation for expenses of the commonwealth [including local aid] shall not contain provisions on any other subject matter.\u201d We have expressed doubt whether \u00a7 7L can restrict a Legislature and Governor that wish to do otherwise. <em>Massachusetts Coalition for the Homeless </em>v. <em>Secretary of Human Servs., </em>400 Mass. 806, 816 (1987). Because we conclude that, even if applicable, \u00a7 7L does not forbid a provision such as St. 1989, c. 240, \u00a7 6, we need not resolve the question of \u00a7 7L\u2019s effectiveness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b397-6\">\u201cNothwithstanding the provisions of any general or special law to the contrary, the lottery distribution to cities and towns for the fiscal year ending June [30, 1989] shall not exceed [$306,000,000]; provided, further, that the lottery distribution to cities and towns for the fiscal year ending June [30, 1990] shall also not exceed [$306,000,000]; provided, further, that the first [$20,000,000] available for transfer from the Lottery Fund to the Local Aid Fund in the fiscal year ending June [30, 1990] shall be transferred to a retained revenue account within the executive office for administration and finance and shall be expended for the purposes of item 1599-3850 of section two C; provided, further, that any amount in the balance of the Lottery Fund at the end of such fiscal years shall be transferred to the Local Aid Fund and be available for lawful appropriations allowed from the Local Aid Fund; and provided, however, if the total combined amount for said fiscal years so transferred to the Local Aid Fund for appropriation exceeds [$34,000,000], any amount in excess of [$34,000,000] shall be distributed by the treasurer from the Local Aid Fund in accordance with the provisions of clause (c) of section thirty-five of chapter ten of the General Laws, in a manner proportional to said lottery distribution of said funds for the fiscal year ending June [30, 1989].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b398-7\">The challenge to \u00a7 6 as not involving an appropriation (or as involving subject matter other than an appropriation) is particularly unpersuasive in the context of St. 1989, c. 240, because in other portions of that act the Legislature provided for local aid that could have been restricted to achieve the local aid result it sought through \u00a7 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b398-8\">It does appear that the question whether local aid funds should be distributed pursuant to \u00a7 6, or in total disregard of \u00a7 6, is one that directly and specially affects all the plaintiff municipalities. If the plaintiff municipalities lack standing to challenge the lawfulness of \u00a7 6, no one else is likely to have any greater standing to do so. We would be reluctant to tolerate a situation in which allegedly unconstitutional conduct would be free from judicial scrutiny even on the request of an entity most directly affected by the alleged unlawful conduct.

The officials in this case have not made the requisite showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Thus, neither the municipalities nor the individuals who are plaintiffs in their official capacities (such as selectmen, mayors, and school committee members) have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statutes at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">c. <em>Individuals. </em>The plaintiffs in their individual capacities as residents and taxpayers must have suffered, or be in danger of suffering, legal harm in order to compel the courts to pass on the validity of the acts of a coordinate branch of government. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>The Governor, </em>381 Mass. 702, 704 (1980). This requirement is not avoided by a prayer for declaratory relief. <em>Id. </em>Over sixty years ago this court described as a \u201cgeneral principle\u201d the concept that only one whose rights are impaired may question in court the constitutionality of a statute. The court stated: \u201cIt is only when some person in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>vokes [the] aid [of the courts] to protect him in his liberty, rights or property as secured under the Constitution against invasion through the operation of a statute, that the courts examine objections to its constitutionality.\u201d <em>Horton </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>269 Mass. 503, 513-514 (1929). The court added that, in order to question the validity of a statute, one must be directly affected as to some personal interest. <em>Id. </em>at 514. The principle that strangers have no standing in the courts is considered to be \u201ca part of the very fabric of our law.\u201d <em>McGlue </em>v. <em>County Comm\u2019rs of Essex, </em>225 Mass. 59, 60 (1916).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Additionally, for plaintiffs to invoke the remedy of declaratory judgment under G. L. c. 231A (1988 ed.), there must be more than controversy in the abstract; there must be a legally cognizable injury entitling a person to initiate judicial resolution of the controversy. <em>Massachusetts Ass\u2019n of Indep. Ins. Agents &amp; Brokers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>373 Mass. 290, 293 (1977). See G. L. c. 231A, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 9. Only one who can allege an injury within the area of concern of the statute under which the injurious action has occurred has standing. <em>Id. </em>In declaratory judgment proceedings this court has required that one who seeks declaratory relief must allege a breach of any duty owed to him. <em>Penal Inst. Comm\u2019r for Suffolk County </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>382 Mass. 527, 532 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The plaintiffs point to \u201cthe severe reductions of local services they and others . . . suffer as a result of . . . the Governor\u2019s withholding of local aid\u201d; mention \u201ccutbacks in education, public works, police, fire and general government services\u201d; and claim that these are particularized injuries directly affecting each plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The argument is not so persuasive as to warrant a grant of standing in the individual plaintiffs. While reductions of local services may occur, I am not persuaded that the plaintiffs in their individual capacities have suffered, or are in danger of suffering, <em>legal </em>harm; that a personal interest is <em>directly </em>affected; that their <em>rights </em>have been impaired; that they have demonstrated <em>legally cognizable injury; </em>or shown a breach of any <em>duty. </em>Moreover, any reductions in local services may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>attributable, at least in part, to other factors such as a lack of additional local revenue or the absence of expenditure adjustments which could contribute to an ability of the Commonwealth to continue to provide a comparable level of services.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Although, in the past, the court has recognized variations on these principles, they are not ones which aid the plaintiffs in this case. Individuals who were citizens and qualified voters had standing to argue that a measure commonly known as Proposition <em>2xh </em>was not constitutionally adopted. <em>Massachusetts Teachers Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>384 Mass. 209, 214 (1981). See <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>354 Mass. 384, 387 (1968), and cases cited (standing shown to question whether proposed initiative amendment contains excluded matter). It is true that the court has considered actions brought by \u201cprivate parties who are legitimately concerned in the performance by public officers of a public duty.\u201d <em>Quinn </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Plymouth, </em>332 Mass. 410, 413 (1955), quoting <em>Cape Cod S.S. Co. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Provincetown, </em>295 Mass. 65, 69 (1936), and cases cited. See <em>Police Comm\u2019r of Boston </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>279 Mass. 577, 585 (1932), and <em>Brooks </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>257 Mass. 91, 93 (1926). However, the opportunity is applicable to actions for relief in the nature of mandamus; these plaintiffs request declaratory relief from this court. See <em>Brewster </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>195 Mass. 222, 224-225 (1907).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">d. <em>Summary. </em>I conclude that neither the municipalities nor their officials have standing to challenge the constitutionality <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>of the statutes and actions at issue. The plaintiffs in their individual capacities as residents and taxpayers do not have standing to challenge any of the statutes or actions on constitutional grounds.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b401-8\">In <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Essex, supra </em>at 329, the court did consider the issues raised by the Attorney General because he had standing to raise those challenges and was a party.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b401-9\">If the allegation of injury is insufficient, the municipality may lack standing even where it claims to act in a representative capacity. <em>Slama </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>384 Mass. 620, 624-625 (1981). See <em>Massachusetts Ass'n of Indep. Ins. Agents &amp; Brokers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>373 Mass. 290, 296-298 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b403-7\">The court has expressed itself in some declaratory proceedings in which the issue of standing was a significant question. For example, in <em>School Comm. of Boston </em>v. <em>Board of Educ., </em>352 Mass. 693, 697 (1967), the court decided to indicate its views in a declaratory proceeding \u201cinvolving questions of pressing public importance\u201d and \u201cwhere a vista of avoidable litigation ... is disclosed and the issues have been fully argued.\u201d The court noted that this is a matter of discretion for the court and observed that both the plaintiffs and the defendants had expressed the hope that the constitutional issues would be decided. <em>Id. </em>at 696-697. See <em>Wellesley College </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>313 Mass. 722, 731 (1943). Apparently the court does not rely on this principle of discretion in its present decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
