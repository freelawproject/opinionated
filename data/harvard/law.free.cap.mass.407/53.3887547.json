The Commonwealth\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>application to pursue an interlocutory appeal was allowed. See Mass. R. Crim. P. 15 (a) (2), 378 Mass. 883 (1979). We agree with the motion judge that the affidavit in support of the search warrant in this case failed to establish probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">On May 6, 1987, Detective Daniel F. O\u2019Connor of the Worcester police department\u2019s vice squad applied for a warrant to search apartment 3 at 19 Great Brook Valley Avenue in Worcester. The following are relevant portions of the affidavit in support of the application for the search warrant:</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">\u201cI, Daniel F. O\u2019Connor being duly sworn, depose and say:</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">1. I am currently a Detective in the Worcester Police Vice Squad, a position of which I have continuously held for the past four years. Presently I am assigned to the District Attorney\u2019s Drug Task Force located at 332 Main Street, Worcester, Massachusetts. During my career I have been involved in several hundred of narcotic investigations including heroin and cocaine investigations.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">\u201c2.1 have information based upon a confidential and reliable informant. For the purpose of the affidavit I will hereinafter refer to this informant as CRI-1. CRI-1 is a person who has given your affiant information in the past which has proved to be accurate and true. CRI-1 has given information that has led to the arrest of persons in the city of Worcester for violations of the controlled substance act. Two such arrests were that of Rafaela Ortiz and Augustine Ortiz on January 16, 1987. Rafael Oritiz [\u00edzc] and Augustine Ortiz were arrested for possession of heroin with intent to distribute. These cases are currently pending in Worcester District Court. For the purpose of this affidavit this informant will hereinafter be referred to as CI-1. Your affiant has met with CI-1 numerous times in the last week and most recently this date. CI-1 advised that he/she has purchased cocaine from 19 Great Brook Valley Ave., apt. #3 Worcester, Massachusetts. CI-1 also stated that he/she and other certain cocaine users would go to this apartment and purchase cocaine. CI-1 further stated that he/she would purchase this cocaine from a Spanish male named Jorge Melendez and also a Spanish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>female by the name of Nereida Cruz. CI-1 stated that he/ she has purchased cocaine from 19 Great Brook Valley Ave. second floor Apt. #3 within the last 24 hours. The white powder that CI-1 purchased from Jorge was injected into CI-l\u2019s arm was in fact cocaine. CI-1 further stated that Jorge and Nereida are major distributors of cocaine from this apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">\u201cOn July 2, 1986 Jorge Melendez was arrested by Troopers Jeffrey Stone and Ronald Ford for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. Melendez later plead guilty to possession of cocaine in Worcester Superior Court and placed on two years probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">\u201cOn this date a check with the Great Brook Valley housing authority as to the residents of 19 Great Brook Valley Ave., Apt. #3 revealed that this apartment is leased to Nerida |&gt;zc] Cruz.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">A magistrate issued a warrant to search the apartment, and on May 7, 1987, the police seized, among other things, plastic bags and paper packets containing white powder believed to be cocaine. The judge granted the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence seized, ruling that the affidavit failed to meet the requirements of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>394 Mass. 363 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">\u201cUnder art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, a magistrate, before issuing a search warrant, must determine that probable cause exists.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rojas, </em>403 Mass. 483, 485 (1988), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, supra. </em>\u201cIn <em>Upton, </em>we held that, under art. 14 . . . the test for determining probable cause in cases involving unnamed informants incorporates the principles developed under <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, </em>393 U.S. 410 (1969), and <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108 (1964)\u201d (footnote omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saleh, </em>396 Mass. 406, 409 (1985). \u201cUnder the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>standard, if an affidavit is based on information from an unknown informant, the magistrate must \u2018be informed of (1) some of the underlying circumstances from which the informant concluded that the contraband was where he claimed it was (the basis of knowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>test), and (2) some of the underlying circumstances from which the affiant concluded that the informant was \u201ccredible\u201d or his information \u201creliable\u201d (the veracity test). <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Texas, supra </em>at 114. If the informant\u2019s tip does not satisfy each aspect of the <em>Aguilar </em>test, other allegations in the affidavit that corroborate the information could support a finding of probable cause. <em>Spinelli </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 415.\u2019\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, supra </em>at 374-375.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The affidavit in this case failed to satisfy the veracity test.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Commonwealth, in arguing that the informant was reliable, relies principally upon certain statements in the affidavit which indicate that he (or she) purchased and used cocaine. The Commonwealth asserts that these remarks constituted statements against penal interest and thus buttressed the informant\u2019s veracity. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">In order for a statement to be considered by the magistrate to be a statement against penal interest, there must be information in the affidavit which tends to show that the informant would have had a reasonable fear of prosecution at the time that he made the statement. See 1 W.R. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 3.3(c), at 645-646 (2d ed. 1987); <em>People </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>66 N.Y.2d 398 (1985); Comment, The Supreme Court, 1970 Term, 85 Harv. L. Rev. 53, 60 (1971); Note, Probable Cause and the First-Time Informer, 43 U. Colo. L. Rev. 357, 367 (1972). \u201cCourts . . . should not utilize the admission against-penal-interest concept in a blunderbuss fashion, but instead should assess in a more careful fashion, preferably upon a full disclosure by the police of all relevant circumstances, what the significance of that admission is in the context of the particular case.\u201d 1 W.R. LaFave, <em>supra</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>See <em>People </em>v. Johnson, <em>supra </em>(\u201cSuch admissions are not guarantees of truthfulness and they should be accepted only after careful consideration of all the relevant circumstances of the case indicates that there exists a basis for finding reliability\u201d). Statements may be more credible if there is a threat of police retaliation for giving false information. See 1 W.R. LaFave, <em>supra </em>at 649-650.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">For example, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parapar, </em>404 Mass. 319 (1989), immediately after being arrested for cocaine trafficking and after the police had made three undercover cocaine purchases, the informant told the police where he had obtained the cocaine. In these circumstances, one could infer that the informant had an actual fear of being prosecuted. Similarly, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vynorius, </em>369 Mass. 17 (1975), the affiant police officer caught the informant red-handed, his pockets stuffed with marihuana. After the informant confessed his drug purchase, he turned over the contraband to the police officer and gave him the information that the officer used as the basis for the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">In contrast, the statement in this case did not indicate any circumstances which would cause the informant to have a reasonable fear of prosecution. The statement was unaccompanied by any physical evidence. Indeed, it is likely that the uncorroborated confession, in and of itself, would have been insufficient to prove guilt. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Leonard, 401 Mass. 470, 472 (1988). The likelihood of prosecution was rather remote. One might infer in a case like this that the informant was a \u201cprotected stool pigeon\u201d whose inaccuracies or indiscretions are tolerated on a continuing basis in exchange for information. See 1 W.R. LaFave, <em>supra </em>at 647. See also Comment, The Supreme Court, 1970 Term, 85 Harv. L. Rev., <em>supra </em>at 60. In such a case, he would have little to fear from giving false information. See 1 W.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>LaFave, <em>supra </em>at 647.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See Note, Probable Cause and the First-Time Informer, 43 U. Colo. L. Rev., <em>supra </em>at 367.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AiZ\">The Commonwealth additionally argues that the fact that the defendant had once pleaded guilty to cocaine possession corroborated the informant\u2019s veracity. We disagree. \u201cA defendant\u2019s criminal history may be factored into a probable cause determination as corroboration of an informant\u2019s tip, but only if the history is sufficiently recent and similar to the crime charged to demonstrate that \u2018the defendant was not averse\u2019 to committing such a crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>406 Mass. 575, 579 (1990), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Germain, </em>396 Mass. 413, 418 n.7 (1985). In <em>Germain, </em>the defendant had a record of crimes similar to that of armed robbery, for which he was charged, including theft, possession of a .32 caliber gun, and possession of burglarious tools. We stated that this criminal history showed \u201cconduct from which the inference may be drawn that the defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>not averse\u201d to committing the crime for which he was under investigation. <em>Id. </em>at 418 n.7. In contrast, in this case, the sole guilty plea for a possession offense did not show conduct which demonstrated the defendant\u2019s proclivity to engage in drug dealing and it should not have been given weight in a probable cause determination.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The fact that the informant gave information on one occasion in the past which led to the arrest of two individuals is insufficient to satisfy the veracity test. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rojas, </em>403 Mass. 483, 486 (1988). The Commonwealth does not argue, and thus we need not consider, whether the fact that the arrestees\u2019 cases were pending at the time of the affidavit furnished an indicium of reliability not present in <em>Rojas. </em>Even assuming that there is more here than in <em>Rojas, </em>we do not think that the affidavit sufficiently established the informant\u2019s veracity. Standing alone, the aforementioned information did not furnish an independent basis for deeming the informant reliable. As we have determined that the other aspects of the affidavit did not comport with the requirements of <em>Upton, </em>we conclude that the motion judge was correct in ruling that the affidavit failed to establish probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The orders allowing the defendants\u2019 motions to suppress in this case and in the companion case are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b70-7\">The defendant concedes that the information in the affidavit satisfied the basis of knowledge test.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b70-8\">We do not mean to suggest that the standard for determining probable cause should be as strict as that needed for the admission of evidence in a trial. The question is not whether the evidence is admissible at trial, but whether it \u201cmeets preliminary requirements sufficient to merit its consideration by any tribunal. One of these prerequisites ... is that the admission of a crime must be, in fact, against the declarant\u2019s interest. Admissions, when found to be against interest, are considered credible because it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>assumed that persons do not make statements damaging to themselves unless satisfied they are true. Admissions need not always be against the declarant\u2019s interest, however; and, if they are not, the basis for believing them is destroyed.\u201d (Footnotes omitted). Note, Probable Cause and the First-Time Informer, 43 U. Colo. L. Rev. 357, 367 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b72-5\">For these reasons, according to LaFave, the disclosure of an informant\u2019s identity calls for \u201cparticular caution\u201d and should carry \u201clittle weight,\u201d even though the identity of the informant is known to the police. 1 W.R. LaFave, <em>supra </em>at 647.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">At any rate, a magistrate could not reasonably infer that the affiant knew the actual identity of the informant. The fact that the affiant met with the informant does not imply that he knew his name or address or that he could readily reach the informant had the information proved to be false. Without any indication whether the affiant actually knew the informant\u2019s identity, it is impossible to conclude that the informant had any reasonable fear of prosecution. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>406 Mass. 575 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b72-7\">The Commonwealth\u2019s reliance on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nowells, </em>390 Mass. 621, 626 (1983), is misplaced. <em>Nowells </em>held that it is necessary <em>at the very least, </em>that the statement provide a reliable basis for concluding that the informant committed a crime. It did <em>not </em>hold that any statement which remotely opens the declarant to criminal prosecution is automatically to be considered a statement against penal interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">In addition, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Norris, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 761 (1978), like <em>Vynorius </em>and <em>Parapar, </em>involved an informant who gave information following his arrest. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kiley, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 939 (1981), is a rescript which does not even recite the facts of the affidavit. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Atchue, </em>393 Mass. 343, 347 n.3 (1984), dealt with a named and identified informant. But see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benlien, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 834, 837-838 n.4 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b73-9\">The Commonwealth admits that the information in the affidavit regarding the lessee of the apartment cannot be considered to corroborate the informant\u2019s veracity. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bottari, </em>395 Mass. 777, 784 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b73-8\">Greaney, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMq\">(dissenting). The court\u2019s consideration of the affidavit in this case is flawed in three fundamental respects. First, the court leaves to the end of its opinion, and then brushes aside, the single most important piece of material pertaining to the informant\u2019s veracity \u2014 the fact that the informant had furnished information in the past to Detective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>O\u2019Connor which led to the arrests and prosecutions in the Worcester District Court of two named individuals for serious violations of the controlled substance laws. Following this omission, the court isolates two pieces of corroborative information \u2014 the defendant\u2019s recent conviction of possession of cocaine and the informant\u2019s admission to the recent purchase and use of cocaine \u2014 and deals with them as though they were the only facts relevant to a determination of the informant\u2019s veracity. Finally, having dissected the affidavit in this fashion, the court evades study of the document as an organic whole and shuns application to its contents of the well-established principles which admonish us to consider the information in the affidavit in an ordinary, commonsense manner without hypertechnical analysis, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ventresca, </em>380 U.S. 102, 109 (1965); to give weight to the magistrate\u2019s determination that probable cause exists, <em>Commonwealth v. Upton, </em>394 Mass. 363, 377 (1985) <em>(Upton II); Commonwealth v. Atchue, </em>393 Mass. 343, 346 (1984); and to resolve marginal cases in favor of finding probable cause, <em>United States v. Ventresca, supra </em>at 108-109; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>358 Mass. 747, 750 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Proper analysis of the affidavit should begin with Detective O\u2019Connor\u2019s statement that the informant \u201chas given information that has led to the arrest of persons in the city of Worcester for violations of the controlled substance act. Two such arrests were that of Rafaela Ortiz and Augustine Ortiz on January 16, 1987. Rafael Oritiz [j/c] and Augustine Ortiz were arrested for possession of heroin with intent to distribute. These cases are currently pending in Worcester District Court.\u201d This information is relegated to the last full substantive paragraph of the court\u2019s opinion and then promptly disregarded in a conclusory statement or two unsupported by the citation of any authority.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>The information quoted indicates that the informant has provided the police with past tips which they have been able to convert into prosecutions. A key in determining whether an informant\u2019s past record independently establishes his veracity is the degree of success with which the authorities have pursued individuals named by him in past tips. While a \u201cnaked assertion\u201d in an affidavit that an informant has given past tips which have led to arrests is not sufficient by itself to establish veracity, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rojas, </em>403 Mass. 483, 486 (1989), it is quite clear that proof of information leading to a past conviction is not necessary to a finding of veracity.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The magistrate who issued the warrant in this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>could reasonably have inferred that the past tips given by the informant had led to more than mere arrests \u2014 the arrests of the individuals named in the affidavit (Rafaela Ortiz and Augustine Ortiz) had resulted, at the time the affidavit was prepared, in determinations that factual and legal bases existed for the issuance of a complaint against each Ortiz for a narcotics offense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The inferences that follow from this are strong. This informant, a drug purchaser and user, associates with persons in Worcester who deal in drugs. He knows enough about these dealers and their illegal activities to furnish grounds for arresting and prosecuting two of them. The fact that prosecutions resulted from these two arrests, therefore, provides a strong indication of reliability which was not present in the <em>Rojas </em>case. In particular, the subsequent prosecutions support a conclusion that the past tip contained reliable infer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>mation. \u201c[A] determination of the informant\u2019s credibility could properly be made where it is revealed not simply that arrests were made, but rather that the prior information led to \u2018arrests and prosecutions.\u2019 \u201d 1 W.R. LaFave, Search and Seizure <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 3.3(b), at 634. Our facts resemble those in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saleh, </em>396 Mass. 406 (1985), where this court found that the informant\u2019s veracity had been established solely on the basis of his past tips, which had resulted in three arrests and Federal indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The information discussed above may well be enough by itself to establish veracity. Any doubt on the matter, however, is dispelled by the two pieces of corroboration contained in the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The first is the fact that the defendant recently has been convicted of possession of cocaine. There can be no question that a prior conviction of the person incriminated by an informant\u2019s tip can provide corroboration of the informant\u2019s veracity if the prior conviction is recent and involves a crime similar to the one alleged in the tip. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>406 Mass. 575, 579 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Germain, </em>396 Mass. 413, 418 n.7 (1985). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Labelle, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 175, 180 (1983) (prior record of defendant for similar offense is relevant corroboration). The prior conviction in the instant case falls into this category. The affidavit discloses that the defendant Jorge Melendez was arrested on July 2, 1986 \u2014less than one year before the date the affidavit was prepared (May 6, 1987) \u2014 and that he entered a guilty plea at a later date. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, supra </em>(four year old conviction too remote). Furthermore, the charge in Melendez\u2019s prior case was possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, which is precisely the charge alleged in the informant\u2019s tip. The statement regarding the prior conviction on a cocaine charge corroborates the informant\u2019s tip, and thus provides relevant material on the issue of veracity. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>390 Mass. 562, 572 n.8 (1983) <em>(Upton I) </em>(noting that an affidavit which failed the veracity prong would have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>\u201csomewhat strengthened\u201d had it included reference to the defendant\u2019s prior conviction on a similar charge).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The court, however, states that the conviction did not show \u201cconduct which demonstrated the defendant\u2019s proclivity to engage in drug dealing and it should not have been given weight in a probable cause determination.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 59. I do not know quite what this statement means. A recent drug conviction certainly indicates a defendant\u2019s willingness to commit the same crime again. Only the naive would think that every drug dealer will \u201cgo straight\u201d after he has been once caught and convicted. If the statement suggests, as I think it does, that a defendant\u2019s prior criminal record is not relevant to a probable cause inquiry unless the record consists of more than one conviction, then it is both fundamentally wrong,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and devoid of support in our case law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AjX1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>No set length should be adopted as an inflexible minimum when a defendant\u2019s prior criminal record is being considered in a probable cause examination. The proper focus should be on the record\u2019s intrinsic probative value. See 1 W.R. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 3.2(d), at 581 (2d ed. 1987). As Professor LaFave notes: \u201cwhere the past criminal conduct bears a sufficient similarity either because of the nature of the crime or the manner of its execution to the act in question, so as to give rise to a reasonable inference that the same person committed both acts, this fact can be considered along with the other available information in a determination of probable cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 582, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gullett, </em>459 Pa. 431, 441 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">I urge close adherence to the probative value standard, as manifested by the requirements we enunciated in <em>Germain </em>(prior conviction must be recent and for a similar offense), and which were cited with approval in Professor LaFave\u2019s treatise. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Germain, <em>supra </em>at 418 n.7; 1 W.R. LaFave, <em>supra </em>at 582 nn. 112 &amp; 113. Under this standard, a single prior conviction could carry probative value, and thus be relevant to the probable cause inquiry, if it is recent and for a substantially similar offense. I would avoid interjecting into the analysis any suggestion of a rigid mechanical rule which attempts to provide a shorthand solution to the intrinsic probative value inquiry. The defendant Melendez\u2019s prior conviction clearly meets the probative value standard and should not be rejected as part of the probable cause analysis in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The second piece of corroborative material in the affidavit is the informant\u2019s statement that he had purchased cocaine from Melendez within the past twenty-four hours and injected it into his arm. The court refuses to consider the statement as one against the informant\u2019s penal interest for two reasons: the statement was not made in circumstances which would indicate that the informant had a reasonable fear of prosecution, and \u201cthe uncorroborated confession, in and of itself, would have been insufficient' to prove guilt.\u201d <em>Ante </em>57. The latter point is simply wrong. In a probable cause analy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>sis, we are not concerned with the standard that governs evidence at a trial, or the adequacy of a fact to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. We are concerned only with probable cause, a considerably less demanding standard of proof. It is unfair to the Commonwealth, and confuses the law, to import standards applicable in other areas into this aspect of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">In the context of search warrant applications, we have said that statements against penal interest may be considered relevant to establishing veracity if they \u201cprovide a ground for concluding [that the informant] committed a crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nowells, </em>390 Mass. 621, 626 (1983). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parapar, </em>404 Mass. 319, 322 (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alessio, </em>377 Mass. 76, 81 (1979). See also 1 W.R. LaFave, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 3.3 (c), at 644 n.140 (noting that courts regularly hold that a statement against penal interest is a factor to be considered on showing of reliability, and citing to several such cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Here, the informant admitted to having purchased cocaine from both defendants on several occasions, the most recent purchase having occurred within the twenty-four hours preceding Detective O\u2019Connor\u2019s preparation of the affidavit. This statement implicates the informant in the crime of possession of a class B controlled substance. See G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A (1988 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">The informant\u2019s statement in this case compares quite favorably with statements which have been deemed relevant evidence of veracity in other search warrant affidavits.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The statement is much stronger than other statements, which required a conclusion about the informant\u2019s criminal culpabil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>ity to be reached by implication, but which were still found to support an informant\u2019s veracity.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">I am cognizant of the danger inherent in applying a statement against penal interest made by an informant in a \u201cblunderbuss fashion.\u201d 1 W.R. LaFave, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 3.3(c), at 645. Detective O\u2019Connor may have promised the informant a \u201cbreak of some sort\u201d in exchange for the information, and it may not be entirely satisfactory to explain the situation by saying, as some courts do, that a promise of special treatment \u201cdoes not eliminate the residual risk and opprobrium of having admitted criminal conduct.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>403 U.S. 573, 583-584 (1971). 1 W.R. LaFave, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 3.3(c), at 649-650, 657. However, although the informant might not be in immediate danger of prosecution, his admission still carries an indication of reliability because of his fear that providing the police with misleading information will not bode well for him in the future. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Norris, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 761, 765 (1978); 1 W.R. LaFave, <em>supra. </em>The fact remains that, if the given information turns out to be false, the police have leverage over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>informant and could punish him in many ways including a disclosure of his identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">The fact that Detective O\u2019Connor knew the informant\u2019s identity is also critical.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Due to his lack of anonymity, the informant likely would have perceived his remarks as risky and inculpatory. See l W.R. LaFave, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 3.3(c), at 647 (noting that a \u201ccritical fact\u201d regarding the weight to be attached to statements against penal interest is whether the informant\u2019s identity is known to police). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Alessio, </em>377 Mass. 76, 81-82 (1979) (reasoning that police ignorance of informant\u2019s identity undermines value of . statement against penal interest). I would conclude that the informant\u2019s admission to purchasing and using cocaine from the defendants, because he is an informant known to the officer making the affidavit, is further relevant corroboration of his veracity.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">Considered in the aggregate, the material in the affidavit describes an informant, known to Detective O\u2019Connor, who had a good record of past performance, and whose information is corroborated by Melendez\u2019s recent conviction of a similar drug charge and the informant\u2019s statement against his penal interest. The affidavit provides an adequate basis to find the informant reliable, a conclusion fortified by comparison of the information in this case with that in cases in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>this court has found that the veracity prong has not been satisfied.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> I would so hold.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b74-6\"> do not agree with the court\u2019s assertion that the Commonwealth has not argued the importance of these facts. The Commonwealth\u2019s brief relies upon \u201cthe informant\u2019s prior tips,\u201d together with the other information in the affidavit, as \u201cconverg[ing] to satisfy the veracity test.\u201d Although the Commonwealth does not clearly distinguish this information from that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>which we found deficient in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rojas, </em>403 Mass. 483 (1988), it does rely upon the arrests and prosecutions as important to establishing probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Further, we have a clear obligation to examine an issue which concerns the validity of a criminal prosecution. As the United States Supreme Court has pointed out in the analogous area of confessions of error by the prosecution: \u201c[O]ur judicial obligations compel us to examine independently [issues on appeal]. . . . The public interest that a result be reached which promotes a well-ordered society is foremost in every criminal proceeding. That interest is entrusted to our consideration and protection as well as to that of the enforcing officers. Furthermore, our judgments are precedents, and the proper administration of the criminal law cannot be left merely to the stipulation of parties.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Young </em>v. <em>United States, </em>315 U.S. 257, 258-259 (1941). See <em>Sibron </em>v. <em>New York, </em>392 U.S. 40, 58-59 (1968). This directive is especially true when the highest appellate court in a State has before it an affidavit supporting an application for a search warrant, the consideration of which involves only a question of law. Ignoring the issue produces an opinion that leaves the law on a vital topic of criminal law in an unsatisfactory state, calling into doubt the validity of many other affidavits..</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b75-7\">See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>566 F.2d 623, 625 (8th Cir. 1977) (rejecting defendant\u2019s argument that veracity requires showing of information leading to successful prosecutions or convictions); 1 W.R. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 3.3(b), at 629 (2d ed. 1987) (stating that it \u201cclearly is not the case\u201d that veracity prong requires showing of past tip leading to at least one conviction). Our decisions also have adhered to this view, holding that veracity exists, based on the informant\u2019s past record and other indicia of reliability, despite the absence of a past conviction. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Valdez, </em>402 Mass. 65 (1988) (past tip led to one arrest on outstanding warrant); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saleh, </em>396 Mass. 406 (1985) (past tips led to three arrests and Federal indictments); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hason, </em>387 Mass. 169 (1982) (past tips provided \u201caccurate information to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>tile police on three previous occasions\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v, <em>Stewart, </em>358 Mass. 747 (1971) (past tip led to discovery of evidence).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b76-7\">The fact that the Ortizes\u2019 cases had been pending for four months (at the time the affidavit was prepared) reveals that criminal complaints must have issued against them. See G. L. c. 263, \u00a7 4 (1988 ed.) (no person may be held to answer for alleged crime in the District Court unless a complaint has issued); Mass. R. Crim. P. 3 (a), 378 Mass. 847 (1979) (same). The existence of these complaints would indicate to the clerk magistrate examining this affidavit at least the following: If each Ortiz was arrested on an arrest warrant, a judicial officer would have found probable cause before any arrest warrant issued, thereby authenticating the informant\u2019s tips. See G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 33 (1988 ed.). If arrest warrants were not used, a clerk magistrate would have concluded that a factual and legal basis existed to issue complaints for possession of heroin with intent to distribute. Each Ortiz then would have been arraigned promptly, see G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 38 (1988 ed.) (if arrested without a warrant, arrestee must be brought before a judge as soon as possible after arrest); District Court Standards of Judicial Practice, The Complaint Procedure, Standard 2:00 &amp; Commentary (1975) (arraignment in District Court routinely occurs no later than next business day after arrest), and separately examined by a judge who would make at least a preliminary determination of probable cause. See G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 22; K.B. Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7\u00a7 625, 626 (2d ed. 1983); District Court Standards of Judicial Practice, The Complaint Procedure, Standard 2:00, <em>supra. </em>A clerk-magistrate in the District Court issued this warrant. This magistrate would have had special experience with respect to the District Court\u2019s procedure in the issuance of arrest warrants and complaints.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Professor LaFave, upon whom the court heavily relies, argues that a single prior conviction which meets the tests of recency and similarity is relevant evidence of an informant\u2019s veracity. See 1 W.R. LaFave, Search and Seizure \u00a7 3.2(d), at 582, 585-586 (2d ed. 1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b78-7\">The court\u2019s conclusion, <em>ante </em>at 58-59, that a \u201csole guilty plea\u201d does not show a \u201cconduct from which the inference may be drawn that the defendant was not averse\u201d to committing the crime currently charged is based solely on a footnote in the <em>Germain </em>case. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Germain, </em>396 Mass. <em>413, </em>418 n.7 (1985). However, the <em>Germain </em>court in no way suggested that any minimum number of convictions must be present before a magistrate may rely on a past criminal record as a sign of reliability. Furthermore, the court\u2019s analysis completely ignores the two requirements we <em>did </em>set forth in <em>Germain </em>\u2014 that the past criminal record must be recent and similar to the crime currently alleged. <em>Germain, supra. Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>406 Mass. 575, 579 (1990). A proper application of the <em>Germain </em>factors reveals that the defendant\u2019s past record in this case is at least as relevant to the probable cause inquiry as was that of the defendant in <em>Germain. </em>The <em>Germain </em>defendant did have multiple past convictions, but all except one of the convictions upon which the court relied in finding probable cause (possession of a .32 caliber handgun) stemmed from a single event. Furthermore, those convictions were approximately one and one-half years old, and for substantially dissimilar crimes (none of the past convictions included personal assault element at issue in the current charges of armed robbery while masked and stealing by confining or putting in fear). By contrast, the defendant\u2019s past record in this case is less than one year old, and for a substantially identical crime.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b80-8\">See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vynorius, </em>369 Mass. 17, 21 (1975) (admission to two purchases of drugs); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kiley, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 939, 939 (1981) (admission to one purchase of drugs); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Reivich, </em>793 F.2d 957, 959 (8th Cir. 1986) (admission of past and current drug dealings); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Deggendorf, </em>626 F.2d 47, 51 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 986 (1980) (admission of cocaine use within past eight months).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The statement made in this case is a direct admission, and thus more incriminating than a statement which merely gives rise to an <em>inference </em>of criminal conduct, but nonetheless has been deemed against the declarant\u2019s penal interest. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Atchue, </em>393 Mass. 343, 347 n.3 (1984) (reasoning that informant\u2019s admission of \u201cfirst hand knowledge\u201d of location of stolen property \u201cgives rise to the inference that the informant\u2019s statements could be viewed as against his penal interest\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Norris, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 761, 766 (1978) (given informant\u2019s earlier past arrest for sale of stolen airline tickets, subsequent statement that person who informant knows has other stolen tickets gives rise to the inference that informant admitted joint participation in the latter crime); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gavic, </em>520 F.2d 1346, 1351 &amp; n.8 (8th Cir. 1975) (statement by occupant of premises that a controlled substance was present creates inference of reliability because it \u201cat least implicated\u201d informant in crime of constructive possession).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The informant\u2019s statement also differs substantively from the one made in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nowells, </em>390 Mass. 621 (1983). In <em>Nowells, </em>the informant admitted going to a particular apartment \u201cto get (turned on) with cocaine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 623. We held that the statement did not indicate that the informant committed a crime because it revealed only the informant\u2019s purpose in visiting the apartment and not incriminating activities committed by the informant in the apartment. <em>Id. </em>at 626.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b82-7\">The court states, <em>ante </em>at 58 n.4, that \u201ca magistrate could not reasonably infer that the affiant knew the actual identity of the informant.\u201d I disagree. Detective O\u2019Connor states that he \u201chas met with [the informant] numerous times in the last week and most recently this date.\u201d This statement clearly supports an inference that O\u2019Connor knew the identity of the informant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b83-5\">In the majority of those cases, the informant\u2019s identity was unknown to the police, and the informant had neither provided any tips in the past nor made a statement against his penal interest. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Spence, 403 Mass. 179 (1988); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borges, </em>395 Mass. 788 (1985); <em>Upton I, supra', Upton II, supra. </em>In these cases, the Commonwealth attempted to establish veracity solely on the basis of police corroboration of the informant\u2019s tip. We deemed that corroboration inadequate in each case. In <em>Borges, </em>the police corroborated only the informant\u2019s description of the defendant\u2019s physical appearance and clothing. In the <em>Upton </em>cases, police corroborated the presence of a motor home at the location predicted by the informant, who had stated that stolen goods were located inside the home. However, the police were unable to confirm the presence of those goods in the home. Finally, in <em>Spence, </em>the police observed two men, one of whom fit a physical and clothing description provided by the informant, disembarking from a particular flight that the informant had predicted. The informant had stated that the man he described would be carrying a large amount of heroin in his crotch, which would be evidenced by a visible bulge. However, it was the described man\u2019s companion, the defendant, who was carrying the heroin. Thus, we concluded that \u201c[t]he fact that the defendant was travelling with an individual whom the informant was able to describe does not indicate anything about the reliability of the informant\u2019s tip concerning the defendant.\u201d <em>Spence, supra </em>at 181. This case differs from these three cases in at least two critical aspects. First, unlike in the three cases discussed above, the affidavit in the instant case provided evidence of the informant\u2019s veracity independent of any police corroboration. Second, a significant piece of police corroboration, concerning the past criminal record of the defendant, was presented in the instant affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">My conclusion on this point is also buttressed by the fact that the <em>Borges </em>and <em>Upton </em>cases, despite holding that veracity had not been demonstrated, were perceived by at least some members of those courts as close decisions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borges, supra </em>at 797 (Hennessey, C.J., concurring) (\u201cThis case is close enough to the line so that I bow to the court\u2019s wisdom, but not without doubt on my part\u201d); <em>Upton II, supra </em>at 377 (Wilkins, J.) (\u201cWe grant that the [Aguilar-Spinelli] question [in this case] is a close one\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
