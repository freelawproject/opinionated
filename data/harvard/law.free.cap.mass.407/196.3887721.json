On April 13, 1988, the judge entered a document dated March 24, 1988,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> captioned, \u201cThe Court\u2019s motion sua sponte to vacate and revoke the motion allowing the execution ... the judgment of contempt . . . and ... the [modified] judgment of contempt ... as the result of the fraud and deceit of the plaintiff and defendant and [their attorneys].\u201d On motion of the plaintiff to summarize the evidence on which his findings were based, the judge issued amended findings and further amended findings. In his amended findings, the judge concluded \u201cthat there was in fact a willful and deliberate plan to use this Court for the personal enrichment of the plaintiff and defendant and their attorneys.\u201d The plaintiff appeals.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We transferred the case here on our motion. The plaintiff asserts that there is no evidentiary basis for the judge\u2019s findings of fraud on the court by the plaintiff, the defendant, and their attorneys. We agree with the plaintiff\u2019s assertions. \u201cThe record demonstrates overt acts by the judge reflecting great bias against [the parties and their attorneys] and substantial disregard for the mandate of this court.\u201d <em>Reserve Mining Co. </em>v. Lord, 529 F.2d 181, 185 (8th Cir. 1976). We therefore reverse the judge\u2019s order revoking the judgments and execution, and his order allowing motions to intervene and a motion to dissolve an attachment. We remand this case to the Administrative Justice of the Probate and Family Court for reassignment to another judge from a different county and for such further proceedings in another county as may be needed consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>We set forth the facts from <em>MacDonald I. </em>\u201cThe plaintiff filed a complaint for contempt in the Probate Court alleging [that] the defendant\u2019s arrearages in alimony and support payments under an order of September 13, 1982, total[ed] $5,908.31. On September 26, 1983, a probate judge authorized an attachment of certain of the defendant\u2019s real estate, which was recorded that day. The following day, September 27, 1983, the defendant sold the real estate. The purchasers gave a mortgage on the property to the Crescent Credit Union (credit union).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 513-514. The credit union\u2019s attorney<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> conducted a title search on the day <em>after </em>the closing and, in the attorney\u2019s own words, \u201cdue to inadvertence, [he] neglected to pick up said Attachment.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s attorney subsequently informed the credit union\u2019s attorney of the attachment. \u201cUpon learning of his error, the [credit union\u2019s] attorney filed a motion in the contempt case to dissolve the attachment. No motion to intervene was made, and no separate petition to dissolve the attachment was filed. The judge allowed the motion on the day it was filed without prior notice, although the plaintiff apparently was present and given an opportunity to be heard. The plaintiff then moved for reconsideration and stay pending appeal, but these motions were denied. The plaintiff thereupon appealed.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 514.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AKm\">In <em>MacDonald I, </em>we vacated the order dissolving the attachment and ordered it reinstated as of the date it originally was recorded. See <em>MacDonald </em>/, <em>supra </em>at 515. In support of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>that result, we reasoned that, \u201c[e]ven if there had been adequate notice, we doubt whether the probate judge could properly dissolve the attachment under G. L. c. 223, \u00a7\u00a7 106 and 108 (1986 ed.), on the grounds urged by the credit union. Those provisions permit dissolution of an attachment upon a finding that all or part of the amount demanded in the original action was \u2018not justly due.\u2019 The probate judge made no such finding nor does the record disclose that evidence was introduced to support such a finding. Furthermore, decisions interpreting earlier statutes containing analogous provisions make clear that \u00a7\u00a7106 and 108 provide a remedy against attachments which are invalid or fraudulent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 514-515. We also said that .\u201c.there was no .allegation that,the plaintiffs attachment was fraudulent or -invalid within the meaning of the statute and inJaclihe judge made no finding to that effect. We can understand the judge\u2019s concern that the defendant not be uniustlv enriched bv the unfortunate error of the credit union\u2019s attorney. However, the question of the attorney\u2019s error was one which the credit union had \u2018no right to [raise] in this form of proceedmgTTt does not show that the debt was not justly due and owing, or that it was not then payable; and, therefore, they show no sufficient ground for vacating the attachment, on petition, by force of this statute.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 515, quoting <em>Baird </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>19 Pick. 381, 385-386 (1837).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">After our opinion, the credit union again sought to intervene. The purchasers also filed a motion to intervene.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss, a motion for stay of judgment, and a motion for recusal. The judge denied all of the plaintiff\u2019s motions, allowed both motions to intervene, and the credit union\u2019s motion to dissolve the attachment or, in the alternative, to reduce it, and on April 13, 1988, entered a document dated March 24, see note 1, <em>supra, </em>which vacated and revoked the two judgments and the execution \u201cdue to the fraud and deceit of the plaintiff and defendant.\u201d Subse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>quently, pursuant to the plaintiff\u2019s motion, the judge filed some amended findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The judge\u2019s findings and amended findings are set forth as follows. The judge found that the plaintiff, the defendant, and their attorneys \u201cat some point in time following the real estate attachment incident on September 27, 1983,\u201d conspired together to recover any arrears in alimony payments from the credit union\u2019s attorney, his insurance carrier, the credit union itself, or the real estate \u201cas the result of [the credit union\u2019s attorney\u2019s] negligence and failure to verify a [duly recorded] real estate attachment on the real estate of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The judge found \u201cthat Attorney[s] Terzian and Downs [for the plaintiff in the domestic relations proceeding] and Attorney Littlefield [for the defendant in the domestic relations proceeding] conversed together frequently about this contempt but the three of them apparently chose to let the arrears grow to at least the size of the original real estate attachment which had issued on September 26, 1983, in the sum of $25,000.00. This Court assumes that that decision by the attorneys and their clients to sit on their hands and do nothing to require the defendant, Richard G. MacDonald, to live up to the orders of this Court was so that all of them could reap the rewards from [the credit union\u2019s attorney\u2019s] misfortune.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">The judge further found that \u201cthe plaintiff and defendant [and plaintiff\u2019s counsel] made representations to the court that were untrue, as subsequent lies and conduct on their part would confirm . . . with the intention that the court would rely upon them as being made in good faith and being true and in fact it was presented only to deceive this court and they did by such deceit perpetrate a fraud upon this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>court.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If the record had supported these findings then, in addition to setting aside the judgments, the judge should have referred the matter to the Board of Bar Overseers for disciplinary action. See S.J.C. Rule 3:09, Canon 3(B)(3)(b), as appearing in 382 Mass. 809 (1981); S.J.C. Rule 3:07, Canon 1, DR 1-102(A)(4), as appearing in 382 Mass. 769 (1981). The record does not support the judge\u2019s conclusion that there was a fraud on the court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Fraud on the court is \u201conly that species of fraud which does, or attempts to, defile the court itself, or is a fraud perpetrated by officers of the court so that the judicial machinery cannot perform in the usual manner its impartial task of adjudging cases that are presented for adjudication. ... In addition, it has been said that \u2018[i]n order to set aside a judgment or order because of fraud upon the court... it is necessary to show an unconscionable plan or scheme which is designed to improperly influence the court in its decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lockwood </em>v. <em>Bowles, </em>46 F.R.D. 625, 631 (D.D.C. 1969).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cCourts have found fraud upon the court only where there has been the most egregious conduct involving a corruption of the judicial process itself. Examples are bribery of judges, employment of counsel to \u2018influence\u2019 the court, bribery of the jury, and the involvement of an attorney (an officer of the court) in the perpetration of fraud.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 631-632. There is no evidence in the record that the parties or their attorneys conspired to commit or actually perpetrated a fraud on the court under this standard. Without more, the documents and facts before the judge did not constitute fraud on the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">It is clear from the findings that the judge again was concerned with the problem of the credit union\u2019s attorney\u2019s admitted negligence despite our statement in <em>MacDonald I, supra </em>at 515, that \u201cthe question of the attorney\u2019s error was one which the credit union had \u2018no right to [raise] in this form of proceeding.\u2019 \u201d \u201cDisregard of this court\u2019s mandate by a lawyer would be contemptuous; it can hardly be excused when the reckless action emanates from a judicial officer. It is one thing for a . . . judge to disagree on a legal basis with a judgment of this court. It is quite another to openly chal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>lenge the court\u2019s ruling .... Our system of government is premised upon subservience to the rule of law. If a judge in the exercise of judicial power loses sight of these principles, the result is autocratic rule by lawless judicial action.\u201d <em>Reserve Mining Co. </em>v. Lord, 529 F.2d 181, 188 (8th Cir. 1976). \u201c[T]he right to an impartial decision-maker is required by due process.\u201d <em>Arnett </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>416 U.S. 134, 197 (1974) (White, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254, 271 (1970) (an impartial decision maker is essential).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Ordinarily, the question of disqualification is left to the judge\u2019s discretion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gogan, </em>389 Mass. 255, 259 (1983). Under S.J.C. Rule 3:09, Canon 3 (C) (1) (a), as appearing in 382 Mass. 809 (1981), a judge should disqualify himself in a proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to instances where he has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party. Although not requested by the attorneys involved, we conclude that the judge\u2019s decision to charge as well as decide that the attorneys engaged in disbarrable conduct based on their representation of clients is so biased as to require his disqualification in this case.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A judge \u201cshould not himself give vent to personal spleen or respond to a personal grievance.\u201d <em>Offutt </em>v. <em>United States, </em>348 U.S. 11, 14 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">On appeal, the credit union claims that it was entitled to intervene as a matter of right pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P; 24 (a) (2), 365 Mass. 769 (1974), and cites cases applicable to that rule. The motion, however, was made pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 24 (b), 365 Mass. 769 (1974), which provides in relevant part that \u201canyone may be permitted to intervene in an action: (1) when a statute of the Commonwealth confers a conditional right to intervene; or (2) when an applicant\u2019s claim or defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in common.\u201d Mass. R. Civ. P. 24 (b). We review the motions under case law and standards gov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>erning rule 24 (b). \u201cA judge has broad discretion in considering permissive intervention. <em>Corcoran </em>v. <em>Wigglesworth Mach. Co., </em>389 Mass. 1002, 1003 (1983). A judge\u2019s decision will not be upheld, of course, when its result is an error of law.\u201d <em>Coggins </em>v. <em>New England Patriots Football Club, Inc., </em>397 Mass. 525, 538-539 (1986), and cases cited. We conclude that the judge erred as a matter of law. We have concluded, for the reasons stated herein, that the judge may not open the contempt proceeding for the purpose of litigating the question of the credit union\u2019s attorney\u2019s error. There is no pending action in which the credit union can intervene. Further, any other fraud claim is barred by the time limitation in Mass. R. Civ. P. 60 (b) (3), 365 Mass. 828 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The credit union filed a separate motion to dissolve the attachment or, in the alternative, to reduce it, which was allowed on April 13, 1988. Nothing in the record shows that the parties were heard on the motion or indicates the grounds on which the judge allowed it. We vacate the allowance of that motion and once again reinstate the attachment to be effective as of the date it was originally recorded.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Although the credit union may not intervene in the contempt case, because the judgments and execution remain closed pursuant to the time limitation in rule 60 (b), the motion remains pending for further proceedings on remand in accordance with G. L. c. 223, \u00a7 114. In hearing that motion, the credit union\u2019s attorney\u2019s error is not relevant. \u201c[T]he question of the attorney\u2019s error was one which the credit union had \u2018no right to [raise] in this form of proceeding.\u2019 \u201d <em>MacDonald I, supra </em>at 515.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The credit union may not relitigate that issue, but may seek a hearing as to the reasonableness of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>attachment, an issue which was not considered in our prior opinion. See <em>MacDonald </em>I, <em>supra </em>at 515 n.3.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The document, as originally issued, was dated March 24, 1985. On his own motion, the judge termed this a clerical error and changed the date to read \u201cMarch 24, 1988.\u201d These findings make no reference to the April hearing. It was not until the judge issued amended findings on August 1, 1988, that the judge made any references to or quotes any statements made at the April hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The defendant filed notice of appeal but did not file a brief with this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The credit union\u2019s appellate counsel is not the attorney who conducted the title search.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The judge stated that he dissolved the attachment in part \u201cbecause [he] believed the plaintiff intended to pursue any future claim against her husband for support from [the credit union\u2019s attorney] and or his liability carrier and because [he believed] the plaintiff refused [his] assistance in seeking to [arrest] the defendant [pursuant to Mass. R. Dom. Rel. P. 4.3 (1989)].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b212-7\">Prior to our consideration of the appeal, the plaintiff, the defendant, and their attorneys signed a stipulation on January 9, 1984, which became a judgment of contempt. In September, 1986, the same parties signed a second stipulation which became a modified judgment of contempt. On October 31, 1986, the judge allowed the plaintiff's motion for execution in the sum of $32,490.67.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The purchasers have not filed a brief in this court in support of the judge\u2019s rulings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b214-8\">There is no evidence or testimony disclosing the content of any conversations between the attorneys. The record does not disclose any basis for the attorneys to anticipate the failure of a title examiner to conduct a timely, nonnegligent title search.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b215-5\">The judge also made the finding that the \u201cdefendant took the proceeds from that sale and refused to pay one penny to his wife under the court order . . . and now seeks, in concert with the plaintiff, to levy under an execution of this court and to force the sale of the property .... The defendant now seeks not only to enrich himself from the initial sale but now seeks to recover money again from these innocent purchasers by a scam that would put the greediest of men to shame.\u201d There is no evidence that the defendant participated in a \u201cscam\u201d to obtain more money from the purchasers. On the contrary, the evidence indicates that a reasonably competent, nonnegligent attorney should have found the attachment during the title search prior to the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">The credit union\u2019s attorney was negligent in two respects: he did not make a timely title search and, in the search that he did conduct, he failed to discover the attachment, which was recorded. In fact, the credit union\u2019s attorney never discovered the attachment. In this case, it was the plaintiff\u2019s attorney who brought the attachment to the attention of the credit union\u2019s title attorney. The credit union concedes that its attorney was negligent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b215-7\">The credit union\u2019s motions did not present any allegation or claim that the plaintiff, defendant, or their attorneys had committed fraud, much less fraud on the court, which implies corrupt conduct. Thus, prior to the issuance of the findings and order, the parties and their attorneys received no notice of any claim of fraud and no opportunity to be heard, to present testimony, to cross-examine witnesses, or to offer evidence. This violated the minimum requirements of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">\u201c[N]otice of charges or reasons for deprivation of a protected interest must be provided before that deprivation can be effected.\u201d <em>Matter of Saab, </em>406 Mass. 315, 323 (1989), citing <em>Mullane </em>v. <em>Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 U.S. 306 (1950). <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>397 U.S. 254 (1970). Although a court has the power to investigate whether a judgment has been obtained by fraud, \u201cthe usual safe-guards of adversary proceedings must be observed .... [A] court cannot deprive a successful party of his judgment without a proper hearing [or] . . . adequate opportunity to be heard.\u201d <em>Universal Oil Prods. Co. </em>v. <em>Root Ref. Co., </em>328 U.S. 575, 580 (1946). Due process requires an opportunity to present witnesses and documentary evidence and the right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses. Cf. <em>Morrissey </em>v. <em>Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 489 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The plaintiff argues that, even for fraud on the court, the one year time limitation in Mass. R. Civ. P. 60 (b) (3), 365 Mass. 828 (1974), barred the judge from revoking the judgments and execution because that action came more than one year after they had entered. We agree with credit union that there is no time limitation which would bar a court from granting relief for fraud on the court. See <em>Artco, Inc. </em>v. <em>DiFruscia, 5 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 513, 518 (1977).

Further, it does not challenge the amount of the arrearage established by stipulation of the parties. There is no evidence in the record before us, however, whether the attachment was excessive or unreasonable. Thus, a remand is necessary. See G.
