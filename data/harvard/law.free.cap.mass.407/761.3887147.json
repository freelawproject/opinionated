Weld and Argeo Paul Cellucci are Republican candidates for the offices of Governor and Lieutenant Governor, respectively. They, together with their respective political committees and certain officers thereof, commenced this action in the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County against the director of the office of campaign and political finance (OCPF) and the Attorney General, the State officials empowered to investigate and prosecute alleged violations of the campaign finance laws. In their complaint, the plaintiffs sought a declaration pursuant to G. L. c. 231A (1988 ed.), that joint expenditures they have made for the purchase of campaign buttons, bumper stickers, and signs bearing the names of both candidates do not constitute unlawful \u201ccontributions\u201d prohibited by G. L. c. 55, \u00a7 6 (1988 ed.). In the alternative, the plaintiffs requested a declaration that \u00a7 6, as applied to them, violates art. 16 and art. 19 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, and the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A single justice of this court accepted the parties\u2019 statement of agreed facts and allowed their joint request for reservation and report of the case to the full court.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">The statement of agreed facts discloses the following. On September 29, 1989, the plaintiffs Weld and Cellucci publicly announced their candidacies for the offices of Governor and Lieutenant Governor, endorsed each other\u2019s candidacy, and announced that they intended to run together as a \u201cteam\u201d in the primary election, and, if nominated, in the general election. Shortly thereafter, the candidates met with officials of OCPF to discuss the application of G. L. c. 55 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>their joint candidacy. In response to OCPF\u2019s suggestion, Weld for Governor and the Cellucci Committee (committees), political committees organized pursuant to G. L. c. 55, \u00a7 5, to promote the candidacies of Weld and Cellucci, requested an advisory opinion from OCPF concerning the legality of joint purchases of campaign buttons, bumper stickers, and signs bearing both candidates\u2019 names. Of particular concern to the committees was the legality of their proposed joint purchases under G. L. c. 55, \u00a7 6, first par., which provides, in pertinent part, that \u201cno [political committee] may contribute to any other political committee or to the campaign fund of any other candidate.\u201d In their request, the committees stated that the cost of the campaign items would be split evenly between them, and that each committee would pay one-half of the cost by separate check. (The committees have, from their inception, maintained separate treasuries.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>)</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">On January 5, 1990, OCPF declined to issue an advisory opinion because the committees already had purchased the items regarding which the opinion had been requested. However, OCPF did indicate that it would soon issue an interpretative bulletin clarifying its interpretation of G. L. c. 55, \u00a7 6. That bulletin was issued on March 15, 1990, and reads, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-5\">\u201cIt is the opinion of this office that a joint expenditure by two or more committees which permits each participating committee to obtain the benefit of the full value of the goods or services for which the joint expenditure is made would result in one committee transferring something of value to each other committee. This trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>fer would occur even if each committee pays a pro rata share of the costs and directly controls the use of only a pro rata share of such goods or services. Such expenditure would therefore be subject to the contribution limitations contained in section 6 of M.G.L. c. 55.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">OCPF defines a \u201cjoint expenditure\u201d as \u201cany expenditure that is made in cooperation or consultation with any candidate, or a nonelected political committee organized on behalf of a candidate, or any agent of a candidate, or made in concert with, or at the request or suggestion of, any candidate, or any nonelected political committee organized on behalf of a candidate or agent of such candidate.\u201d The bulletin cast serious doubt on the legality of the plaintiffs\u2019 joint expenditures, and it prompted this lawsuit for declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">The primary issue presented is one of statutory interpretation \u2014 whether the joint expenditures made by the committees for the purchase of campaign buttons, bumper stickers, and signs bearing the names of Weld and Cellucci constitute prohibited \u201ccontributions\u201d within the meaning of the first paragraph of G. L. c. 55, \u00a7 6.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If the case can be resolved on a statutory interpretation basis (we conclude that it can) there is no need to address the constitutional issues argued.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">The term \u201c [contribution\u201d is defined, in relevant part, by G. L. c. 55, \u00a7 1 (1988 ed.), as follows: \u201c \u2018Contribution,\u2019 a contribution of money or anything of value to an individual, candidate, political committee, or person acting on behalf of said individual, candidate or political committee, for the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>pose of influencing the nomination or election of said individual or candidate . . . and shall include any .... (2) transfer of money or anything of value between political committees.\u201d The defendants rely essentially on the language quoted above which indicates that a transfer of \u201canything of value between political committees\u201d constitutes a prohibited contribution under \u00a7 6. According to the defendants, by means of the arrangements outlined in the facts, each committee is transferring something of value to the other committee and the expenditures are, therefore, caught in the literalism of the definition of \u201ccontribution.\u201d In our view, however, the statutory analysis must go deeper because G. L. c. 55, \u00a7 1, also defines the term \u201c[e]xpenditure\u201d as including a transfer of \u201canything of value between political committees.\u201d Section 6 does not, and constitutionally could not<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> flatly prohibit an \u201cexpenditure\u201d by a committee. Because precisely identical statutory language is used to describe two types of transfers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>which are regulated differently (one is proscribed, the other permitted), we inquire whether the defendants\u2019 method of differentiating permitted \u201cexpenditures\u201d from prohibited \u201ccontributions\u201d is a proper one in the factual circumstances of this case. Th'at method, as set forth in OCPF\u2019s interpretative bulletin, is to draw this distinction based on whether a transfer from one political committee or candidate to another is made after any sort of \u201cconsultation, coordination or cooperation\u201d between the parties. Put another way, unless the party which incurs the expenses does so wholly independently, the expense constitutes a prohibited \u201ccontribution.\u201d Because it is conceded that the committees in this case expended funds for the purchase of campaign buttons, bumper stickers and signs after consulting with one another, these expenses would constitute a prohibited \u201ccontribution\u201d if the defendants\u2019 position is a reasonable one on the facts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">The defendants\u2019 position initially has to be analyzed against the statutory language itself, see <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Howmedica, Inc., </em>373 Mass. 32, 37 (1977), and, because a violation of G. L. c. 55, \u00a7 6, can be punished as a crime, with regard to the settled principle that criminal statutes are to be narrowly construed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>389 Mass. 641, 646-647 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marrone, </em>387 Mass. 702, 706-707 (1982). There is no basis in the text of c. 55, \u00a7 1 or \u00a7 6, or elsewhere in the statute, to support the defendants\u2019 contention that the characterization of a transfer as a \u201ccontribution\u201d turns on the presence or absence of prior consultation between the parties, nor does the interpretative bulletin identify any such textual basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>The defendants do not tell us the source of their prior consultation argument. It appears to have been derived from the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA), the analogous Federal statute, and judicial interpretation thereof. That statute provides that \u201cexpenditures made by any person in cooperation, consultation, or concert with, or at the request or suggestion of, a candidate, his authorized political committees, or their agents, shall be considered to be a contribution to such candidate.\u201d 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 441a (a)(7)(B)(i) (1982). See <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1, 24 n.25 (1976). The OCPF definition of an improper joint expenditure virtually tracks this language.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">If that indeed is the source (and we suspect it is), it must be noted that the FECA expressly provides that joint purchases of campaign buttons, bumper stickers, and signs, which are considered to be basic \u201cgrassroots\u201d political advertising items, do not constitute contributions. See 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 431(8)(B)(xi) (1982). Furthermore, under FECA joint purchases even of general public political advertising, such as billboards and newspaper or television advertisements, are not considered contributions if the costs are allocated in a manner that reflects \u201cthe benefit reasonably expected to be derived\u201d by each party. 11 C.F.R. \u00a7 106.1(a) (1989). The committees here, by jointly purchasing \u201cgrassroots\u201d campaign items and allocating the cost in a reasonable manner between them,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> have acted within the permissible limits of the Federal standards. This is not to say that the State cannot regulate political contributions in a manner that differs from the Federal approach to the same subject based upon particular conditions or requirements within the State. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>to say that, in an area that is especially constitutionally sensitive (a matter we shall discuss in more detail later in this opinion), it is of significance to an evaluation of the defendants\u2019 position that the Federal statute from which the key component of OCPF\u2019s restrictive definition appears to have been borrowed specifically exempts the arrangements made here as to the purchase of campaign buttons, bumper stickers and signs.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">We are also persuaded that the defendants\u2019 interpretation of what constitutes a \u201ccontribution\u201d should not apply here because it would have the effect of prohibiting altogether joint candidacies for Governor and Lieutenant Governor in primary elections. Candidates desiring to run as a \u201cteam\u201d for election to the offices of Governor and Lieutenant Governor could not possibly orchestrate such a joint candidacy without engaging in some type of prior consultation, coordination or cooperation. In fact, were person A to declare himself and person B joint candidates for elective office without first obtaining B\u2019s consent (which, of course, would involve prior consultation and agreement), A could have acted tortiously by appropriating B\u2019s name without authorization. See G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 3A (1988 ed.). Once such prior consultation had occurred, it would follow that A and B had transferred something of value between themselves, such as political consultation services or the sharing of office space and campaign staff. Furthermore, any efforts made to advertise this joint candidacy to the electorate \u2014 precisely the activity engaged in by the plaintiffs here \u2014 would certainly be deemed a transfer of value, and thus a prohibited \u201ccontribution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">We find nothing in the language of G. L. c. 55 which indicates that the Legislature intended to prohibit joint candidacies in primary elections for Governor and Lieutenant Governor. Were that in fact the legislative objective, we would expect to see much more specific language to that effect in view of the fact that our Constitution not only permits but <em>requires </em>that each party\u2019s candidates for Governor and Lieutenant Governor run as a \u201cticket\u201d in the general election. See art. 86 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>tion. Thus, the interpretation of \u00a7 6 advocated by the defendants could require us to read that statute differently in the context of a primary election than in the context of a general election. While this could be done, it leads to a somewhat strained application of the law, particularly if art. 86 is considered expressive of a policy that is not antithetical to what the plaintiffs have done.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Finally, we note that a statutory ban on joint candidacies in primary elections would be of dubious constitutionality. The United States Supreme Court has observed that the First Amendment rights of speech and association have their \u201cfullest and most urgent application precisely to the conduct of campaigns for political office,\u201d <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Valeo, supra </em>at 15, quoting <em>Monitor Patriot Co. </em>v. <em>Roy, </em>401 U.S. 265, 272 (1971), and that \u201c[fjree discussion about candidates for public office is no less critical before a primary than before a general election.\u201d <em>Eu </em>v. <em>San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., </em>489 U.S. 214, 223 (1989). \u201cWhen a State seeks to restrict directly the offer of ideas by a candidate to the voters, the First Amendment surely requires that the restriction be demonstrably supported by not only a legitimate state interest, but a compelling one, and that the restriction operate without unnecessarily circumscribing protected expression.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Hartlage, </em>456 U.S. 45, 53-54 (1982). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dennis, </em>368 Mass. 92, 99 (1975). A prohibition of joint candidacies of this type would burden both candidates\u2019 rights of free speech, see <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Valeo, supra </em>at 19 (restrictions on political communication during a campaign \u201cnecessarily reduce [ ] the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached\u201d), and of free association, see <em>Eu </em>v. <em>San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., supra </em>at 224-225 (\u201cimposing limitations \u2018on individuals wishing to band together to advance their views on a ballot measure, while placing none on individuals acting alone, is clearly a restraint on the right of association\u2019 \u201d), quoting <em>Citizens Against Rent Control/Coalition For Fair Hous. </em>v. <em>Berkeley, </em>454 U.S. 290, 296 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>It is problematic that the State interest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption, the only interest so far held to be sufficiently compelling to justify First Amendment burdens of the type described above, see <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Michigan Chamber of Commerce, </em>110 S. Ct. 1391, 1396-1397 (1990), would apply to the facts in this case, where the source of the equal transfers for the highest elective offices in the State is a cocandidate rather than an unrelated outside entity with potentially diverging economic interests. Cf. <em>Tashjian </em>v. <em>Republican Party of Conn., </em>479 U.S. 208, 224 (1986) (State may enact laws to \u201cprevent the disruption of the political parties from without\u201d but not laws \u201cto prevent the parties from taking internal steps affecting their own process for the selection of candidates\u201d); L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 1143 (2d ed. 1988) (reasoning that expenditures from a candidate\u2019s own personal funds pose less of a corruption danger than outside contributions because a candidate \u201ccould hardly be suspected of bribing herself\u2019). In the absence of express statutory language on point, we are reluctant to attribute to the Legislature an intent to enact a provision of doubtful constitutionality, see <em>Baird </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>371 Mass. 741, 745 (1977); <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., 362 </em>Mass. 570, 577-578 (1972); <em>id. </em>at 595, 596 (Quirico, J., concurring in the result), and we are also reluctant to give deference to an agency to construct an interpretation of a statute so as to ban activity bespeaking no appearance of corruption.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">The plaintiffs have offered a more plausible basis for applying the \u201cexpenditures\u201d/\u201ccontributions\u201d distinction set forth in G. L. c. 55, \u00a7 6, to the present facts. Rather than focusing on the presence or absence of prior consultation, the plaintiffs draw a distinction based on the purpose for which the expense has been incurred. If the expense is incurred primarily to promote the payor\u2019s candidacy, it is an \u201cexpenditure\u201d; if made primarily to promote the candidacy of someone other than the payor, it is a \u201ccontribution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">There is support for this distinction in the statutory language. In defining the terms \u201c[expenditure\u201d and \u201c[c]on<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>tribution,\u201d the Legislature in \u00a7 1 of G. L. c. 55 has made reference to a purpose-based distinction. A transfer of money or anything of value <em>\u201cto </em>an individual, candidate [or] political committee ... for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of said individual or candidate\u201d (i.e., someone other than the payor) constitutes a \u201c [contribution,\u201d while an identical transfer <em>\u201cby </em>an individual, candidate or political committee ... for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of said individual or candidate\u201d (i.e., the payor) is an \u201c[e]xpenditure.\u201d G. L. c. 55, \u00a7 1 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">It can be fairly said on the agreed facts that the items purchased by Weld for Governor were intended primarily for the purpose of promoting Weld\u2019s election to the office of Governor. The same can be said for the items purchased by the Cellucci Committee for his election to the office of Lieutenant Governor. While it is certainly true that both purchases were motivated at least in part by the desire to promote the payor\u2019s cocandidate, together with the joint interests of the \u201cteam,\u201d that desire is subordinate to the payor\u2019s main and overarching goal, which is to promote his own election to the particular office he seeks. See 1979 U.S. Code Congressional &amp; Admin. News 2869 (legislative history of FECA) (noting that, \u201c[i]f a candidate makes an expenditure from his or her campaign account, the possibility that it is not for the purpose of furthering his or her election is remote at best\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that the expenses incurred by Weld for Governor and the Cellucci Committee for the joint purchase of campaign buttons, bumper stickers, and signs bearing both candidates\u2019 names do not constitute prohibited \u201ccontributions\u201d within the ban of G. L. c. 55, \u00a7 6. The statute will bear an interpretation that says that shared expenses, evenly apportioned, are not forbidden contributions when applied to facts indicating that (1) the parties have publicly declared themselves to be cocandidates for elected office and are running as a bona fide \u201cteam\u201d; (2) the nature of the offices sought by these candidates, Governor and Lieu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>tenant Governor, is such that close cooperation between the office-holders is required on a daily basis; (3) the items jointly purchased do not include general public political advertising, such as billboards and newspaper or television advertisements, but are confined to buttons, bumper stickers, and signs; (4) the candidates have carefully allocated the costs between themselves in a manner which reflects the relative benefit reasonably expected to be derived by each candidate; and (5) there is no suggestion of dishonesty.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> If problems are posed by the general prospect of joint campaigns in other situations, then the Legislature may wish to consider suitable revision of the statute, or the director, consistent with his power to implement the statute\u2019s directives, may wish to frame rules and regulations more carefully tailored to avert anticipated harms.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">A declaration is to enter in the county court that, on the facts presented, G. L. c. 55, \u00a7 6, does not prohibit the expenditures that Weld for Governor and the Cellucci Committee have made, and wish to continue to make, for the purchase of campaign buttons, bumper stickers, and signs bearing the names of Weld and Cellucci.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b776-7\">The plaintiffs also sought a preliminary injunction prohibiting the defendants from barring such expenditures in the future, and from initiating any criminal prosecution of any of the plaintiffs for making such expenditures in the past.

Decisions as to what items were to be purchased and the amounts to be expended for such items were made after consultation and mutual agreement by the two committees.

Accordingly, the Court struck down on First Amendment grounds provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, 2 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 431-455 (1988), which placed limits on independent expenditures by individuals or groups relative to a \u201cclearly identified candidate,\u201d while upholding the provisions which restricted the amount of contributions made to a single candidate. <em>Id. </em>at 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">In its subsequent decisions, the United States Supreme Court consistently has relied on the expenditure/contribution distinction first articulated in <em>Buckley. </em>See, e.g., <em>California Medical Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Federal Election Comm\u2019n, </em>453 U.S. 182 (1981) (upholding limits on contributions by unincorporated associations to multicandidate political committees); <em>Federal Election Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., </em>479 U.S. 238, 245 (1986) (striking down, as applied, prohibition on corporate expenditures from treasury funds \u201cin connection with\u201d any Federal election).

The fact that our decision speaks only to the joint purchase of buttons, bumper stickers, and signs, is due solely to the fact that the plaintiffs\u2019 declaratory judgment request asks nothing more.

General Laws c. 55, \u00a7 6 (1988 ed.), provides in relevant part that \u201c[a] political committee organized or operating on behalf of a candidate for the office of governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, state secretary, treasurer and receiver general, or auditor\u201d may receive and expend money or other things of value for certain purposes \u201cprovided, however, that no such committee may contribute to any other political committee or to the campaign fund of any other candidate.\u201d Chapter 55, \u00a7 1, defines the term \u201c [contribution\u201d as \u201ca contribution of money or anything of value to an individual, candidate, political committee, or person acting on behalf of said individual, candidate or political committee, for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of said individual or candidate . . . and shall include any . . . transfer of money or anything of value between political committees.\u201d Here, each candidate and political committee wants to buy buttons, stickers, and signs in part to promote the other\u2019s candidacy. The plan is that the cost of the campaign items will be split evenly between the two candidates (including their committees). Thus, each candidate would expend money to provide to the other candidate the benefit of advertising and promoting the other\u2019s candidacy. Such conduct would be a clear violation of the unambiguous statutory prohibition. Furthermore, nothing in the statute suggests that it would make a difference that the joint purchase would be designed to promote the payor\u2019s, as well as the other candidate\u2019s, candidacy or that the plan calls for reciprocal beneficial contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">The court appears to endorse the plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that, \u201c[i]f the expense is incurred primarily to promote the payor\u2019s candidacy, it is an \u2018expenditure\u2019; if made primarily to promote the candidacy of someone other than the payor, it is a \u2018contribution.\u2019 \u201d That assertion has no support in the statutory language. Chapter 55, \u00a7 1, defines the term \u201ccontribution\u201d as a contribution made for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of another candidate, not as one made \u201cprimarily\u201d for that purpose. Chapter 55, \u00a7 6, does expressly proscribe an \u201cexpenditure that is . . . primarily for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>the candidate\u2019s or any other person\u2019s personal use,\u201d but the word \u201cprimarily\u201d does not appear in connection with the definition of the term \u201ccontribution\u201d in \u00a7 1 nor in connection with the mandate in \u00a7 6 \u201cthat no such committee may contribute to any other political committee or to the campaign fund of any other candidate.\u201d By implying the word \u201cprimarily\u201d where it does not appear, the court \u201cviolates the rule that where the Legislature has employed specific language in one paragraph [or sentence], but not in another [in the same statute], the language should not be implied where it is not present.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Galvin, 388 Mass. 326, 330 (1983), quoting <em>Beeler </em>v. <em>Downey, </em>387 Mass. 609, 616 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">The court asserts that G. L. c. 55, \u00a7 1, which is a criminal statute and therefore must be strictly construed against the government, defines both the word \u201c[contribution\u201d and the word \u201c[expenditure\u201d precisely the same way, that is, as a transfer of anything of value between two political committees. <em>Ante </em>at 764. Proceeding from that proposition, the court reasons that nothing in the statute gives guidance as to whether a purchase of campaign items by one candidate or his committee to advance the candidacy of another candidate is an allowed expenditure or \u25a0 a disallowed contribution. Therefore, the court concludes, the plaintiffs\u2019 proposed conduct cannot properly be viewed as violating the statute. The court is mistaken. The statutory definitions of \u201ccontribution\u201d and \u201cexpenditure\u201d are not precisely the same. They are significantly different. A contribution under G. L. c. 55, \u00a7 1, is a transfer of anything of value between two political committees for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of the <em>transferee. </em>An expenditure under the same statute is a transfer mad\u00e9 for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of the <em>transferor. </em>The statute clearly allows expenditures. However, it just as clearly prohibits a candidate or his or her committee from contributing to the campaign of another candidate, which is the conduct at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">By interpreting the statute as permitting joint expenditures for buttons, bumper stickers, and signs advertising both can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>didates, the court avoids addressing the question whether G. L. c. 55, \u00a7 6, as applied to the plaintiffs, is constitutional, a question to which I shall return. Nevertheless, the court engages in considerable discussion concerning the constitutionality of the statute. The court concludes, <em>ante </em>at 770, that it is \u201creluctant to attribute to the Legislature an intent to enact a provision of doubtful constitutionality.\u201d Consideration of the doubtful constitutionality of a statute in connection with its interpretation is indeed appropriate when the statute reasonably is susceptible of both constitutional and unconstitutional constructions. <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>362 Mass. 570, 578 (1972). <em>Id. </em>at 595-596 (Quirico, J., concurring in the result). The statute in question, however, is not reasonably susceptible of two constructions. The statute can only reasonably be construed as prohibiting the contributions contemplated by the plaintiffs. If constitutional, the statute must be enforced. If it is unconstitutional, it must be struck down. The court exceeds its lawful power when it rewrites the statute even if it is motivated to do so by a desire to save it from constitutional infirmity (an infirmity which, in my judgment, does not exist).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Not only should the court avoid tampering with \u201cthe literalism of the definition of \u2018contribution\u2019 \u201d in the statute, <em>ante </em>at 765, in order to save it from constitutional infirmity, but also the court should refrain from departing from the plain language of the statute in order to make it more like the Federal Election Campaign Act, 2 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 431-456 (1988), a statute which, perhaps, the court prefers. The Federal statute\u2019s express exemption of joint purchases of campaign buttons, stickers, and signs is notably absent from G. L. c. 55. The court ultimately concludes that \u201cshared expenses, evenly apportioned, are not forbidden contributions when applied to facts indicating [among other things] that... the items jointly purchased do not include general public political advertising, such as billboards and newspaper or television advertisement, but are confined to buttons, bumper stickers, and signs; [and that] the candidates have carefully allocated the costs between themselves in a manner which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>reflects the relative benefit reasonably expected to be derived by each candidate.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 771-772. Thus, ostensibly as a matter of statutory construction, the court imports wholesale into G. L. c. 55 provisions not expressed in c. 55 but only contained in the Federal Election Campaign Act. One might reasonably ask what provisions in c. 55. provide a basis for distinction between joint expenditures for campaign buttons, bumper stickers, and signs, on the one hand, and joint expenditures for newspaper, billboard, and television advertising on the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Neither is the court justified in failing to give effect to the statute\u2019s \u201cliteral\u201d definition of \u201ccontribution\u201d by the fact that to do so \u201cwould have the effect of prohibiting altogether joint candidacies for Governor and Lieutenant Governor in primary elections.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 768. Whether that is true is questionable but need not be debated. The Legislature, not the court, is charged with enacting the law, and may, if it chooses to, enact a statute that discourages joint candidacies for Governor and Lieutenant Governor in primary elections.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Article 86 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution provides that, after the candidates for Governor and Lieutenant Governor have been nominated, the nominees of each party shall be placed together on the ballot and, if voted for, must be voted for as a team. The court appears to reason that, since a party\u2019s candidates for those offices must be voted for as a team in the general election, they must be permitted to make joint expenditures in the general election campaign, and therefore the Legislature cannot reasonably be thought to have intended to proscribe such expenditures in primary campaigns. Once again, the statutory language unambiguously forbids joint expenditures. Perhaps, some day, in another case, the court will be required to consider the constitutionality and application of the statute in a case involving a general election but, for the purposes of this case, which involves a primary only, the statute is clear and, in my view, constitutional as applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">I turn now to a discussion of the constitutionality of G. L. c. 55, \u00a7 6, as I would interpret it. I do so only because my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>conclusion that the statute lawfully and effectively prohibits the joint expenditures at issue depends on the statute\u2019s being constitutional. Of course, it is true that limitations on political expenditures and contributions implicate First Amendment values. It is also true, as the court observes, <em>ante </em>at 770, that \u201cpreventing corruption or the appearance of corruption [is] the only interest so far held to be sufficiently compelling to justify First Amendment burdens\u201d on political expression and association. <em>Buckley </em>v. <em>Valeo, </em>424 U.S. 1 (1976), teaches that the amount of money or other thing of value an individual may expend in support of a candidacy may not be constitutionally restricted if the expenditure is totally independent of the candidate, that is, neither prearranged nor solicited by the candidate or on the candidate\u2019s behalf, <em>id. </em>at 44-48, but expenditures that are requested or coordinated or prearranged may be treated as contributions, as the Federal Election Campaign Act treats them, <em>id </em>at 46-47 n.53, and constitutionally may be restricted. <em>Id. </em>at 26-38. Contributions may be restricted consistent with the First Amendment because of the compelling governmental interest in limiting contributions so as to avoid either the actuality or the appearance of corruption flowing from the potential for quid pro quo arrangements between candidates and their benefactors. <em>Id. </em>The same potential for corruption or the appearance of corruption that accompanies contributions to candidates by noncandidates is present when contributions are made by candidates to other candidates. The First Amendment is not violated by a statute prohibiting such conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">General Laws c. 55, \u00a7 1, defines a \u201c[contribution\u201d as a transfer of anything of value between two political committees for the purpose of influencing the nomination or election of the transferee. Neither \u00a7 1 nor \u00a7 6 distinguishes transfers made after solicitation, consultation, or by prearrangement from totally unsolicited and uncoordinated independent transfers. On its face then, the statute may literally be read as prohibiting a candidate or his or her political committee from making a completely independent expenditure for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>purpose of promoting another candidate\u2019s candidacy. To that limited extent, the statute is overbroad. However, the minimal overbreadth of the statute does not require that it be struck down. The likelihood of candidates or their committees expending funds for the political advantage of other candidates, without solicitation, coordination, or prearrangement is miniscule. Furthermore, the likelihood of prosecution for such conduct is virtually nonexistent in view of the interpretative bulletin issued by the agency charged with the statute\u2019s enforcement, the office of campaign and political finance (OCPF), defining a prohibited joint expenditure as \u201cany expenditure that is made in cooperation or consultation with any candidate, or a nonelected political committee organized on behalf of a candidate, or any agent of a candidate, or made in concert with, or at the request or suggestion of, any candidate, or any nonelected political committee organized on behalf of a candidate or agent of such candidate.\u201d The overbreadth doctrine is designed only to prevent actual and substantial chilling of protected speech. <em>Massachusetts </em>v. <em>Oakes, </em>109 S. Ct. 2633, 2638 (1989). No such chilling is threatened by G. L. c. 55, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">I would order the entry of a declaration that G. L. c. 55, \u00a7 6, prohibits the expenditures that are at issue in this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
