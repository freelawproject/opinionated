After sentences were imposed, the defendant appealed, and on May 1, 1985, the Appeals Court affirmed the convictions. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bray, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 751 (1985). Subsequently, the defendant filed a pro se motion, later amended with the assistance of counsel, for a new trial of the murder indictment. The trial judge denied the amended motion, and the defendant appealed. We granted the defendant\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We now affirm the denial of the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">The defendant\u2019s motion was grounded on two claims of error in the judge\u2019s jury instructions, only one of which is asserted on appeal. The defendant contends that the judge erred by instructing the jury that evidence of a defendant\u2019s intoxication is irrelevant to the question of malice in murder. The defendant says that the judge should have instructed the jury in a manner consistent with the rule this court subsequently articulated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grey, </em>399 Mass. 469 (1987), and that counsel\u2019s failure to raise that issue either at trial or in the first appeal constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Grey, </em>we held that evidence of a defendant\u2019s mental impairment is relevant and admissible on the question of malice, <em>id. </em>at 470-471, and in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Glass, </em>401 Mass. 799, 809-810 (1988), we made clear that mental impairment includes impairment due to intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">In denying the motion for a new trial, the judge addressed the defendant\u2019s challenge to the intoxication instruction, and thus, for that reason alone, the question is properly before us. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>364 Mass. 211, 229-231 (1973). The judge acknowledged that, according to the law declared in <em>Grey </em>subsequent to the trial, the jury instruction was incorrect, but he concluded that the <em>Grey </em>rule should not be applied retroactively to the defendant\u2019s trial. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Breese, </em>389 Mass. 540 (1983), relying on United States Supreme Court decisions, we laid out an analytical framework for determining whether decisional law should apply retroactively to earlier trials or should operate prospectively only. We stated that decisional law is usually retroactive, but, if the decision announces a new rule, it may apply prospectively only. <em>Id. </em>at 541. Whether a new rule will apply prospectively only, we said, depends on a three-part test. <em>Id. </em>That test, which originated in <em>Linkletter </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>381 U.S. 618, 636 (1965), implicates the following criteria: \u201c(a) the purpose to be served by the new standards, (b) the extent of the reliance by law enforcement authorities on the old standards, and (c) the effect on the administration of justice of a retroactive application of the new standards.\u201d <em>Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>388 U.S. 293, 297 (1967). <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>447 U.S. 323, 328 (1980) (plurality opinion of Brennan, J.). <em>Breese, supra </em>at 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">We made no suggestion in <em>Breese, </em>which was an appeal from the denial of a motion for a new trial after final judgment (collateral review), that application of the three-part retroactivity test was limited to collateral appeals. In fact, the Supreme Court had declared in <em>Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno, supra </em>at 300, that \u201cno distinction is justified between convictions now final . . . and convictions at various stages of trial and direct review.\u201d The Court characterized such a distinction as \u201cunsupportable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 300-301. See <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>479 U.S. 314, 329 (1987) (White, J., with whom Rehnquist, C.J., and O\u2019Connor, J., joined, dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">In cases subsequent to <em>Breese, </em>the Supreme Court has sharply distinguished between cases on direct review or in which the conviction has not become final and cases on collateral review. In <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>Kentucky, supra, </em>which involved two cases in which the defendants\u2019 convictions had not be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>come final, the Supreme Court was asked to decide whether the petitioners, one of whom had been convicted in a State court proceeding and the other of whom had been convicted in a Federal District Court, should receive the benefit of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, 476 </em>U.S. 79 (1986). After the convictions in <em>Griffith, </em>but before the time for appellate review had expired, <em>Batson </em>overruled a portion of <em>Swain </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 202 (1965), thereby making it much easier for a criminal defendant to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination by a prosecutor in jury selection than it had been under <em>Swain. </em>The Court held in <em>Griffith </em>that a new criminal rule, such as the rule announced in <em>Batson, </em>applies retroactively to all cases, State and Federal, pending on direct review or in which the conviction is not yet final. <em>Griffith, supra </em>at 320-328. The Court reasoned that, after it has declared a new rule in a particular case, \u201cthe integrity of judicial review\u201d requires that that rule be applied by the Supreme Court and all lower courts to all similar cases which have not gone to final judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 323. \u201c[S]elective application of new rules,\u201d the Court concluded, \u201cviolates the principle of treating similarly situated defendants the same.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the Court moved away from the <em>Linkletter-Stovall </em>three-part test in its resolution of the retroactivity question in cases in which judgment had not become final.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Then came <em>Teague </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288 (1989), a case involving collateral review. After an unsuccessful State court appeal, the defendant filed a habeas corpus petition in the Federal District Court. Among other things, he argued that the rule of <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>419 U.S. 522 (1975), holding that the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires that the jury venire be drawn from a cross section of the community, should be extended to the petit jury as well. The District Court denied the petition, and the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed. The Supreme Court affirmed without addressing the Sixth Amendment question, concluding that a rule that would extend the fair cross section requirement to the petit jury should in no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>event be applied retroactively to cases on collateral review. The Court did not apply the three-part test.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">In <em>Teague, supra </em>at 302-305, Justice O\u2019Connor, joined by the Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, and Justice Kennedy, discussed the inconsistent and unsatisfactory results produced by the three-part test approach. The Court also focused on the importance of the \u201cprinciple of finality which is essential to the operation of our criminal justice system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 309. \u201cWithout finality,\u201d Justice O\u2019Connor wrote, \u201cthe criminal law is deprived of much of its deterrent effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Justice O\u2019Connor then announced the adoption, with one modification, of Justice Harlan\u2019s view of retroactivity for cases on collateral review. <em>Id. </em>at 311. That view, which had been expressed earlier by Justice Harlan in separate opinions in <em>Mackey </em>v. <em>United States, </em>401 U.S. 667, 675 (1971), and <em>Desist </em>v. <em>United States, </em>394 U.S. 244, 256 (1969), was that new constitutional rules should not be applied retroactively to criminal cases on collateral review unless they fall within either of two very limited exceptions. \u201cThe first exception [is] that a new rule should be applied retroactively if it places \u2018certain kinds of primary, private individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal law-making authority to proscribe.\u2019 . . . The second exception [is] that a new rule should be applied retroactively if it requires the observance of \u2018those procedures that . . . are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Teague, supra </em>at 311, quoting <em>Mackey, supra </em>at 692. The plurality in <em>Teague </em>modified the second Harlan exception by limiting its scope \u201cto those new procedures [of fundamental fairness] without which the likelihood of an accurate conviction is seriously diminished.\u201d <em>Teague, supra </em>at 312-313.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Since <em>Teague </em>was decided, the Supreme Court has twice reiterated the retroactivity rule that that decision announced. In <em>Penry </em>v. <em>Lynaugh, </em>109 S. Ct. 2934, 2944 (1989), a capital case, the Court stated: \u201cBecause Penry is before us on collateral review, we must determine, as a threshold matter, whether granting him the relief he seeks would create a \u2018new rule.\u2019 <em>Teague </em>v. <em>Lane, [supra]. </em>Under <em>Teague, </em>new rules will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>not be applied or announced in cases on collateral review unless they fall into one of two exceptions. <em>Id. </em>at [311] . . . .\u201d See <em>Butler </em>v. <em>McKellar, </em>110 S. Ct. 1212 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">It is appropriate for us to consider whether in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grey, supra, </em>we announced a new criminal rule and, if so, whether that rule falls within one of the exceptions discussed in <em>Teague. </em>In <em>Grey, supra </em>at 470-471, we held that evidence of a defendant\u2019s mental impairment (including impairment due to intoxication, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Glass, </em>401 Mass. 799, 809-810 [1988]), is relevant to the question of malice in murder. \u201cIn general ... a case announces a new rule when it breaks new ground or imposes a new obligation on the States or the Federal Government .... To put it differently, a case announces a new rule if the result was not <em>dictated </em>by precedent existing at the time the defendant\u2019s conviction became final\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Teague </em>v. <em>Lane, supra </em>at 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">For several years before <em>Grey </em>was decided, a defendant\u2019s mental illness or impairment due to intoxication by drugs or alcohol was recognized in our decisions as being relevant to a consideration of whether a murder that had been committed was committed after deliberate premeditation or with extreme atrocity or cruelty, and was, therefore, murder in the first degree. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>385 Mass. 639, 648-649 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>380 Mass. 672, 680-681 (1980), and cases cited. However, our jurisprudence also contains a long line of cases that hold that a defendant\u2019s intoxication \u201cdoes not relieve his actions of their malicious quality in law.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Huot, </em>380 Mass. 403, 410 (1980), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGuirk, </em>376 Mass. 338, 346 (1978), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 1120 (1979). See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>354 Mass. 630, 634-635 (1968); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>351 Mass. 522, 532-533, cert. denied, 389 U.S. 991 (1967). Thus, until our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henson, </em>394 Mass. 584 (1985), which we discuss below, our precedent at least hinted that mental impairment, whether or not due to voluntary intoxication, was relevant only to the degree of murder and not to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>proof of murder itself. In fact, even after our decision in <em>Henson, </em>we observed in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dunton, </em>397 Mass. 101, 103 (1986), that \u201c[i]n no case have we recognized mental impairment as a ground for negating the element of malice in prosecutions for murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henson, supra, </em>a case involving an indictment for assault with intent to murder, which requires proof of a specific intent to kill, <em>id. </em>at 590-591, we announced the rule that, where proof of a crime requires a specific criminal intent and there is evidence tending to show that the defendant was under the influence of alcohol or some other drug at the time of the crime, the judge, if requested, should instruct the jury that they may consider that evidence in deciding whether the prosecution has proved that specific intent beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 592-594.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">A killing may be established as murder by proof of an unjustified and unexcused specific intent to kill or grievously harm the victim, but such a specific intent need not be shown. Malice in murder may also be shown by proof that, \u201cin the circumstances known to the defendant, a reasonably prudent person would have known that according to common experience there was a plain and strong likelihood that death would follow the contemplated act.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grey, </em>399 Mass. 469, 470 n.1 (1987). <em>Henson </em>\u201cdictated\u201d for the future the rule that mental impairment is relevant to proof of crimes requiring specific intent. It did not, however, dictate that mental impairment may be relevant to proof of murder, particularly in light of the precedent in this Commonwealth, discussed above, that suggested that mental impairment was relevant to the degree of murder but \u201cd[id] not relieve [a defendant\u2019s] actions of their malicious quality in law.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGuirk, supra </em>at 346. Our decision in <em>Grey </em>was consistent with, and even a logical extension of, the rule announced in <em>Henson, </em>but, as Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote in <em>Butler </em>v. <em>McKellar, supra </em>at 1217, \u201cthe fact that a court says that its decision*is within the \u2018logical compass\u2019 of an earlier decision, or indeed that it is \u2018controlled\u2019 by a prior decision, is not conclusive for purposes of deciding whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>the current decision is a \u2018new rule\u2019 under Teague.\u201d We conclude that the rule announced in <em>Grey </em>was not <em>\u201cdictated </em>by precedent existing at the time the defendant\u2019s conviction became final\u201d (emphasis in original), <em>Teague </em>v. <em>Lane, supra </em>at 301, and that it was a new rule for purposes of retroactivity analysis. Therefore, we turn our attention to the question whether either of the exceptions announced in <em>Teague </em>calls for <em>Grey\u2019s </em>retroactivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The first exception \u2014 that a new rule should be applied retroactively if it places \u201ccertain kinds of primary, private individual conduct beyond, the power of the criminal lawmaking authority to proscribe,\u201d <em>Teague, supra </em>at 311, quoting Justice Harlan\u2019s separate opinion in <em>Mackey </em>v. <em>United States, </em>401 U.S. 667, 692 (1971) \u2014 clearly does not apply. The second exception is that a new rule should be applied retroactively if not to do so would \u201cundermine the fundamental fairness that must underlie a conviction or seriously diminish the likelihood of obtaining an accurate conviction.\u201d <em>Teague, supra </em>at 315. For the exception to apply, the new rule, whether constitutionally based or not, must be \u201ccentral to an accurate determination of innocence or guilt\u201d in the \u201cbasic due process\u201d sense. <em>Id. </em>at 313. In <em>Teague, </em>the Court concluded that a new rule that would extend the requirement that jury venires be comprised of a fair cross section of the community to petit juries would not be the type of \u201c \u2018bedrock procedural element\u2019 \u201d that would be applied under the second exception. <em>Id. </em>at 315. Surely, the new rule announced in <em>Grey, </em>that a jury may consider a defendant\u2019s mental impairment as one factor bearing on malice in murder, does not fall within <em>Teague\u2019s </em>second exception. We conclude that the defendant is not entitled to the benefit of the <em>Grey </em>rule, and we affirm the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b311-9\">Defense counsel in connection with the motion for a new trial and this appeal did not represent the defendant at trial or on the first appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
