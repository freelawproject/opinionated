Pratt also claims that the trial judge improperly instructed the jury not to consider a portion of his closing argument, and that the motion judge erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the convictions. .</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>We summarize the evidence in a light most favorable to the Commonwealth, considering the evidence at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mazza, </em>399 Mass. 395, 395 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">In the early morning hours of October 19, 1987, State Trooper Gregory Dern and about fourteen fellow State troopers prepared to execute a warrant to search for drugs at a house located at 194 Southern Avenue in Essex, as well as at a small one-room cottage behind the house, a small shed, the land behind the property, and the persons of Pratt and Mrs. Pratt. One Lieutenant James Jajuga stopped Pratt on Route 128 and transported him to the house in Essex, which was owned by Pratt\u2019s parents. While one group of officers detained Pratt at the house, another group of officers proceeded to the small cottage which was located behind the house, and which served as the Pratts\u2019 residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">State Trooper Dern knocked on the cottage door. A female voice responded from within the cottage, \u201cWho is it?\u201d Dern replied that it was the police, that he had a warrant, and asked the occupant to open the door. There was a pause. Again the voice in the cottage said, \u201cWho is it?\u201d Dern answered, \u201cPolice. I have a warrant. Will you open the door, please.\u201d Yet, again, the woman\u2019s voice asked, \u201cWho is it?\u201d At this point, Dern forced the door open and entered the cottage.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">On entering the cottage, Trooper Dern and the police officers accompanying him observed Mrs. Pratt lying in bed. Dern showed Mrs. Pratt the search warrant, explained the officers\u2019 purpose for being in the cottage, and began searching the cottage. In plain view, sitting on a stove, was a gold-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>colored bowl containing some partially burnt glassine bags with the term \u201c7-LIFE\u201d stamped on them.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Also located on the stove was a spoon that- was burned on the bottom, with a small swab of cotton on top,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and some additional glassine bags.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The search in the cottage proceeded. After five or ten minutes, Trooper Brian Lilly was about to search some shelves above the bed, where some folded towels, stockings, and toiletries lay. Just as Lilly was reaching for the shelf, Mrs. Pratt got out of bed, pointed to the shelf, and began to speak.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While officers held Mrs. Pratt, Lilly searched the shelf. He found a brown wrapper-, within which were forty-four glassine bags, each bearing the inscription \u201c7-LIFE.\u201d They were wrapped in packets of ten, except for one packet which contained four bags. Each bag contained heroin. Also on the shelf were forty-four round tablets wrapped in a piece of tinfoil, later identified as methaqualones.S <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In the same place, the police found a brown bottle which contained fifty-two methadone tablets, as well as seven hypodermic needles and seven syringes.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">From behind the stove, the police seized a small bag of white powdered substance which proved to be dextrose, commonly used as a dilutant in heroin. They also found documents in a cannister under the bed, including identification cards with the Pratts\u2019 names on them, as well as the Pratts\u2019 marriage certificate. Near the bed was a telephone; next to the telephone the police found a piece of paper with some handwritten notations relating to drug transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>After the search of the cottage was completed, approximately fifteen police officers formed a line and started walking from the rear of the cottage across the property, turning over rocks and logs in search of drugs. One officer overturned a rock, lifted up a square matted patch of sod, and found a white plastic bag containing a glass jar with white pills in it. Nearby, two more pill-filled bottles were found. In total, 1,357 methaqualone pills were discovered. Under a rotted log, the police found a plastic container wrapped inside a black trash bag. In the container were four aluminum foil packages; inside each package were two brown packages, each of which contained approximately fifty glassine bags of heroin with the inscription \u201c7-LIFE\u201d stamped on them, wrapped in units of ten.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">2. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence. </em>Arguing that there was insufficient evidence to prove that she was in possession of the contraband in the cottage or on the property, Mrs. Pratt claims that the trial judge erroneously denied her motion for a required finding of not guilty. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">\u201cThe essential question in evaluating the denial of a motion for a required finding of not guilty is whether the evidence received, viewed in a light most favorable t\u00f3 the Commonwealth, is sufficient so that the jury \u2018might properly draw inferences, not too remote in the ordinary course of events, or forbidden by any rule of law, and conclude upon all the established circumstances and warranted inferences that the guilt of the defendant was proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pope, </em>406 Mass. 581, 584 (1990), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clary, </em>388 Mass. 583, 588 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">\u201cPossession implies \u2018control and power,\u2019 . . . exclusive or joint ... or, in the case of \u2018constructive possession,\u2019 knowledge coupled with the ability and intention to exercise dominion and control.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brzezinski, </em>405 Mass. 401, 409 (1989), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rosa, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 495, 498 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">The evidence warranted an inference that Mrs. Pratt had knowledge of the drugs found. She had been sitting quietly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>on the bed as the police conducted their search, and only when a police officer reached a shelf which contained a large quantity of contraband, at least five minutes into the search, did Mrs. Pratt get up from the bed, point to the shelf, and begin to speak. The jury could infer that Mrs. Pratt\u2019s gesture stemmed from her knowledge of the contraband\u2019s presence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In addition, there was evidence that drugs, drug paraphernalia, and a drug transaction list were in plain view in the small one-room cottage. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brzezinski, supra </em>at 410; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>354 Mass. 508, 513 (1968). The fact that the drugs found in the woods were packaged in an identical manner to those found in the cottage, and that they were of the same type and \u201cbrand,\u201d allowed an inference that Mrs. Pratt knew of their presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The jury could also infer that Mrs. Pratt had the ability and intention to exercise dominion and control over the contraband. There was evidence that Mrs. Pratt resided with Pratt in the cottage where a portion of the contraband was stored. \u201cWhen contraband is found in a dwelling shared by a defendant and one or more other persons, a finder of fact may properly infer that the defendant is in possession of the contraband . . . from evidence that the contraband was found in proximity to personal effects of the defendant in areas of the dwelling, such as a bedroom or closet, to which other evidence indicates the defendant has a particular relationship.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rarick, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 912, 912 (1986), and cases cited. Forty-four bags of heroin, forty-four methaqualude tablets, a bottle of methadone tablets, and seven syringes and needles were all found on an open shelf amidst towels, stockings, and toiletries. From her possession of the drugs in the cottage, from the similarity between the packaging and the type of drugs found in the cottage and those found in the woods, from her knowledge, as evidenced by the drug transaction sheet, of the scale of the drug opera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>tion, and from her access to and use of the surrounding property, the jury could infer that Mrs. Pratt was in possession of the drugs found on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">There was also sufficient evidence presented for the jury to find that Mrs. Pratt harbored the requisite intent to distribute. \u201cPossession of a large quantity of an illicit narcotic raises an inference of intent to distribute.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sendele, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 755, 758 (1984), and cases cited. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gill, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 653, 657 (1974). In conjunction with the quantity of drugs found, the manner of packaging permitted an inference of an intent to distribute. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sendele, supra </em>at 758. There was evidence that the heroin was packaged in amounts of one dose per glassine bag, that each bag was marked with a brand name popular in the Cape Ann area, and that the bags were bundled into groups of ten and wrapped together in packages of fifty. A police officer testified that this method of packaging is a common practice for heroin distribution. The drug transaction list found in plain view in the cottage also could contribute to an inference of intent to distribute. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeCastro, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 937, 939 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Pratt and Mrs. Pratt claim that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to find that a conspiracy existed and that, as to these indictments, the judge should have granted their motions for required findings of not guilty. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">The crime of conspiracy \u201cis complete upon the formation of an agreement and a combination to commit, or cause [ ] to be committed, a crime or an unlawful act.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nighelli, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 590, 593-594 (1982), and cases cited. \u201cA conspiracy may be proved by circumstantial evidence, and this is the usual mode of proving it, since it is not often that direct evidence can be had. The acts of different persons who are shown to have known each other, or to have been in communication with each other, directed towards the accomplishment of the same object . . . may be satisfactory proof of a conspiracy.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>163 Mass. 411, 417-418 (1895).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>There was sufficient evidence of a conspiracy to send the indictments to the jury. As discussed above, the jury could conclude that Mrs. Pratt possessed the contraband with intent to distribute. Further, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that Pratt himself was guilty of the same crime.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 9The jury could infer that the pair, living together in a one-room cottage, working toward a common end, were engaged in a conspiracy. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nighelli, supra </em>at 594. Mrs. Pratt need not have been so heavily involved in the operation as her husband in order for her to be found guilty of conspiracy. See <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Tufts, </em>239 Mass. 458, 493 (1921).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">3. <em>The judge\u2019s charge. </em>The defendant argues that the judge erroneously instructed the jury not to speculate as to the credibility of certain \u25a0 individuals not called by the Commonwealth to testify. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The defendant, who represented himself at trial, grounded his defense on the theory that the four informants who were designated in the search warrant affidavit may have planted the drugs on his property. The defendant called the one informant who was named in the affidavit, Steve Lambert, a heroin addict, as a witness on his behalf. The identities of the other three informants, C-l, C-2, and C-3, had not been disclosed by the police, and a defense motion for disclosure of their identities had been denied. The defendant cross-examined police witnesses as to these informants\u2019 backgrounds. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>One police officer testified that C-l was a known heroin dealer. Another officer testified that C-2 was a heroin user and purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">The defendant, in his closing argument to the jury, theorized that one or more of the informants may have framed him in order to curry favor with the police. Pratt included the following statement in his argument. \u201cIs Steven Lambert the best that the Commonwealth had to offer? If he is the best the Commonwealth had to offer in this case, can you imagine what C-l, C-2 and C-3 are like? Can you imagine what sort of characters these people are?\u201d In order to put this statement into context, we quote portions of the defendant\u2019s argument at length in the margin.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>The judge, toward the beginning of his charge, made some comments related to the above portion of the defendant\u2019s argument. We quote the judge\u2019s instruction in context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-5\">\u201cI want to discuss first of all what is evidence, and before I tell you what is evidence let\u2019s talk about what is not evidence, certain things you should put out of your mind and forget. It is obvious that when you go out and deliberate you should not come to any conclusion based on bias or prejudice or some preconceived hangup. That is not evidence. Put it out of your mind. Because you suspect something to be so, that\u2019s not evidence. Mere suspicion is not evidence. It is not evidence if you go out in the jury room and start guessing, engaging in conjecture.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-6\">\u201c/ <em>believe at one point in final arguments it was said: Imagine what characters these people are </em>\u2014 <em>meaning C-l, C-2, C-3. I am telling you, don\u2019t imagine. That is engaging in a guessing game. Don\u2019t do that. That is not evidence. You can not imagine. You </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number><em>cannot guess. You can not speculate\u2019\u2019\u2019 </em>(emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Our analysis begins with the proposition that \u201c[w]ithin the bounds of the evidence and the fair inferences from the evidence, great latitude should be permitted to counsel in argument.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gilmore, </em>399 Mass. 741, 745 (1987). Defense counsel may point out the weaknesses of the prosecution\u2019s case, including decisions of the Commonwealth not to introduce certain items of evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 744-746. \u201cCounsel may suggest inferences which the jury may draw from the evidence, and the judge should not \u2018invade the province of the jury to decide what inferences to draw from certain evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 745, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bowden, </em>379 Mass. 472, 486 (1980). Counsel may not ask the jury to speculate on occurrences not fairly inferable from the evidence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Corriveau, </em>396 Mass. 319, 339 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">While it may have been preferable for the judge not to have singled out the defendant\u2019s words to illustrate the concept that the jury should refrain from engaging in speculation, the judge\u2019s remarks did not amount to error. The judge did not prevent the jury from considering aspects of the informants\u2019 credibility which were grounded in the evidence. Thus, the jury could take into account, consistent with the judge\u2019s instructions, that at least one of the informants was a known heroin dealer and that another was a heroin purchaser. The defendant was permitted \"to suggest that the failure of the Commonwealth to call the unnamed informants reflected adversely on the strength of the Commonwealth\u2019s case. The judge\u2019s instruction was a narrow admonition for the jury to refrain from \u201cimagining\u201d and engaging in a \u201cguessing game.\u201d As such, it did not impermissibly frustrate the defendant\u2019s opportunity to raise reasonable doubts based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>on the evidence before the jury and the fair inferences which could be drawn therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">4. <em>Search warrant. </em>Pratt challenges the validity of the search warrant and claims that the motion judge erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence seized pursuant to the warrant. We address each of the defendant\u2019s arguments seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">a. <em>Material omission. </em>Pratt claims that a material omission of fact from the affidavit in support of the warrant rendered its contents unworthy of credence by the magistrate. The affidavit, submitted on October 16, 1987, contained ten paragraphs which had been previously submitted in April of that year in an affidavit accompanying an application in another court for a warrant to search Pratt. The search pursuant to the April warrant uncovered no contraband. In the October affidavit, the affiant did not mention the unsuccessful search and stated that he had \u201cnot previously submitted the same application.\u201d The October affidavit included additional paragraphs relating to events which transpired in October, 1987. Pratt claims that the omission from the October affidavit that a substantial portion of its contents had previously been submitted to another court, and that the execution of the resulting warrant had not revealed any contraband, requires that portion of the affidavit be struck.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">The motion judge held a hearing pursuant to <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154 (1978), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nine Hundred &amp; Ninety-two Dollars, </em>383 Mass. 764 (1981). The burden at such a hearing is on the defendant to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the affiant made false statements in the warrant affidavit, \u201cknowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth,\u201d <em>Franks, supra </em>at 155, misstatements which \u201cbespeak bad faith,\u201d <em>Nine Hundred &amp; Ninety-two Dollars, supra </em>at 771.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>The motion judge concluded that the affiant did not act in bad faith, and the evidence introduced at the hearing supported his determination. The motion judge could conclude that the affiant believed, in good faith, that he had \u201cnot previously submitted the same application,\u201d because the October affidavit contained significant new information relating to Pratt\u2019s alleged drug-dealing. Furthermore, the motion judge found that the police executed the April search warrant \u201cprematurely\u201d and that the affiant \u201cattributed the failure on his actions and not on the information received from the informant.\u201d Considering that the affiant never doubted the existence of probable cause to support the April warrant, the motion judge properly could conclude that the affiant acted in good faith when he omitted references to the aborted search in the October affidavit. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">b. <em>Trash bag search. </em>One paragraph of the affidavit in support of the October search warrant included a description by the affiant of a search of a green trash bag which the police found in front of Pratt\u2019s residence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Pratt claims that the search constituted a violation of his right against unrea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>sonable searches and seizures under art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, contending that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of the trash bag. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">In considering whether there has been a search under art. 14, it must be determined whether the defendant had a subjective expectation of privacy which can be recognized as \u201creasonable.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Panetti, </em>406 Mass. 230, 234-235 (1989). In the circumstances of this case, the defendant cannot be said to have had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of his trash bag. The bag was placed three feet from the street near the driveway in front of Pratt\u2019s residence. It sat exposed to the public, waiting to be gathered up by the trash collector the following morning. This is not a case where police officers went to the defendant\u2019s back porch to seize garbage which had not yet been placed at the curbside for collection. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>71 Cal. 2d 1096 (1969). Rather, in this case the defendant can be said to have abandoned his privacy interests in his garbage through the placement of his trash bags at the curb for collection. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chappee, </em>397 Mass. 508, 512-513 (1986) (same result under Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The fact that an Essex ordinance allowed only licensed trash collectors to transport garbage does not make the defendant\u2019s subjective expectation of privacy any more reasonable. The licensed collectors may have rummaged through the defendant\u2019s garbage themselves. Secondly, once the defendant knew that the garbage would be picked up by licensed collectors and deposited at the local landfill, he should have known that others could gain access to the garbage.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">At least with respect to the facts of this particular case, we are not persuaded that our Constitution provides broader protection than the United States Constitution with regard to privacy interests in garbage. We agree with the Supreme Court\u2019s remarks in <em>California </em>v. <em>Greenwood, </em>486 U.S. 35, 40 (1988): \u201cIt is common knowledge that plastic garbage bags left on or at the side of a public street are readily accessible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>to animals, children, scavengers, snoops, and other members of the public. . . . Moreover, respondents placed their refuse at the curb for the express purpose of conveying it to a third party, the trash collector, who might himself have sorted through respondents\u2019 trash or permitted others, such as the police, to do so. Accordingly, having deposited their garbage \u2018in an area particularly suited for public inspection and, in a manner of speaking, public consumption, for the express purpose of having strangers take it,\u2019 . . . respondents could have no reasonable expectation of privacy in the inculpatory items that they discarded.\u201d (Footnotes and citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">c. <em>Search of the land. </em>Pratt claims that the affidavit failed to establish probable cause to search the land behind the Pratt residence because it purportedly demonstrated no nexus between the evidence sought and the land. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">\u201cAn affidavit must contain enough information for the issuing magistrate to determine that the items sought are related to the criminal activity under investigation, and that they reasonably may be expected to be found in the place to be searched. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cefalo, </em>381 Mass. 319, 328-329 (1980). A nexus between the items to be seized and the place to be searched need not be based on direct observation and may be found in \u2018the type of crime, the nature of the missing items, the extent of the suspect\u2019s opportunity for concealment, and normal inferences as to where a criminal would be likely to hide stolen property.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burt, </em>393 Mass. 703, 715 (1985), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cinelli, </em>389 Mass. 197, 213 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">The affidavit provided sufficient information to show a nexus between the items to be seized and the land behind the defendant\u2019s house. One informant described a drug transaction which occurred between \u201chim,\u201d a \u201csecond individual,\u201d and Pratt on or about October 16, 1987. The \u201csecond individual\u201d telephoned Pratt at his cottage, and the two met Pratt a short distance from his residence, where the second individual handed Pratt an unspecified amount of money. \u201cPratt then took [the informant] and the second individual to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number><em>a wooded area near 194 Southern Ave. </em>and directed the second individual <em>to a location where the heroin was secreted. </em>The retrieved packet was described by [the informant] as containing 50 glassine bags bearing the inscription 7-Life and wrapped in brown paper.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) The informant then observed Pratt returning to his house. The affidavit also recited the informant\u2019s statement that \u201cJames Pratt is extremely cautious and fearful of police detection and once stated to [the informant] that if the police came to his residence they would never find the heroin because of the size of the property on which he lives and his method of secreting the heroin.\u201d The magistrate reasonably could infer from these statements in the affidavit that contraband could be expected to be found on the land surrounding the defendant\u2019s residence.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">For the above reasons the judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b662-11\">Pratt was convicted of possession of a class B controlled substance, methaqualone, with intent to distribute, in violation of G.

See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Oakes, ante </em>92, 94-95 (1990). We perceive no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Id. </em>We also note that the question whether a husband and wife may be coconspirators is not a question of the sufficiency of the evidence, but a question of law.

I\u2019ll tell you why they did it. Because they were under indictment. They were afraid to go to jail and they were willing to do anything to get out of jail, and what that included was putting drugs in my yard that has no fences, no gates. And I submit that that fingerprint on those containers may have been Steven Lambert\u2019s or any one of these confidential informants. If the Commonwealth in this case had so strong a case against me, why did they name Steven Lambert as an informant? Do you believe that Steven Lambert\u2019s testimony was credible in this case? First he said there were no promises made to him and then in the same breath he said he was released from custody. Why was he released from custody in a heroin case? I mean, there can only be one answer \u2014he agreed to cooperate with the case and whatever means it took. You heard his testimony: I would do anything to get out of custody. Anything.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">\u201cHere\u2019s a man \u2014 and not just Steven Lambert but unnamed confidential informants \u2014 whose testimony showed they had been arrested ten, twenty times, and they are on the street. Heroin dealers, they are on that street today.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">\u201cThey gave testimony that some of them may have been in custody when they made these statements. Wouldn\u2019t it seem reasonable that some brilliant entrepreneur, a major heroin trafficker who had been arrested would say: . . . What can I do to get out of this case?</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">\u201cWell, one thing they could do is go walking up into the woods where there are no fences, in the middle of the country, and plant drugs. They can do that because they have no fear of having to be called in in front of a jury and asked: Hey, did you do that? There is no fear for that. They have no problem with doing it because what they have done will never be exposed. They can do anything they want because there is no fear of going to jail. There is no fear of being caught and there is no fear of being cross-examined. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>\u201cYou have heard about these confidential informants in this case.

Do you remember what kind of person he was?</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">\u201cIn this case you are asked to convict me based on the evidence. . . . You are going to hear arguments that are going to say that you have heard testimony from credible witnesses. Well, I am not going to argue that the police are not credible. They may do things at times that in this case may seem a little high handed, but we know nothing of these other informants. We know nothing of C-l, C-2, C-3, heroin dealers, informants, confidential informants who, for whatever reason that we don\u2019t even know of because we will never see them, what motives, what opportunities and what reasons they had for either giving this information or trying to get out of jail.

This green trash bag was obviously placed on the side of the road to be picked up by the contracted trash collector for Essex, Ma. A check with Essex authorities revealed that the trash pickup for Southern Ave., Essex is accomplished every other Wednesday. Wednesday, October 14, 1987 was the assigned day. The green trash bag was inventoried and the following items were located:</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">\u201cA) A document bearing the name James Pratt, Southern Ave., Essex, Ma.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">\u201cB) Letterheads bearing the name \u2018Tracy Temporaries\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">\u201cC) Several pieces of paper with numerical notations.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">\u201cD) Numerous glassine bags (partially burnt) one of which bears the Inscription 7-Life.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-12\">\u201cE) Numerous empty brown packets.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-13\">\u201cF) Syringe.\u201d The motion judge, in his findings, essentially credited the above account, additionally finding that the trash bag was three feet from the paved road next to a telephone pole located eight to ten feet from the driveway.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b676-7\">We note that, while standing alone, the information relating to the defendant\u2019s activity in March and April would have failed to establish that probable cause existed in October to search the defendant and his premises, in this case \u201cthe affidavit described an ongoing criminal operation.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burt, </em>393 Mass. 703, 716 (1985). \u201c[W]here an affidavit recites a mere isolated violation then it is not unreasonable to believe that probable cause quickly dwindles with the passage of time.
