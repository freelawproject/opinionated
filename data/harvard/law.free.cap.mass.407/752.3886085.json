On April 17, 1988, a jury convicted the defendant of murder in the second degree on both indictments. The defendant was sentenced to consecutive terms of life imprisonment. The defendant appealed and we granted his application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-15\">We briefly summarize the evidence introduced at trial. On July 2, 1986, the two victims were asleep in one of the first-floor apartments at 91 Summer Street in Lawrence. At about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>4 A.M., the defendant, who lived upstairs, broke in the front door of the apartment and stabbed both women to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">At 10:50 a.m. on July 3, 1986, about thirty hours after the murders, two officers of the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, police department were dispatched to North Shore Drive at Three Rivers Stadium in Pittsburgh regarding a report of \u201ca man struck by a car.\u201d The officers found a city fire fighter there attending to the defendant, who was lying at the edge of the roadway. The fire fighter, while involved in \u201ctraining maneuvers\u201d in the stadium parking lot, had witnessed \u201cthe accident.\u201d The fire fighter reported that the defendant told him that he \u201ctried to commit suicide and failed again, [that he was] a murderer and [did not] deserve to live.\u201d One officer heard the defendant say that he \u201ckilled those girls and wanted to kill [himself].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">The defendant was then transported to a hospital\u2019s emergency room and treated. Two Pittsburgh homicide detectives confirmed with the Massachusetts State police that two murders had occurred as the defendant had stated. They conferred with a doctor in the emergency room and then interviewed the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">The interview with the Pittsburgh detectives continued for one-half to three quarters of an hour. The defendant began by stating that he was a Marine Corps veteran from Lawrence. He said that he had been working at Ayer Sales in Reading where three fellow employees, Janet Mazzola, Karen McCarthy, and Anne Marie Blackburn, \u201cwere conspiring against him to ruin his sex life, to ruin his reputation at work, and [that] he was being physically run down because of this.\u201d The defendant explained that \u201che knew the two victims just from seeing them but he later learned they also started to conspire against him along with these three girls from his work place\u201d after he moved to Lawrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">The Pittsburgh detectives asked \u201chow this incident occurred.\u201d The defendant responded that, during the day, he purchased a hunting knife at K-Mart \u201cfor the purpose of killing the victims and also for protection from others that he believed to be out to do him harm.\u201d That night \u201che was in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>his apartment and he heard somebody outside tampering with his car, and when he looked out the window he seen [szc] two males tampering with his car. ... He decided at that time to put a stop to his troubles and he got the knife and went downstairs to the victims\u2019 apartment and killed them by stabbing them repeatedly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">The defendant claimed that next he ran two miles to a bus stop. The defendant stated he was \u201ccovered with blood and . . . that he knew he had killed the girls and that he never went back to the building for that reason.\u201d When asked what became of the clothing and the knife that he had that night, the defendant responded that he had thrown them into a trash bin somewhere in the area. When asked how his mental state was that night, the defendant stated that \u201cit had to be done and that he had no drugs or booze.\u201d The defendant stated that he had taken a bus to Pittsburgh. When asked about his automobile, the defendant explained that he wrecked his automobile either before or after the murders. The defendant stated that his last girl friend, one Linda Harper, was aware of the problems he was having and of who was responsible for those problems. When asked to elaborate as to why the incident took place, the defendant replied that, \u201c[i]t could be explained very simply. That the victims had caused him trouble with his girl, his job, and then with his auto, and there was no reason for him to live. So, if he was going to go, so were they.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Later that day, the Pittsburgh detectives met with a Massachusetts State police sergeant as well as a sergeant of the Lawrence police department. The next morning, July 4, 1986, the defendant gave a statement to these two officers from Massachusetts and to a Pittsburgh police detective. This statement was consistent with the defendant\u2019s earlier interview with the Pittsburgh detectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">On July 14, 1986, the defendant appeared in the Lawrence Division of the District Court Department where it was ordered that he be committed to Bridgewater State Hospital for observation. Dr. Albert D. Pike, a psychiatrist employed by Bridgewater State Hospital to evaluate defendants for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>competency and criminal responsibility, evaluated the defendant at the request of the court. Dr. Pike\u2019s report stated that, in his opinion, the defendant was competent to stand trial but was not criminally responsible for the homicides. On November 13, 1986, the defendant filed a notice of intent to rely on the insanity defense and to call Dr. Pike as a witness. The Commonwealth filed a motion for psychiatric examination of the defendant on December 5, 1986. The motion was continued to December 30 for hearing. In early November, 1986, the prosecutor communicated with Dr. Martin Kelly, a forensic psychiatrist, relative to the defendant\u2019s insanity defense. Apparently due to a miscommunication between the prosecutor and Dr. Kelly, Dr. Kelly examined the defendant on December 15, 1986, although no such examination had been ordered as of that date by the court. Upon learning what had occurred, the prosecutor notified defense counsel. On February 4, 1987, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss based on Dr. Kelly\u2019s action. The defendant also requested funds to retain Dr. Kelly. The judge denied the motion to dismiss but allowed the motion for funds. On.May 15, 1987, the judge allowed the Commonwealth\u2019s motion, filed on December 5, 1986, for a psychiatric examination of the defendant. The defendant\u2019s petition for relief from this order was denied. Pursuant to the May 15, 1987, order, Dr. Robert M. Weiner examined the defendant on November 2, 1987. Meanwhile, the defendant was examined by Dr. David Swenson, a psychiatrist employed by the Commonwealth to service the Essex County courts, at the defendant\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">Two of the three women from Ayer Sales whom the defendant had mentioned to the police testified. Janet Mazzola denied ever calling the defendant, visiting his apartment, or knowing the victims. She believed the defendant was angry toward her and others, that he \u201chad some kind of chip on his shoulder,\u201d \u201c[ajgainst everybody.\u201d She said that the defendant had accused her of spreading rumors about him, once had thrown a box at her, and once had struck her automobile with his automobile in the company parking lot, but he denied having done it. Karen McCarthy, another of the \u201cthree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>girls\u201d at Ayer Sales, testified that she did not know the defendant had moved to Lawrence, and did not know the two victims. She did not recall any \u201ctrouble\u201d in her contact with the defendant. She said she had never called the defendant, had never gone to his house or his mother\u2019s house and had never spoken to anyone about killing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">The defense introduced expert testimony on the issue of the defendant\u2019s criminal responsibility. Dr. Pike testified that he believed the defendant suffered from a paranoid disorder with its major symptom being his delusion or false beliefs. It was his opinion that the defendant understood and appreciated the criminality of his acts, but that he lacked substantial capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Dr. Martin Kelly, associate director of psychiatry at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, with whom the prosecutor had communicated with respect to examining the defendant, also testified. After examining records sent to him by the prosecutor, including the grand jury minutes, hospital and police records, and witness statements, he interviewed the defendant. As a result of this examination, Dr. Kelly concluded that at the time of the homicides, the defendant suffered from a psychotic delusional illness, which he would characterize as a paranoid psychosis or paranoid schizophrenia. In Dr. Kelly\u2019s opinion, this illness deprived the defendant of the substantial capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Dr. David Swenson examined the defendant at the request of defense counsel. In Dr. Swenson\u2019s opinion, the defendant was psychotic both at the time of the offenses and at the time of the examination. Dr. Swenson concluded that the defendant had been in a \u201cpsychotic rage\u201d when he broke into the victims\u2019 apartment. According to Dr. Swenson, it was \u201cpossible that [the defendant] _ at the exact time of the stabbings lacked the capacity to appreciate the criminal aspect,\u201d and that \u201cit appeared\u201d the defendant lacked substantial capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>Dr. Robert M. Weiner, who examined the defendant at the request of the prosecution, opined that the defendant understood the wrongfulness of his acts, as evidenced by his subsequent flight and by his knowledge that the police would be involved. It was also his opinion that the defendant had a substantial capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the judge failed to instruct adequately on murder in the second degree and that the judge erred in failing to instruct on manslaughter. We address the adequacy of the judge\u2019s instructions on murder in the second degree. We set out the relevant portions of the judge\u2019s charge in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>After instructing the jury on murder in the first degree and on murder in the second degree and on criminal responsibility, the judge continued with an instruction pursuant to <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>380 Mass. 672 (1980). Within the <em>Gould </em>instruction, the judge stated: \u201cIn simpler language, that means if you find that there was deliberately premeditated murder, and this deliberately premeditated murder was accompanied with that <em>malice aforethought which I have explained to you was an integral part of murder </em>. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The defendant contends, for the first time on appeal, that the judge\u2019s definition of murder in the second degree was fatally defective in that it failed to apprise the jury that proof of murder in the second degree requires proof of malice. The defendant also contends that the judge\u2019s instructions were in error because they implied that murder in the first degree, but not murder in the second degree, is a specific intent crime.* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant asserts that the judge\u2019s erroneous instruction was significant because there was evidence tending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>to show that, because of his mental condition, the defendant may not have acted with malice when he killed the victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Because the defendant\u2019s counsel did not object to the judge\u2019s instructions on the elements of murder in the second degree, we must ascertain whether the instructions were so seriously flawed as to create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lennon, </em>399 Mass. 443, 448-449 n.6 (1987). The defendant argues that the judge\u2019s instructions created the possibility that the jury returned verdicts of guilty of murder in the second degree even though finding that, due to his mental impairment, the defendant did not act with malice. We conclude that the judge\u2019s instructions may have created such a risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">A trial judge has the duty to state the applicable law clearly and correctly. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Corcione, </em>364 Mass. 611, 618 (1974). In assessing the sufficiency of the jury instructions, we consider the charge in its entirety, to determine the \u201cprobable impact, appraised realistically . . . upon the jury\u2019s factfinding function.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>384 Mass. 396, 399-400 (1981), quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wharton, </em>433 F.2d 451, 457 (D.C. Cir. 1970). \u201c[Wjhether a defendant has been accorded his constitutional rights depends upon the way in which a reasonable juror could have interpreted the instruction <em>[s]Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nieves, </em>394 Mass. 355, 360 (1985), quoting <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510, 514 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-7\">The Commonwealth contends that the judge\u2019s instructions, taken as a whole, were sufficient to inform the jury that proof of murder in the second degree requires proof of malice. The Commonwealth alerts our attention to the judge\u2019s <em>Gould </em>instruction where the judge directed the jury to consider whether \u201cmental impairment of the defendant\u2019s mental process precluded him from being able to deliberately premeditate\u201d and \u201cwhether or not the defendant committed the murder with extreme atrocity or cruelty.\u201d This, the Commonwealth contends, identified for the jury the very elements which distinguished murder in the first degree from murder in the second degree, because the judge then explained: \u201cIf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>you find that he was so mentally impaired on the date of the alleged crime, that would not require a finding of not guilty, but it would reduce both theories of first degree murder . . . to second degree murder.\u201d The Commonwealth also points to the judge\u2019s statement within the <em>Gould </em>instruction \u201cthat malice aforethought . . . was an integral part of murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">In charging the jury on murder in the second degree, the judge erred in failing to delineate more clearly the elements of murder in the second degree. We cannot say with confidence that a reasonable juror would have understood, from the judge\u2019s instructions, that a conviction of murder in the second degree requires proof of malice. Hence, the judge\u2019s instructions created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Accordingly, the judgments are reversed, the verdicts set aside, and the cases are remanded for a new trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b771-6\">The judge gave the following instruction: \u201cIn murder in the first degree the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the act of an unlawful killing and that the killing was committed with deliberately premeditated malice aforethought or, in this particular case or cases, with extreme atrocity or cruelty. By saying to you those things it probably now is clearer to you that the government, the Commonwealth, has proceeded in this trial under two distinct and permissible theories of first degree murder. One, deliberately premeditated malice aforethought. And the second theory being with extreme atrocity or cruelty.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">\u201cA killing is unlawful if it is done without justification or excuse. Now, a soldier in a war is justified in a killing; and a very young child can be excused in the death caused by the discharging of a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">\u201cI am separately going to explain, as I am required to do, the different theories upon which the Commonwealth has tried its case.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">\u201cThe first theory is of deliberately premeditated malice aforethought. Malice: In this case, if you find the defendant intended to kill the victim or intended to inflict grievous bodily harm, both intentions arising before the killing, then that would be sufficient for you to find malice aforethought. Not to emphasize but just to make it clear to you, I shall repeat that. Malice: In this case, if you find the defendant intended to kill the victim or intended to inflict grievous bodily harm, both intentions arising before the killing, then that would be sufficient for you to find malice aforethought.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">\u201cIn that definition I used the word intent. Specific intent is required in this crime. Specific intent involves a concentrating or focusing of the mind. It is contemplation rather than reflection and must precede the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-11\">\u201cJust to help you understand, although you probably well understand specific intent, there are other crimes in our Commonwealth which are general-intent crimes. General intent is when, for example, we stand or sit down. The mind, of course, works to decide whether to stand or to sit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>down, but there is no focusing or concentration of the mind. They are reflection actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">\u201cAs I have said, in this particular crime, first degree murder, it is specific intent that is required. Therefore, contemplation rather than reflex action preceding the act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">After defining deliberate premeditation and extreme atrocity or cruelty, the judge stated: \u201cThat is, my friends, the explanation of first degree murder upon which the government has proceeded during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">\u201cIn this particular case I instruct you that you are also legally permitted to return a verdict of second degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-10\">\u201cUnder our statutory law defining murder there appears the following definition: Murder which does not appear to be in the first degree is murder in the second degree. The degree of murder shall be found by the jury. Let me repeat that statutory language. Murder which does not appear to be in the first degree is murder in the second degree. The degree of murder shall be found by the jury.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b772-11\">The judge\u2019s definition of malice aforethought was more favorable to the defendant than the law requires. The defendant asserts that the judge\u2019s instructions implied that murder in the first degree, but not murder in the second degree, is a specific intent crime. However, because malice aforethought may be found in the absence of a specific intent to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm, murder in the second degree cannot be said to require specific intent. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grey, </em>399 Mass. 469, 470 n.1 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Starling, </em>382 Mass. 423, 428 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b774-8\">Because we reverse on this ground we need not address the defendant\u2019s remaining contentions. We pause to note that the defendant has been \u201cimplicitly acquitted\u201d of the portion of the indictments charging murder in the first degree and, therefore, cannot be retried as to those offenses. See <em>Price </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>398 U.S. 323, 328-329 (1970); <em>Green </em>v. <em>United States, </em>355 U.S. 184, 190-191 (1957).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
