L. c. 211, \u00a7 3 (1988 ed.), seeking relief from an order of a Superior Court judge denying his motion to quash a subpoena duces tecum directed to John Doe, II (Doe). After hearing, a single justice of this court denied relief. Roe appeals. He argues that (1) this is a proper case for reli\u00e9f pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3, and (2) S.J.C. Rule 3:08, PF 15, as amended, 396 Mass. 1217 (1986), applies to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>agents of an attorney and therefore the subpoena should have been quashed because it was served in violation of that rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">We summarize the facts. Roe believes that he was the target of a grand jury\u2019s investigation of a fire involving property owned by Roe. Roe\u2019s attorney retained Doe, an employee of a licensed investigator, see G. L. c. 147, \u00a7\u00a7 23 and 25 (1988 ed.), to investigate the fire incident. Without prior judicial approval, the prosecutor served a subpoena duces tecum on Doe to appear before the grand jury and to produce certain documents. Roe moved to quash the subpoena. After hearing a Superior Court judge denied the motion. The judge did not make any written findings of fact or rulings of law. Roe filed with the county court a \u201cPetition for Relief Pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3,\u201d which was denied after hearing. Roe appealed to the full court from the single justice\u2019s denial of relief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">Roe failed to submit a transcript of the motion hearing to the single justice or to the full court. Roe also \u201cintentionally omitted\u201d several \u201cexhibits\u201d from his petition, offering to \u201cmake them available to the court for an <em>in camera </em>inspection at the court\u2019s convenience.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanez, </em>388 Mass. 603, 604 (1983) (\u201cIt is the appellant\u2019s burden ... to bring us a satisfactory transcript\u201d). See Mass. R. A. P. 18 (a), as appearing in 378 Mass. 940 (1979). Thus, there was no error in the single justice\u2019s denial of relief. Nevertheless, because of the importance of PF 15 to the administration of criminal justice and because this is our first occasion to comment on the interpretation of PF 15, we consider Roe\u2019s claims. See <em>Wellesley College </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>313 Mass. 722, 731 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">Supreme Judicial Court Rule 3:08, PF 15, provides that \u201c[i]t is unprofessional conduct for a prosecutor to subpoena an attorney to a grand jury without prior judicial approval in circumstances where the prosecutor seeks to compel the at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>torney/witness to provide evidence concerning a person who is represented by the attorney/witness.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Ethical concerns raised by an attorney subpoena include \u201cthe \u2018chilling\u2019 of the attorney-client relationship, the implication of Sixth Amendment concerns, the creation of conflicting interests between an attorney and his [or] her client, and the possibility for adversarial abuse.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>United States </em>v. <em>Klubock, </em>832 F.2d 649, 655-656 (1st Cir.), aff'd by an equally divided court, 832 F.2d 664 (1st Cir. 1987) (en banc) (incorporating amended panel opinion). See Stern &amp; Hoffman, Privileged Informers: The Attorney Subpoena Problem and A Proposal For Reform, 136 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1783, 1787-1789 (1988); Weiner, Federal Grand Jury Subpoenas to Attorneys: A Proposal For Reform, 23 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 95, 111 (1985). \u201cThe implications of this disturbing practice are great, to the point of threatening the keystone of the attorney-client relationship, most notably the trust placed by clients in their attorneys.\u201d <em>In re Grand Jury Subpoena to Attorney (Under Seal), </em>679 F. Supp. 1403, 1404 (N.D.W. Va. 1988). We conclude that PF 15 must be interpreted to include agents of an attorney, including investigators such as Doe.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">The concerns that gave rise to the enactment of PF 15, most notably the \u201cchilling\u201d effect on the attorney-client relationship, also are implicated if an attorney\u2019s agent is subpoenaed. Subpoenaing an agent carries the risk that confidential information imparted by the attorney to the agent in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>conduct an effective investigation may be disclosed through the agent, in contravention of the concerns that gave rise to PF 15. Turning members of the defense team into government witnesses may undermine a client\u2019s trust in, and his willingness to communicate with, his attorney. That a prosecutor may seek to compel evidence concerning a client from an agent rather than from the attorney himself does not diminish the danger of such a \u201cchilling wedge.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Further, the power to profit from a defense attorney\u2019s investigative efforts by subpoenaing that attorney\u2019s investigator carries with it the power to control and limit the preparation of the client\u2019s case. A cautious attorney may be discouraged from hiring an investigator to investigate thoroughly his client\u2019s case for fear of producing evidence that will be used against the client. Similarly, an attorney who does hire an investigator may find that he had been instrumental in collecting evidence that ensures his client\u2019s indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">If a judge, after hearing, determines that there has been a violation of PF 15, the judge has a full panoply of remedies available.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The judge also may, among other remedies, consider ordering the' presentation of evidence to a different grand jury without the use of the subpoenaed evidence or any evidence derived from the subpoena, suppression of the evidence without a different grand jury or, in an especially egregious case, the dismissal of indictments.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The judge may conclude that the violation did not assist the prosecutor and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>therefore no remedy is required. In sum, the judge may use <em>any remedy </em>which effectuates the purposes of PF 15.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">The order of the single justice is affirmed. Further proceedings consistent with this opinion are to be had in the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b930-14\">The names used in this opinion are ficticious.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b931-8\">Doe subsequently complied with the subpoena and appeared before the grand jury. Doe\u2019s compliance with the subpoena would appear to moot the question of quashing that subpoena, although other remedies may be available. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Winer, </em>380 Mass. 934, 935 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b932-6\">Prosecution Function 15\u2019s only express requirement is that a prosecutor obtain judicial approval prior to subpoenaing certain witnesses. It does not set forth specific procedures for obtaining the required judicial approval. At the very least, the rule contemplates an ex parte proceeding initiated by a prosecutor before a judge. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Klubock, </em>832 F.2d 649, 657 (1st Cir.), aff'd by an equally divided court, 832 F.2d 664 (1st Cir. 1987) (en banc).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b932-9\">\u201cEven where an indictment may not have issued, and thus technically the attorney/witness is not yet an \u2018adversary,\u2019 since the subpoena regulated by PF 15 seeks to compel evidence \u2018concerning a person who is represented by the attorney/witness,\u2019 it relates to an established attorney-client relationship. The serving of a subpoena in such circumstances will immediately drive a chilling wedge between the attorney/witness and his client.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Klubock, supra </em>at 653.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b933-7\">Moreover, \u201cany disabilities imposed on the attorney-client relationship during the grand jury investigation will not disappear upon indictment. If anything, an indictment may intensify the client\u2019s suspicions and concerns regarding his attorney\u2019s role in the grand jury investigation that led to criminal charges. Consequently, preparation for trial may be seriously hampered.\u201d Weiner, Federal Grand Jury Subpoenas to Attorneys: A Proposal For Reform, 23 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 95, 111 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b933-8\">Pursuant to PF 15, a judge may disapprove the issue and service of a subpoena. The judge also may quash any subpoena that has been served in violation of PF 15 where doing so would be an effective remedy, especially if the subpoenaed attorney or agent has yet to comply with the subpoena.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b933-9\">The judge should report any violation of PF 15 to the Board of Bar Overseers and bar counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b934-7\">Roe also asks that we \u201cenjoin the grand jury and/or the district attorney from further proceeding against Richard Roe or in the alternative, dismiss any indictment against Roe as the prosecution\u2019s conduct in substantially interfering with Roe\u2019s constitutional rights through an unethical violation of S.J.C. Rule 3:08, PF 15 has irreparably interfered with Roe\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d Roe also claims that the information gathered by Doe was protected by the work-product doctrine and that the subpoena should have been quashed because it interfered with Roe\u2019s State and Federal constitutional rights to the effective assistance of counsel. Roe\u2019s record before us is too deficient to permit any consideration of his requested remedies.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
