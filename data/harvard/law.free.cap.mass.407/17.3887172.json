The commissioner asserts that the board erred by ruling that it had jurisdiction to grant an abatement on a claim that the commissioner had unlawfully computed Exxon\u2019s taxable income using the \u201cunitary busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>ness\u201d approach, where the only claims mentioned in Exxon\u2019s timely filed application for abatement were \u201cerroneous exclusion of certain real property\u201d and another item not pertinent to the appeal. The commissioner also asserts that the board erred by ruling that Exxon\u2019s \u201cunoperated acreage\u201d \u2014 real property that was owned or rented by Exxon for exploration purposes, but that was not actually producing oil or natural gas during 1979 \u2014 was \u201cused\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38 <em>(d) </em>(1988 ed.). We transferred the case to this court on our own initiative. We affirm the board\u2019s decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Only Exxon\u2019s 1979 corporate excise is in dispute in this appeal, so we will relate the facts relative to that year\u2019s tax only. Exxon filed a timely return and made timely payments of its corporate excise for 1979. On March 18, 1982, the commissioner assessed Exxon additional excises for 1979 of $1,312,858, plus $451,997.12 in penalties and interest. In its assessment, the commissioner computed Exxon\u2019s taxable income using the worldwide \u201cunitary business\u201d approach, which combines Exxon\u2019s income with that of various affiliated corporations. The commissioner also revised Exxon\u2019s property factor (as defined by G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 38 <em>(d), </em>and discussed below) to exclude from the computation of Exxon\u2019s taxable income all of Exxon\u2019s unoperated acreage, on the ground that unoperated acreage is not \u201cused\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 38 <em>(d). </em>This exclusion increased the value of the property factor and, therefore, as we explain later on in this opinion, also increased Exxon\u2019s Massachusetts taxable income.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">On March 14, 1984, within the time limits prescribed by G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 37 (1988 ed.), Exxon filed its applications for abatement totalling $366,920, disputing the exclusion of certain real property and another item, as stated above, but not complaining about the commissioner\u2019s use of the unitary business approach. In December, 1984, this court in <em>Polaroid Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>393 Mass. 490 (1984), concluded that the commissioner lacked the statutory authority to use the unitary approach. In January, 1985, after the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>time for filing applications for abatement of the March 18, 1982, assessment had lapsed, Exxon filed another application for abatement and a \u201cStatement in Support of Additional Application for Abatement\u201d as an amendment to its March 14, 1984, applications. In this application, Exxon raised the issue of the commissioner\u2019s use of the worldwide unitary approach, citing <em>Polaroid Corp. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">On April 22, 1985, the commissioner rejected the additional application as untimely, stating that \u201c[t]he matter of \u2018Unitary\u2019 assessment is a new issue and cannot be amended t\u00f3 an already open abatement claim on which the statute of limitations has expired.\u201d On June 20, 1985, Exxon filed a timely petition with the board to appeal the unitary issue. On July 3, 1985, the commissioner denied Exxon\u2019s request for an abatement on the \u201cunoperated acreage\u201d issue. On September 3, 1985, Exxon filed with the board another timely petition for appeal as to all amounts disallowed for 1979. The two petitions were considered together on appeal to the board. After a hearing, the board ruled that Exxon was entitled to an abatement on both the unitary assessment and the unoperated acreage issues. We agree with the board that Exxon was entitled to an abatement on both claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">First, we address the unitary assessment issue. Exxon was not required to identify its specific claims or legal theories in its application for abatement in order to preserve those matters for review by the board. The case of <em>MacDonald </em>v. <em>Assessors of Mashpee, </em>381 Mass. 724, 724-726 (1980), is instructive. It involved G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 59 (1988 ed.), which provides that an application for abatement of real estate tax must be submitted \u201cin writing\u201d and \u201con a form approved by the commissioner\u201d of revenue but makes no provision as to contents. We held that, pursuant to that statute, an application for abatement of real estate tax need not contain the specifics of the claim or the applicant\u2019s theories. The present case is governed not by G. L. c. 59, \u00a7 59, but by G. L. c. 62C, \u00a7 37. Nevertheless, <em>MacDonald </em>v. <em>Assessors of Mashpee, supra, </em>is instructive here because in c. 62C, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>\u00a7 37, like in c. 59, \u00a7 59, the only expressed requirement relative to an abatement application is that it be \u201cin writing to the commissioner, on a form approved by him.\u201d It would seem that similar statutes should yield the same answer with respect to the question whether an abatement application must particularize claims and theories.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The commissioner argues that, while c. 59, \u00a7 59, applies only to real estate tax, c. 62C, \u00a7 37, applies to a large variety of taxes, the determination of which may be complex. While a written application for abatement of real estate tax without specifics may put the taxing authority on reasonable notice of the area of dispute, the commissioner argues, an application for abatement under c. 62C, \u00a7 37, does not do so and therefore \u00a7 37 <em>implicitly </em>requires specification of claims and theories. We are not unsympathetic with the commissioner\u2019s position. Nevertheless, we are not persuaded that there is anything implied in the language of c. 62C, \u00a7 37, that is not implied in the almost identical language of c. 59, \u00a7 59. Of course, the Legislature may address the matter if it chooses to.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">The commissioner points out that c. 62C, \u00a7 37, requires that an application for abatement must be \u201con a form approved by him,\u201d and that 830 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 62C.37.1 (4)(c) (1988), promulgated by him in 1980, requires that an application for abatement (form CA-6) set forth the type of tax sought to be abated, the taxable period, the amount of abatement requested, and the specific facts and contentions relied on. Therefore, the commissioner says, the specifics are required. We reject the commissioner\u2019s argument for the reason that \u201c[t]he commissioner [may] not under the guise of approving a form for an application impose upon the taxpayer an obligation to furnish information not required by the statute expressly or by implication.\u201d <em>MacDonald </em>v. <em>Assessors of Mashpee, supra </em>at 725, quoting <em>Assessors of Brookline </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>310 Mass. 300, 308 (1941). Although the requirements of form CA-6 undoubtedly assist the commissioner in processing abatement applications, they do not rise to the level of a jurisdictional requirement with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>out statutory language to that effect. See <em>Children\u2019s Hosp. Medical Center </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>393 Mass. 266, 269 (1984) (the fact that a taxpayer seeking abatement of property tax failed to use the form required by the commissioner but not by statute did not bar the board from hearing the case on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">We turn to the second issue on appeal, which has to do with the unoperated acreage claim. Because Exxon had 1979 income from business activity within and without the Commonwealth, its Massachusetts taxable income was determined under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7\u00a7 30 and 38 (1988 ed.), by multiplying its Federal taxable income, with certain adjustments, by an apportionment quotient, which is the weighted average of three \u201cfactors\u201d \u2014 the ratios of Exxon\u2019s property, payroll, and sales in Massachusetts to, respectively, its property, payroll, and sales everywhere. The \u201cproperty factor\u201d is defined by \u00a7 38 <em>(d) </em>as \u201ca fraction, the numerator of which is the average value of the corporation\u2019s real and tangible personal property owned or rented and used in this commonwealth during the taxable year and the denominator of which is the average value of all the corporation\u2019s real and tangible personal property owned or rented and used during the taxable year.\u201d The commissioner revised the property factor used by Exxon by excluding from the fraction all of Exxon\u2019s unoperated acreage on the ground that such acreage was not \u201cused\u201d within the meaning of the word in c. 63, \u00a7 38 <em>(d). </em>This revision increased the value of the property factor and therefore increased Exxon\u2019s Massachusetts taxable income.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">On appeal to the board, the commissioner requested and received the following relevant findings of fact: \u201cExxon did not conduct tests on each and every tract for the year 1979. Exxon had acres and/or tracts which had no drilling conducted on them for the year 1979. Exxon did not touch every acre or tract every year.\u201d Nonetheless, the board concluded that the requirement of \u201cuse\u201d had been met. In its decision, the board noted the provision in 830 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 63.02 (4)(b)(2) that property was includible in the property factor \u201cif it is actually used or is available for use or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>capable of being used during the year in the regular course of the trade or business of the taxpayer. Property held as reserves or standby facilities or property held as a reserve source of materials shall be included.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The board observed also that \u201c[Exxon] points out that its activities on unoperated acreage are essential to the conduct of its business, in much the same way that in order to maintain a competitive position a manufacturer must invest in research and development of new products, new uses for them, and new methods of producing them. Although the unoperated acreage may not be producing income directly, \u2018the search [for new sources of petroleum and natural gas] must continue to keep the taxpayer\u2019s business alive and thus contributes directly to the taxpayer\u2019s income-generating activities.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">We cannot say that the board\u2019s conclusion was unwarranted. \u201c[The board\u2019s] determination is due some deference,\u201d <em>French </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>383 Mass. 481, 482 (1981), and its determination here finds support in cases on which it relied. See <em>Department of Revenue </em>v. <em>Amoco Prod. Co., </em>676 P.2d 595 (Alaska 1984); <em>Appeal of Richfield Oil Corp., </em>[1962-1966 Transfer Binder] Cal. Tax Rep. (CCH) par. 202-693 (Nov. 17, 1964). In addition, the commissioner has cited no persuasive authority for his position. We conclude, therefore, that the board\u2019s determination that Exxon was entitled to an abatement on the unoperated acreage issue was not erroneous. The decision of the Appellate Tax Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b36-7\">Section 63.02 (4)(b)(2) of 830 Code Mass. Regs, was promulgated by the commissioner in 1984 and repealed by him in 1985. In a footnote in his main brief, the commissioner asserts in a single sentence without reasoning or citation of authority that the board erroneously relied on that regulation. The commissioner\u2019s assertion does not rise to the level of \u201cargument\u201d within the meaning of Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975), and we do not consider it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
