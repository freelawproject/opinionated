In 1986, the DEQE by letter notified the Re-Solve Generators Committee (and Hazen) that, pursuant to G. L. c. 21E (1988 ed.), it was seeking reimbursement for. the cost of removing 115 drums of hazardous material from the Re-Solve site.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">On cross motions for summary judgment, a judge of the Superior Court ruled that Hazen was \u201centitled to a declaratory judgment declaring (1) that defendant [USF&amp;G] is obligated to defend Hazen against the claims made against Ha-zen by the [EPA] and the [DEQE] and to reimburse Hazen for its defense costs incurred to date; and (2) that USF&amp;G is obligated to indemnify and pay on behalf of Hazen any sums for which Hazen is liable as a result of the EPA\u2019s and the DEQE\u2019s claims.\u201d A single justice of the Appeals Court authorized USF&amp;G to appeal from the interlocutory order (a count based on G. L. c. 93A and G. L. c. 176D remained undisposed of). This court granted each party\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">USF&amp;G denies any obligation to defend Hazen against the governmental claims, argues that the claims do not fall within the basic recitation of the scope of policy coverage, and asserts that, in any event, the pollution exclusion clause relieves it of any duty to indemnify Hazen with respect to those claims. The applicable USF&amp;G policies, which include standard comprehensive general liability insurance coverage, provide that USF&amp;G will pay all sums Hazen \u201cshall become legally obligated to pay as <em>damages </em>because of . . . <em>property damage </em>to which this insurance applies, caused by an occurrence, and [USF&amp;G] shall have the right and duty to defend any <em>suit </em>against the insured seeking <em>damages </em>on account of such . . . property damage\u201d (emphasis supplied). USF&amp;G disclaims any duty to afford Hazen a defense with respect to the claims asserted in the letters of the EPA and DEQE because neither letter involves a \u201csuit\u201d against Hazen within the meaning of the word \u201csuit\u201d in the policy. USF&amp;G denies any duty to indemnify Hazen with respect to claims for reim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>bursement for cleanup costs, arguing that such costs are not \u201cdamages\u201d within the policy terms and that, in any event, any amounts payable by Hazen are not amounts Hazen is obliged to pay because of \u201cproperty damage.\u201d The motion judge rejected USF&amp;G\u2019s arguments on these points. We agree with him as to the claim asserted by the EPA but not as to the independent claim of the DEQE.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">We disagree with the motion judge\u2019s allowance of partial summary judgment in favor of Hazen based on his ruling that the policies\u2019 pollution exclusion clauses do not apply to the releases of pollutants in this case. In <em>Lumbermens Mut. Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Belleville Indus., ante </em>675 (1990), decided today, we have discussed the same standard form of pollution exclusion clause that is applicable in this case. We interpreted it as providing coverage for damage caused by the discharge or release of pollutants only if the discharge or release was not only accidental but also \u201csudden,\u201d in the sense of an unexpected, abrupt discharge or release. <em>Id. </em>at 680. Hazen has not demonstrated, on the summary judgment record, that there is no dispute of material fact as to whether releases or discharges of pollutants at the Re-Solve site, for which Ha-zen may be responsible, were sudden and accidental. The record is silent on whether the release of any pollutants at that site was sudden and accidental. Consequently, that portion of the declaration of rights that states that USF&amp;G has an obligation to indemnify Hazen with respect to claims for cleanup costs at the Re-Solve site must be vacated. The question whether the release of any damage-causing pollutants was sudden and accidental requires further attention in the Superior Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>We shall now turn to an explanation of why the claims asserted by the EPA (but not that independently asserted by DEQE) are (1) ones as to which USF&amp;G had a duty to defend and (2) involve claims for damages because of property damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">1. USF&amp;G argues that it has no duty to defend Hazen with respect to any claims of the EPA and DEQE until those claims are asserted in a lawsuit. Hazen replies that the letters of notification from those agencies had the same practical effect as the filing of a complaint in a legal action because Hazen\u2019s rights and obligations could be substantially affected by actions and determinations occurring before any lawsuit would be commenced. '</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">The policy provides that USF&amp;G has the \u201cduty to defend any suit against [Hazen] seeking damages on account of . . . property damage\u201d to which the insurance applies. In the next section of this opinion we shall discuss whether the governmental claims seek \u201cdamages on account of . . . property damage.\u201d Here, the question is how we should read the word \u201csuit,\u201d which is not defined in the policy. Obviously, on the record no lawsuit has been brought. Literally, there is no suit. That fact alone has been sufficient to provide the answer for some courts. See <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Sur. Co. </em>v. <em>Gulf Resources &amp; Chem. Corp., </em>709 F. Supp. 958, 960 (D. Idaho 1989) (Idaho law) (\u201cunder the plain meaning of the policy terms, no duty to defend has been triggered\u201d); <em>Technicon Elecs. Corp. </em>v. <em>American Home Assurance Co., </em>141 A.D.2d 124, 145-146 (N.Y. 1988), aff'd on other grounds, 74 N.Y.2d 66 (1989). It is, however, not sufficient to provide an answer for us.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">By a letter dated May 13, 1983, and addressed to Hazen in Holyoke, EPA notified Hazen \u201cof liability which your company may incur or may have incurred in connection with the Re-Solve Waste Facility in North Dartmouth.\u201d EPA said that it had \u201cdetermined that actual releases of hazardous substances, as defined in [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601], are occurring at the Re-Solve Facility.\u201d EPA and DEQE had spent public funds on \u201cactivities in response to these releases.\u201d EPA and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>DEQE were prepared to contract for the \u201clonger term phases of clean-up of the site,\u201d and EPA would undertake further activities \u201cunless EPA determines that such action will be done properly by a responsible party.\u201d EPA had concluded, based on the records from the Re-Solve facility, that Hazen might be a responsible party with respect to that site.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">EPA wrote that it wished to discuss Hazen\u2019s \u201cvoluntary involvement in the measures necessary to remedy the problems presented by the hazardous substances at ReSolve.\u201d A superficial view of the EPA letter might lead one to conclude that it is not analogous to a complaint. See, e.g., <em>Technicon Elecs. Corp. </em>v. <em>American Home Assurance Co., supra </em>at 146 (EPA letter was invitation to voluntary action, not coercive demand letter). The letter continues, however, declaring that \u201cthe only form of voluntary involvement\u201d that EPA would consider is \u201ccommitment to a complete implementation of all the measures needed on the site proper and reimbursement of the expenses already incurred by EPA and DEQE.\u201d It then describes those measures. EPA asked for a written response within thirty days, announced a planned meeting for all potentially responsible parties, and requested (pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9604 and 6927 [1982]) information and records regarding hazardous substances that Hazen sent to the Re-Solve facility. The letter advised Hazen of criminal penalties for any failure to furnish the requested information. EPA stated that, if it were to receive no response within the next thirty days, it would assume that Hazen \u201chas declined to undertake voluntary response activities at the ReSolve site.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">The question is a close one. The authorities are divided on the point.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude that the litigation defense protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>that Hazen purchased from USF&amp;G would be substantially compromised if USF&amp;G had no obligation to defend Ha-zen\u2019s interests in response to the EPA letter. That letter asserts that \u201cactual releases of hazardous substances\u201d were occurring at the Re-Solve site. As will be seen, that allegation sets forth a claim of damages on account of property damage. The letter from the DEQE, however, claims only a threat of the release of hazardous material from certain \u201coverpacked drums\u201d temporarily stored on the Re-Solve site. That letter does not allege the occurrence of any damage that falls within the policy coverage. The DEQE claim, as expressed in the letter, is not the equivalent of a suit. Summary judgment declaring that USF&amp;G was obliged to defend against the DEQE claim was not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Since the standard policy language was drafted, the EPA processes for the enforcement of obligations to aid in the cleaning up of environmental pollution have moved away from the use of lawsuits toward the use of agency demands for participation in remedial action.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Those requests are dan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>gerous for the alleged polluter to ignore because they often result in dispositive, extrajudicial solutions.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The consequences of the receipt of the EPA letter were so substantially equivalent to the commencement of a lawsuit that a duty to defend arose immediately. The EPA letter was not the equivalent of a conventional demand letter based on a personal injury claim. See <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Sur. Co. </em>v. <em>Gulf Resources &amp; Chem. Corp., </em>709 F. Supp. 958, 960 (D. Idaho 1989) (the insureds \u201cpoint out that the identification of them as PRPs carries more serious consequences than, for example, a demand letter between private parties. For example, they argue that they can be fined for failure to cooperate in the EPA\u2019s process of planning the cleanup. Also, if the EPA ultimately recovers the costs of response, defendants\u2019 failure to settle prior to commencement of litigation by the EPA could increase the amount of recovery against defendants\u2019\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Hazen\u2019s obligation to respond positively to the EPA letter was strong. The prospects of avoiding financial responsibility were minimal because liability is not based on fault (\u00a7 9607 [a] [1982 &amp; Supp. V 1987]) and the available defenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>are very limited (\u00a7 9607 [b]). Moreover, the risk to which Hazen was exposed was substantial because, as a practical matter, its liability is joint and several. See <em>O\u2019Neil </em>v. <em>Picillo, </em>883 F.2d 176, 178-179 (1st Cir. 1989), cert. denied sub nom. <em>American Cyanamid Co. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neil, </em>110 S. Ct. 1115 (1990). Early involvement in the settlement discussions is thus often crucial to protect one\u2019s interests. Any court action by EPA is limited to the administrative record (\u00a7 9613[j][l] [1982 &amp; Supp. V 1987]), and judicial review considers only whether the EPA \u201cdecision was arbitrary and capricious or otherwise not in accordance with law\u201d (\u00a7 9613[j][2]). Thus participation in the development of that record can be crucial. Settlement of EPA claims against potentially responsible parties (see \u00a7\u00a7 9613[f] [2], 9622[d]), with protection against claims for contribution (\u00a7 9613[f][2]), is a desired goal. The situation was such that the opportunity to protect Hazen\u2019s interests could well have been lost, long before any lawsuit would be brought.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It would be naive to characterize the EPA letter as a request for voluntary action. Hazen had no practical choice other than to respond actively to the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The early involvement of an insurer in such a process is obviously important to the insured (and very possibly to the insurer), assuming, of course, that the claim is one that falls within the coverage of the policy. We turn now to the question of the extent to which cleanup costs are within the coverage of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">2. USF&amp;G argues that the claims asserted by EPA and DEQE are not within the policy coverage because, in demanding payment of cleanup costs, they are not seeking \u201cdamages on account of . . . property damage.\u201d The record tells us little about the nature of the pollution at the ReSolve site and almost nothing about any property damage that the release of pollutants may have caused.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>We have little difficulty, however, in concluding as to the DEQE letter that a claim for the removal of certain stored drums of allegedly hazardous materials does not assert a claim for damages on account of property damage. Certainly, the record does not show the existence of no dispute of material fact whether property damage occurred. Hazen, therefore, was not entitled to a summary judgment declaring that the cost of removing the drums was covered by the USF&amp;G policy. Damages on account of property damage do not include costs incurred in complying with an injunction or order directed to damage prevention or costs incurred in complying with the law, where there has been no property damage. See <em>Aerojet-Gen. Corp. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>211 Cal. App. 3d 216, 237 (1989) (response costs for extant pollution, but not for future pollution, are \u201cdamages\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">As to the EPA claims, the EPA letter asserts that hazardous wastes have been released on the site and that there may have already been off-site groundwater contamination. The contamination of soil and groundwater by the release of hazardous material involves property damage.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The area of meaningful dispute is whether cleanup costs incurred in response to property damage are \u201cdamages\u201d within the meaning of the policy language. This issue has sharply divided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>courts, with the majority tending to hold that cleanup costs are damages.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The question is one of State law. Most State courts of last resort that have passed on the issue have held that environmental cleanup costs, incurred in response to demands of government agencies, are \u201cdamages\u201d when there has been a discharge of pollutants that has caused property damage. <em>C.D. Spangler Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Crankshaft &amp; Eng\u2019g Co., </em>326 N.C. 133, 152-153 (1990); <em>Boeing </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Sur. Co., </em>113 Wash. 2d 869, 886-887 (1990) (\u201ccosts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>owing because of property damages are remedial measures taken after pollution has occurred, but preventive measures taken before pollution has occurred are not costs incurred because of property damage\u201d). <em>Compass Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Cravens, Dargan &amp; Co., </em>748 P.2d 724, 728-730 (Wyo. 1988). Contra <em>Patrons Oxford Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Marois, </em>573 A.2d 16, 18-20 (1990). We join the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"AUK\">When pollution has occurred, cleanup costs are damages within the policy language because in that circumstance the word \u201cdamages,\u201d which is not defined in the policy, is ambiguous. If there are two rational interpretations of policy language, the insured is entitled to the benefit of the one that is more favorable to it. See <em>Slater </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., </em>379 Mass. 801, 804 (1980); <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Pawtucket Mut. Ins. Co., </em>352 Mass. 304, 306 (1967); <em>MacArthur </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Hosp. Serv., Inc., </em>343 Mass. 670, 672 (1962). It is also appropriate, in construing an insurance policy, to consider what an objectively reasonable insured, reading the relevant policy language, would expect to be covered. See <em>Home Indem. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Merchants Distribs., Inc., </em>396 Mass. 103, 107 (1985). Cf. <em>Bond Bros. </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>393 Mass. 546, 551 (1984). On this approach, a reasonable policyholder reading the language would fairly expect that the policy covered amounts he must spend to correct pollution damage for which the law holds him responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">We explicitly reject the reasoning of some courts that incorporates \u201c[pjrevious judicial interpretations\u201d into the insurance contract to narrow the scope of the word \u201cdamages\u201d and thus purport to eliminate any ambiguity. See, e.g., <em>Patrons Oxford Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Marois, supra, </em>at 19; <em>Maryland Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Armco, Inc., </em>822 F.2d 1348, 1352 (4th Cir. 1987) cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1008 (1988). (technical meaning of \u201cdamages\u201d is best approach to policy construction). Lay people should not reasonably be expected to know such limitations. For the same reason, we receive no proper guidance, in construing the word \u201cdamages,\u201d by recognizing that imposition of an obligation to clean up a site (or to make reimbursement for the cost of doing so) is based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>equitable principles, whereas to lawyers \u201cdamages\u201d may refer only to amounts recoverable in an action at law measured by the harm caused to a wronged plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Some courts denying coverage have been concerned that response costs might greatly exceed any decrease in the value of the property damaged by pollution. See, e.g., <em>Continental Ins. Cos. </em>v. <em>Northeastern Pharmaceutical &amp; Chem. Co., </em>842 F.2d 977, 986-987 (8th Cir. 1988); <em>Maryland Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Armco, Inc., supra </em>at 1353. Others have thought it significant, in denying coverage, that the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9601-9657) makes a distinction between harm to natural resources (which the courts equate to \u201cdamages\u201d) and cleanup costs. See, e.g., <em>Cincinnati Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Milliken &amp; Co., </em>857 F.2d 979, 980 (4th Cir. 1988); <em>Continental Ins. Cos. </em>v. <em>Northeastern Pharmaceutical &amp; Chem. Co., supra </em>at 987; <em>Verlan, Ltd. </em>v. <em>John L. Armitage &amp; Co., </em>695 F. Supp. 950, 954-955 (N.D. Ill. 1988). Neither of these facts should have any bearing on the meaning of the word \u201cdamages\u201d in the policy. If an environmental statute creates liability for the cost of cleaning up a polluted site, it makes no difference either that that measure of liability may exceed common law damages or that, in some instances, the government could seek to recover for damage to natural resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">The important point is that, if Hazen is legally liable to pay certain amounts because of property damage for which the law holds it responsible, and USF&amp;G is legally obliged to pay \u201cdamages on account of . . . property damage,\u201d Hazen has policy coverage, subject, of course, to the application of other policy provisions. The summary judgment record is not sufficient, however, to permit a determination of what damage on account of property damage occurred for which USF&amp;G must indemnify Hazen.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">3. The interlocutory order declaring the rights of Hazen Paper Company against United States Fidelity and Guaranty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>Company is vacated. The case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b706-6\">We decline to decide whether the summary judgment record demonstrates no dispute of material fact as to whether an occurrence took place within the definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d in the policy. Although one may infer that any discharge of pollutants was \u201can accident\u201d and the damage caused by such discharges was \u201cneither expected nor intended from the standpoint of [Hazen],\u201d the record is quite bare of relevant facts on which a judge may properly rely in deciding the point on summary judgment. The question is open during further proceedings in the Superior Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b708-7\">Compare <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins.

Co. </em>case, we think it unimportant whether the governmental agency is asserting its proprietary governmental interests or the interests of someone else whose property sustained damage because of the discharge of pollutants, or both. As cases, cited above, following the majority rule indicate, it does not matter in deciding the coverage question whether the governmental agency suffere'd property damage, provided some third party has a claim for damages on account of property damage.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
