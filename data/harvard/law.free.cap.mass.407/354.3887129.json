Skinner. Skinner rented a vehicle from Embassy, negligently drove the vehicle and severely injured William J. Tabor. On appeal, Liberty asserts that the judge erred in declaring that the business auto policy afforded noncompulsory liability insurance coverage to Skinner. Liberty contends that (1) Skinner was engaged in a \u201cprohibited use\u201d of the rental vehicle at the time of the accident; (2) she was not an \u201cinsured\u201d for purposes of that policy\u2019s noncompulsory liability coverage; and (3) the business auto policy and a rental agreement incorporated in that policy by an amendatory endorsement limit the amount of liability coverage available to indemnify Skinner to the minimum compulsory liability coverage. See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A (1988 ed.). We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The facts are not in dispute. Liberty issued two insurance policies to Embassy. One was a business auto policy, which provided two million dollars of noncompulsory liability insurance, and the other was an umbrella excess liability policy (umbrella policy) with a one million dollar liability limit. On February 2, 1985, Skinner rented an automobile from Embassy to use in place of her own car, which was being repaired. The Hanover Insurance Company (Hanover) had issued a Massachusetts automobile insurance policy to Skinner (Hanover policy), covering her own automobile, with liability limits of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident. On February 25, 1985, while operating the rented automobile, Skinner struck Tabor, a pedestrian, causing extensive bodily injury. Liberty, Tabor, and Hanover agree that, at the time of the accident, Skinner was negligent, under the influence of alcohol, and violating one or more State vehicle codes. Tabor sued Skinner in an action for negligent operation of a motor vehicle and obtained a judgment in the amount of $2,165,000, plus interest and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Liberty commenced this case by seeking, alternatively, the declaration that (1) the business auto policy did not afford coverage to Skinner for any claims arising out of the accident; (2) the business auto policy did not afford coverage to Skinner beyond the compulsory liability limits; or (3) the coverage the business auto policy afforded to Skinner was secondary to that provided by the Hanover policy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial judge allowed Liberty\u2019s motion to amend the complaint to add Hanover as a party defendant. Hanover filed an intervener complaint, a cross-complaint, and a motion for summary judgment. Tabor filed a motion for summary judgment and requested a declaration that full coverage from each of the three policies was available to pay the judgment entered in his favor against Skinner \u201cas a result of any negligence by Skinner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The judge allowed Tabor\u2019s motion for summary judgment and Hanover\u2019s motion to intervene as a plaintiff in the cross-claim. On Hanover\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the judge ordered that the noncompulsory liability coverage provided in Liberty\u2019s business auto policy was primary coverage for Tabor\u2019s damages and that, to the extent his recovery exceeded that amount, coverage would be provided in equal shares by Liberty\u2019s umbrella policy and the Hanover policy. She further ordered that, on exhaustion of the Hanover policy\u2019s three hundred thousand dollar coverage, any amount remaining on Liberty\u2019s umbrella policy would be applied against any remaining, unpaid damages to Tabor. Final judgment entered for Tabor pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 54 <em>(b), </em>365 Mass. 820 (1974). Liberty appealed from allowance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>of Tabor\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the order on Hanover\u2019s motion for summary judgment, allowance of Tabor\u2019s motion for entry of final judgment, and entry of judgment. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We affirm the orders and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">1. <em>Prohibited Use. </em>The business auto policy provided that two million dollars in noncompulsory motor vehicle liability insurance would be available to an \u201cinsured,\u201d defined as Embassy and \u201c[ajnyone else . . . while using with [Embassy\u2019s] permission a covered auto,\u201d subject to three exceptions not applicable here. The policy was subject to an \u201camendatory endorsement,\u201d however, which stated that \u201c[t]he insurance provided by this policy for the lessee, rentee, its servants, agents, or employees or those using the automobile with or without the permission of the lessee or rentee or persons alleged to be legally responsible for the use of the automobile is subject to the'terms, including any limit of liability, conditions, restrictions, and limitations contained in the lease or rental agreement.\u201d A boldfaced warning on the front page of the two-page rental agreement stated, \u201cWarning: Only renter and additional driver are covered by insurance.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The \u201cvehicle insurance\u201d provision continued, providing in relevant part that the business auto policy \u201cshall not apply . .. to any liability of Customer or any driver . . . arising while the Vehicle is being used in violation of any of the limitations set forth in Paragraph 2.\u201d Paragraph 2 listed \u201cprohibited uses\u201d of a rental vehicle and provided, in part, that a vehicle shall not be used \u201cin violation of any federal, state or local laws. (If the Customer [renter] is negligent or violates any of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>the state vehicle codes or is under the influence of alcohol or drugs, the Customer is totally responsible for all damages to the Vehicle and for any other claims by any other parties.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">The business auto policy expressly stated that Liberty \u201cwill pay [up to two million dollars to an insured] for any one accident or loss.\u201d The policy defined \u201caccident\u201d to include \u201ccontinuous or repeated exposure to the same conditions resulting in bodily injury or property damage the insured neither expected nor intended.\u201d The term \u201caccident,\u201d however, commonly is defined as \u201can unexpected happening without intention or design,\u201d <em>Beacon Textiles Corp. </em>v. <em>Employers Mut. Liab. Ins. Co., </em>355 Mass. 643, 646 (1969), and cases cited; see <em>Sheehan </em>v. <em>Goriansky, </em>321 Mass. 200, 205 (1947), and may include \u201c[u]nintended or unforeseen consequences of reckless or negligent acts.\u201d <em>Vappi &amp; Co., Inc. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Sur. Co., </em>348 Mass. 427, 432 (1965), and cases cited. See <em>Quincy Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Abernathy, </em>393 Mass. 81, 84 (1984). Under this definition, the business auto policy, standing alone, would cover an insured\u2019s negligent acts despite paragraph 2 (\u201cprohibited uses\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The rental agreement, however, redefines the term \u201caccident\u201d as defined in the policy, by excluding liability for an injury involving the violation of any law or vehicle code or involving negligent conduct, which typically involves unexpected or unintended consequences. See, e.g., <em>Luz </em>v. <em>Stop &amp; Shop, Inc. of Peabody, </em>348 Mass. 198 (1964). The rental agreement thus nullifies coverage in situations in which an insured would be liable as a result of the insured\u2019s negligence. \u201cIt is common knowledge that protection against liability on the ground of negligence is the principal purpose of [motor vehicle liability] policies .... The object of the policy is protection against law suits and legal liability.\u201d <em>Miller </em>v. <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., </em>291 Mass. 445, 448 (1935). The rental agreement renders the \u201cinsurance\u201d coverage provided by the business auto policy illusory. A provision in an insurance policy that negates the very coverage that the policy purports to provide in the circumstances where the person is liable is void as against public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>2. <em>Insured. </em>The business auto policy provided that liability coverage applied to an \u201cinsured,\u201d which it defined as Embassy and \u201c[a]nyone else . . . while using with [Embassy\u2019s] permission, a covered auto.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Liberty claims that Skinner was not an insured because she \u201cwas not using the rental automobile with [Embassy\u2019s] permission at the time of the accident.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It asserts that, by operating the automobile negligently, in violation of the State vehicle code, and under the influence of alcohol, Skinner engaged in a \u201cprohibited use\u201d of the automobile as set forth in the rental agreement. She was not therefore using the automobile with Embassy\u2019s permission and did not qualify as an \u201cinsured.\u201d Thus, concludes Liberty, Skinner was not covered by the policy. In support of its argument, Liberty cites a string of cases where owners loaned or rented their vehicles for a specific and limited use and the person to whom the vehicle was entrusted engaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>the vehicle in an impermissible use.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Ready, </em>331 Mass. 204, 207-208 (1954); <em>Lodge </em>v. <em>Bern, </em>328 Mass. 42 (1951). <em>Kenner </em>v. <em>Century Indemnity Co., </em>320 Mass. 6, 10 (1946). <em>Blair </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>291 Mass. 432, 436 (1935). We conclude that Skinner was an insured.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Our cases suggest that the phrase \u201cwhile using with [Embassy\u2019s] permission\u201d refers to the question whether an insured has been given \u201cauthority to operate\u201d or \u201cthe right to possession\u201d of an automobile for a specific purpose. See <em>Hurley </em>v. <em>Flanagan, </em>313 Mass. 567, 572 (1943); <em>White </em>v. <em>Standard Accident Ins. Co., </em>302 Mass. 474, 476 (1939). Skinner signed the rental agreement and was listed as an authorized driver. Skinner\u2019s \u201cuse\u201d of the automobile was within the scope of Embassy\u2019s permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Liberty\u2019s argument boils down to an assertion that Embassy did not give permission to Skinner to be negligent. The sole restriction on Skinner\u2019s use of the vehicle was that she agreed \u201cnot to use the vehicle for commercial purposes unless specifically authorized.\u201d The record indicates that Skinner was using the vehicle for personal purposes as a temporary replacement for her own car, which was being repaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">We reject the proposition that the phrase \u201cwhile using with [Embassy\u2019s] permission, a covered auto\u201d includes only non-negligent operation of the vehicle as a permitted use. Such a construction would provide coverage only when there was no liability. As we noted earlier, a provision in an insur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>anee policy that provides coverage only when there is no liability is void as against public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">3. <em>Compulsory Coverage. </em>Liberty argues that \u201c[njowhere in the body of either the lease or the insurance contract is there language from which one can discern an intent to provide coverage for leasees up to the $2,000,000 limit available to Embassy.\u201d The business auto policy plainly states that Liberty will pay an insured (Embassy and anyone using a covered auto with Embassy\u2019s permission) two million dollars per accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Liberty suggests, despite that language, that a person reading the policy would not have any \u201creasonable expectation\u201d that the policy covered anything other than compulsory coverage. We do not agree. An average person reading the policy would not know that the insurance only covered incidents in which, as a matter of law, there could be no liability or that, even if there were liability, Liberty would pay only the compulsory amount of insurance. A reasonable person reading the policy, including the statement in the business auto policy that up to two million dollars would be paid for any one accident, would conclude that the policy protection was broader than compulsory insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Liberty next maintains that, even if \u201cportions of the lease agreement are violative of public policy (prohibited use provision), the lease read as a whole only provides the statutory limits\u201d (i.e., compulsory insurance). See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In support of its contention, Liberty relies on the amendatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>endorsement and a provision in the rental agreement stating that \u201c[t]he Renter is provided with the state statutory limits in the state where the vehicle is rented: Bodily Injury, Property Damage, and Medical Payments Coverage.\u201d Liberty claims that, if Skinner is an insured, she only was entitled to the minimum coverage by virtue of that language. Liberty argues that the language, properly interpreted, excludes all coverage other than compulsory from the prohibited use provision of the rental agreement. The policy is ambiguous as to whether the limitation of liability applies only to amounts over the compulsory insurance. Nothing in the rental agreement limited the \u201cprohibited use\u201d language to noncompulsory coverage. The agreement\u2019s \u201cprohibited use\u201d and \u201cvehicle insurance\u201d language excludes all coverage for accidents or injuries based on negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Liberty also argues that we should read the \u201cstatutory limits\u201d language as an exception to the prohibited use provision of the rental agreement. \u201cIt is well established that, where an insurer drafts the policy, the language is strictly construed and all ambiguities are resolved against the insurer.\u201d <em>Transamerica Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Norfolk &amp; Dedham Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>361 Mass. 144, 147 (1972). By its language, the policy does not state that the \u201cstatutory limits\u201d provision is an exception from the prohibited use language of the rental agreement. The prohibited use language in the rental agreement contains no exclusion for compulsory coverage. We will not read into the policy any purported limitation of liability based on an exclusion not clearly expressed by the drafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">We affirm the judgment declaring that the noncompulsory liability coverage in Liberty\u2019s business auto policy was primary coverage for damages sustained by Tabor and that, to the extent his recovery exceeded that amount, equal coverage shall be provided by Liberty\u2019s umbrella policy and the Hanover policy, up to their respective policy limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Hanover\u2019s cross-complaint sought declaratory relief to determine the priority of coverage between Liberty\u2019s business auto policy and the Hanover policy. Hanover also requested a declaration that the business auto policy offered primary coverage for all loss up to two million dollars; and that both the Hanover policy and Liberty\u2019s umbrella policy offered excess coverage and that each should be applied, on a basis proportional to their respective limits, to any liability beyond two million dollars. Liberty did not contest the applicability of the umbrella policy to this case; it only contested the question when that policy was payable in relation to the other two policies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b371-7\">A \u201cvehicle insurance\u201d provision found on the back page stated that \u201c[Embassy] has automobile liability insurance with limits as required by law. If Customer has such insurance then [Embassy\u2019s] policy shall be secondary coverage and the Customer\u2019s policy shall be primary coverage.\u201d Our rule is that, \u201c[w]here .. . the driver does not own the vehicle he was driving in the accident, the coverage on the car is primary while the coverage of the driver is excess as between two automobile insurers whose policies contain identical \u2018other insurance\u2019 clauses.\u201d <em>Transamerica Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Norfolk &amp; Dedham Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>361 Mass. 144, 148 (1972), and cases cited. Liberty does not argue otherwise on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The business auto policy defined covered automobiles as \u201c[a]ny auto used under a written rental agreement, issued by [Embassy], stating a rental period of less than one year and in which [Embassy] agree [s] to provide the insurance\u201d and \u201c[a]ny auto used in [Embassy\u2019s] leasing and rental business, or used for nonbusiness purposes with [Embassy\u2019s] permission, except any auto when used under a written rental or leasing agreement issued by [Embassy].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Tabor asserts that Liberty did not raise this question at the trial level and argues that we should not consider it for the first time on appeal. See <em>Anthony\u2019s Pier Four, Inc. </em>v. <em>Crandall Dry Dock Eng\u2019rs, Inc., </em>396 Mass. 818, 821 n.6 (1986), citing <em>Penney </em>v. <em>First Nat'l Bank, </em>385 Mass. 715, 718 n.2 (1982). We agree with Liberty that the issue was before the trial judge. Liberty\u2019s amended complaint asserted that the rental agreement provided \u201cthat insurance would not apply if the vehicle was used in violation of the terms of the agreement\u201d and asserted that Skinner had violated those terms. In its memorandum in opposition to summary judgment, Liberty argued that there was a genuine issue as to the question of Skinner\u2019s sobriety, which was one of several factors affecting the availability of insurance coverage. After oral argument on the summary judgment motion, the parties stipulated that Skinner was operating under the influence. We agree with Liberty that the pleadings placed the \u201cconsent to use\u201d issue before the judge. Indeed, the judge\u2019s memorandum of decision concluded that Skinner was an insured as that term was defined in the business auto policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b374-8\">The implication of this argument is that, but for Skinner\u2019s \u201cprohibited use\u201d of the vehicle, the two million dollar noncompulsory liability coverage would be available to satisfy Tabor\u2019s recovery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b374-9\">Tabor argues that the agreement created ambiguity regarding the availability of insurance coverage because the average person would not know that negligent operation of a rental vehicle at the time of an accident would vitiate the owner\u2019s permission and negate coverage. Tabor also suggests that the average person would not know the extent of the insurance coverage from reading the policy. We need not consider that argument that \u201cin passing on a question concerning coverage available under a policy of insurance, \u2018it may be appropriate to consider what a policyholder reasonably should expect his coverage to be in the circumstances.\u2019 <em>Bond Bros. </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>393 Mass. 546, 551 (1984).\u201d <em>Home Indem. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Merchants Distribs., Inc., </em>396 Mass. 103, 107 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b375-8\">Liberty asks that we construe the statutory limits provision as an exception to the \u201cvehicle insurance provisions\u201d and that we construe \u201cstatutory limits\u201d as meaning minimum coverage. Because the language of this policy is not prescribed by statute, nor is it controlled by the Division of Insurance, see <em>Bilodeau </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Casualty Co., </em>392 Mass. 537, 541 (1984), the insurance contract is construed strongly against the insurer. See <em>Quincy Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Abernathy, </em>393 Mass. 81, 83 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">Further, on the result we reach, we need not decide whether, as Tabor contends, \u201cstatutory limits\u201d is ambiguous because it does not necessarily mean compulsory minimum coverage. Tabor argues that \u201climits\u201d means \u201ccap\u201d in those States where a cap is applicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
