Contrary to the decision of the Appeals Court,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we conclude that the instructions had such potential. Accordingly, we reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction of manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-15\">There is no need to summarize the evidence presented at the trial in great detail. The. prosecution\u2019s evidence indicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>that, after a disagreement, the defendant and the victim confronted each other. At the meeting, the victim had a baseball bat which he held \u201cshorthand\u201d (that is, hand on the wide end with the bat held behind his elbow). After the defendant declined an invitation to fight, the victim took a step toward the defendant, who shot a handgun into the air. When the victim took a second step forward, the defendant shot him once. Later, while getting into the police cruiser, the defendant said' in Spanish, \u201cIf he lives, I\u2019ll kill him again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The evidence in the defendant\u2019s case indicated that the dislike between the two men had stemmed from the victim\u2019s having insulted the defendant\u2019s wife. The disagreement culminated in the confrontation. As the victim, armed with a baseball bat, approached, the defendant indicated to the victim that he wanted no trouble. This effort to defuse the issue was rejected by the victim, who swung the bat at the defendant. The defendant fired a shot from his handgun into the air. When the victim came closer and swung the bat again, the defendant shot at the victim\u2019s body, grievously wounding him. The contentions before the jury, therefore, were, on the one hand, that the defendant had exceeded the boundaries of self-defense and had committed manslaughter, and, on the other hand, that he had acted justifiably to prevent a potentially deadly attack by the victim, who was approaching, armed with, and swinging, a baseball bat.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The evidence in this case required \u201cinstructions on the law of self-defense [that were] carefully prepared and delivered so as to eliminate any language that might convey to the jury the impression that [the] defendant must prove that he acted in self-defense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vidito, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 332, 339 (1985). The instructions here were not satisfactory in this regard. The judge advised the jury that the \u201cdefense\u201d in the case had been \u201cnarrowed to . . . self-defense[,]\u201d and that as a \u201cprecondition to assert [ing] the defense of self-defensef,]\u201d the defendant had to show that he had been assaulted. The judge addressed the issue at several points in the instructions in terms of \u201ca right to use self-defense\u201d on the defendant\u2019s part, and \u201cthe defense of self-defense [was] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>available to this defendant.\u201d There were added references to the \u201cclaim\u201d of self-defense. In focusing the jury\u2019s attention on the discrete elements of self-defense, the judge used considerable \u201cfinding\u201d language. For example, the jury were told that it was necessary for them to find whether the victim had been the original assailant, whether the defendant had the right to use a weapon, and whether the defendant\u2019s use of the weapon was unreasonable. The jury were advised that these findings established \u201ctests and limitations for the exercise of the right of self-defense[.]\u201d The problem arose again when, after deliberating for several hours, the jury asked the judge to instruct them further on \u201cthe criteria for self-defense[.]\u201d With minor modifications, the judge repeated his previous instructions to the jury on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The governing test requires that the instructions be examined in their entirety to determine their probable impact on the jury\u2019s perception of the fact-finding function. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>391 Mass. 853, 858 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>384 Mass. 396, 399-400 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>383 Mass. 40, 44 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stokes, </em>374 Mass. 583, 590-591 (1978). It is true that, prior to discussing self-defense in his main instructions and in the supplemental instructions, the judge told the jury that the Commonwealth had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had not acted in self-defense. However, there was no further mention of the burden of proof after the initial explanations; rather, there followed lengthy expositions of the law of self-defense which conveyed the impression \u201cthat it was the defendant who was required to wield the laboring oar\u201d on the issue. <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>377 Mass. 527, 534 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The instructions also tended to confuse the allocation of the appropriate burden of persuasion. The language framing self-defense in terms of a \u201cclaim,\u201d \u201cright,\u201d or \u201cdefense,\u201d which necessitated \u201cfindings\u201d as to the reasonableness in several particular respects of the defendant\u2019s behavior, suggested to the jury a need to conclude that the defendant\u2019s conduct was proper before they could return a not guilty ver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>diet. However, \u201c[i]t is enough for acquittal that there be a reasonable doubt whether the defendant acted in proper self-defense.\u201d <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 534. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richards, supra </em>at 405. Therefore, despite introduction of the instructions by a correct statement of the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof, the explanation given of self-defense blurred the subject and disconnected several important factors involved in the consideration of the issue from the applicable burdens of proof and persuasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">In considering whether a new trial is appropriate, we have also taken into account the standard of appellate review. When the main instructions on self-defense were completed, and again after the delivery of the supplemental instructions, the defendant\u2019s counsel objected with reasonable specificity to the infirmities he then detected in the instructions. Defense counsel told the judge that he thought the language used, particularly the finding language, might produce \u201cconfusion in the jurors\u2019 minds [,]\u201d and that the \u201cjurors may think [that] to acquit my client they have to . . . find and conclude [the facts]\u201d described in the instructions. Defense counsel further pointed out that the defendant did not \u201chave to prove anything [,]\u201d and \u201c[i]f [the jurors] have any reasonable doubt as to any of [the facts] they have to acquit my client.\u201d Defense counsel suggested that the problems might be cured if the judge reinstructed the jury on the Commonwealth\u2019s burdens of proof and persuasion immediately before their deliberations and redeliberations. The judge declined the requested relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Defense counsel carefully complied with the third sentence of section (b) of Mass. R. Crim. P. 24, 378 Mass. 895 (1979), which states that \u201c[n]o party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless he objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, specifying the matter to which he objects and the grounds of his objection.\u201d The objections in this case indicate that defense counsel felt that the jury had not received competent guidance on the legal principles governing the issue of self-de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>fense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The standard of review, therefore, is one of prejudicial error rather than the more difficult standard (from a defendant\u2019s point of view) of whether the criticized passages of the instructions created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Self-defense is a sensitive part of the jury instructions in a criminal trial, and inappropriate language in the instructions can readily lead to a result in which an appellate court lacks confidence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 547, 551 (1984). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Deagle, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 748, 751 (1980). Based on the governing standard of review, the closeness of the evidence on self-defense, and the deficiencies described above, we conclude that the charge, considered as a composite, could have misled the jury with respect to the burden of proof on self-defense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant is entitled to a new trial on the manslaughter charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The judgment on indictment no. 9376 (manslaughter) is reversed, and the verdict set aside.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b507-16\">The Appeals Court decided the appeal in an unpublished memorandum and order according to Appeals Court Rule 1:28 procedure. See 27 Mass. App. Ct. 1422 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b511-8\">Defense counsel also filed written requests for jury instructions on the law of self-defense, see Mass. R. Crim. P. 24 (b), 378 Mass. 842-843 (1979), which were substantially correct, and which avoided the problems that occurred in the instructions given.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b511-9\">The principles stated in <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>471 U.S. 807 (1985), see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Repoza, </em>400 Mass. 516, 520 (1987), also may apply to the instructions. In view of our analysis, we do not have to reach the issues presented by the <em>Francis </em>case. We also need not consider the claimed infirmities in the judge\u2019s instructions on the presumption of innocence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b511-10\">Although the Appeals Court affirmed judgments on two indictments \u2014 no. 9376 (manslaughter) and no. 9377 (unlawfully carrying a firearm) \u2014 and defendant\u2019s request for further appellate review was granted with reference to both, defendant\u2019s argument and request for relief in his brief submitted to this court refer only to the first indictment. Consequently, we review only the judgment on indictment no. 9376 (manslaughter). The judgment on indictment no. 9377 (unlawfully carrying a firearm) is left to stand.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
