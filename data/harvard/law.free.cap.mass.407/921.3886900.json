R. Civ. P. 25 (a) (1), 365 Mass. 771 (1974), requires the conclusion that their failure to substitute the defendant\u2019s executrix within one year of the approval of her bond falls within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>the excusable neglect provision of Mass. R. Civ. P. 25 (a) (l).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We agree. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">On April 24, 1987, less than four months after the plaintiffs\u2019 amended their complaint to add the defendant as a party, he died. On May 15, 1987, counsel for the defendant filed a suggestion of death, which was served on all parties in the case. The suggestion of death did not identify anyone as Ronan\u2019s actual or prospective representative. On June 22, 1987, the Probate Court appointed Faith E. Ronan to be the defendant\u2019s executrix and approved her bond. Faith Ronan did not, as executrix, appear in the action, notify the parties of the defendant\u2019s death, or file a suggestion of death on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">In August, 1988, counsel for the defendant moved to dismiss for failure timely to substitute proper parties under rule 25 (a) (1). The plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss and a motion to substitute the defendant\u2019s executrix as a defendant. The judge in the Superior Court allowed the motion to dismiss, finding that the plaintiffs were \u201cfully aware\u201d of the defendant\u2019s death. He ruled that their knowledge precluded him from finding that their failure to substitute the defendant\u2019s executrix was excusable neglect under rule 25 (a) (1). The plaintiffs then filed motions to reconsider the allowance of the motion to dismiss and the denial of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>motion to substitute. These motions were denied. The plaintiffs unsuccessfully petitioned a single justice of the Appeals Court for relief from the allowance of the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">Having failed in their efforts to substitute the defendant\u2019s executrix, the plaintiffs then moved for leave to file an amended complaint naming the defendant\u2019s executrix as a defendant. The trial judge denied this motion, ruling that amendment in these circumstances would \u201ceffectively nullify rule 25 . . . .\u201d The plaintiffs again sought relief from a single justice of the Appeals Court. After a single justice denied relief, the plaintiffs moved for the entry of a separate and final judgment under Mass. R. Civ. P. 54 (b), 365 Mass. 824 (1974), in the defendant\u2019s favor. This motion was granted, and the plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">The plaintiffs argue that rule 25 (a) (1) requires a finding of excusable neglect in this case because the defendant\u2019s representative did not undertake to notify them of the defendant\u2019s death and did not herself file a suggestion of death. They contend that the suggestion of death filed by the defendant\u2019s attorneys was deficient because only the defendant\u2019s <em>representative </em>was authorized to file a suggestion under the rule,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and because the suggestion filed by the defendant\u2019s attorney failed to identify the defendant\u2019s representative. Relying on <em>Rende </em>v. <em>Kay, </em>415 F.2d 983 (D.C. Cir. 1969), and its progeny,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> decided under Fed. R. Civ. P. 25 (a) (1), the plaintiffs argue that, unless the notice and suggestion of death are made by the deceased\u2019s representative (i.e., the executor or administrator),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the time limits for filing a motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>to substitute are tolled. The plaintiffs argue that the <em>Rende </em>court\u2019s reasoning, that \u201c[n]o injustice results from the requirement that a suggestion of death identify the representative or successor of an estate who may be substituted as a party for the deceased before Rule 25 (a) (1) may be invoked by those who represent or inherit from the deceased,\u201d is required by our rule. <em>Id. </em>at 986. The plaintiffs also point out that some State courts have adopted the rule in <em>Rende. </em>See <em>Varela </em>v. <em>Roman, </em>156 Ariz. 476, 478 (Ariz. App. 1988) (\u201cthe rule plainly contemplates that the suggestion of death be filed by a party or the representative of the deceased party\u201d); <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>538 A.2d 1096, 1100 (Del. 1988) (\u201cWe find the reasoning of <em>Rende . . . </em>not only persuasive but compelling\u201d); <em>Barto </em>v. <em>Weishaar, </em>101 Nev. 27 (1985); <em>Wick </em>v. <em>Waterman, </em>143 Wis. 2d 676 (Ct. App. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">Counsel for the defendant argues that the differences between our rule and the Federal rule compel a result in favor of the defendant. Unlike the Federal rule, which provides for dismissal of an action as to the deceased party \u201c[ujnless the motion for substitution is made not later than 90 days after the death is suggested upon the record,\u201d Mass. R. Civ. P. 25 (a) (1) provides for dismissal only after the more indulgent interval of \u201cone year after the date of approval of the bond of the representative.\u201d Counsel for the defendant contends that the <em>Rende </em>decision resulted from a concern that it would be unfair to compel surviving parties to assume the \u201cburden of locating the representative of the estate within 90 days.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 986. The defendant\u2019s counsel argues that the far longer time span contemplated by our rule renders the <em>Rende </em>court\u2019s solicitude for surviving parties unnecessary, because surviving parties informed of a death (as were the plaintiffs here) have one full year to discover the identity of the dece<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>dent\u2019s representative. Finally, the defendant\u2019s counsel directs our attention to several State courts that have rejected the rule in <em>Rende. </em>See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Wheeler, </em>437 So. 2d 521 (Ala. 1983) (unlike Federal rule, corresponding Alabama rule does not require that suggestion of death be filed by representative); <em>Farmers Ins. Group </em>v. <em>District Court of the Second Judicial Dist., </em>181 Colo. 85, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Lambert </em>v. <em>Supreme Court of Colo., </em>414 U.S. 878 (1973). <em>Mullis </em>v. <em>Bone, </em>143 Ga. App. 407 (1977); <em>LesCarbeau </em>v. <em>Rodrigues, </em>109 R.I. 407, 410 (1972) (decided under Rhode Island rule imposing no time limitation on when motion to substitute must be made). Cf. <em>King </em>v. <em>Tyree\u2019s of Tampa, Inc., </em>315 So. 2d 538 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1975). In essence, the defendant\u2019s counsel urges us to adopt the view that \u201ca plaintiff's attorney who receives notification of the defendant\u2019s death has the responsibility to promptly initiate the necessary inquiries to determine the identity of a person to be substituted for the deceased defendant.\u201d <em>Farmers Ins. Group, supra </em>at 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">Although we agree with the defendant\u2019s attorney that generally the burden is on counsel \u201cto attend to the progress of pending matters,\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Quinn, </em>406 Mass. 641, 644 (1990), the plain language of our rule requires a conclusion that the burden is on the representative of the deceased party. The last sentence of rule 25 (a) (1) (not found in its Federal counterpart) reads as follows: \u201cIf the court finds that the representative of the deceased party has failed within a reasonable period of time after the date of the approval of his bond to notify in writing the surviving party of the decedent\u2019s death and to file a suggestion of death upon the record it <em>shall find excusable neglect </em>for purposes of this rule and Rule 6 (b)\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (emphasis supplied). The Reporters\u2019 Notes to Mass. R. Civ. P. 25 (Mass. Ann. Laws, Rules of Civil Procedure 653 [Law. Co-op. 1982]) reinforce the mandatory na<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>ture of this procedural requirement: \u201cFailure on the part of the decedent\u2019s representative to notify the surviving party within a reasonable time from the approval of the bond and to file a suggestion of death upon the' record <em>requires a finding of excusable </em>neglect\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">The plaintiffs, therefore, are correct in arguing that the plain language of our rule imposes an even higher burden on the representative of a deceased litigant than does the Federal rule. Indeed, the rule appears to <em>follow </em>the holding in <em>Rende </em>in some respects<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (although it provides an even longer time in which surviving parties may move to substitute). Were there any ambiguity, we would be inclined to accept the argument of the defendant\u2019s counsel, but there is none. We do not depart from the plain, unambiguous, and mandatory language of any rule in the service of a vague notion of the spirit and purpose of the rule. See <em>Mellinger </em>v. <em>West Springfield, </em>401 Mass. 188, 192-193 (1987) (following plain language of Mass. R. Civ. P. 15, 365 Mass. 824 [1974]). Under our rule, \u201c[t]he burden [on the decedent\u2019s representative] of providing formal notice is slight.\u201d <em>National Equip. Rental, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Whitecraft Unlimited, Inc., </em>75 F.R.D. 507, 510 (E.D.N.Y. 1977). The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b936-7\">Rule 25 (a) (1) of the Massachusetts Rules of Civil Procedure provides: \u201cIf a party dies and the claim is not thereby extinguished, the court may order substitution of the proper parties.

Unless the motion for substitution is made within one year after the date of approval of the bond of the representative of the deceased party, the action shall, upon notice and hearing, be dismissed unless the failure of the surviving party to move for substitution was the result of excusable neglect. If the court finds that the representative of the deceased party has failed within a reasonable period of time after the date of the approval of his bond to notify in writing the surviving party of the decedent\u2019s death and to file a suggestion of death upon the record it shall find excusable neglect for purposes of this rule and Rule 6(b).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b937-7\">The provision of rule 25 (a) (1) relating to a suggestion of death filed by a party is not at issue in the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b937-8\">See, e.g., <em>Boggs </em>v. <em>Dravo Corp., </em>532 F.2d 897 (3d Cir. 1976); <em>Blair </em>v. <em>Beech Aircraft Corp., </em>104 F.R.D. 21 (W.D.
