(\u201cCommco\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s January 2, 2002 judgment affirming the February 2, 2001 judgment of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Connecticut (Alan H.W. Shift, <em>Chief </em>Judge) denying Commco\u2019s motion for an injunction against Science Applications International Corp. (\u201cSAIC\u201d) and U.S. Bank. This case is a product of Commco\u2019s claim that SAIC fraudulently attempted to draw, and later fraudulently drew on a letter of credit issued by U.S. Bank at Commco\u2019s request, for the benefit of SAIC. Initially Commco sought injunctive relief to prevent SAIC from drawing on the letter of credit. However, during the course of this case, following denial of an injunction and denial of a stay, SAIC drew on the letter of credit. Thus, Commco now seeks to compel: (1) SAIC to repay U.S. Bank; and (2) U.S. Bank to return the collateral it held as security for the letter of credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-15\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b914-16\">In the bankruptcy court, Commco primarily sought a preliminary and permanent injunction prohibiting SAIC from drawing and U.S. Bank from paying on the letter of credit. The bankruptcy court denied Commco\u2019s motion, finding that Commco failed to establish either that it would be irreparably harmed if SAIC drew on the letter of credit, or that it was likely to succeed on the merits of its claim against SAIC (by proving that SAIC\u2019s draw on the letter of credit was fraudulent).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-17\">After the bankruptcy court denied Commco\u2019s motion, Commco sought a stay of that order and the extension of a temporary restraining order, then in effect, that prevented SAIC from drawing on the letter of credit. The bankruptcy court denied those motions. Commco then filed an appeal in the district court challenging the bankruptcy court\u2019s denial of Commco\u2019s motion for a preliminary and permanent in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>junction. Along with this appeal, Commco also filed a motion seeking a stay of the bankruptcy court\u2019s order pending appeal. The district court denied Commco\u2019s motion for a stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Shortly after the district court denied Commco\u2019s motion for a stay pending appeal, SAIC drew on the letter of credit. Therefore, before the district court had an opportunity to decide the merits of Commco\u2019s appeal, the only issue the bankruptcy court had ruled upon explicitly-whether Commco was entitled to an injunction prohibiting SAIC from drawing on the letter of credit-was moot. However, rather than returning to the bankruptcy court to seek alternate relief, Commco sought alternate relief directly in the district court. In its appeal to the district court, Commco sought an order directing SAIC to return to U.S. Bank all funds received as a result of the draw on the letter of credit, and directing U.S. Bank \u201cto restore funds to [Commco\u2019s] operating and collateral accounts from which they have now been withdrawn.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s conclusion that Commco was not entitled to injunctive relief because Commco failed to establish that it was likely to succeed on the merits of its fraud claim. The district court did not address the irreparable harm issue, or discuss the fact that the relief Commco sought in the district court was different than the relief that the parties focused on in the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">Commco now appeals from the judgment of the district court, and asks this Court to \u201cvacate the District Court judgment and remand this matter to the District Court with instructions to remand the case to the Bankruptcy Court for the entry of an order directing SAIC to return all funds drawn from the Letter of Credit to U.S. Bank, and directing U.S. Bank to restore all funds withdrawn due to SAIC\u2019s draw on the Letter of Credit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">In their briefs and at oral argument, the parties have focused primarily on the question of whether SAIC\u2019s draw on the letter of credit was materially fraudulent within the meaning of letter of credit law (in this case, the Minnesota version of U.C.C. \u00a7 5-109, Minn.Stat. \u00a7 336.5-109). We note that even if Commco could establish that SAIC\u2019s draw on the letter of credit was materially fraudulent, there are a number of other legal and factual issues that we would have to resolve in Commco\u2019s favor before we could conclude that Commco was entitled to the relief it now seeks.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, the parties agree that Commco cannot prevail if SAIC\u2019s draw on the letter of credit was not materially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>fraudulent within the meaning of section 5-109.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Because this is an appeal of the district court\u2019s review of a bankruptcy court decision, the \u201cdistrict court\u2019s order ... is subject to plenary review, meaning that this Court undertakes an independent examination of the factual findings and legal conclusions of the bankruptcy court. The Bankruptcy Court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error and its conclusions of law are reviewed de novo.\u201d <em>In re Duplan Corp., 212 </em>F.3d 144, 151 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">After conducting an independent examination of the factual findings and legal conclusions of the bankruptcy court, we conclude, for substantially the same reasons as those given by the district court in its December 18, 2001 order, that Commco has failed to establish that SAIC\u2019s draw on the letter of credit was materially fraudulent within the meaning of section 5-109. Even if it is true, as Commco argues, that the Settlement Agreement cannot be read in light of the Letter of Credit because the latter is \u201ccompletely independent\u201d of the former, <em>New York Life Ins. Co. v. Hartford Nat\u2019l Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>173 Conn. 492, 378 A.2d 562, 566 (Conn.1977), we conclude that even the Settlement Agreement and the Promissory Note when read together are ambiguous, permitting the bankruptcy court\u2019s resort to extrinsic evidence. Therefore, the district court correctly affirmed the judgement of the bankruptcy court.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b916-7\">For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b915-6\">. Although Commco\u2019s arguments in the bankruptcy court focused on its request for an injunction preventing SAIC from drawing on the letter of credit, the complaint also requested the relief Commco sought in the district court-an order that essentially unwinds the transaction. Because the appellants have not argued that Commco forfeited its right to seek an order unwinding the transaction by failing to pursue it more fully in the bankruptcy court (and failing to return to the bankruptcy court to seek this alternate relief after SAIC drew on the letter of credit), we express no view on that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b915-12\">. For example, Commco has cited no authority to support its view that under U.C.C. \u00a7 5-109 a party that was entitled to (but did not receive) an injunction prohibiting a draw on a letter of credit would also be entitled to an injunction unwinding such a transaction after it has occurred. Furthermore, Commco has failed to present any evidence on the issue of the irreparable harm it might face if it is not granted an order, issued more than a year after SAIC drew down the letter of credit, requiring SAIC to return the money. Instead, Commco\u2019s arguments to this Court on the irreparable harm issue have focused entirely on the evidence of irreparable harm that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>Commco claimed it would suffer if SAIC were allowed to draw on the letter of credit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
