The IJ had denied Liang\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of deportation. Liang also seeks review of a BIA order denying his motion to reconsider the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>Liang, a citizen of China, entered the United States in August 1992 without authorization and was intercepted by the INS and placed in exclusion proceedings. Liang conceded excludability but filed for asylum and withholding of deportation under \u00a7\u00a7 208 and 243(h) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158, 1253(h). In his asylum application, Liang claimed that he was eligible because of his active opposition to government mandated birth-control policies. Liang claimed that in 1989 he was transferred to a Birth Control Work Team, against his wishes, after exposing the manager at his previous place of employment as corrupt. Liang further claimed that in August 1989 he released a pregnant woman whom he was transporting for a forced abortion. Fearing retaliation, he left his home and eventually left China, with the hope of coming to America.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">Liang was the only witness at his hearing before the IJ, where he testified generally in support of his asylum application. At the conclusion of the hearing, the IJ denied Liang\u2019s application and ordered Liang deported. The IJ found that Liang\u2019s testimony \u201chas not been particularly plausible or consistent as to lead me to believe that his activities were in fact such as he had indicated.\u201d The IJ discussed what it perceived as several inconsistencies and implausibilities in Liang\u2019s testimony. For example, although in his written asylum application Liang had stated that he \u201clet go\u201d the pregnant woman whom he was transporting, at the hearing Liang testified that he brought her to another village after the car he was driving broke down en route to the hospital. Moreover, although in his written application Liang stated that \u201cshe and her husband had resisted\u201d when members of the birth-control team arrived to take her away, at the hearing Liang testified that the woman\u2019s husband was not at home.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">Liang appealed to the BIA, which dismissed the appeal in February 2000. The BIA agreed with the IJ\u2019s conclusions that Liang\u2019s \u201ctestimony and evidence lacks credibility\u201d and that \u201che has failed to sustain his burden of proof in these proceedings.\u201d Liang moved for reconsideration, which was denied in March 2002. On appeal, Liang argues that the IJ and the BIA erred in concluding that he had failed to satisfy his burden of proof and by failing explicitly to discuss the authenticity of documentation he submitted in support of his application.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">When considering a petition for review of a BIA decision, the scope of our inquiry is \u201cexceedingly narrow.\u201d <em>Melgar de Torres v. Reno, </em>191 F.3d 307, 313 (2d Cir.1999). We accept the BIA\u2019s factual determinations so long as they are supported by substantial evidence, giving particular deference to credibility determinations, <em>see Montero v. INS, </em>124 F.3d 381, 386 (2d Cir.1997), and reverse \u201conly if no reasonable fact-finder could have failed to find the past persecution or fear of future persecution necessary to sustain the petitioner\u2019s burden.\u201d <em>Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 287 (2d Cir.2000), <em>see also Alvarado-Carillo v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 44, 49 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">In this case, the discrepancies between Liang\u2019s written application and testimony before the IJ could reasonably have led a fact-finder to conclude that Liang did not testify credibly. Liang\u2019s case for asylum rests essentially on a single event: the alleged freeing of a woman he was transporting for forced abortion. But, as previously noted, the account he gave of this event in his written application differed substantially from his testimony before the IJ. Consequently, the finding of Liang\u2019s lack of credibility is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">Nor are we persuaded by Liang\u2019s contention that the IJ and the BIA erred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>by neglecting to consider the handwritten \u201cNotice of Discharge of Public Employment\u201d submitted with Liang\u2019s asylum application. In fact, a review of the transcript of the hearing indicates that the IJ did consider this document. More importantly, however, we have never required that the IJ, or the BIA, specifically rule on the credibility of each piece of documentary evidence submitted. Rather, the IJ is merely required to state the reasons for the ruling. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 236.3(d) (1993) (\u201cAn adverse decision [concerning an application for asylum or withholding of deportation] will state why asylum or withholding of deportation was denied.\u201d); <em>see also Morales v. INS, </em>208 F.3d 323, 328 (1st Cir.2000) (rejecting claim that IJ must discuss each piece of evidence). Accordingly, neither of Liang\u2019s claims has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">The petitions for review of the orders of the Board of Immigration Appeals are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b911-11\">. Liang\u2019s petition is governed by the transitional rules established by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009. <em>See Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 282 n. 1 (2d Cir.2000) (applying transitional rules when deportation proceedings began before April 1, 1997, and the order of deportation became final after October 30, 1996). Under the transitional rules, IIRIRA\u2019s appeal of INA \u00a7 106 is not effective and Liang may petition for review thereunder. <em>See </em>IIRI-RA \u00a7 309(c)(4)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
