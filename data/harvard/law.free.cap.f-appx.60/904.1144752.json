Noone Jr. (\u201cNoone\u201d). On the night of May 10, 1997, Noone\u2019s son, James F. Noone, III (Noone III\u201d), held a party at his father\u2019s residence. Sergeant Dean Spencer of the Ocean City Police Department showed up to investigate a stolen vehicle and a drunken driving incident. Spencer attempted to question Noone III, who allegedly refused to provide information, including his name, date of birth, and address. As a result, Spencer issued a summons charging Noone III with obstruction of justice, a disorderly persons offense. N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:29. The summons named \u201cJames Noone\u201d but did not include a date of birth or social security number.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-14\">Noone III did not respond to the summons. A municipal court issued a warrant for \u201cJames Noone\u201d on July 9, 1997, and forwarded it to the Police Department, where it was entered into a computer system. The computer identified plaintiff Noone, the father. Consequently, the warrant issued for Noone rather than Noone III. Patrol Officers Bruce Warren and Brian Trostle served the warrant on July 19, 1997. Noone explained that he was not in Ocean City on May 10, 1997, that he never received a copy of the summons and complaint, and that the warrant was a mistake.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Furthermore, because he was expecting 150 guests in the next half hour, he requested that the matter be resolved at a later date. Warren and Trostle refused Noone\u2019s request and arrested him under the warrant. Noone was detained in the Police Department for one hour before posting bail in the amount of $175.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-15\">The following year, on the night of July 25, 1998, Noone held his annual \u201cNight in Venice\u201d party where officers of the Community Policing Unit witnessed underage drinking and reported noise ordinance violations. In response, Defendants Robert Scott Adams, Johnathan Wereley, Ryan Wokock, David Rowland,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Daniel LaRocca, Rick Costigan, Robert Koob,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Tom Finnegan, and Dennis Jones (collectively, \u201cIndividual Defendants\u201d) reported to Noone\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>residence. Based on their own observations, Individual Defendants entered Noone\u2019s property, including his patio and house, where they remained for 15-80 minutes. The officers had neither a warrant nor Noone\u2019s permission to gain entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">Despite seeing what they believed to be underage drinking, Individual Defendants issued no summons or citations while on Noone\u2019s property. But later on during the course of the evening, ten to fifteen people associated with Noone\u2019s party were arrested for underage drinking. Noone was neither arrested nor issued a summons or citation.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">On March 26, 1999, Noone filed a complaint against Ocean City and the Police Department (\u201cMunicipal Defendants\u201d) and against Sergeant Spencer and 100 \u201cJohn Doe\u201d police officers. Soon after, Noone filed an amended complaint, adding the remaining defendants.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that he was entitled to relief for violation of his Fourth Amendment rights under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Ocean City, the Police Department, Spencer, Trostle, and Warren filed a joint motion for summary judgment. The remaining defendants filed separate joint motions for summary judgment. The District Court Judge granted summary judgment to all defendants. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-8\">Our review of the entry of summary judgment is plenary. <em>See, e.g., Beers-Capitol v. Whetzel, </em>256 F.3d 120, 130 n. 6 (3d Cir.2001). We apply the same test the District Court should have used initially. <em>Omnipoint Communications Enter., L.P. v. Newtown Township, </em>219 F.3d 240, 242 (3d Cir.2000). Summary judgment is appropriate if there is no issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-14\">III. 1997 Incident</p>\n<p id=\"b939-15\">Under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must prove a person acting under color of state law deprived him of a federal right. <em>See Berg v. County of Allegheny, </em>219 F.3d 261, 268 (3d Cir.2000). Government officials performing discretionary functions are generally not hable for civil damages under \u00a7 1983 by reason of granted qualified immunity. <em>Wilson v. Layne, </em>526 U.S. 603, 609, 119 S. Ct. 1692, 143 L.Ed.2d 818 (1999). In determining qualified immunity, a court must first ask whether \u201cthe facts alleged, viewed in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, show that the officer\u2019s conduct violated a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Curley v. Klem, </em>298 F.3d 271, 277 (3d Cir.2002). If answered affirmatively, the question becomes whether it \u201cwould be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Layne, </em>526 U.S. 603, 119 S.Ct. 1692, 143 L.Ed.2d 818).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-17\">As noted, Noone alleges his arrest violated the Fourth Amendment. An arrest violates the Fourth Amendment if executed pursuant to an erroneously issued warrant. <em>Berg, </em>219 F.3d at 269-71 (citing <em>Whiteley v. Warden, </em>401 U.S. 560, 91 S.Ct. 1031, 28 L.Ed.2d 306 (1971)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Here, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>warrant for Noone was generated after a computer retrieved the wrong \u201cJames Noone\u201d out of the Police Department record system. Noone\u2019s arrest violated his Fourth Amendment rights because it was executed pursuant to an erroneously issued warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">A. Defendants Warren, Trostle, and Spencer</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">The District Court granted Warren and Trostle qualified immunity, holding that a reasonable police officer, under these circumstances, would believe there was probable cause for Noone\u2019s arrest. Where an officer executes an arrest based on an objectively reasonable belief that there is a valid warrant, he may be entitled to qualified immunity. <em>Berg, </em>219 F.3d at 272. It is usually reasonable for an officer to believe a warrant was issued for probable cause. <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, an arresting officer is not required to make an independent investigation for every suspect who claims innocence, provided the officer\u2019s reliance on an arrest warrant is reasonable in light of the relevant circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 272-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">Noone was arrested based on a warrant containing his name and date of birth. Although Noone proclaimed his innocence, it was not unreasonable for Warren and Trostle to conclude that Noone was the proper individual sought. Furthermore, because the warrant was issued for failure to appear in court, it was not unreasonable for the officers to refuse Noone\u2019s request to resolve the matter at a later date. For these reasons, we will affirm the grant of summary judgment with respect to Warren and Trostle.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-10\">With respect to defendant Spencer, Noone contends there was a genuine issue of material fact whether Spencer was liable under \u00a7 1983 on the basis of deliberate indifference. In <em>Berg, </em>we left open the question whether liability under these circumstances should be analyzed as a Fourth Amendment violation or as due process \u201cdeliberate indifference.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 219 F.3d at 274. We need not resolve that here because under either theory, Spencer is entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-12\">As for a possible Fourth Amendment violation, the District Court held: \u201c[Tjhere is no evidence before the Court that Spencer intentionally caused the arrest of plaintiff. Indeed, the warrant for plaintiffs arrest was issued by the municipal court for failure to appear before the municipal court judge. There is no evidence which implicates Spencer in this decision.\u201d We agree.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There can be no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>\u00a7 1983 liability here under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">Under a due process theory, the District Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-6\">There were no reasonably available measures to reduce or eliminate a serious risk which Spencer could have taken in this case. Indeed, the entire incident could have been avoided in its entirety i[f] plaintiff\u2019s son [had] provided a modicum of cooperation with Spencer during the stolen car investigation. Spencer did not arrest plaintiff; and there is no evidence of deliberate indifference on the part of Spencer. Accordingly, there can be no liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">Knowing of two people by the name \u201cJames Noone\u201d on the date the summons issued and aware of potential confusion, Spencer \u201cattempted to contact the court on at least two prior occasions to let them know there was confusion between a James Noone, the father, and James Noone, the son.\u201d The reason the summons lacked a date of birth, social security number, and proper address was \u201cbecause Mr. Noone didn\u2019t give it to me [Spencer] and that\u2019s why he was charged with obstructing justice.\u201d Spencer also testified that the reason he did not have the information was \u201cbecause he [Noone III] was totally uncooperative at that time. There was nothing to indicate to me [Spencer] that he would be more cooperative at another time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b941-8\">In hindsight, it is possible that Spencer could have done more at a later time to try to ascertain the correct date of birth, social security number, and address. But the failure to do so would merely amount to negligence, not deliberate indifference. Therefore, under either a Fourth Amendment or due process claim, Spencer was entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-11\">B. Municipal Defendants</p>\n<p id=\"b941-12\">A municipal unit may be sued for damages under \u00a7 1983 for its employee\u2019s unconstitutional action if the \u201caction that is alleged to be unconstitutional implements or executes a policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated by that body\u2019s officers.\u201d <em>Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Serv., </em>436 U.S. 658, 690, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). There can be liability only if: (1) plaintiffs rights were violated by a policy or custom of the municipality, and (2) the municipality\u2019s deliberate indifference was the moving force behind plaintiffs alleged injury. <em>See Berg, </em>219 F.3d at 275-76. Failure to properly train an employee will be considered deliberate indifference only where that failure causes a pattern of violations. <em>Id. </em>at 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-13\">In <em>Berg, </em>we reversed a grant of summary judgement in favor of a municipality so that the factfinder could address whether the municipality acted with deliberate indifference. <em>Id. </em>at 277. Specifically, we found the record lacked evidence of procedures guarding against mistakenly issued warrants where the municipality \u201cemployed a design where the slip of a finger <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>could result in wrongful arrest and imprisonment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 267, 277. We concluded that the municipality failed to provide protective measures and failsafes against erroneously issued warrants and said, \u2018When such a simple mistake can so obviously lead to a constitutional violation, we cannot hold that the municipality was not deliberately indifferent to the risk as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">Unlike <em>Berg, </em>Municipal Defendants here did not employ a design where \u201cthe slip of the finger could result in wrongful arrest and imprisonment.\u201d No reasonable safeguards have been identified that Municipal Defendants could have instituted to protect against the type of error that occurred here. The form of summons provided for a defendant\u2019s name, address, social security number, and date of birth. This was not a situation \u201cwhere such a simple mistake [could] so easily lead to a constitutional violation.\u201d Thus, we find no basis upon which to hold Municipal Defendants liable. We will affirm the grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">IV. 1998 Incident</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">Noone challenges the District Court\u2019s finding of qualified immunity with respect to Individual Defendants and lack of liability with respect to Municipal Defendants for their roles in the 1998 Incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">A. Individual Defendants</p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">The District Court found Individual Defendants entitled to qualified immunity without identifying whether a constitutional violation occurred. But qualified immunity analysis begins with determining whether there was a constitutional violation. <em>Curley, </em>298 F.3d at 277 (citing <em>Layne, </em>526 U.S. 603, 119 S.Ct. 1692, 143 L.Ed.2d 818). Our independent review of the record reveals no violation. Therefore, we do not reach qualified immunity and will affirm the grant of summary judgment on Noone\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims with respect to Individual Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-10\">Under the Fourth Amendment, a warrantless entry into a private home is \u201cpresumptively unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Rohrig, </em>98 F.3d 1506, 1514 (6th Cir.1996) (citing <em>Payton v. New York, </em>445 U.S. 573, 586, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 63 L.Ed.2d 639 (1980)). \u201cExigent circumstances,\u201d however, may justify a warrantless entry into a home if the governmental interest outweighs the private individual\u2019s interest in remaining free from governmental intrusions. <em>Rohrig, </em>98 F.3d at 1522. For example, in <em>Rohrig, </em>the Sixth Circuit found exigent circumstances justified police officers\u2019 warrantless entry into plaintiffs home in response to a noise ordinance complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 1523. The court said there was no Fourth Amendment violation because the governmental interest in immediately abating an ongoing nuisance by quelling loud and disruptive noise in a residential neighborhood justified the warrantless intrusion. <em>Id. </em>at 1522.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-11\">Like <em>Rohrig, </em>the record here shows exigent circumstances justified a warrantless entry into Noone\u2019s property during the 1998 Incident. Individual Defendants observed what they believed to be underage drinking and violation of a noise ordinance. The governmental interest in abating these illegal activities justified warrantless entry into Noone\u2019s property. Accordingly, summary judgment for Individual Defendants was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-12\">B. Municipal Defendants</p>\n<p id=\"b942-13\">A municipality may be liable for the unconstitutional actions of its officials only where a plaintiffs rights were violated by a policy or custom of the municipality. <em>Monell, </em>436 U.S. at 690-91, 98 S.Ct. 2018. We recently articulated guiding principles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>for deciding whether an official\u2019s act permits an inference of government policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AP8\">First, ... municipalities may be held liable under \u00a7 1983 only for acts for which the municipality itself is actually responsible, \u201cthat is, acts which the municipality has officially sanctioned or ordered.\u201d Second, only those municipal officials who have \u201cfinal policymaking authority\u201d may by their actions subject the government to \u00a7 1983 liability. Third, whether a particular official has \u201cfinal policymaking authority\u201d is a question of state law. Fourth, the challenged action must have been taken pursuant to a policy adopted by the official or officials responsible under state law for making policy in that area of the city\u2019s business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b943-5\"><em>Nawrocki v. Township of Coolbaugh, </em>34 Fed.Appx. 832, 837 (3d Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati </em>475 U.S. 469, 480, 106 S.Ct. 1292, 89 L.Ed.2d 452 (1986)) (other citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">In <em>Nawrocki </em>a plaintiff appealed a grant of summary judgment in favor of a township on \u00a7 1983 claims for due process violations based on, <em>inter alia, </em>malicious prosecution. 34 Fed.Appx. at 834, 836. We affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 839. In that case, the plaintiff argued that an unconstitutional government policy could be inferred from a government official\u2019s isolated act. <em>Id. </em>at 836-37. We held that \u201c[although there may have been some inadequacies in the way in which municipal policies were followed ... an official\u2019s failure to adhere strictly to municipal policies does not itself support an inference of a policy that can subject the Township to liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 837. Thus, we held that the plaintiff failed to establish liability under \u00a7 1983. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">Here, Noone asserts that the police officers were police department policymakers whose actions constituted municipal policy, even though they occurred only once. Thus, Noone argues that Municipal Defendants are hable for the police officers\u2019 action. We disagree. As we stated in <em>Nawrocki </em>where an official fails to adhere strictly to municipal policies, we will not infer that a policy exists to subject the municipality to liability under \u00a7 1983. The police officers\u2019 actions in the 1998 Incident were part of an isolated incident that was neither officially sanctioned nor ordered by Municipal Defendants. Thus, we will affirm the grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-10\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b938-10\">. Although Noone asserted that Warren and Trostle had the wrong person, there was no reference to Noone's son during Noone's discussion with Warren and Trostle.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b938-16\">.

Consequently, Berg was mistakenly arrested for Banks\u2019s alleged misdeed. <em>Id. </em>at 267-68. As a result of his mistaken arrest, Berg brought suit, pursuant to \u00a7 1983, against the county and various state officials alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>violation of the Fourth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 268. The district court concluded there was no Fourth Amendment violation because the erroneously issued warrant supplied probable cause to arrest. <em>Id. </em>We disagreed and held that an improperly issued warrant cannot provide probable cause for an arrest. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b940-8\">.
