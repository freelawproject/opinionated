We affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the defendants for substantially the same reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s order and the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-15\">\n<em>I. BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b224-16\">Mr. Byrd was convicted of rape in Tulsa County District Court in 1995. Under a contract between the Oklahoma Department of Corrections and Cornell Corrections, Inc., Mr. Byrd is now incarcerated at the Great Plains Correctional Facility, a private prison operated by Cornell Corrections and located in Hinton, Oklahoma. In his pro se complaint, Mr. Byrd alleged that he was: (1) incorrectly placed in medium security status and, (2) placed in punitive segregation for no apparent reason and thus received excessive punishment for a disciplinary violation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He named as defendants the Great Plains Correctional Facility, Cornell Corrections, Inc., and the City of Hinton, Oklahoma, where the facility is located.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-17\">Adopting the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge, the district court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The court reasoned that prison officials had broad discretion to place inmates in the appropriate security classification and that, as to his claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>regarding his placement in disciplinary segregation, Mr. Byrd did not have a constitutionally protected liberty interest in remaining in the general prison population. As to the City of Hinton, the court observed that Mr. Byrd had failed to offer any evidence of a causal connection between a municipal policy and the alleged constitutional deprivations. Moreover, the court noted, the city does not own or operate the Great Plains Correctional Facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">\n<em>II. DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard as did the district court. <em>Amro v. Boeing Co., 232 F.3d 790, 796 </em>(10th Cir.2000). Summary judgment is appropriate if \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). We view the evidence and draw any inferences in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment, but that party must identify sufficient evidence that would require submission of the case to the jury. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 251-52, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). Although courts must construe pro se pleadings liberally, pro se plaintiffs may not rely on conclusory allegations to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. <em>Hall v. Bellmon, </em>935 F.2d 1106, 1110 (10th Cir.1991). Applying these standards, we conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgment to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">As to Mr. Byrd\u2019s challenge to his security classification, we note that \u201c[cjhanging an inmate\u2019s prison classification ordinarily does not deprive him of liberty, because he is not entitled to a particular degree of liberty in prison.\u201d <em>Templeman v. Gunter, </em>16 F.3d 367, 369 (10th Cir.1994) (citing <em>Meachum v. Fano, </em>427 U.S. 215, 225, 96 S.Ct. 2532, 49 L.Ed.2d 451 (1976)). Moreover, the Supreme Court has held that \u201cregulations promulgated by prison officials should be upheld by courts unless the regulations are shown to be unreasonable or an exaggerated response to administrative and security concerns.\u201d <em>Beerheide v. Suthers, </em>286 F.3d 1179, 1184 (10th Cir.2002). Here, the defendant prison officials have explained the basis for Mr. Byrd\u2019s classification. Rec. doc. 12, Affidavit and Ex. 4. (Special Report, filed June 10, 2002) (explaining Department of Corrections\u2019 guidelines for determining security status, which consider the severity of the offense of conviction and the inmate\u2019s prior criminal record). Thus, Mr. Byrd\u2019s constitutional challenge to his security classification lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">As to his placement in disciplinary segregation, the district court properly noted that an inmate generally does not have a constitutionally protected liberty interest in remaining free from placement in disciplinary segregation unless that placement constituted an \u201catypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\u201d <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995). Applying that standard, the Supreme Court has held that a placement in disciplinary segregation for thirty days did not impose an atypical and significant hardship. <em>Id. </em>at 486. Here, Mr. Byrd pleaded guilty to committing battery while in prison and received thirty days\u2019 confinement in disciplinary segregation and a $50 fine. He has presented no evidence indicating that the conditions to which he was subjected during this thirty day period constituted an atypical and significant hardship,\u201d <em>id. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>484, in relation to ordinary prison life. <em>Cf. Penrod v. Zavaras, </em>94 F.3d 1399, 1407 (10th Cir.1996) (affirming the grant of summary judgment to defendant prison officials on claim arising out of inmate\u2019s placement in administrative segregation for ten-month period on the grounds that \u201c[t]he administrative segregation regime plaintiff was subjected to as a result of legitimate security concerns did not impose an atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison\u201d). In light of <em>Sandin, </em>these facts are insufficient to support Mr. Byrd\u2019s challenge to his placement in disciplinary segregation.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Finally, the district court properly granted summary judgment to the City of Hinton. There is no evidence that the city had any role in operating the Great Plains Correctional Facility and thus no causal link between the city and the alleged constitutional violations. <em>See Hollingsworth v. Hill, </em>110 F.3d 733, 742 (10th Cir.1997) (explaining the elements necessary to support a \u00a7 1983 action against a municipality).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">\n<em>III. CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the defendants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b224-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of res judicata, collateral estoppel, and law of the case. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b224-13\">. After examining the briefs and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2)(C). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b224-18\">. The magistrate judge observed that Mr. Byrd\u2019s complaint was \"brief and vaguely worded.\u201d Rec. doc. 18, at 1 (Report and Recommendation, filed Aug. 13, 2002). However, after considering Mr. Byrd\u2019s response to the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the magistrate judge construed the complaint to raise these two claims. On appeal, Mr. Byrd does not challenge this characterization of his claims, and we therefore read the complaint in the same maimer.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
