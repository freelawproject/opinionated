He had previously pleaded guilty to vehicular manslaughter, a conviction not relevant to this appeal. At the time of his 1995 plea, assault was classified as an aggravated felony but, because the sentence was less than five years, under the immigration laws as they then stood Marmolejo-Gutierrez was not subject to deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">In 1997, while serving his sentence, Marmolejo-Gutierrez was placed in deportation proceedings on account of his 1995 conviction. The immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) failed to inform him of his eligibility for discretionary relief from deportation under \u00a7 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Marmolejo-Gutierrez was deported. He returned to the United States, was arrested in 2001, and was indicted for illegal reentry in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. He moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that his prior deportation was unlawful in that the IJ faded to advise him of his eligibility for \u00a7 212(c) relief. The district court granted the motion and the government now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">In 1996, Congress adopted the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) which in \u00a7 440(d) identified the set of offenses for which convictions would preclude relief under \u00a7 212(c). <em>See </em>Pub. L. No. 104-132, \u00a7 440(d), 110 Stat. 1214, 1277 (1996) (amending 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c)). This enactment foreclosed \u00a7 212(c) relief prospectively for all persons convicted of aggravated felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">Also in 1996, Congress adopted the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d). That act contained two provisions relevant to this appeal. First, it repealed \u00a7 212(c) and replaced it with a procedure under which persons who had been convicted of an aggravated felony were ineligible for relief from removal (formerly deportation). <em>See </em>IIRIRA, Pub. L. No. 104-208 Division C, \u00a7 304(b), 110 Stat. 3009-546, 3009-597 (1996) (repealing \u00a7 212(c)); <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 340(a)(3), 110 Stat. 3009-594, <em>codified at </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(3) (2001) (prohibiting cancellation of removal for persons convicted of aggravated felonies). Second, it expanded the definition of \u201caggravated felony\u201d by reducing the prison sentence required to trigger aggravated felony status from five years to one year. <em>See </em>IIRIRA \u00a7 321(a)(3), 110 Stat. 3009-627, <em>codified at </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) (2001). If applied to Marmolejo-Gutierrez\u2019s 1995 conviction, the act would make it a deportable offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-12\">In <em>INS v. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001), the Supreme Court held that \u201c \u00a7 212(c) relief remains available for aliens ... whose convictions were obtained through plea agreements and who, notwithstanding those convictions, would have been eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief at the time of their plea under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>law then in effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 326. Because St. Cyr pleaded guilty to a deportable offense at a time when \u00a7 212(c) was available, relief remained available to him notwithstanding the repeal of that section. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Marmolejo-Gutierrez\u2019s case differs from St. Cyr\u2019s. Although IIRIRA later converted his 1995 conviction into a deportable offense, at the time of his guilty plea, \u201cunder the law then in effect,\u201d MarmolejoGutierrez\u2019s offense was not deportable. Having pled to a nondeportable offense, he would not have been eligible for \u00a7 212 relief. The considerations underlying the <em>St. Cyr </em>decision are therefore not present. Marmolejo-Gutierrez cannot be said to have been \u201cacutely aware of the immigration consequences\u201d of his conviction and to have \u201crelied upon\u201d the likelihood of receiving \u00a7 212(c) relief. <em>Id. </em>at 322, 325. Thus, in his case, the statute did not \u201ctake[] away or impair! ] vested rights acquired under existing laws ... or attach! ] a new disability, in respect to transactions ... already past.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 321 (quoting <em>Landgraf v. USI Film Products, </em>511 U.S. 244, 269, 114 S.Ct. 1483, 128 L.Ed.2d 229 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Our analysis is informed by our recent decision in <em>United States v. Velasco-Medina, </em>305 F.3d 839 (9th Cir.2002), where we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-6\">Velaseo-Medina was never eligible for discretionary relief under \u00a7 212(c) because his guilty plea did not render him deportable; unlike St. Cyr, he never possessed \u201cvested rights acquired under existing laws.\u201d Thus, Velaseo-Medina could not have developed the sort of settled expectations concerning \u00a7 212(c) relief that informed St. Cyr\u2019s plea bargain and that animated the <em>St. Cyr </em>decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 849.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Similarly, because the assault was a nondeportable offense in 1995 when Marmolejo-Gutierrez pled guilty, he did not have a vested right to discretionary relief under \u00a7 212(c). We therefore conclude that the IJ did not err when he failed to inform Marmolejo-Gutierrez of \u00a7 212(c) relief and dismissal of the indictment was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b171-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b171-9\">. Section 212(c), codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c)(1985) stated: \"Aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation, and who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years, may be admitted in the discretion of the Attorney General ...\u201d Section 212(c) had been interpreted by the Board of Immigration Appeals to authorize any permanent resident alien to apply for discretionary waiver from deportation. In 1990, Congress amended \u00a7 212(c) to preclude discretionary relief for anyone convicted of an aggravated felony who had served a term of imprisonment of at least five years. Pub. L. No. 101-649, \u00a7 511, 104 Stat. 4978, 5052 (1990) (amending 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b172-7\">. Because Velaseo-Medina (unlike Marmolejo-Gutierrez) entered his plea after enactment of AEDPA (but before IIRIRA), and AEDPA foreclosed \u00a7 212(c) relief for persons convicted of aggravated felonies, the court noted that Velaseo-Medina would have realized that if his conviction were recharacterized as an aggravated felony (as it was under IIRIRA), he would have been ineligible for relief under AEDPA. <em>Id. </em>at 850. This additional ground for denying relief to Velaseo-Medina does not apply to Marmolejo-Gutierrez.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
