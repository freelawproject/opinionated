Because the parties are familiar with the facts, they are not recited herein. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-25\">In reviewing a motion to dismiss, we limit our inquiry to the complaint and appended affidavits. <em>See, e.g., Western Ctr. For Journalism, v. Cederquist, </em>235 F.3d 1153, 1154 n. 1 (9th Cir.2000). Prudential standing under NEPA requires that plaintiffs allege interests within NEPA\u2019s environmental \u201czone of interests,\u201d whereby purely economic interests are not sufficient to confer prudential standing. <em>See Nevada Land Action Ass\u2019n v. U.S. Forest Service, </em>8 F.3d 713, 716 (9th Cir.1993). Plaintiffs\u2019 concerns appear to be economic rather than environmental. TTAX has no standing because it is a taxpayer organization whose purported environmental interests are not germane to its members. <em>See Presidio Golf Club v. National Park Ser</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number><em>vice, </em>155 F.3d 1153, 1159 (9th Cir.1998). As to the other plaintiffs, although on appeal much is said about water contamination and other environmental harms, <em>none </em>of those plaintiffs asserted any such concerns in their affidavits. The complaint made allegations regarding noise, dust, vibrations and fumes, but plaintiffs\u2019 expressed concerns were that their \u201cbusinesses\u201d will be affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Appellants have argued that they are opposed to destruction of the historic building that houses the Men\u2019s Club, operated by one of the plaintiffs, the French Quarter. But the complaint did not mention historic value, and the only affidavit to talk about the building-Eugene Canepa\u2019smerely stated that the Men\u2019s Club operates out of a historic building. Canepa never asserted any concern about its historic value. To the contrary, he focused solely on the financial ruin that ReTRAC allegedly will cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">In sum, although we agree that noise, dust, vibrations and fumes might otherwise confer prudential standing, when we look at the complaint and affidavits in a light most favorable to plaintiffs, plaintiffs have not alleged concern about such harms from a non-business standpoint. This is in contrast to a ease where-despite economic interests-distinct environmental interests are sufficiently alleged to confer NEPA standing. Accordingly, no plaintiff has prudential standing. <em>See Nevada Land Action, </em>8 F.3d at 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">We also affirm the denial of a preliminary injunction. To be entitled to preliminary injunctive relief, plaintiffs must demonstrate either: (1) a combination of probable success on the merits combined with a possibility of irreparable injury, or (2) that serious questions are raised and the balance of hardships tips in plaintiffs\u2019 favor. <em>See Idaho Sporting Congress Inc. v. Alexander, </em>222 F.3d 562, 565 (9th Cir. 2000) (citation omitted). The district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that (a) success on the merits of their NEPA claims is unlikely and (b) the balance of hardships tips against plaintiffs due to ReTRAC\u2019s environmental/aesthetic goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">For the foregoing reasons we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b85-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts <em>o\u00ed </em>this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
