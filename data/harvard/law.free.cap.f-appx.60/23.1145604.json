The petitioners argue that the Commission failed to give them due process and failed properly to consider the public interest as required by the Federal Power Act. We reject the petitioners\u2019 contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">At the outset, we note that, though the issue is not free from doubt, the petitioners have shown sufficient \u201cactual or imminent\u201d injury caused by the Commission\u2019s action to possess standing under the Constitution\u2019s Article III. <em>See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 562, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). However, we reject the petitioners\u2019 arguments on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">Regardless of whether the Commission gave the petitioners adequate notice and opportunity for hearing before its original January 12, 2001 orders, the Commission later remedied any alleged procedural defect by considering whatever evidence and arguments petitioners offered in their petitions for rehearing and their motions to intervene. We have held that the Commission need not hold a trial-type hearing if it can adequately resolve disputed issues of fact on the written record. <em>See, e.g., Sierra Assoc. for Envt. v. FERC, </em>744 F.2d 661, 663 (9th Cir.1984) (noting that a \u201cpaper hearing\u201d provides due process). Here, the petitioners not only had ample opportunity to submit whatever evidence they desired as part of the petition-for-rehearing process, but also they had an obligation under the Commission\u2019s procedural rules to do so. <em>See </em>18 C.F.R. \u00a7 385.214(b)(1); 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 385.713(c). When the Commission gave the petitioners the opportunity fully to submit evidence and argue the issues in their petitions for rehearing, as it did here, the Commission satisfied the dictates of due process required by the Constitution and federal statute. <em>See Boston Edison Co. v. FERC, </em>885 F.2d 962, 966 (1st Cir.1989) (Breyer, J.); <em>see also City of Auburn v. United States, </em>154 F.3d 1025 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-14\">The Commission was not required to comply with the Administrative Procedure Act\u2019s notice-and-comment procedural requirements applicable to agency rule-making because the Commission\u2019s approval of the PG &amp; E companies\u2019 reorganization was not a \u201crulemaking.\u201d <em>See United States v. Florida East Coast Ry. Co., </em>410 U.S. 224, 245, 93 S.Ct. 810, 35 L.Ed.2d 223 (1973) (\u201cAdjudication deals with what the law was; rulemaking deals with what the law will be.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-15\">The Commission did not abuse its discretion by not permitting NCPA to inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>vene late in Docket EC01-41 when the Commission determined that the agency did not have \u201cgood cause\u201d for failing to file a timely motion. <em>See </em>18 C.F.R. \u00a7 385.214(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The Commission\u2019s finding that the Pacific Gas &amp; Electric companies\u2019 reorganization was \u201cconsistent with the public interest,\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824b(a), was not \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). The Commission\u2019s orders directly contradict NCPA\u2019s assertions that the Commission failed to consider the public interest and failed to consider the reorganization\u2019s effects on creditors. The Commission explicitly considered the reorganization\u2019s effects on creditors and decided, on balance, that the reorganization was consistent with the public interest, based on relevant factors. Balancing potentially conflicting factors relevant to the public\u2019s energy needs is a task for the Commission\u2019s discretion that we hesitate to second-guess.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Finally, we deny NCPA\u2019s motion that we judicially notice certain documents. <em>See Rybachek v. EPA, </em>904 F.2d 1276, 1296 (9th Cir.1990) (\u201cJudicial review of agency actions should generally be confined to the original record upon which the actions were based.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b56-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
