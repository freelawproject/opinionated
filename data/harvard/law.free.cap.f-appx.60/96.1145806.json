We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we reverse.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">At trial, the prosecutor noted discrepancies between Castro\u2019s trial testimony and that of a government agent, and asked Castro, over repeated defense objections, whether the government agent \u201cgot it wrong,\u201d \u201cmisunderstood,\u201d or if the agent\u2019s testimony was simply \u201cnot true.\u201d Because this line of questioning was tantamount to asking Castro whether the government agent was lying, it is reversible error. <em>United States v. Geston, </em>299 F.3d 1130, 1137 (9th Cir.2002). The responsibility to evaluate witness veracity must rest solely with the jury, and forcing a criminal defendant to comment on the credibility of a government agent impermissibly influences the jury\u2019s determination. <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>176 F.3d 1214, 1220 (9th Cir.1999); <em>see also United States v. Henke, </em>222 F.3d 633, 643 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-14\">This error was not harmless because it undercut the sole defense presented at trial \u2014 that of duress. Castro claimed that the man who had previously paid him to smuggle drugs demanded he transport this load to make up for the one lost at the prior arrest, threatening to harm him and his family if he refused. Castro was the sole witness who could testify as to this defense. \u201cIn a case where witness credibility was paramount, it was plain error for the court to allow the prosecutor to persist in asking witnesses to make improper comments upon the testimony of other witnesses.\u201d <em>Geston, </em>299 F.3d at 1137.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-15\">The government contends that its cross-examination involved only a minor factual matter, and was thus harmless. The size of discrepancy, however, alters neither the impact the improper questioning had on the defendant\u2019s credibility, nor the rule that \u201cthe prosecution is not allowed to use improper tactics.\u201d <em>United States v. Sarkisian, </em>197 F.3d 966, 990 (9th Cir.1999). \u201cThe prosecuting attorney represents a sovereign whose obligation is to govern impartially and whose interest in a particular case is not necessarily to win, but to do justice. It is the sworn duty of the prosecutor to assure that the defendant has a fair and impartial trial.\u201d <em>Com. of North-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number><em>em Mariana Islands v. Bowie, </em>236 F.3d 1083, 1089 (9th Cir.2001) (internal quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b129-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b129-12\">. We grant Appellant's Motion to Strike Government Exhibits A and B to the Response <em>Brief, </em>but deny his Motion to Strike Government\u2019s Supplemental Excerpts of Record.

Geston, </em>299 F.3d 1130, 1136 (9th Cir.2002). But here, the prosecutor asked defendant whether the government witness was wrong, not <em>why </em>he was wrong. Defendant thus didn\u2019t have to comment on character or credibility; he only had to answer-as he surely could do-whether the other witness\u2019s responses were <em>accurate. </em>(Incidentally, that\u2019s all he did.)</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">The question here is admittedly close; we don\u2019t disagree on the law to apply or what that law means; we only part on the interpretation of a few simple questions. Nonetheless, because I don\u2019t see how asking whether an agent \u201cgot it wrong\u201d or offered testimony that was \u201cnot true\u201dmeaning not correct-is the same as asking whether the agent lied, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
