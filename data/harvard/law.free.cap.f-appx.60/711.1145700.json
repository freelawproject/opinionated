Lay, Senior United States Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b743-20\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-21\">The City of El Cajon appeals the district court\u2019s order and judgment that: (1) the City\u2019s ordinance regarding real estate signs placed in the public \u201cparkway\u201d is unconstitutionally vague; (2) the City\u2019s ordinance regarding \u201ccommunity service signs\u201d is an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech; and (3) the City\u2019s ordinance banning temporary political signs is an unconstitutional restriction on speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-22\">THG Enterprises and Jim Harnsberger (collectively \u201cTHG\u201d) cross-appeal the district court\u2019s determination regarding appropriate attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-23\">We affirm the district court\u2019s decision that the City\u2019s Municipal Code \u00a7 17.66.020(F)(7) is unconstitutionally vague as applied to signs on public property. The ordinance\u2019s use of the phrase \u201c[i]f an off-site real estate sign is located on private property\u201d implies that an off-site real estate sign could also be on public property. But the ordinance\u2019s restrictive structure and purpose suggest the opposite. Thus, a person of ordinary intelligence would not reasonably know whether placing an off-site real estate sign on public property is prohibited. <em>See Village of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., </em>455 U.S. 489, 498, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 71 L.Ed.2d 362 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>We also affirm the district court\u2019s decision that the City\u2019s Municipal Code \u00a7 17.66.020(F)(5) is an unconstitutional pri- or restraint on speech. Even if we assume the ordinance is content neutral, it does not provide adequate procedural safeguards governing when, where, or how a permit is granted. <em>See Thomas v. Chicago Park Disk, </em>534 U.S. 316, 323, 122 S.Ct. 775, 151 L.Ed.2d 783 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">We reverse the district court\u2019s decision that the City\u2019s Municipal Code \u00a7 17.66.020(F)(4) is an unconstitutional restriction on free speech. We agree with the district court that the parkway is a limited public forum subject to a \u201creasonableness\u201d standard of review. Under that standard, however, we hold that the ordinance reasonably promotes the City\u2019s aesthetic and safety interests by banning temporary political signs. Temporary political signs, unlike other signs allowed in the parkway, are unrelated to providing directional or location information to drivers and pedestrians. Temporary political signs also pose a greater aesthetic risk because of the competition innate in political campaigns. While the City\u2019s regulatory scheme is not precise, we cannot say that it is unreasonable either.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Because we reverse the district court in part, we vacate the district court\u2019s order granting attorney\u2019s fees to THG and remand with instructions to recalculate the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">Each party to bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"AX7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
