Brooks appeals pro se the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing his action alleging that Golden Feather Realty Services, Inc. (\u201cGolden Feather\u201d) violated certain rules and regulations promulgated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d), and the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d), by prohibiting real estate brokers, including Brooks, from conducting open houses in HUD homes. We have jurisdiction under 28 U. S.C. \u00a7 1291. After de novo review, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number><em>Schmier v. U.S. Ct. of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, </em>279 F.3d 817, 824 (9th Cir.2002), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Brooks\u2019s contention that Golden Feather violated HUD Property Disposition Handbook, Directive No. 4310.5 REV-2, by prohibiting open houses is without merit. The Directive provides only that real estate brokers \u201cmay request permission to hold an open house on any property available for sale,\u201d not that the brokers are entitled to conduct such open houses, and HUD Notice H 99-4 did not modify this provision. Similarly, the district court properly concluded that Golden Feather\u2019s decision to prohibit open houses did not violate 24 C.F.R. pt. 291, because those regulations do not confer any right on real estate brokers to conduct such open houses.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The district court properly dismissed Brooks\u2019s claim that Golden Feather violated the rule-making provisions of the APA, because the APA governs only federal agencies. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553; <em>id. </em>\u00a7 551(1) (defining an agency as \u201ceach authority of the Government of the United States\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Brooks\u2019s motion for relief from the judgment because Brooks failed to demonstrate that the evidence his counsel allegedly omitted from the opposition to dismissal would have altered the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss. <em>See Coastal Transfer Co. v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., </em>833 F.2d 208, 211-12 (9th Cir.1987). Furthermore, the district court did not err in denying the motion before Brooks had filed a reply brief. <em>See City of Los Angeles, Harbor Div. v. Santa Monica Baykeeper, </em>254 F.3d 882, 888 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">Contrary to Brooks\u2019s contention on appeal, he was not entitled to a jury trial. <em>See Etalook v. Exxon Pipeline Co., </em>831 F.2d 1440, 1447 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-13\">We deny Brooks\u2019s motions for judicial notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b182-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
