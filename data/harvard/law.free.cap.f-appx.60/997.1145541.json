We have reviewed the administrative record and the Board\u2019s decision and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review substantially on the reasoning of the Board. <em>See Henriquez Parada v. INS, </em>No. A28-073-338 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>(B.I.A. Nov. 19, 1997).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1030-18\"> Because we find that the Board properly found Henriquez Parada to be deportable for failure to show that he applied for and received consent to reenter the United States after his prior deportation, we decline to reach the issue of whether the Board properly found that Henriquez Parada was also deport-able on the ground that he lacked a valid immigrant visa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
