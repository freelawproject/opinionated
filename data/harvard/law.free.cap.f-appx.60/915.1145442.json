Taylor contends that the District Court erred in concluding that the ALJ\u2019s findings were supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-16\">The District Court exercised jurisdiction over Taylor\u2019s request for review of the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). Because the District Court\u2019s Order was a final judgment that disposed of all of the Parties\u2019 claims, we exercise jurisdiction over the instant appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-18\">We review de novo the issue of whether the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Plummer v. Apfel, </em>186 F.3d 422, 427 (3d Cir.1999) (stating that \u201c[t]he role of this Court is identical to that of the District Court, namely to determine whether there is substantial evidence to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision.\u201d) Substantial evidence \u201cdoes not mean a large or significant amount of evidence, but rather such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Hartranft v. Apfel, </em>181 F.3d 358, 360 (3d Cir.1999) (citing <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 565, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988)). \u2018We wifi not set aside the Commissioner\u2019s decision if it is supported by substantial evidence, even if we would have decided the factual inquiry differently.\u201d <em>Hartranft, </em>181 F.3d at 360 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-19\">After a careful review of the record and the Parties\u2019 arguments, we find no basis for disturbing the District Court\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned opinion. Taylor argues to this Court that the ALJ violated the <em>Cotter </em>doctrine, which requires the ALJ to set forth the factual findings, including both accepted and rejected evidence, on which his or her decision is based. <em>See Cotter v. Harris, </em>642 F.2d 700, 705-06 (3d Cir.1981). Taylor raised this same argument before the District Court. After conducting a comprehensive analysis of the evidence in the record, the District Court concluded that the ALJ properly relied on the reports of the physicians who examined Taylor and that the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. We agree with the District Court that the ALJ properly considered the physicians reports and adequately set forth the basis for his decision. Therefore, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>will affirm the judgment for substantially the same reasons set forth in the record.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
