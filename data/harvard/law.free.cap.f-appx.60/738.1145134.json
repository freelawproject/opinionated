R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-18\">Proceeding <em>pro se </em>and <em>informa pauper-is, </em>Appellants Machell Phibbs and Nicolina Phibbs (collectively \u201cAppellants\u201d) appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of their complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). Appellants also appeal the district court\u2019s denial of the motion they filed pursuant to Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Appellants\u2019 motion to consolidate their two appeals is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-19\">The claims raised in Appellants\u2019 complaint arise from a dispute over handicapped parking at Appellants\u2019 apartment complex. The defendants named in the complaint include the corporation which owns the apartment complex, the manager and assistant manager of the complex, several tenants, and a police officer who responded to a disturbance at the complex. The district court construed the complaint as alleging causes of action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985(3). The court concluded that Appellants had failed to state claims upon which relief may be granted and dismissed the complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). In reaching the determination that Appellants\u2019 complaint should be dismissed, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>district court relied on <em>Wilhelm v. Continental Title Co., </em>a case in which this court concluded that disabled persons do not constitute a class of persons entitled to protection under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985. <em>See </em>720 F.2d 1173, 1175-77 (10th Cir.1983). In addition, the district court concluded that the complaint did not allege any constitutional violation actionable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">On appeal, Appellants assert that the district court should have provided them with an opportunity to amend their complaint to correct any deficiencies. They also assert that their complaint- contains additional claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Fair Housing Act and that the district court erred when it dismissed the complaint without addressing those claims. This court reviews a dismissal pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) <em>de novo. See Perkins v. Kan. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>165 F.3d 803, 806 (10th Cir.1999). The <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of a <em>pro se </em>complaint for failure to state a claim \u201cis appropriate only where it is patently obvious that the plaintiff could not prevail on the facts alleged, and allowing [her] an opportunity to amend [her] complaint would be futile.\u201d <em>Whitney v. New Mexico, </em>113 F.3d 1170, 1173 (10th Cir.1997) (quotation omitted). When reviewing the propriety of a dismissal for failure to state a claim, this court must construe a <em>pro se </em>litigant\u2019s complaint liberally, must accept the allegations in the complaint as true, and must construe the allegations and any reasonable inferences that might be drawn from them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>See Gaines v. Stenseng, </em>292 F.3d 1222, 1224 (10th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">We conclude that the district court properly dismissed Appellants\u2019 \u00a7 1983 and \u00a7 1985 claims. It is clear from our review of the record that Appellants cannot prevail on the facts alleged in their complaint and allowing them the opportunity to amend the compliant would be futile. Construing Appellants\u2019 complaint liberally, however, we also conclude they raised claims arising under both the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Fair Housing Act. The district court erred when it dismissed Appellants\u2019 complaint <em>sua sponte </em>without any discussion or analysis of those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Appellants\u2019 \u00a7 1983 and \u00a7 1985 claims with prejudice is affirmed. The court\u2019s dismissal of the remaining claims raised in Appellants\u2019 complaint is reversed and Appellants\u2019 appeal from the denial of their Rule 60(b) motion is dismissed as moot.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The matter is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b771-13\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b772-6\">. Appellants did not challenge the dismissal of their \u00a7 1983 and \u00a7 1985 claims in their Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
