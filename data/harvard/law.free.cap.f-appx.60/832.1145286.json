Petitioners\u2019 principal argument is that Petitioner GEM Enterprises was not the alter ego of Petitioner APF Carting as found by the Board. Petitioners also contend that they did not violate the National Labor Relations Act by (1) bypassing the union and dealing directly with the employees in encouraging them to seek other employment; (2) refusing to provide the union with requested information; (3) conditioning the employment of two individuals on their withdrawal from the union; and (4) discharging one of those individuals for protected union activity. Further, Petitioners contend that the Board\u2019s remedy was overbroad. Because the Board\u2019s findings all survive the appropriate standard of review, <em>United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Int\u2019l Union v. NLRB, </em>880 F.2d 1422, 1429 (D.C.Cir.1989) (\u201c[T]his court will uphold the order of the Board unless, reviewing the record as a whole, it concludes that the Board\u2019s factual findings are not supported by substantial evidence ____\u201d), we deny the petition for review. Substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that GEM Enterprises was in fact the alter ego of APF Carting. Likewise, substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s findings that Petitioners violated the Act. The Board\u2019s remedial order, which seeks to restore the status quo, falls within its remedial powers. <em>Va. Elec. &amp; Power Co. v. NLRB, </em>319 U.S. 533, 539-40, 63 S.Ct. 1214, 87 L.Ed. 1568 (1943). Any disagreement over which specific employees were affected by Petitioners\u2019 unlawful acts should be addressed not here, but at a compliance proceeding following the adjudication of liability. It is</p>\n<p id=\"b864-23\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the petition for review of the order of the National Labor Relations Board be denied and the Board\u2019s cross-application for enforcement be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-24\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein -until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number><em>See </em>Fed.
