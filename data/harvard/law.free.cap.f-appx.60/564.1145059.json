Lawson, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Michigan, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b597-7\">\n<em>ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">Leroy Hill appeals the sentence of imprisonment entered upon his plea of guflty to conspiring to possess with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, possessing with intent to distribute cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and carrying, using, and possessing a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). The parties have waived oral argument, and this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">The district court sentenced Hill to ninety-seven months of imprisonment on the drug offenses and sixty months of imprisonment on the firearm offense, to be served consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">On appeal, Hill contends that his sentence was the result of an incorrect guideline application, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(2), because: 1) the district court improperly considered his lack of employment; 2) the district court improperly considered prior criminal charges not resulting in conviction; and 3) the district court improperly considered facts surrounding his negotiations for the purchase of drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-14\">In reviewing challenges to sentences, this court reviews the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo, and reviews the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>248 F.3d 506, 515 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 981, 122 S.Ct. 414, 151 L.Ed.2d 315 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-15\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court did not misapply the guidelines. In choosing the term of imprisonment within the guideline range \u2014 as is the case herein \u2014 courts may consider, without limitation, any information concerning the background, character, and conduct of the defendant, unless otherwise prohibited by law. USSG \u00a7 1B1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-16\">Hill first claims that the district court improperly considered his lack of employment in determining his sentence. In support of his claim, Hill relies on USSG \u00a7 5H1.5, which limits the district court\u2019s ability to consider a defendant\u2019s employment record in sentencing. Section 5H1.5, however, is not applicable in this case. That section provides that a defendant\u2019s employment record is not normally relevant in determining whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range. Inasmuch as Hill was not sentenced outside the applicable guideline range, Hill\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 5H1.5 is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>Hill next claims that the district court improperly considered prior criminal charges not resulting in conviction in determining his sentence. Courts have consistently held that uncharged but relevant criminal conduct may be used in determining a defendant\u2019s sentencing guideline range. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Sanders, </em>982 F.2d 4, 10 (1st Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Galloway, </em>976 F.2d 414, 427-28 (8th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Newbert, </em>952 F.2d 281, 284-85 (9th Cir.1991). In support of his claim, Hill relies on USSG \u00a7 4A1.8 which authorizes the district court to depart from the guideline range where \u201creliable information indicates that the criminal history category does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s past criminal conduct\u201d and provides that a prior arrest record shall not be considered. USSG. \u00a7 4A1.3. That section, however is not applicable in Hill\u2019s case because the district court did not depart from the applicable guideline range. Thus, Hill\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 4A1.3 is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">Finally, Hill claims that the district court improperly considered facts surrounding his negotiations for the purchase of drugs. Hill\u2019s claim is meritless. Hill negotiated for sixty grams of cocaine base, an amount that would have carried with it a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence. The net weight of the cocaine base turned out to be under fifty grams. The district court properly considered Hill\u2019s conduct in determining his sentence, and Hill\u2019s negotiations for a larger quantity of cocaine base than the amount he actually received is not conduct otherwise prohibited from consideration by law. USSG \u00a7 1B1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Accordingly, we hereby affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
