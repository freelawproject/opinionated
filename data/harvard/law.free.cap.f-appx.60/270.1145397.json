The Earthgrains Co., </em>No. 01 C 3895, 2002 WL 1949235 (N.D.Ill. Aug. 22, 2002). We <em>reverse.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-22\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b302-23\">Ms. Kim filed U.S. Patent Application 08/147,995 on November 5, 1993. That application was directed to a \u201cpotassium br\u00f3mate replacer,\u201d <em>viz., </em>a composition consisting essentially of ascorbic acid, a food acid, an optional phosphate, and flour to serve as a slow-acting oxidant in yeast-leavened products. Kim filed U.S. Patent Application 08/308,617, which was a continuation-in-part of the \u2019995 application, on September 19, 1994. That application issued as U.S. Patent 5,510,129 on April 23, 1996. The T29 patent was then reissued as U.S. Patent Re. 36,355 on October 26, 1999. The reissued patent contains ten claims directed to potassium br\u00f3mate re-placers and encompasses broader ranges of components of the invention, which were described in the T29 patent\u2019s specification but not included in the claims initially. Claim 5 of the reissued patent, which is the primary independent claim alleged to be infringed, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-24\">A <em>potassium br\u00f3mate replacer </em>composition consisting essentially of, by weight:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-25\">(a) about 0.001 to 0.03 parts ascorbic acid as an oxidant per 100 parts flour,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>(b) about 0.015 to 0.2 parts food acid per 100 parts flour, said food acid selected from the group consisting of acetic acid, citric acid, fumaric acid, lactic acid, malic acid, oxalic acid, phosphoric acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, fruit juice, fruit juice concentrate, vinegar, wine, and mixtures thereof, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-5\">(c) flour.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">\u2019355 patent, col. 8,11. 47-57 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Earthgrains manufactures and sells the accused Butter Top and DTtaliano brand breads, each of which contains ascorbic acid and vinegar (a food acid). The Butter Top and DTtaliano bread products were originally produced by Metz Baking Company but were acquired by Earthgrains when it merged with Metz in 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">On May 25, 2001, Kim, acting <em>pro se, </em>filed suit against Earthgrains in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleging that Earthgrains\u2019 sale of its Butter Top and DTtaliano breads infringes the \u2019355 patent because each bread contains amounts of ascorbic acid and a food acid, <em>ie., </em>vinegar, falling within the ranges claimed in the \u2019355 patent. Earthgrains moved for summary judgment that the '355 patent is invalid under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b) on the theory that the Butter Top and DTtaliano breads were on sale more than one year prior to Kim\u2019s earliest patent filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">The district court granted Earthgrains\u2019 motion for summary judgment. First, the court determined that the earliest possible critical date for the \u2019355 patent was November 5, 1992, one year before Kim\u2019s earliest filing date relating to the invention claimed in the \u2019355 patent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Kim v. The Earthgrains Co., </em>No. 01 C 3895, 2002 WL 1949235 (N.D.Ill. Aug. 22, 2002). Secondly, the court found that Earthgrains provided unrebutted evidence, in the form of a declaration of Earthgrains\u2019 employee Donald G. Knott, that Butter Top bread was on sale prior to the critical date. <em>Id. </em>While noting that it was not clear from the record whether Butter Top bread contains amounts of ascorbic acid and vinegar that fall within the ranges claimed in the \u2019355 patent, the court still held that Kim\u2019s allegation that it does contain those amounts and therefore infringes estopped her from arguing that its prior sale does not invalidate the patent. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Vanmoor v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>201 F.3d 1363, 53 USPQ2d 1377 (Fed.Cir.2000)). Thus, the court concluded that Kim\u2019s factual allegation that Butter Top bread infringes the \u2019355 patent combined with Earthgrains\u2019 unrebutted evidence that Butter Top bread was sold prior to the critical date rendered the \u2019355 patent invalid under \u00a7 102(b). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-13\">Kim timely appealed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-14\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b303-15\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>reapplying the same standard used by the district court. <em>Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc. v. U.S. Surgical Corp., </em>149 F.3d 1309, 1315, 47 USPQ2d 1272, 1275 (Fed.Cir.1998). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c). \u201cThe evidence of the non<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>movant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, <em>255, </em>106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">On appeal, Kim argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment that the \u2019355 patent is invalid under \u00a7 102(b). Kim contends that the claimed invention was not \u201cin public use or on sale\u201d in the United States before the critical date of November 5, 1992 because Earthgrains\u2019 lack of research and development, Metz\u2019s earlier use of acetic acid in vinegar as a food acid, and a 1994 letter from the FDA demonstrate that potassium br\u00f3mate was used in the Butter Top and D\u2019ltaliano breads in 1992. Thus, according to Kim, the alleged invalidating sales were not of \u201cpotassium br\u00f3mate replacers.\u201d Moreover, Kim asserts that the Knott declaration, on which the district court relied in granting summary judgment to Earthgrains, contained \u201ccontradictory, inaccurate, and misleading statements.\u201d Kim also argues that the court misapplied \u00a7 102(b) by not considering the \u00a7 101 statutory class, <em>viz., </em>composition of matter, to which the claimed \u201cpotassium br\u00f3mate replacer\u201d belongs.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Earthgrains responds that the district court correctly granted summary judgment that the \u2019355 patent is invalid under \u00a7 102(b). Earthgrains argues that D\u2019ltaliano bread identical to the D\u2019ltaliano bread that Kim alleges infringes the \u2019355 patent was on sale before the critical date.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Earthgrains adverts to the Knott declaration, which purports to establish that the 1992 D\u2019ltaliano bread and the accused D\u2019ltaliano bread have \u201cvirtually the same\u201d ascorbic acid and vinegar contents, and argues that Kim has never contested the fact that the pre-critical date D\u2019ltaliano bread and the accused D\u2019ltaliano bread have the same composition. Earthgrains further argues that the sale of D\u2019ltaliano bread before the critical date anticipates the \u2019355 patent, regardless whether all of the advantages of the ascorbic acid and vinegar combination were understood at that time. Earthgrains also responds that \u00a7 102(b) applies to all classes of subject matter, including compositions of matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">We agree with Kim that the court erred in granting summary judgment that the \u2019355 patent is invalid under \u00a7 102(b). Because a patent issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is presumed to be valid, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282 (2000), Earthgrains has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the precritical date sale of Butter Top or D\u2019ltaliano bread anticipated the \u2019355 patent, <em>see Vanmoor, </em>201 F.3d at 1366, 53 USPQ2d at 1379. The district court correctly stated that that burden may be satisfied by Kim\u2019s allegation that the Butter Top and D\u2019ltaliano breads infringe the \u2019355 patent. <em>See id. </em>However, such is the case only if the <em>same </em>Butter Top or D\u2019ltaliano bread that Kim accuses of infringing the \u2019355 patent was on sale before the critical date, see, <em>e.g., id.; Evans Cooling Sys., Inc. v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>125 F.3d 1448, 1451, 44 USPQ2d 1037, 1040 (Fed.Cir.1997), for it would be inconsistent for Kim to argue that the Butter Top and D\u2019ltaliano breads fall within the scope of the claims for infringement purposes but not for anticipation purposes, see <em>Lewmar Marine, Inc. v. Barient, Inc., </em>827 F.2d 744, 747, 3 USPQ2d 1766, 1768 (Fed.Cir.1987) (\u201cThat which would literally infringe if later in time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>anticipates if earlier than the date of invention.\u201d (emphasis omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The district court, however, did not fully consider the differences in composition between the pre-critical date breads and the accused breads. In finding the \u2019355 patent invalid under the on-sale bar of \u00a7 102(b), the district court relied only on the \u201cunrebutted declaration of Mr. Knott that at least one loaf of the Butter Top bread brand was on sale before the critical date.\u201d Although there is no dispute that some breads labeled as Butter Top and DTtaliano were on sale before the critical date, a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether those breads had the same compositions as the accused breads, especially with respect to the potassium br\u00f3mate re-placer limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">The Knott declaration does not establish that the same Butter Top and DTtaliano breads that Kim accuses of infringing the \u2019355 patent were on sale in 1992. Although Earthgrains insists that the Knott declaration proves that the 1992 breads and the accused breads are identical because they contain essentially the same amounts of ascorbic acid and vinegar, Kim accuses Earthgrains of infringing the \u2019355 patent by its sale of bread that contains the claimed amounts of ascorbic acid and vinegar and, importantly, no potassium br\u00f3mate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Neither Earthgrains\u2019 arguments nor the Knott declaration addresses whether the breads sold in 1992 contained potassium br\u00f3mate. Nor does the Knott declaration support the district court\u2019s finding that both the 1992 and the current Butter Top breads have the same ascorbic acid and vinegar contents. According to the declaration, the 1992 formula for Butter Top bread included 0.130 parts vinegar (per 100 parts flour) and 0.000120 parts ascorbic acid, whereas the current formula for Butter Top bread includes 0.96 parts vinegar and 0.000115 parts ascorbic acid. Those figures indicate that the 1992 and current Butter Top breads contain different ascorbic acid and vinegar contents, and neither appears to fall literally within the scope of the \u2019355 patent\u2019s claims.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">Moreover, we disagree with Earthgrains\u2019 repeated assertion that Kim has not contested the claim that the breads on sale in 1992 and the accused breads are the same. Although Kim has apparently not argued that the ascorbic acid and vinegar contents differ, she has sought to distinguish the breads in terms of their potassium br\u00f3mate content. In her response to Earthgrains\u2019 statements of facts in dispute, which was filed with the district court on June 12, 2002, Kim argued that the 1992 Butter Top and DTtaliano recipes provided by Earthgrains list as ingredients yeast foods containing potassium br\u00f3mate, <em>viz., </em>Arkady D S and Arco Double Strength, respectively. The district court did not address that issue. In this appeal, Kim continues to maintain that, unlike the accused Butter Top and DTtaliano breads, the 1992 breads used yeast food containing potassium br\u00f3mate. Thus, Kim argued to the trial court and argues to us now that the Butter Top and DTtaliano breads manufactured in 1992 have materially different compositions than the Butter Top and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>DTtaliano breads that she alleges infringe the \u2019355 patent. Although we do not address the merits of Kim\u2019s arguments on this point, we find that her arguments of infringement and validity are not inconsistent: the accused breads containing no potassium br\u00f3mate may infringe, while the breads on sale in 1992 and containing potassium br\u00f3mate may not anticipate the \u2019355 patent. We therefore conclude that her arguments are sufficient to preclude summary judgment of invalidity on the theory of estoppel invoked by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">Drawing all justifiable inferences in favor of the nonmovant Kim, as we must when reviewing a grant of summary judgment, a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the breads that Kim alleges infringe the \u2019355 patent have substantially the same composition in all material respects as the breads that were sold prior to the critical date. Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment that the \u2019355 patent is invalid and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">In their briefs, the parties make various other requests. We deny Earthgrains\u2019 request for costs. We also deny Kim\u2019s request that this case be reassigned to another district court judge.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b303-10\">. The parties do not dispute the critical date, so we too will treat November 5, 1992 as the critical date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b304-6\">. Earthgrains\u2019 brief focuses on the sale of D\u2019ltaliano bread as anticipating the '355 patent, mistakenly asserting that that was what the district court did. The district court\u2019s opinion, however, relied solely on the sale of Butter Top bread in its \u00a7 102(b) analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b305-7\">. Although Kim's complaint does not explicitly allege that the accused breads contain no potassium br\u00f3mate, her arguments make clear that she believes them to infringe because they contain the claimed amounts of ascorbic acid and vinegar as a potassium br\u00f3mate <em>replacer.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b305-11\">. We note, however, that the differences in ascorbic acid and vinegar contents for the DTtaliano breads were much less significant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
