The district court did not err in certifying the class of women employed at Boeing\u2019s Puget Sound facilities for purposes of determining whether the employer engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination against its female employees because of sex (Phase I). <em>See, e.g., Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters v. United States, </em>431 U.S. 324, 97 S.Ct. 1843, 52 L.Ed.2d 396 (1977). In a systemic disparate treatment case seeking class-wide injunctive or declaratory relief, plaintiffs are \u201cnot required to offer evidence that each person [who] seek[s] relief was a victim of the employer\u2019s discriminatory policy\u201d to establish their prima facie case. <em>Id. </em>at 360. Rather, their burden is to prove only that \u201cdiscrimination was the company\u2019s standard operating procedure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 336. This may be done through statistics alone. <em>See id. </em>at 339-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">Because the employer\u2019s defense must be \u201cdesigned to meet the prima facie case\u201d established by plaintiffs\u2019 statistical proof, the focus of its rebuttal case likewise \u201cwill not be on individual [employment] decisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 360 n. 46. Instead, to meet its rebuttal burden, the employer must demonstrate that the plaintiffs\u2019 statistical evidence \u201cis either inaccurate or insignificant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-13\">Hence, Boeing cannot defeat class certification at the liability phase by arguing that it is entitled to introduce individualized evidence that each of its employment decisions was motivated by a legitimate nondiseriminatory reason. <em>See, e.g., Probe v. State Teachers\u2019 Ret. Sys., </em>780 F.2d 776, 780 (9th Cir.1986) (recognizing the applicability of Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2) to Title VII actions). At various points in its appellate brief, Boeing seems to concede as much. <em>See, e.g., </em>Appellants\u2019 Opening Br. at 23. If there is a finding that Boeing engaged in class-wide discrimination, the district court may award at least declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-14\">2. The district court abused its discretion when it certified the class for purposes of determining plaintiffs\u2019 punitive damages claims (Phase II). Although there is no rule against \u201chybrid certification\u201d under both Rule 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3), <em>see Smith v. Univ. of Wash. Law Sch., </em>233 F.3d 1188, 1196 (9th Cir. 2000), certification here was premature, <em>see Teamsters, </em>431 U.S. at 361 (\u201c[T]he question of individual relief does not arise <em>until </em>it has been <em>proved </em>that the employer has followed an employment policy of unlawful discrimination.\u201d (emphasis added)). The district court\u2019s order certifying the Phase II class indicates that liability in Phase I would depend on plaintiffs\u2019 ability to prove a pattern or practice of discrimination, and that \u201cthe punitive damages assessed against defendants (if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>any) will flow from that finding.\u201d However, a finding that the employer engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination does not automatically entitle every class member to damages. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981a(b)(1) (allowing the award of punitive damages when the employer acted with reckless indifference to the federal rights of \u201can aggrieved individual\u201d). To receive punitive damages in a Title VII case, a plaintiff must have suffered some harm as a result of a defendant\u2019s illegal behavior. Hence, membership in the Phase II class must be restricted to those who allege that they were harmed by the employer\u2019s proven pattern or practice of discrimination. The district court\u2019s order contravenes these principles. Because the district court did not certify a class for backpay, the action will terminate upon an award of punitive damages, which, according to the order, automatically \u201cflow from\u201d a finding of a pattern or practice of discrimination. If the district court\u2019s certification of the Phase II class were upheld, the beneficiaries of the punitive damages award would necessarily include those class members not affected by the alleged discriminatory policy as well as those who were. This may not be done. We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s certification order with respect to punitive damages (Phase II).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">3. Because we hold that questions about systemic disparate treatment should be decided first and vacate those aspects of the district court\u2019s order that relate to class-wide punitive damages, Rule 23(b)(2)\u2019s \u201cpredominance\u201d requirement is not violated. <em>See Molski v. Gleich, </em>307 F.3d 1155, 1165-70 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">We reject Boeing\u2019s argument that a bifurcated trial plan violates the Seventh Amendment\u2019s Reexamination Clause. <em>See Arthur Young &amp; Co. v. U.S. Dist. Court, </em>549 F.2d 686, 692-93 (9th Cir.1977); <em>see also Hilao v. Estate of Marcos, </em>103 F.3d 767, 782 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">We affirm the district court\u2019s certification order in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">AFFIRMED in part, VACATED in part. No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b71-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
