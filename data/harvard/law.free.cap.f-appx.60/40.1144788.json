The district court granted summary judgment for the Fund, concluding that Barncord had forfeited those benefits. We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-12\">We review the grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Shaw v. Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers Pension Plan, </em>750 F.2d 1458, 1460 (9th Cir.1985). Barncord\u2019s disability pension benefits were not protected from forfeiture by plan amendment under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1054(g). That provision protects only \u201caccrued benefits,\u201d including \u201cretirement-type subsidies.\u201d Benefits that are not \u201caccrued benefits\u201d may be subject to forfeiture by plan amendment. <em>See Shaw, </em>750 F.2d at 1463.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-16\">\u201c[I]n the case of a defined benefit plan, the individual\u2019s accrued benefit determined under the plan\u201d is generally \u201cexpressed in the form of an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(23)(A) (1999). \u201cIn general, the term \u2018accrued benefits\u2019 refers only to pension or retirement benefits. Consequently, accrued benefits do not include ancillary benefits not directly related to retirement benefits....\u201d 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.411(a)-7(a)(1)(ii) (2002). Such ancillary benefits include \u201cdisability benefits not in excess of the qualified disability benefit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The \u201cqualified disability benefit\u201d is \u201ca disability benefit provided by a plan which does not exceed the benefit which would be provided for the participant if he separated from the service at normal retirement age.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(22) (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-17\">The disability pension is not in excess of the \u201cqualified disability benefit\u201d because, under section 4.07 of the Plan, the monthly amount of the disability pension is \u201cdetermined in the same way as the monthly amount of the Normal Pension is determined.\u201d Thus, the disability pension benefits are \u201cancillary benefits not directly related to retirement benefits.\u201d They are not \u201caccrued benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-18\">Nor are the disability pension benefits \u201cretirement-type subsidies.\u201d The term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>\u201cretirement-type subsidy,\u201d as used in \u00a7 1054(g), was to be defined by Treasury regulations. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1054(g)(2)(A). Though the Treasury has yet to promulgate such regulations, the legislative history indicates that \u201ca qualified disability benefit ... will not be considered a retirement-type subsidy.\u201d S.Rep. No. 575, 98th Cong., 2d Sess., <em>reprinted in </em>1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2547, 2575-76. The disability pension is a \u201cqualified disability benefit\u201d because it does not exceed the normal retirement benefit. Thus, it not a \u201cretirement-type subsidy.\u201d That fact distinguishes this case from <em>Canseco v. Constr. Laborers Pension Trust for S. Cal., </em>93 F.3d 600 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Whether or not the Fund notified Barn-cord of the 1997 amendment is inconsequential. Summary judgment was appropriate because Barneord failed to show \u201cactive concealment [of the amendment] or some significant reliance upon, or prejudice resulting from the lack of notice.\u201d <em>Williams v. Plumbers &amp; Steamfitters Local 60 Pension Plan, </em>48 F.3d 923, 926 (5th Cir.1995) (citation omitted); <em>accord Kreutzer v. A.O. Smith Corp., </em>951 F.2d 739, 743 (7th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b73-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b73-14\">. Because we have elected to decide this case on the merits, we deny the Fund\u2019s motion to strike the briefs for failure to conform to the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and the Circuit Rules of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. We agree, however, that many of the Fund\u2019s objections are well-taken. See, <em>e.g., In re O\u2019Brien, </em>312 F.3d 1135 (9th Cir.2002); <em>N/S Corp. v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., </em>127 F.3d 1145 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
