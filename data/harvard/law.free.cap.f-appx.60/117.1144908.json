Solis contends that the district court erred when it deferred to the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the date on which it must afford food stamps benefits to applicants utilizing the new vehicle equity amendment. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-21\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment. <em>Padfield v. AIG Life Ins. Co., </em>290 F.3d 1121, 1124 (9th Cir.2002). Our review is governed by the same standards used by the trial court under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c). <em>Delta Savings Bank v. United States, </em>265 F.3d 1017, 1021 (9th Cir.2001) (citations omitted). We must determine, viewing the evidence in the light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>most favorable to the nonmoving party, whether there are any genuine issues of material fact, and whether the district court applied the relevant substantive law. <em>Oliver v. Keller, </em>289 F.3d 628, 626 (9th Cir.2002). Summary judgment may be affirmed on any ground supported by the record, even if it was not the basis for the district court\u2019s decision. <em>See Keyser v. Sacramento City Unified Sch. Dish, </em>265 F.3d 741, 750 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">I. The Plain Language of the Regulation</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Interpretation of an agency\u2019s regulation utilizes general principles of statutory interpretation. We examine the language of the regulation by looking to \u201cprovisions of the whole law, and to its object and policy.\u201d <em>Pilot Life Ins. v. Dedeaux, </em>481 U.S. 41, 51, 107 S.Ct. 1549, 95 L.Ed.2d 39 (1987) (citation omitted). We also take into account common sense, the regulatory purpose, and the practical consequences of the proposed interpretation. <em>Crown Pacific v. Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm\u2019n, </em>197 F.3d 1036, 1040 (9th Cir.1999) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The plain language of the regulation is the starting point for its interpretation. A regulation should be construed so as to give effect to the \u201cnatural and plain meaning\u201d of its words. <em>Id. </em>at 1038-39 (citation omitted). The plain meaning governs unless it leads to absurd results. <em>Dyer v. United States, </em>832 F.2d 1062, 1066 (9th Cir.1987) (citation omitted). If a term is not defined in the regulation itself, we may rely on dictionary definitions. <em>See United States v. Sherburne, </em>249 F.3d 1121, 1126 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">The regulation at issue contains an effective date of January 20, 2001, and further provides that \u201cstate agencies must implement [the amendment] no later than June 1, 2001.\u201d 65 Fed. Reg. 70134, 70134 (Nov. 21, 2000). Dictionary definitions do not compel either party\u2019s proffered definition interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">None of the cases relied upon by Solis eliminate the ambiguity, because they do not concern the difference between an effective date and an implementation date. Two of the cases concern whether an effective date bars retroactive application of the provision. <em>See United States v. Hughes Aircraft Co., </em>162 F.3d 1027, 1031 (9th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Gomez-Rodriguez, </em>77 F.3d 1150, 1151 (9th Cir.1996). The third case concerns the statute of limitations on an action against the employer. <em>Pisciotta v. Teledyne Indus., Inc., </em>91 F.3d 1326, 1332 (9th Cir.1996). Solis\u2019 assertion that other circuits\u2019 decisions support her interpretation does not correctly represent the decisions cited. In those cases, the courts addressed whether the effective date of the 1985 amendment to the Food Stamps Act of 1977 or the implementation date contained in the Secretary\u2019s regulations determined applicants\u2019 eligibility for benefits and concluded that the effective date clearly set by the statute controlled. <em>Lynch v. Lyng, </em>872 F.2d 718, 721 (6th Cir.1999); <em>Huberman v. Perales, </em>884 F.2d 62, 63 (2nd Cir.1989); <em>Metzer v. Lyng, </em>864 F.2d 75, 77 (8th Cir.1988). By contrast, the statute here does not provide any dates relating to the effectiveness of the regulations, but merely authorizes the Secretary to create regulations concerning inaccessible resources. <em>See </em>7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2014(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">II. Deference to the Secretary\u2019s Interpretation</p>\n<p id=\"b151-12\">Where plain language is ambiguous, as is the ease here, the Secretary\u2019s interpretation controls \u201cso long as it is \u2018reasonable,\u2019 that is so long as the interpretation sensibly conforms to the purposes and wording of the regulations.\u201d <em>Crown Pacific, </em>197 F.3d at 1038 (citations omitted). In this case, the Secretary\u2019s interpretation\u2014 that the effective date is the earliest date on which the agency may apply the regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>tion but is not the date on which the applicant can expect to receive benefits under the regulation \u2014 is entitled to deference because it is reasonable. It does not conflict with the dictionary definitions. Nor does it render the term \u201ceffective date\u201d meaningless, as Solis contends it does. Further, the Secretary\u2019s interpretation makes sense given the actual procedural obstacles to making the changes prescribed by the new rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Solis\u2019 claim that the interpretation is a <em>post hoc </em>justification that is not entitled to deference is incorrect. A <em>post hoc </em>interpretation is one that an agency advances during litigation that is distinct from the underlying administrative proceedings. <em>See Gilliland v. E.J. Bartells Co., Inc., </em>270 F.3d 1259, 1262 (9th Cir.2001). The Secretary has regularly and consistently applied the proffered interpretation in previous cases and regulations. <em>See, e.g., </em>61 Fed. Reg. 54270, 54278 (Oct. 17, 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b150-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
