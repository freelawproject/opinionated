Counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he states that there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Although notified of his right to submit a pro se supplemental brief, Beltran-Avellaneda has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-20\">Counsel presents for review the district court\u2019s failure to depart downward based on Beltran-Avellaneda\u2019s cultural assimilation. This court lacks jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s refusal to depart downward unless that refusal is based on the court\u2019s mistaken belief that it lacked the power to depart. <em>United States v. Bayerle, </em>898 F.2d 28, 30-31 (4th Cir.1990). The record clearly indicates that the district court knew it had the power to depart but simply refused to depart. Therefore, this court lacks jurisdiction over Beltran-Avellaneda\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-21\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Because this court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review, we deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw at this time. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-22\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-23\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
