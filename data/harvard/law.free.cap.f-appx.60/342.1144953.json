Cirineo was sentenced principally to a term of 292 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-17\">On appeal, Cirineo argues that his sentence violates the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). We have interpreted the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi </em>to mean that \u201cunless [certain] facts were found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, the defendant may not be sentenced more heavily than the maximum sentence allowed by the statute without regard to those [particular] facts.\u201d <em>United States v. Luciano, </em>311 F.3d 146, 151 (2d Cir.2002). More specifically,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-18\">[a]s long as the sentence imposed is not greater than the maximum penalty authorized by statute for the offense charged and (in cases involving a guilty plea) allocuted to by the defendant, a district court may consider drug quantity in determining a defendant\u2019s relevant conduct for sentencing purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-19\"><em>United States v. McLean, </em>287 F.3d 127, 133 (2d Cir.2002) (citing <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>274 F.3d 655, 663-64 (2d Cir.2001) <em>(en banc)).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>In this case, Cirineo was indicted for conspiring to violate 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), which prohibits, <em>inter alia, </em>distribution or possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of crack cocaine. Cirineo\u2019s indictment expressly charged him with possessing \u201c50 grams and more\u201d of crack cocaine, and Cirineo acknowledged during his plea allocution hearing that he possessed in excess of this amount of crack cocaine. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) carries a maximum statutory penalty of life imprisonment. Cirineo was sentenced principally to 292 months in prison. Accordingly, no <em>Apprendi </em>violation has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Cirineo also argues that the District Court committed clear error by crediting the testimony provided by his co-defendant, Franklin Lama, during the <em>Fatieo </em>hearing held on January 7, 2002 to determine the exact quantity of drugs attributable to Cirineo for sentencing purposes. <em>See United States v. Fatico, </em>579 F.2d 707 (2d Cir.1978). Specifically, Cirineo argues that Lama was not credible because he was a cooperating government witness and because he regularly smoked marijuana during the time period about which he was testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">When a trial judge\u2019s credibility finding is based on his or her decision to credit the testimony of a witness who \u201chas told a coherent and facially plausible story that is not contradicted by extrinsic evidence, that finding, if not internally inconsistent, can virtually never be clear error.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 575, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985). Cirineo does not challenge either the plausibility or the consistency of Lama\u2019s testimony regarding drug quantity, and he points to no evidence contradicting that testimony. Accordingly, the District Court did not err, much less clearly err, by crediting Lama\u2019s testimony for purposes of determining the exact quantity of drugs attributable to Cirineo.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is hereby Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
