In a brief filed pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Edwards\u2019 attorney challenges the length of Edwards\u2019 revocation sentence. Edwards was apprised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-22\">We have thoroughly reviewed the record on appeal, including the nature and extent of Edwards\u2019 violations of his supervised release and the transcript of the revocation hearing. We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in revoking Edwards\u2019 supervised release based on his admissions at the revocation hearing. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642-43 (4th Cir.1995). Hence, because the district court was presented with and explicitly considered the suggested sentencing range of <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 7B1.4 (2002), and the statutory maximum sentence of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583 (2000), we find no error in Edwards\u2019 sentence. <em>See Davis, </em>53 F.3d at 642-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Edwards\u2019 sentence. Further, this court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
