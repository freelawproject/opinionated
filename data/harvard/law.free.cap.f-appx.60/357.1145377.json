We reserve decision on the motion for certification and the plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Defendants-appellants-cross-appellees the New York City Police Department (\u201cthe City\u201d) and Anthony DiPalma appeal from the district court\u2019s August 28, 2001 order denying their motion for a new trial after a jury verdict of $400,000 compensatory damages against both defendants and $1 million in punitive damages against the City on plaintiff Alii Katt\u2019s claim of a hostile work environment in violation of federal, state and city law. The defendants argue on appeal that the district court abused its discretion in admitting certain evidence and that therefore a new trial is required. Katt cross-appeals, challenging the same district court order, which vacated the award of punitive damages against the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">The standard for granting a new trial because of a district court\u2019s abuse of discretion is a demanding one, \u201c[a] new trial is warranted if the court\u2019s abuse of discretion clearly prejudiced the outcome of the trial. We will grant a new trial only if we are convinced that the jury has reached a seriously erroneous result or that the verdict is a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Annis v. County of Westchester, </em>136 F.3d 239, 247 (2d Cir.1998) (granting a new trial because of the admission of prejudicial testimony). Additionally, the trial court \u201chas wide discretion in controlling the admissibility of testimony and other evidence, and absent a demonstration of abuse of discretion, its rulings will not be disturbed.\u201d <em>Zahra v. Town of Southold, </em>48 F.3d 674, 686 (2d Cir.1995); <em>see also United States v. DiDomenico, </em>985 F.2d 1159, 1163 (2d Cir.1993) (appellate court will only reverse district court\u2019s determination on expert testimony if \u201cmanifestly erroneous\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">Defendants argue that Dr. Stephen Leinen\u2019s testimony was inappropriately let in because he was insufficiently qualified as an expert and the unfair prejudicial effect of his testimony outweighed its probative value. Defendants also assert the district court abused its discretion when it allowed certain questions to be asked of defendant DiPalma. We disagree, and affirm the judgment of the District Court regarding the grant of a new trial for substantially the same reasons as stated in the opinion of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">We reserve decision on plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeal and the defendants\u2019 motion to certify, both of which concern the question of whether punitive damages are available against the City under the New York City Human Rights Law. We will dispose of that portion of the appeal in a separate opinion to be filed at a later date.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED in part. We reserve decision on the motion for certification and plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
