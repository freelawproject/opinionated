Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co., </em>535 U.S. 722, 122 S.Ct. 1831, 152 L.Ed.2d 944 (2002) (Festo II\u201d), which vacated this court\u2019s earlier decision in <em>Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co., </em>234 F.3d 558, 56 USPQ2d 1865 (2000) (en banc) <em>(\u201cFesto </em>I\u201d). <em>See Intermatic Inc. v. Lamson &amp; Sessions Co., </em>___ U.S. ___, 123 S.Ct. 549, 154 L.Ed.2d 423 (2002). We then recalled the mandate issued by this court following our December 17, 2001 decision, reported as <em>Intermatic Inc. v. Lamson &amp; Sessions Co., </em>273 F.3d 1355, 61 USPQ2d 1075 (Fed.Cir.2001) <em>(\u201cIntermatic III\u201d), </em>and ordered briefing on the application of <em>Festo II </em>to the prosecution history estoppel issues presented by these cases. <em>See Intermatic Inc. v. Lamson &amp; Sessions Co., </em>55 Fed.Appx. 544 (Fed.Cir.2003) (order).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-26\">In the first action in the district court <em>{Intermatic </em>I), the jury awarded the patentee Intermatic damages for infringement under the doctrine of equivalents by Lamson\u2019s \u201cribbed\u201d product, and the court denied Lamson\u2019s post-trial motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>judgment as a matter of law seeking to overturn the jury\u2019s verdict on the grounds that Intermatic\u2019s evidence of equivalence was insufficient and that prosecution history estoppel precluded Intermatic\u2019s equivalence claim. We reversed the infringement verdict, invoking the ride of our intervening <em>Festo I </em>decision that any narrowing amendment completely bars the patentee from asserting infringement under the doctrine of equivalents as to the narrowed claim limitation, without reaching any of Lamson\u2019s other arguments advanced on appeal as to why Intermatic\u2019s equivalence claim should not stand. <em>Intermatic III, </em>273 F.3d at 1366, 61 USPQ2d at 1083.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">In the second action in the district court <em>(Intermatic II), </em>the court granted summary judgment that Lamson\u2019s \u201cribless\u201d product does not infringe Intermatic\u2019s patent either literally or under the doctrine of equivalents. The basis for the court\u2019s decision on the equivalence issue was that the prosecution history estopped Intermatic from asserting equivalence. We affirmed, again relying on the complete bar of <em>Festo I, </em>without reaching any of Lam-son\u2019s other arguments advanced on appeal as to why Intermatic\u2019s equivalence assertion must fail. <em>Id. </em>at 1368, 273 F.3d 1355, 61 USPQ2d at 1084.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Because <em>Festo II </em>has established a new framework for analyzing prosecution history estoppel different from that employed by both the district court and this court in our earlier opinion, and because the district court has not evaluated Lamson\u2019s other arguments advanced on appeal as to why Intermatic cannot avail itself of the doctrine of equivalents, we hereby (1) vacate our earlier <em>Intermatic III </em>decision; (2) vacate the district court\u2019s decisions <em>{Intermatic I </em>and <em>Intermatic II); </em>and (3) remand for further proceedings in the district court, which, <em>inter alia, </em>should apply the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Festo II </em>criteria on the questions of prosecution history estoppel, if appropriate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
