Hill, proceeding pro se, appeals several district court orders denying his motions for relief from the court\u2019s orders of forfeiture in favor of the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>in suits filed by the United States pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955(d). This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">On June 29, 1994, the United States (\u201cgovernment\u201d) filed complaints for forfeiture in rem against several properties in which Hill possessed an ownership interest. The complaints alleged that five properties known as the \u201cChar House,\u201d the \u201c411 Grin.\u201d \u201cWoods Truck Stop.\u201d \u201cDick\u2019s Varsity Restaurant and Arcade,\u201d and the \u201cSouthfork Restaurant\u201d were used to commit and to facilitate illegal gambling. The civil forfeiture complaint followed Hill\u2019s criminal convictions for various money laundering and illegal gambling offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Both the government and Hill filed motions for summary judgment. On February 28, 2001, the district court granted the government\u2019s motions, denied Hill\u2019s motions, and ordered the properties forfeited to the government. The district court subsequently denied Hill\u2019s motion \u201cfor leave to respond and answer out-of-time to summary judgment and/or default judgment.\u201d On appeal, this court affirmed the district court\u2019s orders of forfeiture and subsequently denied Hill\u2019s petition for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">On April 9, 2002, Hill filed motions \u201cfor return of property pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 41(e) and relief under F.R.C.P. 60(b).\u201d The district court denied Hill\u2019s motions on May 9, 2002. Hill has filed a timely appeal. The government has filed a motion for sanctions pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 38, to which Hill has responded. Hill has filed a motion to remand to the district court for further proceedings. The government filed a response to the motion to remand and Hill filed a reply to the government\u2019s response.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>Cincinnati Ins. Co. v. Byers, </em>151 F.3d 574, 578 (6th Cir.1998); <em>Good v. Ohio Edison Co., </em>149 F.3d 413, 423 (6th Cir.1998). An appeal from an order denying a Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion does not bring up for review the underlying judgment disposing of the complaint. <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 263 n. 7, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978); <em>Hood v. Hood, </em>59 F.3d 40, 42 (6th Cir.1995). Rather, this court\u2019s inquiry is limited to \u201cwhether one of the specified circumstances exists in which [the plaintiff] is entitled to reopen the merits of his underlying claims.\u201d <em>Feathers v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., </em>141 F.3d 264, 268 (6th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Hill's post-judgment motion for relief from judgment under Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b)(4). Hill\u2019s post-judgment motion is essentially an attempt to belatedly assert an affirmative defense to the government\u2019s forfeiture complaints. As an affirmative defense, however, the statute of limitations has been waived due to Hill\u2019s failure to assert it during the prior proceedings. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(c); <em>Haskell v. Washington Township, </em>864 F.2d 1266, 1273 (6th Cir.1988). Hill\u2019s post-judgment motion is also an attempt to challenge the underlying order of forfeiture. However, Hill may not challenge the district court\u2019s order pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b), as Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) may not be used as a vehicle to challenge the underlying order disposing of the complaint. <em>See Browder, </em>434 U.S. at 263 n. 7, 98 S.Ct. 556; <em>Hood, </em>59 F.3d at 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">The district court\u2019s denial of Hill\u2019s motion for relief is affirmed and Hill\u2019s motion to remand this case to the district court for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>further proceedings is denied. The government\u2019s motion for sanctions is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
