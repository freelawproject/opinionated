We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">Martinez\u2019s only issues on appeal are two allegations of prosecutorial misconduct. \u201cThe test for reversible prosecutorial misconduct generally has two components: that (1) the prosecutor\u2019s remarks and conduct must in fact have been improper, and (2) such remarks or conduct must have prejudicially affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights so as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Golding, </em>168 F.3d 700, 702 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">Martinez\u2019s first claim is that the Government deceived him regarding whether Martinez\u2019s post-theft trip to hide the stolen trailer would be an issue at trial. The record is clear that it is Martinez who made it an issue. Therefore, the prosecutor\u2019s conduct was not improper, and even if it was, Mart\u00ednez suffered no unfair prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">Martinez\u2019s second claim is that the Government breached an agreement not to mention Martinez\u2019s arrest on state charges arising from the same theft. Even assuming, as the district court did, that the Government in fact breached an agreement, Martinez cannot make the requisite showing of prejudice, especially in light of the court\u2019s strong curative instruction. <em>See United States v. Scheetz, </em>293 F.3d 175, 186 (4th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-14\">Accordingly, we affirm Martinez\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
