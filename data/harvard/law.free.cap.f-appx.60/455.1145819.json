His attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that there are no meritorious issues for appeal but raising the issue of whether the district court abused its discretion in sentencing Hernandez-Juarez to the high end of the sentencing guidelines range. Although notified by both this court and his attorney of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, Hernandez-Juarez failed to file such a brief. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">The district court adopted Hernandez-Juarez\u2019s presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d), which properly calculated both Hernandez-Juarez\u2019s base offense level and his criminal history. The PSR calculated a sentencing guidelines range of 77-96 months, and the court sentenced Hernandez-Juarez to a 95-month term of imprisonment. A defendant may not challenge on appeal the district court\u2019s discretionary decision to impose sentence at a particular point within a properly calculated guidelines range. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>18 F.3d 1145, 1151 (4th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Porter, </em>909 F.2d 789, 794-95 (4th Cir.1990). Hernandez-Juarez\u2019s claim that the district court abused its discretion in sentencing him to a 95-month term of imprisonment thus fails. Hernandez-Juarez raises no other issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-12\">We have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Hernandez-Juarez\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
