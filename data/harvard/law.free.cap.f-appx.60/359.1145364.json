The court sentenced Flores-Martinez to, among other things, 70 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>months of imprisonment. On appeal, Flores-Martinez argues that the district court erred by failing to grant his motion for a downward departure on the ground that his criminal history category substantially over-represented the seriousness of his criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">\u201cIt is well established in this Circuit that a court\u2019s decision not to depart from the Guidelines is ... not appealable ... [unless] the defendant shows that a violation of law occurred, that the Guidelines were misapplied, or that the refusal to depart was based on the sentencing court\u2019s mistaken conclusion that it lacked the authority to depart.\u201d <em>United States v. Lainez-Leiva, </em>129 F.3d 89, 93 (2d Cir.1997) (per curiam) (internal citations, quotations, and punctuation omitted). Flores-Martinez argues that the last of these exceptions applies, but he has not pointed to anything in the record that demonstrates that the district court failed to apprehend its authority to depart downward. At most, he argues that the district court erred because \u201cthere was no statement by the court to indicate that the court understood the extent of its authority to depart on the grounds of [Flores-Martinez\u2019s] demonstrated diminished capacity.\u201d But \u201ca district court\u2019s silence concerning its refusal to depart downward does not support an inference that the district court misapprehended its scope of authority.\u201d <em>United States v. Lawal, </em>17 F.3d 560, 563 (2d Cir.1994). Although Flores-Martinez relies heavily on <em>United States v. Silleg, </em>311 F.3d 557 (2d Cir.2002), that case is readily distinguishable. In <em>Silleg </em>the district court made statements during the sentencing hearing that indicated that it did not believe it had the authority to grant a downward departure. Therefore, Flores-Martinez has failed to establish that the district court \u201cmistaken[ly] concluded] that it lacked the authority to depart.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">We have considered all of Flores-Martinez\u2019s arguments and find them meritless. Since this case presents none of the exceptions to the rule that decisions not to depart from the Guidelines are not renewable, the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
