R.App. P. 34(a)(2)(c). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-14\">Calvin Barnett, a state prisoner proceeding pro se, appeals the dismissal without prejudice of his \u201cPetition in Error.\u201d Mr. Barnett also seeks to proceed in forma pauperis. The magistrate judge determined it was without subject matter jurisdiction to adjudge Mr. Barnett\u2019s petition and recommended dismissal without prejudice. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-16\">After the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed Mr. Barnett\u2019s conviction, Mr. Barnett sought state postconviction relief. His action in Oklahoma district court was unsuccessful, and Mr. Barnett sought a writ of mandamus from the OCCA. Mr. Barnett argued to the OCCA that the Oklahoma district court did not timely send him a copy of the order denying postconviction relief, thus barring him from appealing the denial to the OCCA. The OCCA concluded that Mr. Barnett should seek relief before the Oklahoma district court before requesting relief from the OCCA. In Mr. Barnett\u2019s \u201cPetition in Error,\u201d he challenges the OCCA\u2019s Order Denying Extraordinary Relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-17\">In his appeal, Mr. Barnett also raises various challenges regarding the retroactivity of amendments to Oklahoma\u2019s parole statutes. Although Mr. Barnett might properly bring an action involving these challenges pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, he has not done so here. The magistrate judge was correct when he concluded the federal district court lacked jurisdiction over Mr. Barnett\u2019s challenge to a state court proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-18\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the dismissal without prejudice of Mr. Barnett\u2019s petition and DENY Mr. Barnett\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis. We note that the district court and our court have docketed this matter as a petition brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, and we direct that the docket shall be amended to reflect Mr. Barnett was merely proceeding before the improper court in this matter. Should Mr. Barnett file a timely \u00a7 2254 motion regarding this conviction, it should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>treated as a second or successive petition based on the proceedings in this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b805-15\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
