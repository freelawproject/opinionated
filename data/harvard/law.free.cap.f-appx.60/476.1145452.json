Engle appeals his conviction and 120 month sentence for conspiracy to distribute dilaudid, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (2000). On appeal, Engle argues that under Fed.R.Evid. 609(b), the district court erred in excluding evidence of a Government witness\u2019 1987 conviction for drug crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-22\">We review this claim for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Carter, </em>300 F.3d 415, 423 (4th Cir.2002). Engle\u2019s claim is meritless. Engle cannot establish that, under Fed.R.Evid. 609, the district court abused its discretion by excluding evidence of the Government witness\u2019s 1987 conviction, because he cannot establish the evidence\u2019s probative value in undermining the Government witness\u2019s credibility substantially outweighed its prejudicial effect. Fed.R.Evid. 609(b); <em>United States v. Beahm, </em>664 F.2d 414, 418 (4th Cir.1981); <em>United States v. Cavender, </em>578 F.2d 528, 531 (4th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-23\">Accordingly, we affirm Engle\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not significantly aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
