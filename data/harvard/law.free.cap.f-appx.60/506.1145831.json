In criminal cases, the defendant must file his notice of appeal within ten days of the entry of judgment. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A); <em>United States v. Alvarez, </em>210 F.3d 309, 310 (5th Cir.2000) (holding that ten-day appeal period applies to \u00a7 3582 proceedings). With or without a motion, the district court may grant an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>extension of time to file of up to thirty days upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause. Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(4); <em>United States v. Reyes, </em>759 F.2d 351, 353 (4th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The district court entered its order on January 31, 2003. Thus, the ten-day appeal period expired on February 14. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 26 (providing that \u201cintermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays\u201d are excluded when the time period is less than eleven days). Norris filed his notice of appeal on February 21 \u2014 after the expiration of the appeal period but within the thirty-day excusable neglect period. Because Norris\u2019 notice of appeal was filed within the excusable neglect period, we remand the case to the district court for the court to determine whether Norris has shown excusable neglect or good cause warranting an extension of the ten-day appeal period. The record, as supplemented, will then be returned to this court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">\n<em>REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
