An appeal may not be taken from the final order denying a motion under \u00a7 2255 unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue for claims addressed by a district court on the merits absent \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>\u00a7 2258(c)(2) (2000). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude that Terrell has not made the requisite showing. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 1039-40, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
