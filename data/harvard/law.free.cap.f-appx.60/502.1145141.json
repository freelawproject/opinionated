Weddle appeals his convictions for making false statements and misuse of Social Security numbers in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (2000), and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 408(a)(4), 408(a)(7)(B) (2000). On appeal, Weddle claims there is insufficient evidence to support his convictions. We have reviewed those portions of the transcript submitted to the court and conclude otherwise. Weddle\u2019s submission of multiple false Social Security numbers, his willful deception regarding his incarceration at the Russell County Jail, and his false statement regarding his status as a convicted felon are all indicative of his fraudulent intent, the essential element he claims is lacking in the Government\u2019s evidence. Accordingly, we conclude, there is sufficient evidence for a reasonable trier of fact to find Weddle guilty of the charged offenses. <em>See United States v. Lomax, </em>293 F.3d 701, 705 (4th Cir.2002). We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
