Masiarczyk, Jr., seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his motion filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). An appeal may not be taken to this court from the final order in a motion under \u00a7 2255 unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appeal-ability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1) (2000). A certificate of appealability will not issue for claims addressed by a district court on the merits absent \u201ca substantial showing of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2) (2000). As to claims dismissed by a district court solely on procedural grounds, a certificate of appealability \u25a0will not issue unless the petitioner can demonstrate both \u201c(1) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right\u2019 and (2) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rose v. </em>Lee, 252 F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)). We have independently reviewed the record and conclude Masiarczyk has not made the requisite showing. <em>See Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 1039-40, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c) (2000). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
