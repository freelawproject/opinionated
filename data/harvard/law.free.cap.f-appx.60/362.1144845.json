Section 1983 when it took certain actions with respect to a checking account he opened at the bank. Specifically, Nobrega alleges that the bank acted illegally when it placed a \u201chold\u201d on two checks he deposited in the account, and when it subsequently closed the account. After discovery, the District Court granted the bank\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-21\">We review a grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Marvel Characters, Inc. v. Simon, </em>310 F.3d 280, 285 (2d Cir.2002). In addition, Nobrega\u2019s status as a pro se litigant means that we must hold his allegations to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by an attorney. <em>See Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972) (per curiam). Even under this lenient standard, however, we affirm the District Court in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-22\">First, Nobrega\u2019s claim fails as a matter of law because liability under Section 1983 only applies to actions taken by government entities or employees, or by private entities or individuals when such actions may fairly be said to have been taken at the behest of the State. <em>See Lugar v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number><em>Edmondson, </em>457 U.S. 922, 937, 102 S.Ct. 2744, 73 L.Ed.2d 482 (1982). Nobrega presents no evidence that the actions of the bank of which he complains can be attributed to the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Second, even assuming that Nobrega can state some federal law claim, we are convinced of the correctness of the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the bank\u2019s actions were proper. The undisputed evidence shows that the bank was well within in rights when it withheld crediting the two</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">checks to his account and that it gave Nobrega proper notice that his checking account was being closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
