Christian petitions for a writ of mandamus, alleging the district court has unduly delayed acting on numerous motions and objections concerning his civil rights action against the City of Greenville, South Carolina. He seeks an order from this court directing the district court to act. Because there has been recent significant action in the case, we find there has been no undue delay in the district court. We therefore deny this petition without prejudice. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"Atrs\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
