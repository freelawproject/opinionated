Burnett guilty of possessing a firearm on June 1, 2001, after having been convicted of three felonies, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) and punishable under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). The district court<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> sentenced Burnett to 327 months imprisonment and five years supervised release. On appeal, counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and Burnett has submitted several pro se filings.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">We conclude the evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict. Burnett stipulated to having one or more earlier felony convictions, and police officers and another witness testified Burnett possessed a firearm on June 1. <em>See United States v. Stroh, </em>176 F.3d 439, 440 (8th Cir.1999) (sufficieney-of-evidence standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">We reject the points counsel raises. First, the court properly allowed a witness to testify Burnett had previously stabbed and threatened him, because the testimony was relevant to Burnett\u2019s motive and intent to possess a firearm near the witness\u2019s residence. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 404(b); <em>United States v. Burks, </em>934 F.2d 148, 151 (8th Cir.1991) (prior-bad-act evidence). Second, Burnett\u2019s offense level was supported by testimony showing he fired a gun outside the witness\u2019s residence and later pointed the gun at an officer. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) (level 34 for possessing firearm in connection with crime of violence). Third, Burnett\u2019s earlier conviction for second-degree burglary of a restaurant was a violent felony under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). <em>Cf. United States v. Hascall, </em>76 F.3d 902, 904 (8th Cir.) (second-degree burglary of commercial building \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d; noting quoted language is identical in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 (crime of violence) and \u00a7 924(e) (violent felony)), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 U.S. 948, 117 S.Ct. 358, 136 L.Ed.2d 250 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-12\">Having reviewed the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues. We affirm the district court and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. We also deny Burnett\u2019s motions-which seek to obtain or present evidence, and assert counsel failed to pursue witnesses and physical evidence-as they would be more properly pursued in other proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b672-9\"> The Honorable Jean C.
