After his death in 1997, his wife petitioned for modification based on alleged factual errors. The Benefits Review Board (BRB) affirmed the denial of benefits because the factual errors were harmless and because substantial evidence established that Kaneshiro\u2019s illness was not related to his employment. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">The Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (LHWCA), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-50 (as extended by the Defense Base Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1651-54), provides the statutory mechanism by which covered employees are entitled to compensation for work-related injury. <em>See Todd Shipyards Corp. v. Director, OWCP, </em>139 F.3d 1309, 1311-12 (9th Cir.1998). The LHWCA specifically creates a presumption in favor of benefits for an injured employee by \u201cproviding that a claimant\u2019s injury is presumed to be covered by the Act.... \u201d <em>See Ramey v. Stevedoring Servs. of Am., </em>134 F.3d 954, 959 (9th Cir.1998) (citing 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 920(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">The issue here is whether Kaneshiro\u2019s employer overcame this statutory presumption by submitting \u201cevidence specific and comprehensive enough to sever the potential connection between the disability and the work environment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted). An administrative law judge (ALJ) found that the evidence \u201coverwhelmingly indicates there was very little chance or possibility that Mr. Kaneshiro\u2019s disease was caused by his exposure to radiation through his employment.\u201d The BRB concluded that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision. Our task is to review the BRB\u2019s decision for \u201cerrors of law and adherence to the substantial evidence standard.\u201d <em>See Sestich v. Long Beach Container Terminal, </em>289 F.3d 1157, 1159 (9th Cir.2002) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">As a preliminary matter, we reject the employer\u2019s contention that the motion for modification was not timely. The LHWCA permits a party to seek modification of a decision \u201cat any time prior to one year after the rejection of a claim.\u201d <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 922. The BRB in this case reasonably interpreted \u201crejection of a claim\u201d to mean the BRB\u2019s final decision. <em>See Stevedoring Servs. of Am. v. Director, OWCP, </em>297 F.3d 797, 801 (9th Cir.2002) (noting that court must respect the BRB\u2019s interpretation of the statute where such interpretation is reasonable). The employer also contends that the motion improperly sought to review legal rather than factual determinations. The record indicates, however, that the ALJ carefully limited his review to the alleged \u201cmistakes of fact\u201d and specifically noted that \u201ca party should not be allowed to attempt to retry a case through the modification procedures.\u201d Finally, the employer contends that the ALJ should not have permitted the modification procedure at all. We have noted, however, that \u201c[t]he ALJ has broad discretion under section 922 to correct mistakes of fact, whether demonstrated by wholly new evidence, cumulative evidence, or merely further reflection on the evidence initially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>submitted.\u201d <em>See E.P. Paup Co. v. Director, OWCP, </em>999 F.2d 1341, 1347 n. 1 (9th Cir.1993) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">On the merits, Marie Kaneshiro generally challenges the finding that her husband\u2019s illness was not employment-related. Her specific objection, however, appears to be to the ALJ\u2019s finding regarding the amount of radiation that her husband received. Although Marie Kaneshiro offered expert testimony that her husband may have been exposed to as much as fifteen rem of radiation and that such a level of exposure could cause CGL, the ALJ credited the employer\u2019s experts, one who explained that Kaneshiro\u2019s \u201clatent period\u201d was too long for his CGL to have been caused by the occupational exposure, and another who concluded that even at an exposure of fifteen rem, \u201cit is highly improbable, or less than one percent chance that Mr. Kaneshiro\u2019s CGL was the result of his exposure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">We agree with the BRB that the ALJ \u201crationally credited the medical opinions of record that conclude that decedent\u2019s CGL was not related to radiation exposure during the course of decedent\u2019s employment with employer.\u201d It is the function and responsibility of the ALJ to weigh the evidence and, if necessary, \u201cto credit one witness\u2019s testimony over that of another.\u201d <em>See Duhagon v. Metropolitan Stevedore Co., </em>169 F.3d 615, 618 (9th Cir.1999) (per curiam). \u201c[0]ur task is not to reweigh the evidence, but only to determine if substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s findings.\u201d <em>Lockheed Shipbuilding v. Director, OWCP, </em>951 F.2d 1143, 1146 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b112-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
