(\u201cChautauqua\u201d) to suspend service to Lancaster. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-27\">This appeal arises out of Lancaster\u2019s objections to the DOT\u2019s Order to Show Cause why it should not allow Chautauqua to suspend service. Chautauqua itself is not a party to the appeal; its ability to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>suspend service has been brought into issue solely by Lancaster. Lancaster has standing to pursue this appeal pursuant to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46110(a) as a \u201cperson disclosing a substantial interest\u201d in the order. We have jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 46110(a) as \u201cthe court of appeals of the United States for the circuit in which [Lancaster] resides or has its principal place of business.\u201d We must defer to the DOT\u2019s interpretation of the statute it is charged with administering if it is \u201ca permissible construction of the statute,\u201d <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, </em>467 U.S. 837, 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). We review the DOT\u2019s factual findings for substantial evidence, \u00a7 46110(c), and its final decision not to award the subsidy for abuse of discretion. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">As we write solely for the parties, our recitation of the facts will be brief. On January 31, 2002, as required by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 41734, Chautauqua filed a 90-day notice of its intention to suspend service at Lancaster on May 1, 2002. Chautauqua indicated that it would not suspend service if it received an EAS subsidy. In March 2002, the DOT issued an Order to Show Cause tentatively allowing Chautauqua to suspend service. Lancaster filed objections to the notice, requesting that Chautauqua be prohibited from terminating service and given an EAS subsidy. In April 2002, the DOT issued a Final Order terminating Lancaster\u2019s subsidy eligibility and allowing Chautauqua to suspend service. Lancaster appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">Under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 41731 et seq., an airport is entitled to an EAS subsidy if it is an \u201celigible place.\u201d An airport is an \u201celigible place\u201d if it was an \u201celigible point\u201d before October 1, 1988, received scheduled air transportation after January 1, 1990, and is not listed as ineligible. In its 2000 Appropriations Act, Congress created an exception to the automatic grant of subsidies to eligible places: \u201cHereafter, notwithstanding 49 U.S.C. 41742 [providing funds for EAS subsidies], no essential air service subsidies shall be provided to communities in the 48 contiguous states that are located fewer than 70 highway miles from the nearest large or medium hub airport.\u201d P.L. 106-69, Section 332. The next year, Congress passed the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (\u201cAIR 21\u201d), P.L. 106-181, including a section slightly backtracking on this exception that stated: \u201cThe Secretary <em>may </em>provide assistance under [49 U.S.C. 41731] with respect to a place that is located within 70 highway miles of a hub airport ... if the most commonly used highway route between the place and the hub airport exceeds 70 miles.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Section 205 (emphasis added). Taken together, these regulations prohibit the DOT from granting subsidies to airports within 70 highway miles of a large or medium hub airport, but give the DOT discretion to grant a subsidy to an airport that is more than 70 miles from a hub along the most commonly used highway route.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">In its final order, the DOT determined that Lancaster was not eligible for an EAS subsidy because 1) under section 332\u2019s prohibition, Lancaster was within 70 miles of Philadelphia International Airport (\u201cPHL\u201d), as determined by the Department\u2019s Federal Highway Administration measurements; and 2) even if section 205\u2019s exception to the prohibition applied and the \u201cmost commonly used highway route\u201d to PHL exceeded 70 miles, it was within the Secretary\u2019s discretion to deny the subsidy because of the proximity of alternative airports, namely, Baltimore-Washington International Airport (75 miles), and Harrisburg International Airport (30 miles).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>Lancaster objects to the DOT\u2019s order on two grounds: 1) a lack of substantial evidence and abuse of discretion in refusing to consider the \u201cmost commonly used highway route\u201d between Lancaster and PHL; and 2) abuse of discretion in considering Lancaster\u2019s proximity to BWI and Harrisburg airport. In essence, Lancaster argues that the DOT should have granted a subsidy because Lancaster is an eligible place under \u00a7 41731, and the most commonly used highway route between the airport and a hub airport exceeds 70 miles. Lancaster argues that section 205 is not \u201cmerely precatory\u201d and that DOT\u2019s interpretation of section 205 as giving it discretion to look at other, unlisted factors in determining whether to grant a subsidy is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">Lancaster\u2019s arguments must fail. First, substantial evidence supports the DOT\u2019s finding that, under section 332, Lancaster is not entitled to an EAS subsidy because it is less than 70 highway miles from PHL. On appeal, Lancaster does not dispute this measurement. Second, the DOT\u2019s interpretation of section 205 (as giving it discretion to grant a subsidy if the most commonly used highway route between the airport and a hub airport exceeds 70 miles) is a permissible view of section 205\u2019s language, which states that \u201cthe Secretary <em>may\u201d </em>grant a subsidy under those circumstances, but does not compel the subsidy. Our standard of review is limited to determining whether the DOT\u2019s interpretation of Section 205 is permissible; it clearly is.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">Further, Lancaster\u2019s arguments that the DOT\u2019s order was an abuse of discretion under section 205 are unavailing. Our review of an administrative agency\u2019s determination is extremely deferential, as the agency is best able to take into account the many factors that affect its decisions. Lancaster argues that \u00a7 41731(b) limits the DOT from denying subsidies on a basis that is not specifically stated, and that the proximity of other airports is not a stated basis. Lancaster thus contends that the DOT abused its discretion by denying a subsidy based on the proximity of BWI and Harrisburg. However, \u00a7 41731(b) does not apply in the way Lancaster urges, as it only limits a finding that a place is not an \u201celigible place.\u201d The DOT does not dispute that Lancaster is an eligible place. Rather, it determined that <em>notwithstanding </em>that fact, under section 205, the grant of a subsidy was discretionary, and Lancaster was not entitled to a discretionary subsidy because the Lancaster community was already well-served by airports in the area. In making that determination, the DOT did not abuse its discretion in taking BWI and Harrisburg into account. The proximity of other airports is a relevant and permissible factor that may be examined in determining whether a community is adequately connected to the air transportation system.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">Lancaster also cites to the Air Transportation and System Stabilization Act (\u201cATS-SA\u201d), P.L. 107-42, passed in the aftermath of September 11, 2001, and argues that Congress intended to fund EAS subsidies to ensure continued service to small communities such as Lancaster. Section 105 of the ATSSA states: \u201cThe Secretary of Transportation should take appropriate action to ensure that all communities that had scheduled air service before September 11, 2001, continue to receive adequate air transportation service and that essential air service to small communities continues without interruption.\u201d The DOT did not specifically address the ATSSA in its order because Lancaster did not raise this argument in its objections. As the DOT noted at oral argument, however, the ATSSA is aspirational, not mandatory, and did not strip the DOT of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>We conclude that, since Congress clearly-intended to leave the final decision regarding EAS subsidies to the Secretary, the DOT is in the best position to prioritize its resources and must consider the interests and needs of disparate communities around the country. Administrative expertise is the reason we have <em>Chevron </em>deference; it is not our role to second-guess the DOT\u2019s discretionary determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the DOT\u2019s order denying Lancaster an EAS subsidy and allowing Chautauqua Airlines to suspend service.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
