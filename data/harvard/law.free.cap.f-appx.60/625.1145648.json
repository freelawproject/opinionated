Robinson challenges his conviction on two grounds: (1) that the district court violated the dictates of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), by failing to instruct the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Robinson distributed the quantity of crack cocaine alleged in the indictments; and (2) that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he was the one who distributed the crack cocaine. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Background</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">Robinson\u2019s conviction arose from two crack cocaine transactions with an informant under the direction of the now defunct Chicago Housing Authority Police Department (\u201cCHAPD\u201d) in August 1997. That year the CHAPD, in conjunction with federal law enforcement agencies, investigated a crack enterprise operating at the LeClaire Courts public housing complex. CHAPD sergeant John Hersey supervised the investigation. To assist with the investigation, the CHAPD employed a twice-convicted crack dealer and former Le-Claire resident named Anthony Clemmons. In August 1997 the CHAPD targeted Robinson, and asked Clemmons, who had known Robinson for several years as \u201cSugar,\u201d to buy crack from him. Clemmons, wearing a body wire and accompanied by an undercover CHAPD officer, Charles Mitchell, purchased an ounce (approximately 28 grams) of crack from Robinson on August 11 and 13. Clemmons was paid $600 for each transaction along with relocation and moving expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">In April 1998 a grand jury returned indictments charging Robinson with two counts of crack cocaine distribution for the August 11 and 13 transactions. The indictments specifically charged Robinson with knowingly and intentionally distributing \u201capproximately 28 grams\u201d and \u201capproximately 27.7 grams\u201d of crack cocaine respectively. The government filed the indictments a year later in November 1999, and arrested Robinson shortly thereafter. Robinson pleaded not guilty and requested a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">\n<em>A The Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">At trial, Hersey, Mitchell, and Clemmons recounted the two transactions for the jury in detail. Clemmons testified that Robinson was the man who sold him the crack cocaine on each occasion, and Officers Hersey and Mitchell corroborated that identification. Hersey and Mitchell testified that upon returning to the CHAPD headquarters after the August 11 transaction, Mitchell identified Robinson as the man who dealt with Clemmons from an array of five photographs. Both officers made in-court identifications of Robinson as the individual they observed with Clemmons during the two buys. The government\u2019s forensic scientists analyzed and confirmed that the off-white, rocky substances Clemmons purchased weighed 28 grams and 27.7 grams respectively, and contained cocaine base. In addition, the scientists testified that, given its consistency, the cocaine base appeared to be in the form of crack.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">Defense counsel argued that Robinson did not deliver the crack to Clemmons, suggesting instead that the culprit was Robinson\u2019s older brother Deshon. In support of this theory, counsel pointed to inconsistencies between Officer Mitchell\u2019s descriptions of the perpetrator and Robinson\u2019s actual appearance. Officer Mitchell\u2019s written reports immediately following each transaction described Robinson as 5 feet 8 inches tall and 175 pounds, whereas Robinson is 6 feet 2 inches and then weighed 215 pounds. Robinson also presented evidence that his brother Deshon, who lived at the same LeClaire Courts address and sometimes went by the name \u201cSugar,\u201d fit Officer Mitchell\u2019s description. Mitchell explained that he simply copied the descriptive information contained in his written reports from a police index file on Robinson; the man he observed was a bit taller at 5 feet ten inches and a bit heavier at 180 pounds. But Robinson argued that that description did not match his actual appearance either and the photo line-up from which Mitchell allegedly identified Robinson was not presented at trial be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>cause it had been inadvertently destroyed when the CHAPD disbanded in 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">In contradiction of Robinson\u2019s misidentification theory, the <em>government </em>presented the testimony of another Chicago police officer, Brad Redrick. Officer Redrick patrolled the LeClaire Courts community daily during the previous ten-year period and talked to Robinson, whom he identified in the courtroom, in person on more than one hundred occasions. The government asked Redrick to listen to the tape recordings of the Clemmons transactions to determine whether he recognized Robinson\u2019s voice. Robinson testified that he indeed heard Robinson\u2019s voice on the tapes dealing with Clemmons. Redrick testified that he also was familiar with Deshon Robinson, having talked to him probably twenty times. According to Redrick, Deshon\u2019s voice was \u201csqueakier\u201d than Robinson\u2019s, and he did not hear it on any of the recordings. Redrick said that he never knew Deshon to go by the nickname \u201cSugar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">\n<em>B. Jury Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">Without objection from defense counsel, the court accepted the instructions proposed by the government regarding the name, makeup, consistency, and quantity of the drugs sold. The court first instructed the jury that to find Robinson guilty the government must have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he knowingly and intentionally distributed cocaine base. The court advised that the government need not prove that the offense actually involved the amount of cocaine alleged in the indictment; rather, the government must prove merely that a \u201cmeasurable amount\u201d of cocaine base was involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Based on <em>Apprendi, </em>the district court went on to instruct the jury that if it found Robinson guilty, then it must further decide whether the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the form of cocaine base involved in each count was crack cocaine, and that the amount of crack cocaine sold on each occasion was five grams or more. Accordingly, the verdict forms supplied to the jury asked the jury to check one of three boxes. The jury was to check box one if it found beyond a reasonable doubt that \u201cthe form and amount of cocaine base that defendant distributed ... was at least five grams of the form of cocaine base commonly known as crack cocaine;\u201d the jury was to check box two if it found that the defendant distributed a \u201clesser measurable amount\u201d of crack; and the jury was instructed to check box three if it found \u201csome measurable amount\u201d of \u201csome form of cocaine base other than crack\u201d had been distributed by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">The jury found Robinson guilty of both counts and checked box one on both verdict forms. Robinson moved for acquittal or, in the alternative, for a new trial, arguing that the verdicts were against the manifest weight of the evidence and that the court erred in not dismissing the indictments because of the destruction of evidence. The district court denied the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-11\">\n<em>C. Sentencing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b659-12\">Robinson was sentenced in this case in June 2002 to two concurrent 100-month prison terms, followed by 5 years\u2019 supervised release also to run concurrent with each other. The district court arrived at that sentence by first determining by a preponderance of the evidence that Robinson\u2019s two crack cocaine offenses involved a total of 56 grams. Based on that amount, the court assigned a base offense level of 32, which combined with Robinson\u2019s criminal history category of I, yielded a sentencing range of 121 to 151 months. The court then granted Robinson a 3-level <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>downward departure from that range because his commission of these crimes was \u201caberrant behavior,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which lowered his sentencing range to 87 to 108 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">On appeal, Robinson argues for the first time that the district court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury that it must find beyond a reasonable doubt the precise amount of crack cocaine specified in his indictments violated the rule announced by the Supreme Court in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>580 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). In fact, when asked by the court whether he had any objections to the government\u2019s proposed instructions, he confirmed to the court that he had none. Therefore, we review this challenge to the jury instructions for plain error. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>245 F.3d 645, 648 (7th Cir.2001). \u201cUnder the plain error standard, we will not reverse a decision unless the defendant demonstrates that (1) there was error; (2) the error was plain; and (3) the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Trennell, </em>290 F.3d 881, 887 (7th Cir.2002). If these three conditions are satisfied, \u201cwe may correct the error if in our discretion, we find the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 887; <em>accord United States v. Cotton, </em>535 U.S. 625, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 1786, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cOther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.... \u2018[I]t is unconstitutional for a legislature to remove from the jury the assessment of facts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed.\u2019 \u201d 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (quoting <em>Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 252-53, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999)). Accordingly, this court has mandated that the trier of fact must determine the elements of the offense that appear in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a), and the threshold amount listed in \u00a7 841(b) relied upon by the court to establish the maximum statutory penalty; however, this court does not require the trier of fact to determine the precise quantity of drugs in question. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>308 F.3d 726, 740-42 (7th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Bjorkman, </em>270 F.3d 482, 492 (7th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Brough, </em>243 F.3d 1078, 1080 (7th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">Here, the district court more than complied with this mandate by instructing the jury to decide whether the government had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the amount of crack that Robinson distributed exceeded 5 grams.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>found that Robinson indeed distributed 5 grams or more, thus subjecting him to a 40-year maximum penalty. Robinson\u2019s sentence of 8 years and 4 months fell well below the maximum authorized by the jury\u2019s verdict, as well as the statutory maximum sentence for distributing even a minute amount of crack cocaine. We have stated many times that \u201cwhen a defendant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment within the statutory maximum for the crime of which he was convicted, <em>\u2018Apprendi </em>is beside the point.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jones, </em>245 F.3d at 649 (quoting <em>Talbott v. Indiana, </em>226 F.3d 866, 869 (7th Cir.2000)); <em>see also Brough, </em>243 F.3d at 1080 (\u201c[A]ny penalty up to 20 years is lawful even if the jury does not find a particular quantity, because 20 years is the maximum under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) for unlawfully distributing any detectable quantity of any Schedule I or II controlled substance.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Nonetheless, Robinson argues that the court\u2019s instructions, even though he failed to timely object to them anytime during trial, violated his due process and jury trial rights because, without a finding as to the precise amount of crack, it is impossible to discern whether the jury unanimously agreed that the government met its burden of proof. As Robinson\u2019s counsel acknowledged at oral argument, this argument is premised on the untenable view that <em>Apprendi </em>requires that drug quantity be treated an element in \u00a7 841 cases irrespective of the penalty imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">We recently rejected a nearly identical argument, holding that a special verdict form asking the jury to find a threshold amount under \u00a7 841(b)(1), rather than the exact amount alleged in the indictment, satisfied the <em>Apprendi </em>rule. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>308 F.3d 726, 740-42 (7th Cir.2002). In so holding, we reiterated that the law in this circuit is clear: drug quantity is not an element of the offense under \u00a7 841. <em>Id. </em>at 740-41 (\u201cIf drug amount were a true element of \u00a7 841, then a failure by a jury to agree on the drug amount would mean that \u2018there is <em>no offense at all. </em>\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Bjorkman, </em>270 F.3d at 492 (emphasis in original))); <em>Trennell, </em>290 F.3d at 887. As we explained in <em>Bjorkman, \u201cApprendi </em>does not rewrite or change the elements of any federal offense,\u201d rather, it requires only that the jury find beyond a reasonable doubt facts that raise the maximum lawful punishment. 270 F.3d at 491. Contrary to Robinson\u2019s assertion, the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Ring v. Arizona, </em>536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002), does not suggest otherwise. In <em>Ring, </em>the Court merely held that, under <em>Apprendi, </em>additional facts increasing a statutory maximum punishment from life to death must be submitted to the jury and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. 122 S.Ct. at 2439, 2443. The jury instructions given here did not run afoul of either <em>Apprendi </em>or <em>Ring.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b661-11\">Robinson next argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he was the one who distributed the crack cocaine to Clemmons. In particular, he contends that Clemmons\u2019s testimony identifying him was \u201cunreliable\u201d and \u201cuncorroborated.\u201d When reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim, this court considers whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, \u201cany rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>United States v. Crotteau, </em>218 F.3d 826, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>834 (7th Cir.2000). Defendants making such a claim face a \u201cvery high hurdle.\u201d <em>Crotteau, </em>218 F.3d at 834. \u201cReversal is warranted only when the record is devoid of any evidence, regardless of how it is weighed, from which a jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">This court does not reweigh the evidence or reassess the credibility of the witnesses. <em>Id. </em>Yet, that is precisely what Robinson asks this court to do here. Robinson attacks Clemmons\u2019s identification, primarily arguing that he was a paid informant, a convicted drug dealer, and a marijuana addict who admitted to having smoked pot during one of the transactions 'at issue. This court does not second-guess fact-finders\u2019 credibility determinations because they have had the opportunity to observe the verbal and nonverbal behavior of the witnesses including their reactions, responses, expressions, attitudes, tones of voice, eye contact, postures, body movements, and speech patterns. <em>United States v. Mancillas, </em>183 F.3d 682, 701 n. 22 (7th Cir.1999). In contrast, we are merely presented with the cold pages of the record. <em>Id.; see also Churchill v. Waters, </em>977 F.2d 1114, 1124 (7th Cir.1992) (\u201cA witness\u2019s behavior during the trial can very well reveal deception or untruthfulness through evasiveness on the witness stand that is more frequently that not undiscernible in the pages of a deposition.\u201d). Thus, this court will overturn a conviction based on a credibility determination when the witness\u2019s testimony was \u201cincredible as a matter of law.\u201d <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>177 F.3d 628, 630 (7th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Clemmons unequivocally testified that Robinson sold him the crack on August 11 and 13:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-6\">Q: Do you see the person that you know as Sugar in the court room today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-8\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-9\">Q: And is that the person from whom you bought narcotics on August 11 and August 13,1997?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-10\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-11\">[Clemmons identified the defendant in the courtroom.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-12\">Q: Are you certain the person you purchased crack from on August 11 and 13 of \u201997 is William Robinson not Dishon [sic] Robinson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-13\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-14\">True, Clemmons, like many informants in a number of criminal cases, was not a model citizen. We cannot always get nuns, priests, rabbis, ministers, and imams. But the jury heard the evidence of Clemmons\u2019s marijuana use, potential motives, and generally unsavory character, and chose to believe him nonetheless. \u2018When a jury has chosen to credit crucial testimony with full knowledge of the many faults of the witness providing it, we have no basis to interfere.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>177 F.3d at 631.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-15\">In addition, contrary to Robinson\u2019s assertion, there was evidence at trial corroborating Clemmons\u2019s identification. Mitchell, who spoke face-to-face with Robinson after the second buy, identified Robinson in court as the man he observed with Clemmons during both transactions. Hersey likewise identified Robinson as the individual he observed talking to Clemmons during the controlled buys. And, Redrick identified Robinson\u2019s voice on the four tape recordings of the transactions. Robinson, however, contends that Officer Mitchell\u2019s description of Robinson was inconsistent with his actual appearance; the photo lineup was destroyed; neither Hersey or Mitchell observed the drugs change hands; and Officer Redrick\u2019s voice identification was flimsy. These arguments suffer the same fate as his credibility challenge. In weighing the evidence, the jury had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>opportunity to observe the witnesses\u2019 behavior, while this court has only a cold record to review. <em>Mancillas, </em>183 F.3d at 701. Accordingly, \u201c[i]t is the jury\u2019s job to choose among competing but reasonable interpretations of witnesses\u2019 testimony.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>177 F.3d at 631. After the jury, as its duty requires, considered all identification testimony, it chose to convict.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b660-6\">.
