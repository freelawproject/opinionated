His applications were denied initially and on reconsideration. At his request, Lopez was granted a de novo hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-16\">At the hearing, Lopez testified that he worked as a machine operator for eighteen years and was discharged from employment 'in January 1996 because he missed too much work, allegedly due to lower back pain. Lopez testified that he collected unemployment benefits until approximately July 1996; state law requires that a recipient of unemployment benefits be able to work. Lopez\u2019s job involved standing, walking, bending, and lifting between twenty and thirty-five pounds. He has not been engaged in substantial gainful activity since 1996. Lopez also testified that he suffered from back problems, Bell\u2019s Palsy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>and hypertension. He was taking Procardia and Vasotec to control his hypertension. He claimed that his back ailments prohibited him from sitting or standing for longer than ten or fifteen minutes at a time and from lifting objects. Additionally, he testified that he suffered from right hand problems related to his Bell\u2019s Palsy, but said that his hand was still functional. At the time of the hearing, Lopez testified that his day consisted of watching television and walking back and forth between his kitchen and living room and that occasionally he took a short walk outside.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">The ALJ reviewed Lopez\u2019s relevant medical records, including reports from Newark University Hospital\u2019s emergency room and outpatient clinic and Dr. Ahamed, the physician who examined Lopez at the request of the Social Security Administration. Newark University Hospital records showed that Lopez suffered from hypertension, which was treated with medication, and non-acute Bell\u2019s Palsy. The records documented Lopez\u2019s complaints of being unable to blink his right eye, which was treated with artificial tears. Dr. Ahamed concluded that aside from his Bell\u2019s Palsy and hypertension, Lopez\u2019s examination was within the normal range without any positive findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">In proceeding through the required five step analysis prescribed by the regulations, the ALJ found that (step 1) Lopez had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since January 28, 1996, and that (step 2) Lopez had severe impairments of hypertension and low back pain, but that (step 3) neither met or equaled an impairment found in the listings. He also found that Lopez has Bell\u2019s Palsy on his right side, but that impairment is not severe because it does not limit his ability to perform basic work-related functions. The ALJ found that he was not disabled within the Social Security Act at step four of the sequential analysis because his residual functional capacity permitted him to perform medium-level work, which involves lifting no more than fifty pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of objects weighing up to twenty five pounds. Lopez\u2019s past relevant work as a machine operator did not exceed this residual functional capacity. Thus, he concluded that Lopez was capable of returning to his past relevant work and was not disabled under the Act. He noted that Lopez\u2019s statements to the unemployment office \u201ccast serious doubt on his credibility, as he was either able to work or misstated his abilities for financial gain.\u201d App. at 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">Lopez requested the Appeals Council review the decision, claiming that the ALJ\u2019s decision was arbitrary and capricious because he did not give full and fair consideration to evidence in favor of Lopez. However, the Appeals Council concluded that there were no grounds for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-9\">Lopez filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey seeking judicial review of the final decision of the Commissioner under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). In a comprehensive opinion, the District Court held that there was substantial evidence to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision. The District Court noted that Lopez\u2019s ailments appeared to be overstated in light of the medical evidence and that Lopez failed to demonstrate how his ailments precluded him from doing his past relevant work as a machine operator.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-11\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b945-12\">This court\u2019s review of the Commissioner\u2019s final decision is limited to determining whether the decision was supported by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d which is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 564-65, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number><em>Hartranft v. Apfel, </em>181 F.3d 358, 360 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">Lopez must prove that he is disabled under the Social Security Act to obtain benefits. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423 (Supp.2002). \u201cDisability\u201d is defined under the Social Security Act as the \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment ... which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 423(d)(1)(A); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1505(a) (2002). A claimant is unable to engage in substantial gainful activity when \u201chis physical or mental impairment or impairments are of such severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but cannot, considering his age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy....\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">The Commissioner must perform a five-step sequential evaluation process to make disability determinations under the regulations. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.920. If the claimant fails to meet the requirements at any step in the process, the Commissioner may conclude that the claimant is not disabled under the Act. The ALJ must determine, in order: (1) whether the claimant is currently engaged in substantial gainful activity; (2) if not, whether the claimant has a severe impairment; (3) if so, whether claimant\u2019s severe impairment meets or equals the criteria of an impairment listed in 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 1; (4) if not, whether claimant\u2019s impairment prevents him from performing his past relevant work; and (5) if so, whether the claimant can perform any other work which exists in the national economy, in light of his age, education, work experience, and residual functional capacity. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520, 416.920; <em>Sykes v. Apfel, </em>228 F.3d 259, 262-63 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">Claimant has the burden to establish that he is disabled under the Act. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1512. To meet this burden, the claimant must furnish medical and other evidence of the existence of the disability. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(5)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">The ALJ\u2019s decision must be in writing and contain findings of fact and a statement of reasons and support thereof. <em>Cotter v. Harris, </em>642 F.2d 700, 704 (3d Cir.1981). The ALJ must set forth in his decision which evidence he rejects and the evidence he credits. <em>Id. </em>at 705.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-8\">Lopez contends that the ALJ failed to indicate which evidence he accepted and which he rejected so that the reviewing court is unable to tell if significant probative evidence was not credited or simply ignored. However, the ALJ set forth the essential considerations upon which he based his decision. The ALJ\u2019s opinion detailed the opinions and medical evidence on the record. In addition, he took into consideration the subjective testimony of Lopez, and noted that he questioned his credibility because of his inconsistent statements to the unemployment office. Furthermore, the ALJ noted that Lopez\u2019s complaints are not credible in light of the objective medical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">In conclusion, the ALJ\u2019s findings contain the requisite amount of detail for a reviewing court to determine whether the evidence was properly considered. In addition, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision that Lopez is able to return to his past relevant work as a machine operator.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-11\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b946-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
