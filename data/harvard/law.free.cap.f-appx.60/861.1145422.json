McGrath-McKechnie, </em>203 F.Supp.2d 261 (E.D.N.Y. 2002), we recount only those facts that are necessary to understand the disposition of this appeal. Since 1999, the defendants have implemented a suspension and revocation policy, according to which first and second time service refusals by New York City taxi drivers are punished with license suspension or revocation, following a hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 269. The plaintiffs filed suit against the defendants pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that this policy unconstitutionally deprived them of their property. The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment with respect to the suspension and revocation policy. <em>Id. </em>at 290.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiffs appeal. For the reasons given below we conclude that the district court was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-13\">The plaintiffs argue that the suspension and revocation policy violates city regulations which mandate fines, not suspension or revocation, as penalties for first and second time service refusals. Admin. Code \u00a7 19 \u2014 50T(b)(1). We agree with the district court that the city regulations can reasonably be read to permit the imposition of license suspension or revocation \u201cin the alternative to any of the specific penalties set forth.\u201d 35 R.C.N.Y. \u00a7 8-03(b). The plaintiffs further argue that Chairwoman Diane McGrath-McKechnie lacked the authority to implement the policy without the approval of a majority of the Commission. N.Y.C. Charter \u00a7 2301(e). We agree with the district court that the city charter can reasonably be read to grant the Chairwoman power to carry out the regulations on her own. N.Y.C. Charter \u00a7 2301(c). Because a reasonable, though arguably incorrect, interpretation of the city regulations supports the Chairwoman\u2019s actions, these actions were not \u201carbi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>trary or irrational\u201d and therefore do not give rise to a constitutional violation. <em>Interport Pilots Agency, Inc. v. Sammis, </em>14 F.3d 133, 145 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">The plaintiffs further argue that one of the defendants\u2019 alleged statutory bases for the policy is unconstitutionally vague. 35 R.C.N.Y. \u00a7 2-61(a)(2) prohibits taxi drivers from committing any act \u201cwhich is against the best interests of the public.\u201d Considering \u201cthe particular application\u201d of the regulation, as we must in evaluating this vagueness challenge, <em>United States v. Coman, </em>938 F.2d 1553, 1562 (2d Cir.1991), we conclude that in light of 35 R.C.N.Y. \u00a7 2-50(b), which prohibits taxi drivers from unjustifiedly refusing service, the plaintiffs had \u201cfair notice of [the] conduct proscribed ... by the regulation,\u201d <em>Giano v. Senkowski, </em>54 F.3d 1050, 1057 (2d Cir.1995). The regulation as applied therefore survives the vagueness challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b894-11\">. The district court also granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment with respect to their challenge of the defendants' summary suspension policy, pursuant to which the defendants would suspend licenses without a prior hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 282. This aspect of the district court\u2019s decision has not been appealed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
