R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b158-9\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">Johnson &amp; Johnson Finance Corporation (\u201cJJFC\u201d) executed a series of loans in favor of Harold Kavoussi and his surgery clinic, Pomona Valley Eye Surgery Medical Group (\u201cPVES\u201d). Dr. Kavoussi defaulted on those loans and filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief. The bankruptcy court granted one of JJFC\u2019s motions for summary judgment, finding that Dr. Kavoussi\u2019s debt was non-dischargeable under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(B). Dr. Kavoussi appeals the judgment of the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (\u201cBAP\u201d) affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-13\">The bankruptcy court may refuse to discharge a debt if the debtor obtained the loan by \u201cuse of a statement in writing (i) that is materially false; (ii) respecting the debtor\u2019s or an insider\u2019s financial condition; (iii) on which the creditor to whom the debtor is liable for such money, property, services, or credit reasonably relied; and (iv) that the debtor caused to be made or published with intent to deceive.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(B). The Ninth Circuit has restated the elements of \u00a7 523(a)(2)(B) as seven factors: \u201c(1) a representation of fact by the debtor, (2) that was material, (3) that the debtor knew at the time to be false, (4) that the debtor made with the intention of deceiving the creditor, (5) upon which the creditor relied, (6) that the creditors reliance was reasonable, [and] (7) that damage proximately resulted from the representation.\u201d <em>Candland v. Insurance Co. of N. America (In re Candland), </em>90 F.3d 1466, 1469 (9th Cir.1996). The creditor must prove these elements by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Grogan v. Garner, </em>498 U.S. 279, 291, 111 S.Ct. 654, 112 L.Ed.2d 755 (1991). Dr. Kavoussi appeals the bankruptcy court\u2019s determinations that his financial statements contained material misrepresentations; that he had intent to deceive; and that JJFC reasonably relied on his false representations. In addition, he appeals the bankruptcy court\u2019s denial of his motion for a new hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-16\">We independently review the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings on appeal, and affirm its determinations unless they are clearly erroneous. Whether the creditor relied upon false statements, whether there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>intent to defraud, and whether the misrepresentations were material are all issues of fact. <em>Candland, </em>90 F.3d at 1469.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The bankruptcy court did not clearly err in determining that the debt was nondischargeable under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523(a)(2)(B). First, Dr. Kavoussi\u2019s failure to disclose that a loan from his parents for $220,000 was secured by $6.8 million in assets was a material misrepresentation; JJFC submitted affidavits that they would not have tendered the loan had they known that his assets were pledged. <em>See Candland, </em>90 F.3d at 1470 (holding that a statement is materially false if it \u201cwould affect the creditor\u2019s decision[-]making process\u201d). In addition, Dr. Kavoussi\u2019s failure to disclose that his real property had been transferred constituted a material misrepresentation. Dr. Kavoussi\u2019s claim that his failure to reveal the transfer was not a misrepresentation because the deeds were not yet recorded is unavailing. A \u201ctransfer is \u2018made\u2019 under [11 U.S.C.] \u00a7 727(a)(2) on the date the agreement or deed of transfer is executed,\u201d when it is \u201cvalid between the parties to that transfer, irrespective of whether it is valid as against [bona fide purchasers].\u201d <em>Finalco, Inc. v. Roosevelt (In re Roosevelt), </em>87 F.3d 311, 316-17, 318 (9th Cir.1996); <em>see also </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727(a)(2) (\u201cThe court shall grant the debtor a discharge, unless ... the debtor, with intent to hinder ... a creditor ... has transferred ... property of the debtor....\u201d). Moreover, regardless of the rule applied, the fact that JJFC would not have made the loan had they known about the deeds renders the misrepresentation material.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">Second, the totality of the circumstances indicates an intent to deceive. <em>See Tustin Thrift &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. Maldonado (In re Maldonado), </em>228 B.R. 735, 738 (9th Cir. BAP 1999). It is impossible to believe that Dr. Kavoussi\u2019s notation that he owned \u201c100% shares\u201d of his corporations was intended to indicate anything other than that he owned 100% of each corporation. Moreover, Dr. Kavoussi\u2019s failure to reveal to JJFC that all of his assets were pledged to his parents was not mitigated by a reasonable explanation demonstrating good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">Third, JJFC reasonably relied on Dr. Kavoussi\u2019s representations regarding his financial status. \u201cLenders do not have to hire detectives before relying on borrowers\u2019 financial statements.... [W]e have noted that, when there is evidence of materially fraudulent statements, little investigation is required for a creditor to have reasonably relied on the representations.\u201d <em>Gertsch v. Johnson &amp; Johnson Finance Corp. (In re Gertsch), </em>237 B.R. 160, 170 (9th Cir.BAP 1999) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also La Trattoria, Inc. v. Lansford (In re Lansford), </em>822 F.2d 902, 904 (9th Cir.1987) (\u201cHaving intentionally misled the sellers in an area he knew was important to them, it is unseemly for Lansford now to argue that he should be excused from section 523 because the sellers believed him.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">Finally, because Dr. Kavoussi did not appeal to the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel the lower court\u2019s order denying his motion for a new hearing or amend his notice of appeal to include it, we lack jurisdiction to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b158-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
