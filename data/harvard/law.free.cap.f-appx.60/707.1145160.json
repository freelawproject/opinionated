The district court granted summary judgment in Veterans\u2019 favor on the ground that Neil\u2019s death, which was related to autoerotic asphyxiation, fell within the policy\u2019s exclusion for \u201cintentionally self-inflicted injury.\u201d Travis appeals. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">At the time that the district court considered Veterans\u2019 summary judgment motion, no Ninth Circuit or California case law directly addressed the question of whether death related to autoerotic asphyxiation involved \u201cintentionally self-inflicted injury.\u201d Although there continues to be no California case law on the issue, we now have the benefit of this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Padfield v. AIG Life Insurance Co., </em>290 F.3d 1121 (9th Cir.2002). In <em>Pad-field, </em>we concluded that the typical consequences of autoerotic asphyxiation are not \u201cinjuries\u201d and thus recovery for an insured\u2019s death related to autoerotic asphyxiation was not precluded by a policy exclusion for death resulting from \u201cintentionally self-inflicted injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1129-30. We acknowledge that <em>Padfield </em>involves federal common law rather than California law, but we find its reasoning persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Neither California law nor its public policy dictates a result different from the one reached in <em>Padfield. </em>Here, as in <em>Padfield, </em>whether the consequences of autoerotic asphyxiation were \u201cinjuries\u201d depends upon the ordinary and popular meaning of the term. <em>Compare </em>Cal. Civ.Code \u00a7 1644 (\u201cThe words of a contract are to be understood in their ordinary and popular sense, rather than according to their strict legal meaning ....\u201d), <em>mth Padfield, </em>290 F.3d at 1129 (the physical consequences of autoerotic asphyxiation are not injuries \u201cas that term is defined in the \u2018ordinary and popular sense [by] person[s] of average intelligence and experience\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Babikian v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., </em>63 F.3d 837, 840 (9th Cir.1995)) (alterations in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Furthermore, that \u201caccidental means\u201d insurance policies are the exception rather than the rule in California supports the conclusion that an insured should generally be covered for unintended death even if the death was related to the insured\u2019s voluntary acts. <em>See Olson v. Am. Bankers Ins. Co., </em>30 Cal.App.4th 816, 35 Cal.Rptr.2d 897, 899-900 (1994) (citing <em>Weil v. Fed. Kemper Life Assurance Co., </em>7 Cal.4th 125, 27 Cal.Rptr.2d 316, 320-21, 866 P.2d 774 (1994)) (for an insurance policy to exclude coverage for death resulting from intended activities, the policy should contain the words \u201caccidental means\u201d). In addition, California Insurance Code \u00a7 533, which excludes an insurer\u2019s liability for \u201closs caused by the wilful act of the insured,\u201d was intended to discourage the commission of wilful torts. <em>See Tomerlin v. Canadian Indem. Co., </em>61 Cal.2d 638, 39 Cal.Rptr. 731, 737-38, 394 P.2d 571 (1964). Even assuming that Section 533 might apply to nontortious conduct, it would not preclude coverage here because harm is not inherent in the act of autoerotic asphyxiation. <em>Cf. J.C. Penney Cas. Ins. Co. v. M.K., </em>52 Cal.3d 1009, 278 Cal.Rptr. 64, 70, 804 P.2d 689 (1991) (Section 533 precludes coverage for child molestation since the intent to molest is the same as the intent to harm); <em>see also Interinsurance Exch. v. Flores, </em>45 Cal.App.4th 661, 53 Cal.Rptr.2d 18, 23 (1996) (\u201cWhere application of section 533 becomes an issue, the insurance company must establish that the insured acted with intent to harm or that the insured committed an inherently wrongful act.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">Guided by <em>Padfield, </em>we conclude that under California law the physical consequences of autoerotic asphyxiation are not \u201c \u2018injuries]\u2019 as that term is defined in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>\u2018ordinary and popular sense [by] person[s] of average intelligence and experience.\u2019\u201d <em>Padfield, </em>290 F.3d at 1129 (quoting <em>Babikian, </em>63 F.3d at 840). Because there is no evidence that Neil intended anything other than the typical physical consequences of autoerotic asphyxiation, we conclude that his death does not fall within the policy\u2019s \u201cintentionally self-inflicted injury\u201d exclusion. Accordingly, we reverse the grant of summary judgment in Veterans\u2019 favor and remand the case for further proceedings in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b739-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
