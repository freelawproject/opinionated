Having had the benefit of oral argument and after carefully considering the appeal record, the parties\u2019 briefs, and the applicable law, we are not persuaded that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to St. Paul. Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>reasoning that supports judgment for St. Paul has been articulated by the district court, the issuance of a detailed written opinion by this Court would serve no useful purpose. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is affirmed upon the reasoning employed by that court in its memorandum and order dated August 6, 2001 and entered on that same date.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
