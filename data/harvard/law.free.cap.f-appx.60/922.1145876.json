(\u201cOutlet City\u201d) brought this Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (\u201cCERCLA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601 <em>et seq., </em>action in order to recover the costs it has incurred in relation to the clean-up of hazardous waste on the property it purchased 25 years ago from West Chemical Products, Inc. (\u2018West\u201d). For the reasons that follow, we are unwilling to sustain, without further analysis and findings, the two articulated bases for the District Court\u2019s decision granting judgment to West on the CERCLA claim. We do, however, affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of judgment to West on the ultrahazardous activity claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-13\">In November 1978, Outlet City bought four acres of property in Queens, New York, (\u201cthe Property\u201d) from West for $586,000. West had owned the Property since 1901, and operated a facility that manufactured chemicals and household products such as disinfectants, insecticides, soaps, etc. West used various chemicals including, but not limited to, creosote, acids, de-greasing solvents, iodine, and petroleum. It stored the products and chemicals in aboveground and underground storage tanks.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-17\">After West vacated the Property, Outlet City used it for commercial and retail purposes. In 1988, AKRF, Inc. (\u201cAKRF\u201d), an environmental consulting firm, performed an environmental study of the Property on behalf of Hartz Associates, a company interested in buying the Property from Outlet City. The 1988 AKRF study indicated that contamination might exist at the Property. In 1990, after further study, Outlet City concluded that there was creosote and that petroleum contamination had, in fact, occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-18\">In April 1991, Outlet City filed a complaint against West asserting a claim under Section 107 of CERCLA, <em>inter alia, </em>to recover costs incurred as a result of the environmental mess allegedly caused by West. In July 1994, Outlet City amended the complaint to state the following claims: 1) Section 107(a)(1) and (a)(2) CERCLA liability, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9607(a)(1), (a)(2); 2) ultrahazardous activity (abnormally dangerous activity); 3) negligence; 4) willful and wanton conduct and gross negligence; 5) fraudulent concealment; 6) nuisance; 7) trespass; and 8) New York Oil Spill Act (\u201cOil Spill Act\u201d) violation, N.Y. Navig. Law \u00a7\u00a7 181(1), (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-19\">In March 1996, Outlet City began negotiations with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>(\u201cNYSDEC\u201d) to develop a remedial program for the Property. In October 1996, Outlet City and the NYSDEC signed an agreement that consisted of 1) implementation of an Interim Remedial Measure Plan (\u201cIRM\u201d) for the recovery of creosote on the Property; and 2) implementation of the Supplemental Site Assessment/Remedial Investigation Work Plan for the Property. The NYSDEC later found these plans to be lacking, and in March 2000, Outlet City promised to replace its IRM \u25a0with a more effective remediation plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">On September 30, 1998, after the case had been reassigned to Judge Greenaway, Jr., the District Court denied the parties\u2019 cross motions for partial summary judgment on the CERCLA and Oh Spill Act claims because there were material, disputed facts with respect to each. On September 27, 2000, the case was reassigned to Judge Cavanaugh. On April 26, 2001, the parties agreed to dismiss the fraudulent concealment claim, and on October 23, 2001, Judge Cavanaugh adopted Magistrate Judge Haneke\u2019s recommendation to dismiss counts 3, 4, 6, and 7. Beginning on October 23, 2001, the remaining claims (CERCLA, ultrahazardous activity, and Oil Spill Act) were tided before Judge Cavanaugh. The bench trial concluded on October 26, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">On March 20, 2002, the District Court issued an opinion granting judgment to West on all three claims. The case was closed on March 25, 2002, and Outlet City filed a timely notice of appeal on April 15, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-10\">The District Court had federal question subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. Outlet City appeals from a final order and judgment of the District Court. We, therefore, have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>Lanning v. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transp. Auth., </em>308 F.3d 286, 290 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b957-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-13\">Outlet City appeals the District Court\u2019s grant of judgment to West on its CERCLA claim. We have addressed the purpose of CERCLA in various contexts. We have found that \u201c[i]n response to widespread concern over the improper disposal of hazardous wastes, Congress enacted CERCLA, a complex piece of legislation designed to force polluters to pay for costs associated with remedying their pollution. ...\u201d <em>United States v. Alcan Aluminum Corp. et al., </em>964 F.2d 252, 258 (3d Cir.1992) (citations omitted). \u201cCERCLA is a remedial statute which should be construed liberally to effectuate its goals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 258. At issue in this case is Section 107 of CERCLA. That section provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-14\">(a) Notwithstanding any other provision or rule of law, and subject only to the defenses set forth in subsection (b) of this section\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-15\">(1) the owner and operator of a vessel or a facility,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-16\">(2) any person who at the time of disposal or any hazardous substance owned or operated any facility at which such hazardous substances were disposed of, ... or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-17\">(4) ____shall be liable for\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-18\">(B) <em>any other necessary costs of response incurred by any other person consistent with the national contingency plan.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b957-19\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9607(a)(l, 2), (a)(4)(B) (emphasis added). This Court has said that Section 107 liability is imposed where the plaintiff establishes the following four ele<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>merits: 1) the defendant falls within one of the four categories of \u201cresponsible parties\u201d; 2) the hazardous substances are disposed at a \u201cfacility\u201d; 3) there is a \u201crelease\u201d or \u201cthreatened release\u201d of hazardous substances from the facility into the environment;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 4) the release causes the incurrence of \u201cresponse costs.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Alcan Aluminum, </em>964 F.2d at 259. If a plaintiff proves all four elements and the defendant does not prove one of the three statutory defenses, CERCLA imposes strict liability on the defendant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">The District Court granted judgment to West after concluding that Outlet City faded to meet its burden of proving 1) a \u201crelease\u201d and 2) NCP-compliant \u201cresponse costs.\u201d We will discuss these conclusions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">A. <em>\u201cRelease\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">The District Court determined that there was no liability-producing \u201crelease\u201d for three reasons: 1) Outlet City had an opportunity to inspect the Property before purchasing it, but failed to conduct environmental studies, and the sale contract contained no contingency to accommodate later disclosures of contamination; 2) Outlet City stored heating fuel on the Property in the same tanks used by West and the hydrocarbon studies showed that the petroleum contamination was not attributable to West\u2019s ownership of the land; and 3) there were several other possible sources of contamination, including the asphalt covering the Property, adjacent railroad and other industrial facilities, and Outlet City did not present evidence to eliminate the possibility that hazardous substances came from sources other than West\u2019s manufacturing operations. (D.Ct.Op., pp. 8-9)</p>\n<p id=\"b958-10\">The District Court\u2019s first two reasons for finding no \u201crelease\u201d are not applicable because: (1) Outlet City\u2019s knowledge that the Property was contaminated when it bought it from West has no bearing on whether there was a \u201crelease;\u201d and (2) because liability for petroleum spills is excluded from CERCLA under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9601(14). The third reason is based on the court\u2019s interpretation of Section 107. Implicit in the District Court\u2019s conclusion that West is not liable for the \u201crelease\u201d is the idea that Outlet City did not prove that West released the contaminants <em>which led to the response costs incurred by Outlet City. </em>In other words, in the legal analysis of the \u201crelease\u201d element, the District Court determined that there must be causation between the release by West and the response costs incurred by Outlet City. But this Court has held that the only causation required under CERCLA is that the release of hazardous substances at the \u201cfacility\u201d cause the response costs; a plaintiff does not need to prove that the defendant\u2019s waste caused the response costs under Section 107. <em>Alcan Aluminum, </em>964 F.2d at 264-266. Therefore, we cannot sustain the District Court\u2019s conclusion that there was no \u201crelease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>B. <em>Compliance with the National Contingency Plan</em></p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">Section 107 provides that \u201cresponse costs\u201d can only be recovered from \u201cresponsible parties\u201d when they were: 1) necessary; and 2) consistent with the National Contingency Plan (\u201cNCP\u201d). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(a)(4)(B). With respect to consistency with the NCP, 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.700 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-7\">(c)(3) For the purpose of cost recovery under section 107(a)(4)(B) of CERCLA:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AW_\">(i) A private party response action will be considered \u201cconsistent with the NCP\u201d if the action, when evaluated as a whole, is in substantial compliance with the applicable requirements in paragraphs (5) and (6) of this section, and results in a CERCLA-quality cleanup; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-8\">(4) Actions under \u00a7 300.700(c)(1) ... and (c)(2) will not be considered \u201cnot consistent with the NCP\u201d based on immaterial or insubstantial deviations from the provisions of 40 CFR part 300.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5OT\">Paragraphs (5) and (6) of 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.700(c) set forth the procedural requirements for an NCP-comphant cleanup effort by reference to other sections of the CFR. They include requirements about worker health and safety, documentation of costs, permits, reports, removal site evaluation, remedial site evaluation, and opportunity for meaningful public comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-9\">The District Court concluded that Outlet City\u2019s \u201cresponse costs\u201d were not in \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with the NCP for the following reasons: 1) Outlet City did not properly document the cost of actions taken (other than legal fees, which were documented but not legally justified); 2) Outlet City did not conduct a timely, effective, or comprehensive site evaluation; 3) with regard to the removal of groundwater contaminants, there was no substantial compliance because Outlet City only removed 15% or less of the product to be recovered and the NYSDEC admonished it for not doing better; 4) Outlet City failed to prove that any permanent measures consistent with removal of the hazardous substance have been initiated or completed. (D.Ct. Op., pp. 11-12)</p>\n<p id=\"b959-11\">Focusing on the third and fourth reasons, it is clear that the District Court improperly equated \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with \u201csubstantial amount of removal or remediation.\u201d That is not the standard codified in the C.F.R. under the NCP. The NCP does not require that a cleanup be substantially complete when an action is filed. ' The NCP requires only \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with the procedural requirements of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-12\">Although the other two reasons are legitimate NCP non-compliance concerns, the District Court did not consider evidence presented by Outlet City in concluding that these steps weren\u2019t taken. For example, the District Court did not address the testimony of Outlet City\u2019s expert that its expenditures were \u201creasonable, necessary and substantially compliant\u201d with the NCP (App.759-760), and did not reference any evidence to the contrary. Given that there is ample documentation of Outlet City\u2019s expenditures in the record, and particularly based on the testimony of its expert, the District Court\u2019s opinion does not enable us to meaningfully review the judgement. In addition, the District Court\u2019s conclusion may run afoul of the instruction in the NCP that strict compliance is not required. In fact, if the procedural deviations are \u201cimmaterial or insubstantial\u201d they should not be deemed inconsistent with the NCP. 40 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.700(c)(4). At a minimum, Outlet City presented suf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>ficient evidence to warrant a more comprehensive analysis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">Outlet City also appeals the District Court\u2019s grant of judgment to West on its ultrahazardous activity claim. The New York law on the tort of ultrahazardous activity is clear. \u201cDetermining whether an activity is abnormally dangerous involves multiple factors. Analysis of no one factor is determinative. Moreover, even an activity abnormally dangerous under one set of circumstances is not necessarily abnormally dangerous for all occasions .... Particularly useful are the six criteria listed in Restatement of Torts Second (section 520): \u201ca) existence of a high degree of risk of some harm to the person, land or chattels of others; b) likelihood that the harm that results from it will be great; c) inability to eliminate the risk by the exercise of reasonable care; d) extent to which the activity is not a matter of common usage; e) inappropriateness of the activity to the place where it is carried on; and f) extent to which its value to the community is outweighed by its dangerous attributes.\u201d <em>Doundoulakis v. Town of Hempstead et al, </em>42 N.Y.2d 440, 448, 398 N.Y.S.2d 401, 368 N.E.2d 24 (N.Y.1977) (citing <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 520)).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">The District Court provided three reasons for concluding that West was not liable for an ultrahazardous activity: 1) Outlet City presented \u201cno facts or witnesses\u201d to prove that West\u2019s manufacturing activity was abnormally dangerous or presented a higher degree of risk than usual; 2) Nino Tassi, an employee of West from the 1950\u2019s until 1978, testified that he required no medical attention or protective clothing at work and he never saw warning signs about chemical hazards; and 3) West\u2019s manufacturing activity was an appropriate activity given the location of the Property in an industrial area. (D.Ct.Op., p. 13)</p>\n<p id=\"b960-9\">We focus on the first and the third reasons, which are Restatement factors, and which we find to be persuasive. Outlet City\u2019s only argument to the contrary is that the District Court should have determined as a matter of law that the chemical storage and clean-up activities of West were abnormally dangerous. In support of that proposition, Outlet City cites <em>State of New York v. Shore Realty Corp., </em>759 F.2d 1032 (2d Cir.1985) and <em>State v. Schenectady Chemicals, </em>103 A.D.2d 33, 479 N.Y.S.2d 1010 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-10\"><em>Shore Realty </em>and <em>Schenectady Chemicals </em>are easily distinguished. First, they involve claims of public nuisance rather than ultrahazardous activity. Although the courts in those cases found the manufacturing activity at issue to be a public nuisance, that does not mean that the manufacturing activity in this case, even if identical, was abnormally dangerous. In any event, whether a certain kind of manufacturing activity was abnormally dangerous in the place where it occurred is a highly fact-sensitive question that cannot be determined as a matter of law by comparison to other highly fact-sensitive cases. Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s decision on the ultrahazardous activity claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>v.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of judgment to West on the ultrazardous activity claim. Because we are unwilling to sustain, without further analysis and findings, the two articulated bases for the decision, namely that (1) no \u201crelease\u201d was proven and (2) there was no substantial compliance with the NCP, we vacate the District Court\u2019s grant of judgment to West on the CERCLA claim. Accordingly, we remand this matter to the District Court to reconsider its decision in light of our opinion, based upon the existing trial record or after developing a supplementary record as the court may deem just and proper.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b958-7\">. CERCLA defines release as: \"any spilling, leaking, pumping, pouring, emitting, emptying, discharging, injecting, escaping, leaching, dumping, or disposing into the environment (including the abandonment or discarding or barrels, containers, and other closed receptacles containing any hazardous substance or pollutant or contaminant) ...

A removal action is different than a remedial action. A removal action is intended to remove the hazardous waste from the area in the short term \u2014 a quick fix. A remedial action involves a long-term effort to remedy the damage done to the environment. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9601(23), (24).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b960-7\">.
