We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Although the district court addressed Barber\u2019s claims on the merits, we find that a writ of audita querela was not available because Barber could have raised his claims in a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). <em>See United States v. Torres, </em>282 F.3d 1241, 1245 (10th Cir.2002). The fact that Barber was unable to obtain relief under \u00a7 2255 does not alter our conclusion. <em>See United States v. Valdez-Pacheco, </em>237 F.3d 1077, 1080 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cA prisoner may not circumvent valid congressional limitations on collateral attacks by asserting that those very limitations create a gap in the postconviction remedies that must be filled by the common law writs.\u201d); <em>In re Jones, </em>226 F.3d 328, 333 (4th Cir.2000). Accordingly, we affirm. We deny Barber\u2019s motion to stay and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-21\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
