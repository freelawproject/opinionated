We review de novo the question of whether Schafler is entitled to an exemption, <em>Coughlin v. Cataldo (In re Cataldo), </em>224 B.R. 426, 428 (9th Cir. BAP1998), with the exception of findings by the Bankruptcy Court that Schafler acted in bad faith, which we review for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>clear error. <em>Arnold v. Gill (In re Arnold), 252 </em>B.R. 778, 784 (9th Cir.BAP2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Schafler does not establish that the asset in question qualifies as an exempt account under Section ll-504(h) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article of the Code of Maryland. This statute requires that the account meet the requirements of \u201c \u00a7 401(a), \u00a7 403(a), \u00a7 403(b), \u00a7 408, \u00a7 408A, \u00a7 414(d), or \u00a7 414(e) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or \u00a7 409 (as in effect prior to January 1984) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended.\u201d Schafler does not argue, and the record does not indicate, that the account for which she claims an exemption satisfies these requirements. The exemption was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">The Bankruptcy Court\u2019s denial of Schafler\u2019s motion for an exemption did not deny her due process of law simply because it did not occur at a separately scheduled hearing. The Bankruptcy Court chose to address the matter during a hearing on a related matter, after both parties had fully briefed the exemption issue, and gave both parties an opportunity to present oral argument. Schafler argues that this was done in violation of Bankruptcy Local Rule 9014 for the Northern District of California, but does not demonstrate any prejudice that resulted. Absent a demonstration of prejudice, any error in this respect is not reversible error. <em>Houston v. Bryan, </em>725 F.2d 516, 518 (9th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">The decision of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b728-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
