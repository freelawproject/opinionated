Gomez appeals the denial of his motion to suppress statements made at the time of his arrest, the district court\u2019s failure to find the government committed a discovery violation, and the denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment on constitutional grounds. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Gomez knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived his rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). <em>See United States v. Vallejo, </em>237 F.3d 1008, 1014 (9th Cir.), <em>as amended, </em>246 F.3d 1150 (9th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Before any interrogation, the agents read Gomez his rights in Spanish, his preferred language. He wrote \u201cyes\u201d in Spanish on the pre-printed, Spanish language <em>Miranda </em>advisal form after each of his rights. He wrote \u201cyes\u201d in Spanish next to the questions asking him if he understood and was willing to answer questions, and he signed his name at the bottom of the form. A more explicit statement of waiver is not required. <em>North Carolina v. Butler, </em>441 U.S. 369, 373, 99 S.Ct. 1755, 60 L.Ed.2d 286 (1979) (\u201cholding that an express written or oral statement of waiver of the right to remain silent or of the right to counsel ... is not inevitably either necessary or sufficient to establish waiver\u201d); <em>United States v. Cazares, </em>121 F.3d 1241, 1244 (9th Cir.1997) (citing <em>Terrovona v. Kincheloe, </em>912 F.2d 1176, 1179 (9th Cir.1990)) (\u201cTo solicit a waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights, a police officer need neither use a waiver form nor ask explicitly whether the defendant intends to waive his rights.\u201d). The district court properly denied Gomez\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">The government did not violate Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure by failing to disclose Agent DiPaola\u2019s conversations with Gomez until the first day of trial. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(1)(A). The conversations were used at the suppression hearing to show Gomez\u2019s ability to speak English and interact with the agents, and are not probative of guilt. The government represented to the district court that it did not intend to use the conversations at trial until Gomez submitted a declaration that he did not speak English on the eve of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">The statutes under which Gomez was convicted, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952, 960, are not unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>United States v. Buckland, </em>277 F.3d 1173 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc). <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>314 F.3d 430, 437-38 (9th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Mendoza-Paz, </em>286 F.3d 1104, 1109-11 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>___ U.S. ___, 123 S.Ct. 573, 154 L.Ed.2d 459 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b117-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
