Having carefully reviewed the record, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to enter default judgment in plaintiffs\u2019 favor, <em>see Harris v. St. Louis Police Dep\u2019t, </em>164 F.3d 1085, 1086 (8th Cir.1998) (per curiam) (finding no abuse of discretion in district court\u2019s denial of default judgment to plaintiff where court had granted defendant additional time to answer); and that the district court did not err in limiting the trial to plaintiffs\u2019 failure-to-promote claims, <em>see Wallin v. Minn. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>153 F.3d 681, 688 (8th Cir.1998) (allowing complaint to encompass allegations outside ambit of EEOC charge circumscribes EEOC\u2019s investigatory and conciliatory role, and deprives charged party of notice of the charge), <em>cert. denied, </em>526 U.S. 1004, 119 S.Ct 1141, 143 L.Ed.2d 209 (1999), or in allowing the City of St. Louis\u2019s attorney to represent defendant Murphy. We further conclude that without a transcript, we cannot review the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings or determine whether the jury\u2019s verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence. <em>See Schmid v. United Bhd. of Carpenters &amp; Joiners, </em>827 F.2d 384, 386 (8th Cir.1987) (per curiam) (court unable to review evidentiary and weight-of-evidence arguments because no transcript filed), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 1071, 108 S.Ct. 1041, 98 L.Ed.2d 1004 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-20\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B. We deny the pending motion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b671-18\">. The Honorable Stephen N.
