Bennett appeals from the district court\u2019s affirmance of a decision by an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) denying her disability insurance benefits. We reverse and remand for an award of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The relevant facts are known to the parties and are discussed here only briefly and as necessary. Bennett left work permanently on July 23, 1982 due to severe pain in her neck, back, shoulders, arms, and hands. The pain was caused by an earlier injury. The record contains reports from Bennett\u2019s treating physician, Jerome K. Schaffer, who saw Bennett many times over a number of years. He diagnosed chronic myocervical derangement with myofibrositis and determined that she was entirely unable to work. Further evidence in the record shows that Schaffer was unable to treat Bennett\u2019s pain effectively by medication, in part because she was allergic to many pain medications. He therefore referred her for surgery that he believed might reduce her pain. However, the surgery was unsuccessful in controlling the pain. The record also includes various hospital reports and testimony from Bennett, all consistent with Bennett\u2019s reports of pain and inability to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The ALJ found that Bennett\u2019s allegations of pain and other symptoms through December 31, 1987, the last day of her insured status, were \u201cnot credible or reliable based on the medical and lay evidence\u201d and that Bennett \u201cdid not have any impairment or impairments which more than minimally affected her ability to perform basic work-related activities.\u201d The ALJ based these findings and his final determination not on any medical evidence conflicting with Schaffer\u2019s, but rather because he gave little weight to Schaffer\u2019s evidence, and, apparently, because he did not find Bennett\u2019s testimony credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">The ALJ rejected Schaffer\u2019s evidence primarily because it included little in the way of specific, objective diagnostic testing. However, while a treating physician\u2019s uncontradicted medical opinion will not receive \u201ccontrolling weight\u201d unless it is \u201cwell-supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques,\u201d Social Security Ruling 96-2p, it can nonetheless be rejected only for \u201c\u2018clear and convincing\u2019 reasons supported by substantial evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Holohan v. Massanari, </em>246 F.3d 1195, 1202 (9th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Reddick v. Chater, </em>157 F.3d 715, 725 (9th Cir.1998)). Furthermore, a treating physician\u2019s opinion \u201con the ultimate issue of disability\u201d must itself be credited unless it can be rejected for clear and convincing reasons. <em>Holohan, </em>246 F.3d at 1202-03. Thus, because Schaffer\u2019s medical opinions were uncontradicted and because he concluded that Bennett\u2019s impairment rendered her completely unable to work, we must reverse unless the ALJ\u2019s reasons for rejecting Schaffer\u2019s evidence were clear and convincing and were supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-11\">The ALJ cited four reasons (other than a paucity of objective findings) for rejecting Schaffer\u2019s opinions: 1) Schaffer referred to Bennett\u2019s neck pain as \u201cintermittent,\u201d 2) Bennett did not stop working immediately after her injury, 3) Bennett continued to drive short distances and perform light household activities after she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>stopped working, and 4) Bennett did not receive aggressive pain therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The first three of these reasons are insubstantial. First, Schaffer\u2019s diagnosis of \u201cintermittent\u201d pain is not inconsistent with Bennett\u2019s having been disabled due to pain. If, as Bennett testified, the pain was often so severe that she was unable to sit or hold a pen, then she could not be employed in positions, including her past relevant work, that required constant writing or sitting. Second, that Bennett was able to work for a time after her injury is not inconsistent with the evidence of Schaffer and Bennett that Bennett\u2019s pain gradually became so severe that she became unable to work. Third, the fact that Bennett continued to drive short distances and perform light household activities is not inconsistent with her testimony and Schaffer\u2019s opinion that she was unable to work. <em>See Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1284 n. 7 (9th Cir.1996) (\u201cThe Social Security Act does not require that claimants be utterly incapacitated to be eligible for benefits, and many home activities may not be easily transferrable to a work environment....\u201d); <em>Cooper v. Bowen, </em>815 F.2d 557, 561 (9th Cir.1987) (noting that a disability claimant need not \u201cvegetate in a dark room\u201d in order to be deemed eligible for benefits).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The ALJ\u2019s fourth reason is factually inaccurate. The record shows that Bennett underwent surgery in an effort to control her pain. Surgery is without doubt an aggressive form of treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Because the ALJ\u2019s reasons for rejecting the treating physician\u2019s evidence were not clear and convincing, and because those reasons were not supported by substantial evidence in the record, we reverse and remand to the district court with instructions to remand to the Social Security Administration for the award of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">REVERSED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b168-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b169-9\">O\u2019SCANNLAIN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ACd\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">I must respectfully dissent from the decision to reverse the district court and to award disability benefits. The Commissioner\u2019s decision to deny benefits may be overturned \u201conly if it is not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Morgan v. Apfel, </em>169 F.3d 595, 599 (9th Cir.1999). Substantial evidence means \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Where the evidence is susceptible to more than one rational interpretation, it is the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that must be upheld. <em>Id.; Andrews v. Shalala, </em>53 F.3d 1035, 1041 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">In this case, the ALJ found that Bennett had failed to meet her burden of showing that she was disabled by her neck and shoulder pain. Specifically, the ALJ rejected the opinion of Bennett\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Schaffer. The majority is correct to note that such an opinion can be rejected only for \u201c\u2018clear and convincing\u2019 reasons supported by substantial evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Holohan v. Massanari, </em>246 F.3d 1195, 1202 (9th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Reddick v. Chater, </em>157 F.3d 715, 725 (9th Cir.1998)). I must part ways with the majority, however, with respect to its conclusion that the ALJ failed to provide such reasons in this case. For, in rejecting Dr. Schafer\u2019s opinion, the ALJ noted that, at bottom, the opinion was premised on subjectively controlled motion testing rather than \u201cmedically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques.\u201d Social Security Ruling 96-2p. We have elsewhere held that, where a medical opinion is premised upon the patient\u2019s \u201cown subjective complaints,\u201d the absence of an independent, objective basis for the opinion itself \u201cconstitutes a specific, legitimate reason for rejecting the opinion of a treating physician.\u201d <em>Fair v. Bowen, </em>885 F.2d 597, 605 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>The majority\u2019s critique of the other reasons relied upon by the ALJ becomes decidedly less persuasive when stripped of the imprimatur of medical authority. Indeed, the ALJ\u2019s credibility determination \u2014 that is, that Bennett\u2019s testimony regarding her neck pain was not believable in light of the activities she admittedly engaged in \u2014 takes on added weight: For if the ALJ found Bennett\u2019s testimony not worthy of credence, it had all the more reason to reject Dr. Schaeffer\u2019s conclusions, themselves based entirely upon subjective input from Bennett.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">At best the majority has demonstrated that the evidence in this case is susceptible to more than one rational interpretation. Such a demonstration is insufficient, however, to reverse the ALJ\u2019s conclusion. <em>Andrews, </em>53 F.3d at 1041. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
