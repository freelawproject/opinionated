Tzada, a native and citizen of Ethiopia, petitions for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d) affirming without opinion the immigration judge\u2019s order finding Tzada removable and denying his application for asylum and withholding of removal. The Board and immigration judge\u2019s determination that Tzada is not eligible for asylum must be upheld unless that determination is \u201cmanifestly contrary to law.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(C) (2000). We have reviewed the administrative record and find no error in the Board and immigration judge\u2019s con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>elusion that Tzada failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (2000). Accordingly, we deny Tzada\u2019s petition for review. We grant the Government\u2019s fifth motion for an extension of time to file their brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
