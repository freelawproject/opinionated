This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(1), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-18\">In 1992, MeCully, along with two co-defendants, was convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana. He was sentenced to 262 months imprisonment. His conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>20 F.3d 670 (6th Cir.1994). McCuhy\u2019s prior motion to vacate was dismissed as meritless. This court denied McCuhy\u2019s request to file a second or successive motion to vacate in an order filed September 28, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-19\">On April 29, 2002, MeCully filed yet another \u00a7 2255 motion, claiming that the indictment failed to allege the amount of the controlled substance attributed to him as part of the drug conspiracy charge. The district court construed the motion as being brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, denied the rehef requested, and dismissed the petition in an order filed June 5, 2002. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-20\">Initially, we note that the respondent questions this court\u2019s jurisdiction. However, we are satisfied that jurisdiction is proper. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-21\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s order dismissing a habeas corpus petition. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number><em>Charles v. Chandler, </em>180 F.3d 753, 755 (6th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed McCully\u2019s petition. As a general rule, a petitioner challenging the legality of a sentence must bring his claim under \u00a7 2255 in the sentencing court, while a petitioner challenging the execution or manner in which the sentence is served may bring a claim under \u00a7 2241 in the court having jurisdiction over the prisoner\u2019s custodian. <em>United States v. Peterman, </em>249 F.3d 458, 461 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1008, 122 S.Ct. 493, 151 L.Ed.2d 404 (2001); <em>Charles, </em>180 F.3d at 755-56. However, a federal prisoner may challenge his conviction and the imposition of a sentence under \u00a7 2241, instead of \u00a7 2255, if he is able to establish that his remedy under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 Oast clause in fifth paragraph); <em>United States v. Hayman, </em>342 U.S. 205, 223, 72 S.Ct. 263, 96 L.Ed. 232 (1952); <em>Charles, </em>180 F.3d at 755-56. For example, a prisoner who can show that an intervening change in the law establishes his actual innocence can invoke the savings clause of \u00a7 2255 and proceed under \u00a7 2241. <em>Peterman, </em>249 F.3d at 461-62; <em>Charles, </em>180 F.3d at 757. The prisoner has the burden of proving that his remedy under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. <em>Charles, </em>180 F.3d at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">McCully\u2019s claim constitutes a challenge to the legality of his sentence, and he did not establish that his remedy under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. <em>See Charles, </em>180 F.3d at 756. His claim does not involve an intervening change in the law that establishes his actual innocence. <em>See Peterman, </em>249 F.3d at 461-62; <em>Charles, </em>180 F.3d at 757. While he does not cite <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), it is clear that MeCully is making an <em>Apprendi </em>argument. However, that decision does not help him. In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201c[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Although the Supreme Court announced a new rule of constitutional law in <em>Apprendi, </em>the rule has not been made retroactive to cases on collateral review. <em>See In re Clemmons, </em>259 F.3d 489, 491 (6th Cir.2001) (\u00a7 2244).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">MeCully did not prove that he was entitled to proceed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order is affirmed. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
