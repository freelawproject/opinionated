He thereafter pled guilty to Counts I through V of the Indictment and was sentenced to 120 months imprisonment on count I and 60 months imprisonment on counts II through V to run concurrently to each other but consecutively to count I. The total period of confinement that resulted is therefore 121 months followed by a period <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>of supervised release of 5 years and a special assessment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Counsel for Pearson represents that, after a review of the record in this matter, \u201ccounsel has concluded that there are no non-Mvolous issues for appeal....\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 8, and he has therefore only submitted a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), referring to those portions of the record that might arguably support an appeal, and directing our attention to relevant law.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">We agree with counsel\u2019s representation, and we will therefore affirm the judgment of sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
