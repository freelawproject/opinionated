Satterwhite filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>this motion several years after his sentence was affirmed on direct appeal<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and his challenge under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000), was rejected. There is simply no statutory or other authority for reconsidering his sentence at this late date. Accordingly, the district court was without jurisdiction to consider the motion, and we affirm its denial of relief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b482-17\">The district court\u2019s order stated that Satterwhite had not timely appealed his conviction and sentence. This is erroneous. Nevertheless, the district court did not have jurisdiction to reconsider Satterwhite\u2019s sentence, so the error is harmless.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
