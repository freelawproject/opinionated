R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, or collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-18\"><em>Pro se </em>Petitioner Davula Alfreda Leonoff appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of her complaint with prejudice under Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-19\">Petitioner originally brought this action against three respondents as an \u201cApplication for Writ of Habeas Corpus,\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, while she was incarcerated in an Oklahoma state facility. On January 8, 2002, however, Petitioner filed a pleading entitled, \u201cAmmended [sic] civil complaint and jury trial demand pursuant to F.R.C.P. 8(a)(2) and 8(e)(1).\u201d The complaint stated that she was filing suit on behalf of herself and on behalf of her children M, L, and B, as their best friend. It added 20 defendants and alleged numerous civil causes of action. Petitioner noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>in her amended complaint that she was no longer in state custody, and she apparently abandoned the portion of her habeas petition relating to her incarceration. We review the district court\u2019s dismissal of this complaint de novo. <em>Ruiz v. McDonnell, </em>299 F.3d 1173, 1181 (10th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Many of Petitioner\u2019s claims concern judicial proceedings that occurred more than a decade ago. It appears that in November 1988 an Oklahoma judge entered an order giving temporary custody of Petitioner\u2019s daughter, J, to the Oklahoma Department of Human Services. Sometime after that order was entered, Petitioner and her husband took J from a state-appointed custodian. In February 1989 the State of Oklahoma filed an information alleging that Petitioner had illegally removed her child from lawful custody. That same month Petitioner was arrested on that charge, and in the fall of 1989 she was tried and convicted. Shortly after her arrest, an Oklahoma court placed J, M, and L in the custody of Petitioner\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">In October 2001 Petitioner was again arrested for the illegal removal of a child from lawful custody. After this arrest Petitioner\u2019s fourth child, B, was placed in state custody. The custody of that child is still the subject of pending state court proceedings in Oklahoma.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Petitioner brings this case under \u201cAdmiralty and Equity Jurisdiction Pursuant to Article III. Section 2 arising from Fraud, Fraud upon Breach of Contracts, Title VII., of Civil Rights Act of 1964, The United States Codes, The Constitution for these United States of America, The Bill of Rights, The Declaration of Independence, The U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights, The Magna Carta, The U.C.C., the U.S.C.A., between Appellants and Appellees for failure to fulfill obligations of said Contracts, setting forth claims arising under 42 U.S.C. &amp; 1983-88, 18 U.S.C. &amp; 1621. 42 U.S.C. &amp; 1621[.]\u201d Aplt\u2019s Br. in Support of ROA at 1. More specifically, Petitioner states nine causes of action, claiming she is entitled to habeas corpus relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254; damages, injunctive relief, and declaratory relief under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, based on various violations of her First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights by Oklahoma agencies and officials; and damages, injunctive relief, and declaratory relief under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 241, 242, 872, 1621, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1985, 1986. She seeks, among other things, the following relief: (1) monetary damages for direct and consequential harms suffered, including exemplary and punitive damages; (2) \u201cINJUNCTIVE RELIEF IN THE FORM OF HABEAUS [sic] CORPUS RELEASE OF [her children]\u201d; (3) unspecified injunctive relief for illegal searches; (4) \u201c \u2018injunctive relief in the form of a \u2018STAY\u2019 of wage assignment of the $2,324.00 supposedly owed in [a state court proceeding]\u201d; (5) \u201ca restraining order against Tulsa, Oklahoma state courts and Oklahoma City State and Administrative Courts from further \u2018ABUSE OF HERSELF AND HER CHILDREN\u2019\u201d; (6) removal of a state court order; and (7) injunctive relief preventing appellees from making medical diagnoses and treatments concerning her or her children. Aplt.\u2019s Br. in Support of ROA at 6, 11, 13, 15, 25, 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">The federal district court dismissed Petitioner\u2019s claims because (1) some claims involved challenges to the validity of state court decisions, and such review of state court decisions is barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, see <em>D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Rooker v. Fid. Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923); (2) the <em>Younger </em>doctrine, see <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>(1971), prohibited the court from considering Petitioner\u2019s request for injunctive and declaratory relief in the pending state child custody dispute; (3) as set forth in <em>Lehman v. Lycoming County Children\u2019s Serv. Agency, </em>458 U.S. 502, 102 S.Ct. 3231, 73 L.Ed.2d 928 (1982), the court lacked jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 to consider a collateral attack on a state court judgment terminating parental rights; and (4) the State of Oklahoma, the state agencies, and the state officials sued in their official capacities are entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity on Petitioner\u2019s claims for monetary damages. To the extent that Petitioner had any remaining claims over which the court had jurisdiction, the court ruled that (5) the judges who are parties to the lawsuit have absolute judicial immunity for their judicial actions and (6) Petitioner\u2019s civil rights claims based on actions taken between 1988 and 1990 are barred by the two-year statute of limitations applicable to federal civil rights claims brought in Oklahoma. Because of the jurisdictional constraints and the untimeliness of her claims, the district court concluded that it would have been futile to give Petitioner an opportunity to amend her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">We have carefully reviewed Petitioner\u2019s filings with this court, the district court\u2019s order, and the record on appeal. We agree with the district court that for each of Petitioner\u2019s claims, either the district court lacked jurisdiction over the claim or Petitioner failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Therefore, for substantially the same reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s February 8, 2002 order, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of Petitioner\u2019s complaint with prejudice. Petitioner\u2019s motion for a ruling on her supplemental brief is DENIED; her motion to designate her docketing statement as her opening brief is GRANTED; to the extent that her pleadings can be construed as a motion to supplement the record, that motion is DENIED; and all other motions are DENIED. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
