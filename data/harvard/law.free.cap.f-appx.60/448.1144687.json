Bennafield was convicted under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a) (2000) of simple possession of at least five grams of a substance containing cocaine base, Count One, and simple possession of more than fifty grams of a substance containing cocaine base, Count Two. We affirmed Bennafield\u2019s conviction on Count Two, vacated as to Count One, and remanded for resentencing. <em>United States v. Bennafield, </em>287 F. 3d 320 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>___ U.S. ___, 123 S.Ct. 388, 154 L.Ed.2d 315 (2002). On remand, Bennafield was sentenced to 213 months imprisonment on Count Two. He moved to vacate the sentence, arguing that his conviction under the fourth sentence of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a) (2000) was improper because that offense is not a lesser included offense of the charge of the indictment, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) (2000). The district court denied that motion, and Bennafield appealed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-26\">Bennafield asserted the issue he now seeks to raise in his brief in his initial direct appeal. In considering this claim, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>we concluded that, to the extent the jury instruction on simple possession was error, it was invited. <em>Id. </em>at 325. Accordingly, we declined to decide whether the offense stated in the fourth sentence of \u00a7 844(a) is a lesser included offense of \u00a7 841(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Under the mandate rule, the district court was \u201cbound to carry the mandate of the upper court into execution and could not consider the questions which the mandate laid at rest.\u201d <em>Sprague v. Ticonic Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>307 U.S. 161, 168, 59 S.Ct. 777, 83 L.Ed. 1184 (1939). \u201c[Wjhere an issue was ripe for review at the time of an initial appeal but was nonetheless foregone, the mandate rule generally prohibits the district court from reopening the issue on remand unless the mandate can reasonably be understood as permitting it to do so.\u201d <em>United States v. Ben Zvi, </em>242 F.3d 89, 95 (2d Cir.2001); <em>see also United States v. Aramony, </em>166 F.3d 655, 662 (4th Cir.1999). A district court may consider issues foreclosed by the mandate in the following \u201cextraordinary circumstances:\u201d (1) change in controlling legal authority, (2) significant new evidence, or (3) a blatant error resulting in serious injustice. <em>United States v. Bell, </em>5 F.3d 64, 67 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Here, our mandate vacated the conviction of Count One, affirmed the conviction of Count Two, and remanded for resentencing. Accordingly, Bennafield is not entitled to review of his conviction on Count Two unless he can show \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d Because Bennafield has failed to show such circumstances, the district court properly followed the terms of our mandate and declined to consider Bennafield\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Therefore, we affirm in Bennafield\u2019s conviction and sentence on Count Two. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
