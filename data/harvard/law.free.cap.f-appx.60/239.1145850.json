The next year he challenged the validity of his guilty plea in a <em>pro se </em>motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The district court denied the motion in an order entered June 10, 2002. Movant now seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) from this court, so that he may appeal the district court\u2019s decision. He has also filed a motion to convert his \u00a7 2255 motion into a direct appeal. We deny the request for a COA and Movant\u2019s motion to convert.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-15\">The Government began its prosecution of Movant in November 1996, when it charged him with several drug-trafficking offenses. Three different court-appointed lawyers represented Movant at various points over the next four years. In 2000, Movant entered into an agreement with the Government, under which he pleaded guilty to one conspiracy count. The Government, in turn, agreed to move to reduce Movant\u2019s sentence on the basis of substantial assistance, under USSG \u00a7 5K1.1. The parties stipulated to a sentence of 180 months. The district court granted the \u00a7 5K1.1 reduction and sentenced Movant to 180 months in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-16\">In attacking his guilty plea, Movant makes the following allegations: (1) that the trial court overlooked defense counsel\u2019s lack of preparation, and that Movant\u2019s guilty plea was thus involuntary because he was constructively denied counsel; (2) that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney did not pursue an argument that the Government had breached its cooperation agreement with him; (3) that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to explain the potential significance of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), to his case; (4) that he received ineffective assis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>tance of counsel because his attorney improperly assessed whether Movant\u2019s right to a speedy trial had been violated and failed to preserve this argument; (5) that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because his attorney failed to prepare adequately for a hearing concerning whether the Government had breached its plea agreement with Movant; (6) that the district court violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 by involving itself in plea negotiations; (7) that the district court failed to explain to Movant the elements of the offense of conspiracy; (8) that the district court failed to determine whether there was a factual basis for Movant\u2019s guilty plea; and (9) that the excessive duration of his pretrial detention rendered his guilty plea involuntary and interfered with his right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2), one seeking a COA must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d Here, the district court reached the merits of Movant\u2019s claims in denying his \u00a7 2255 motion. Under these circumstances, \u201c[t]he [movant] must demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). We recognize that in determining whether the district court\u2019s \u201cresolution was debatable amongst jurists of reason,\u201d we should not undertake a \u201cfull consideration of the factual or legal bases adduced in support of the claims.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 1039, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). Rather, \u201c[t]he COA determination under \u00a7 2253(c) requires an <em>overview </em>of the claims in the habeas petition and a general assessment of their merits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). This we now proceed to do. Our review of the district court\u2019s decision in this case leads us to conclude that the court\u2019s evaluation of Movant\u2019s motion was neither debatable nor wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">In its discussion of Movant\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court observed that Movant\u2019s allegations could be grouped into three main claims \u2014 a claim \u201cthat his plea was involuntary because he was under duress and frustrated with his inability to assert his rights,\u201d a claim \u201cthat there was no factual basis for his guilty plea,\u201d and \u201cthe ineffective assistance of counsel claim, [which] includes a number of subparts.\u201d District Court Order at 3. The court began its analysis by addressing whether there was a factual basis for the plea. It noted that the record contradicted Movant\u2019s assertion that his plea to the conspiracy charge was not factually supported. The plea agreement set forth detailed facts showing that Movant\u2019s conduct met the elements of conspiracy. At the plea hearing Movant stated that he believed that he was guilty of the conspiracy charge, and the Government described the factual basis for the conspiracy charge. The district court therefore rejected Movant\u2019s claim that there was insufficient factual support for the guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">Next, the district court considered Movant\u2019s claim that his plea was involuntary, in light of his frustration with his inability to assert his rights. According to the court, this claim amounted to a variation on Mov\u2022ant\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims. Movant alleges that he felt pressure to plead guilty because he was not being adequately represented by his lawyers. The district court noted that in considering such a claim, \u201cthe plea will be deemed constitutionally involuntary only when the attorney is held to have been constitutionally ineffective.\u201d <em>Worthen v. Meachum, </em>842 F.2d 1179, 1184 (10th Cir.1988) (overruled on other grounds by <em>Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>The district court thus turned to its consideration of Movant\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel arguments. The court began its analysis by citing the standard provided in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Under <em>Strickland </em>a movant \u201cmust show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient,\u201d in that the performance \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d and the movant \u201cmust show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 687-688. When a guilty plea is being challenged, the establishment of prejudice requires \u201cshowfing] that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 59, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">In this case the district court determined that Movant failed to demonstrate that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel. The court pointed out that Movant\u2019s attorneys \u201cfiled at least sixty pretrial motions during the course of this criminal prosecution,\u201d including \u201cmotions arguing that his speedy trial rights had been violated and seeking to enforce the terms of a plea offer that included a shorter sentence.\u201d Order at 5. The court also found that Movant\u2019s \u201callegation that his third attorney failed to advise him of the <em>Apprendi </em>decision does not demonstrate ineffective assistance because <em>Apprendi </em>is not applicable.\u201d Order at 6. The Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Apprendi </em>extends only to factual determinations that would increase a criminal sentence beyond the statutory maximum. 530 U.S. at 490. Here, the district court noted, Movant \u201cwas sentenced to a term of imprisonment that is less than the lowest possible statutory maximum for his drug conspiracy.\u201d Order at 6. As for Movant\u2019s contention that his third attorney had been unprepared to proceed to trial, the district court found that this allegation was \u201cvague and conclusory and lackfed] any evidentiary support.\u201d Order at 5. Likewise, the district court stated that any additional ineffective-assistance-of-counsel arguments that the Movant was asserting were \u201cvague and conclusory and lack[ed] evidentiary support.\u201d Order at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">Having reviewed Movant\u2019s \u00a7 2255 claims, we find persuasive the district court\u2019s reasoning in rejecting those claims. We note, however, one particular ground on which he has argued that his plea was involuntary. Movant contends that the trial court improperly involved itself in the negotiations leading to the plea agreement in this case, in violation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(e)(1). Movant apparently argues that he felt pressure to enter the plea agreement because the trial court was treating as a foregone conclusion the idea that Movant would plead guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">Rule 11(e)(1) makes clear that \u201c[t]he court shall not participate in any discussions between the parties concerning any ... plea agreement.\u201d We recognize the important justifications for this rule. In this case, however, Movant has not established that the trial court took part in any conduct that violated Rule 11(e)(1). Movant has identified the following comments as reflecting the trial court\u2019s improper participation in plea negotiations. During a status hearing, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-8\">Now, as you are aware, we had a lengthy hearing for two days in November on the wiretap issues which involve these defendants and defendants in some other cases, and the Court took that under advisement; but basically, I stopped reading the materials because you told me that in fact you were close to reaching an out of court disposition or settlement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>In the meantime, [the attorney for one of Movant\u2019s co-defendants has] filed a variety of new motions, and I\u2019m concerned about where this case stands. So I want to know what\u2019s going to happen. Are you going to settle the case or do we need to hear it out and plead a hearing on the motions and get it set for trial?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">District Court Record, Govt.App., Doc. No. 979 at 227. We do not believe that these comments can be read as an improper effort to encourage Movant to accept a plea bargain instead of proceeding to trial. Although the court inquired into whether the parties were likely to reach an agreement, it accepted the possibility that the case would go to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">We conclude that Movant has failed to make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right, as required under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). Accordingly, we DENY Movant\u2019s request for a COA. Movant\u2019s motion for leave to proceed without prepayment of costs and fees is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">As we noted above, Movant has filed with this court a motion to convert his \u00a7 2255 motion into a direct appeal. The appeal before us at this time concerns the district court\u2019s ruling on Movant\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. It appears that no appeal from the Movant\u2019s original sentence was docketed with this court. Regardless of the merits of Movant\u2019s grounds for arguing that he should now be granted leave to pursue a direct appeal, he did not raise that issue before the district court. He must initiate in district court any proceedings directed toward securing a new opportunity to appeal his original sentence. <em>See Tele-Communications, Inc. v. Commissioner, </em>104 F.3d 1229, 1232 (10th Cir.1997) (\u201cGenerally, an appellate court will not consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d). Thus, Movant\u2019s motion to convert his \u00a7 2255 application into a direct appeal is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b272-13\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
