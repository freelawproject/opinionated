We have jurisdiction pursuant to 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1153(a) and 44709(f), and we deny Robbins\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">Robbins argues that the NTSB erred by affirming the ALJ\u2019s decision to take notice of Federal Aviation Regulations which establish that Robbins\u2019s admittedly fraudulent entry in an aircraft maintenance log was in a report that was \u201crequired to be made\u201d in violation of 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 43.12(a)(1), rather than requiring the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to prove this fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">Robbins\u2019s argument is without merit because \u00a7 43.12(a)(1) prohibits \u201c[a]ny fraudulent or intentionally false entry in any record or report that is required to be made, kept, or used to show compliance with any requirement under this part....\u201d 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 43.12(a)(1). In addition, 14 C.F.R. \u00a7 43.11 requires that a person performing the type of annual inspection at issue here \u201cshall make an entry in the maintenance record of that equipment\u201d detailing the type of inspection performed and the date of that inspection. <em>See </em>14 C.F.R. \u00a7 43.11(a)(1) and (a)(2). Thus, under the plain language of \u00a7\u00a7 43.11 and 43.12 the false entry made by Robbins was required to be made in the aircraft\u2019s maintenance records to show compliance with federal aviation regulations. Accordingly, the Administrator did not need to enter the federal aviation regulations into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b716-13\">Robbins argues that the \u201cgood moral character\u201d requirement for holders of an Airline Transport Phot (ATP) certificate is unconstitutionally vague and violates due process because it did not provide Robbins with \u201cfair and explicit notice\u201d of the conduct that would violate the requirement. <em>See </em>14 C.F.R. \u00a7 61.153(c). We decline to reach this issue as NTSB precedent supports the revocation of all of Robbins\u2019s airman certificates solely on the basis of his violation of \u00a7 43.12(a)(1). <em>See Administrator v. Stanberry, </em>7 N.T.S.B. 934, at *1-3 (1991) (revoking airman certificates, including pilot and mechanic privileges, for participation in insurance fraud by altering aircraft\u2019s markings and symbols); <em>Administrator v. Barron, </em>5 N.T.S.B. 256, at *1 (1985) (revoking both pilot and medical certificates of airman who had withheld three drunk driving convictions when filling out the FAA\u2019s medical application).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-14\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b716-15\">Robbins argues that the NTSB erred by affirming the ALJ\u2019s denial of his motion to continue the administrative hearing to allow the Administrator more time to produce the airplane and maintenance log at issue pursuant to Robbins\u2019s discovery request. Robbins cites no authority to support his argument that the NTSB acted arbitrarily and capriciously in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>affirming the ALJ\u2019s decision, and there is no basis for so holding as the Administrator was not in control or possession of either the aircraft or the maintenance log.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Finally, Robbins argues that the Administrator could have produced the aircraft pursuant to authority under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44709(a). Because Robbins did not raise this argument before the NTSB, nor has he shown a reasonable ground for not doing so, we do not have jurisdiction to reach this issue. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(4); <em>Reid v. FAA, </em>765 F.2d 1457, 1462 (9th Cir.1985) (declining to rule on questions of statutory interpretation where the petitioner did not show a reasonable ground for not asserting the issue before the NTSB).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b716-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
