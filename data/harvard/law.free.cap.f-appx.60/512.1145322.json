Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-26\">On appeal, Carter contends his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary. Because Carter did not move to withdraw his guilty plea in the district court, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 527 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>___ U.S. ___, 123 S.Ct. 200, 154 L.Ed.2d 169 (2002). A thorough review of the record reveals no plain error, and we find Carter\u2019s plea was knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-29\">Carter also challenges the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines. Because we conclude Carter knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal his sentence, his challenge to the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines is waived. <em>United States v. Wiggins, </em>905 F.2d 51, 53 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-30\">Accordingly, we affirm Carter\u2019s conviction and sentence.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b544-19\"> We deny the Government's motion to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
