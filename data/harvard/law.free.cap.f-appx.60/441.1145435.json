In November 1993, Killian pled guilty to four counts relating to bank robbery and unlawful use of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1); 924(c)(1); 2113(d)(2000). Killian\u2019s plea agreement contained a provision stating: \u201cThe defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>dant knowingly and expressly waives the right to contest either the conviction or the sentence in any post-conviction proceedings, including, but not limited to, any proceeding under Title 28, United States Code, Section 2255, except with respect to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel or prosecutorial conduct.\u201d We therefore grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal based upon Killian\u2019s waiver of his appellate rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Killian\u2019s appointed counsel filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that there are no meritorious issues presented on appeal but raising the question whether the district court\u2019s failure to produce a transcript of Killian\u2019s plea hearing mandated that this Court vacate Killian\u2019s guilty plea and remand for another plea hearing. Killian also filed a pro se supplemental brief, raising a similar argument and other issues. The Government filed a response to the <em>Anders </em>brief, agreeing that no meritorious issues are presented in Killian\u2019s appeal. Six days later, the Government filed a motion to dismiss Killian\u2019s appeal, claiming Killian waived his right to appeal in his plea agreement. Killian\u2019s counsel filed a response to the motion to dismiss, stating he did not take a position on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">In <em>United States v. Brown, </em>232 F.3d 399, 403 (4th Cir.2000), this Court held that \u201ca defendant may not appeal his sentence if his plea agreement contains an express and unqualified waiver of the right to appeal, unless that waiver was unknowing or involuntary.\u201d <em>See also United States v. Wessells, </em>936 F.2d 165, 167 (4th Cir.1991); <em>United States v. Wiggins, </em>905 F.2d 51, 53 (4th Cir.1990). Killian has presented no evidence that his decision to substantially waive his appellate rights was unknowing or unintelligent. Indeed, when given the opportunity to withdraw his plea at sentencing, he declined to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Thus, Killian\u2019s appeal is foreclosed by the appellate waiver he knowingly signed in his plea agreement. The only exceptions to a valid waiver are for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and prosecutorial misconduct. However, Killian does not raise either of those claims, and we conclude the issues he does assert do not fall within one of the exceptions to Killian\u2019s valid waiver of appellate rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">Accordingly, we grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss and dismiss Killian\u2019s appeal. We deny Killian\u2019s motion to strike the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss. We have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from repre sentation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
