We affirm. Because the parties are famil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>iar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we will not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Evidence of poverty is inadmissible to prove motive. <em>United States v. Romero-Avila, </em>210 F.3d 1017, 1022 (9th Cir.2000). Contrary to Hollingsworth\u2019s contention, a review of the record shows that the government did not use the evidence of Hollingsworth\u2019s unemployment to argue impermissibly, or even imply, that Hollingsowrth was poor and thus had motive to commit the crime. Therefore, the district court did not err by admitting evidence of Hollingsworth\u2019s unemployment.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">A prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination or comments highlighting the weaknesses in the defendant\u2019s case do not shift the burden to the defendant so long as: (1) the comments do not call attention to the defendant\u2019s failure to testify; (2) the prosecutor does not argue that failure to explain the weaknesses requires a guilty verdict; and (3) the prosecutor reiterates that the burden of proof is on the government. <em>United States v. Vaandering, </em>50 F.3d 696, 701-02 (9th Cir.1995). Here, Hollingsworth testified; the prosecutor never argued that Hollingsworth\u2019s inability to show proof that he went to the dentist in Tijuana by itself proved that he was guilty. The prosecutor, and judge, repeatedly stated that the burden of proof is on the government and Hollingsworth had no burden or duty to produce any evidence. Thus, the burden did not shift and there was no prosecutorial misconduct warranting reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Our review of the record satisfies us that there was no violation of <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976). <em>See United States v. Velarde Gomez, </em>269 F.3d 1023, 1029 n. 1 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">The district court did not err by denying Hollingsworth\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the grand jury was improperly instructed as to its duties. That argument is foreclosed by our recent decision in <em>United States v. Marcucci, </em>299 F.3d 1156 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">Likewise, Hollingsworth\u2019s argument that the statutes under which he was convicted are unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), is foreclosed by our recent decisions. <em>See United States v. Buckland, </em>277 F.3d 1173 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc), <em>as amended and superceded by </em>289 F.3d 558 <em>and cert. denied, </em>535 U.S. 1105, 122 S.Ct. 2314, 152 L.Ed.2d 1067 (2002) (\u00a7 841); <em>United States v. Mendoza-Paz, </em>286 F.3d 1104, 1110 (9th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>___ U.S. ___, 123 S.Ct. 573, 154 L.Ed.2d 459 (2002) (\u00a7 960); <em>United States v. Varela-Rivera, </em>279 F.3d 1174, 1175 n. 1 (9th Cir.2002) (\u00a7 952). Nor does mens rea as to drug type and quantity have to be alleged in the indictment or found by a jury. <em>United States v. Carranza, </em>289 F.3d 634, 644 (9th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>___ U.S. ___, 123 S.Ct. 572, 154 L.Ed.2d 458 (2002). Thus, the district court did not err in denying Hollingsworth\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment based on these grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-16\">Finally, the district court did not err when it denied Hollingsworth\u2019s Fed. R.Crim.P. 29 motion for judgment of acquittal because the evidence was sufficient to sustain his convictions for importation of marijuana and possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b210-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
