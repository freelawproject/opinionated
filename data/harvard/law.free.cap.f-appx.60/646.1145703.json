The written plea agreement contained an appeal waiver in which Mr. Alejandrez agreed not to appeal his sentence unless the sentencing judge departed upward, or imposed a sentence in excess of the statutory maximum or a sentence in violation of law apart from the Guidelines. On appeal, counsel has moved to withdraw and has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Mr. Alejandrez has filed a pro se supplemental brief, arguing that the district court erred in not granting him a 2-level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(6), and also in not granting a substantial-assistance departure. After careful review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-15\">We conclude that the plea agreement\u2019s sentence-appeal waiver should be enforced. Mr. Alejandrez acknowledged his understanding of the appeal waiver at the plea hearing and the sentence imposed was not inconsistent with the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Morrison, </em>171 F.3d 567, 568 (8th Cir.1999) (appeal waiver enforced where its language was clear, court brought waiver to defendant\u2019s attention at plea hearing, defendant acknowledged he was waiving appeal rights, and sentence imposed was not contrary to plea agreement). Therefore, we will not entertain Mr. Alejandrez\u2019s sentencing arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-16\">Upon reviewing the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous unwaived issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm. We also grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-17\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b679-13\">.
