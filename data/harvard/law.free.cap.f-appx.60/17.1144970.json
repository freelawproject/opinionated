We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. We review the district court\u2019s denial of a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility for clear error, <em>United States v. Scrivener, </em>189 F.3d 944, 947 (9th Cir.1999), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-16\">Morin contends that the district court\u2019s refusal to apply a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 was error because its decision was based solely on his assertion of an entrapment defense. Where a defendant presents an entrapment defense, \u201cthe sentencing judge must look at all the evidence bearing on the defendant\u2019s contrition.\u201d <em>United States v. Ing, </em>70 F.3d 553, 556 (9th Cir.1995). Here, the record shows that Morin attempted to minimize his own involvement in the offense, denied an intention to commit the offense in the United States, and blamed law enforcement officials. Thus, the district court\u2019s conclusion that Morin\u2019s conduct was \u201cincompatible\u201d with acceptance of responsibility does not amount to clear error. <em>See Scrivener, </em>189 F.3d at 948 (defendant\u2019s attempts to minimize his own involvement and blame his son were inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility); <em>United States v. Marquardt, </em>949 F.2d 283, 285 (9th Cir.1991) (per curiam) (affirming refusal to apply downward adjustment where defendant indicated that he had not intended to violate the law and that the authorities \u201csteered\u201d him toward child pornography).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b50-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
