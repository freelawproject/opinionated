We find that substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s decision that Davies\u2019 failure to notify the INS of address changes was willful and not reasonably excusable. We further find we are without jurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s discretionary decision that Davies was ineligible for suspension of deportation or voluntary removal. <em>Okpa v. INS, </em>266 F.3d 313, 317 (4th Cir.2001). Finally, we find substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that Davies did not establish good moral character.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-22\">Therefore, we deny Davies\u2019 petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-23\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
