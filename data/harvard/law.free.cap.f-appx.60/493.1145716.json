We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-23\">Fultz contends <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) (holding any fact, other than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>prior conviction, that increases criminal penalty beyond prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to jury and proved beyond reasonable doubt), requires sentencing factors such as career offender status be alleged in the indictment, submitted to a jury, and proven beyond a reasonable doubt. We have previously held sentencing factors are not required to be alleged in the indictment or submitted to the jury. Fultz was sentenced within the statutory maximum, and <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply. <em>See United States v. Kinter, </em>235 F.3d 192, 200 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Fultz\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
