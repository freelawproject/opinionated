The petition for review is untimely as to the March 21, 2002, order affirming the immigration judge\u2019s order denying their application for asylum and withholding of deportation. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405-06, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-20\">The petition for review is timely as to the Board\u2019s denial of the motion for reconsideration. We have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(b)(2) (2002); <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); <em>Yanez-Popp v. INS, </em>998 F.2d 231, 234 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-21\">We deny as untimely the petition for review as to the Board\u2019s order of March 21, 2002. We deny the petition for review upon finding that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for reconsideration. We deny the motion for summary affirmance. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-22\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
