Jurisdiction over appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>from the Bankruptcy Court is retained by the B.A.P unless a separate written statement is filed pursuant to Fed. R. Bankr.P. 8001(e), which states: \u201cAn election to have an appeal heard by the district court ... may be made <em>only </em>by a statement of election contained in a separate writing filed within the time prescribed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(c)(1).\u201d (emphasis added). <em>See In re Ioane, </em>227 B.R. 181 (9th Cir.BAP1998) (Rule 8001(e)\u2019s contemporaneous \u201cseparate written filing\u201d requirement to be construed literally). Rule 8001(e)\u2019s separate written document requirement is mandatory and jurisdictional. Appellant\u2019s appeal can only be heard in the B.A.P, not the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">The District Court denied Schafler\u2019s motion to dismiss her Chapter 7 petition and revoke the discharge of her debts. This motion amounts to an appeal of the September 21, 1999, order of the Bankruptcy Court denying Schafler\u2019s original motion to dismiss. Fed. R. Bank. Proc. 8002(a) provides a 10-day period for appeals from an order of the Bankruptcy Court. Appellant missed the 10 day deadline by more than two and a half years, so the District Court lacked jurisdiction to hear the motion. <em>See </em>1 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>\u00b6 5.05[1] (Alan N. Resnick <em>&amp; </em>Henry J. Sommer eds., 15th ed. rev. 2002) (\u201cThe 10-day period of rule 8002(a) is jurisdictional.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">Since the District Court did not properly have jurisdiction to hear Appellant\u2019s claims, the decisions of the District Court in this appeal are</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">VACATED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b727-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b727-24\">. To the extent that Schafler\u2019s briefing indicates that there are other matters on appeal, these issues are addressed by unpublished memorandum dispositions in cases 02-16695, 01-16250, 01-16270, 01-17516, and 02-15619 issued by this panel on _, 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
