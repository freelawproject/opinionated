Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we do not recite them unless necessary. We reverse and remand for award of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">We have long assessed disability-benefit eligibility under a five-part test. <em>See, e.g., Bustamante v. Massanari, </em>262 F.3d 949, 953-54 (9th Cir.2001); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(f). Both sides agree that the dispute arises at step five of the five-step test, where the burden has shifted to the Commissioner to show that Panozzo has the residual functional capacity to perform some other substantial gainful activity on a \u201cregular and continuing basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>During Panozzo\u2019s disability hearing, the Commissioner\u2019s vocational expert acknowledged that there would be no full-time jobs for someone with all of Panozzo\u2019s attributes if extended rest breaks were needed. Panozzo testified that he needed extended rest breaks, but the ALJ rejected Panozzo\u2019s testimony. This rejection of Panozzo\u2019s subjective pain testimony was not in accord with the legal standard for discrediting claimant testimony when there is no affirmative evidence of malingering. \u201cOnce a claimant produces medical evidence of an underlying impairment [as Panozzo has], the Commissioner may not discredit the claimant\u2019s testimony as to the severity of symptoms merely because they are unsupported by objective medical evidence.\u201d <em>Reddick v. Chater, </em>157 F.3d 715, 722 (9th Cir.1998) (citing <em>Bunnell v. Sullivan, </em>947 F.2d 341, 343 (9th Cir.1991) <em>(en banc)). </em>\u201cUnless there is affirmative evidence showing that the claimant is malingering, the Commissioner\u2019s reasons for rejecting the claimant\u2019s testimony must be \u2018clear and convincing.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 834 (9th Cir.1995)); <em>see also Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1283-84 (9th Cir.1996). \u201cGeneral findings are insufficient; rather, the ALJ must identify what testimony is not credible and what evidence undermines the claimant\u2019s complaints.\u201d <em>Lester, </em>81 F.3d at 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-12\">Here, the ALJ, citing SSR 96-7p, made one finding suggesting malingering and several findings suggesting lack of credibility as to symptom severity. In the end, none are supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-13\"><em>First, </em>the ALJ suggested Panozzo was malingering because his \u201cuse of the cane for support defies credulity. There is no impairment of the lower extremities or spine which would warrant any need for an assistive device.... \u201d That was not true. Panozzo had back problems, supported in the record by x-rays and Dr. Phillips\u2019s cervical spondylosis diagnosis. Moreover, Panozzo testified that he \u201cuse[d] [the cane] everyday for support and especially when [he] get[s] so tight that [the pain] goes down [his] back, the muscles tighten up down into [his] back and when it gets [t]o his hips it\u2019s like a clamp pulling [him] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>forward.\u201d ER 117. Based on the record, Panozzo\u2019s use of a cane was not affirmative evidence of malingering.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\"><em>Second, </em>the ALJ noted Panozzo\u2019s medical treatment was \u201croutine, conservative and infrequent.\u201d But the ALJ did not suggest what further treatment would be appropriate. Panozzo has been seen by many doctors since 1992, and had at least 15 visits in the 1994-1998 period. It appears he followed his treating physician\u2019s advice to see him every three to six months; he saw Dr. Phillips at least 9 times from January 1995 through 1997. <em>See Regennitter v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>166 F.3d 1294, 1296 (9th Cir.1999) (\u201cParticularly because none of the many physicians Regennitter has seen has suggested effective treatment for his pain, the amount of medical treatment Regennitter has received is not necessarily inconsistent with his complaints.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\"><em>Third, </em>the ALJ noted, \u201che testified that he washes dishes, drives an automobile, prunes rose bushes, and goes grocery shopping with his wife.\u201d But these findings are somewhat misleading. Panozzo testified that he did no housework at all. ER 117. He said that he helped his wife with the dishes. ER 118. He said he did not do any sweeping. <em>Id. </em>When asked if he did \u201cany yard work,\u201d he responded, \u201cI try to do a little pruning on rose bushes, little bushes that I have at the house when I\u2019m capable of doing so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As for shopping, Panozzo noted that he did some but qualified this admission by stating he goes for a \u201chalf hour\u201d and his wife \u201cdoes the heavy shopping by herself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>With regard to driving, Panozzo said he gets \u201call tight and cramped up\u201d after even a \u201chalf hom'\u201d period. ER 120. These activities are not inconsistent with Panozzo\u2019s claimed need to rest during the day. \u201cOnly if the level of activity were inconsistent with Claimant\u2019s claimed limitations would these activities have any bearing on Claimant\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>Reddick, </em>157 F.3d at 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">In sum, none of the ALJ\u2019s findings detract from Panozzo\u2019s credibility on his need to rest. Because the Commissioner failed to meet her burden of showing Panozzo had the residual functional capacity to work full-time, and the record is fully developed, we reverse and remand for award of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b122-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b123-10\">BEEZER, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A3m\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">When an ALJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and is not based on legal error, it should not be disturbed. <em>Magallanes v. Bowen, </em>881 F.2d 747, 750 (9th Cir.1989). The district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for the Commissioner of Social Security was correct and should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-12\">The ALJ is responsible for making credibility determinations. <em>Reddick v. Chater, </em>157 F.3d 715, 722 (9th Cir.1998). If there is no affirmative evidence of malingering, the ALJ must present clear and convincing reasons for rejecting a claimant\u2019s testimony. <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 834 (9th Cir.1995). In this case there was both affirmative evidence of malingering and additional clear and convincing reasons for rejecting Panozzo\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-13\">The opinion of the court recognizes that the ALJ\u2019s determination that Panozzo uses a cane without any medical reason would be evidence of malingering, if supported by the record. The ALJ based its conclusion on Dr. Rand\u2019s 1995 report, which found that Panozzo\u2019s cervical spine had a full, active range of motion and did not discuss any lower extremity impairment. Dr. Rand noted that Panozzo purported to use a cane for balance, but did not note any medical need for a cane. Dr. Rand concluded in 1998 that Panozzo walked with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>out a limp or list, could move around without a problem, and was essentially the same as when Dr. Rand saw Panozzo in 1995. Although the opinion of the court points to other evidence that Panozzo had a back problem, the ALJ\u2019s determination to the contrary was based on substantial objective evidence. This is affirmative evidence of malingering.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">In addition, the ALJ considered other factors that undermined Panozzo\u2019s credibility. Adhering to the guidelines in Social Security Ruling 96-7p (\u201cSSR 96-7p\u201d) the ALJ considered:</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">(1) Panozzo\u2019s daily activities;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">(2) the supposed side effects of Panozzo\u2019s medication;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">(3) the infrequency of Panozzo\u2019s treatment compared with the level of his complaints.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">The ALJ followed SSR 96-7p closely. The ALJ recognized that although Panozzo claimed serious disability, his level of daily activity was fairly high. <em>See Fair v. Bowen, </em>885 F.2d 597, 603 (9th Cir.1989) (\u201c[I]f, despite his claims of pain, a claimant is able to perform household chores and other activities that involve many of the same physical tasks as a particular type of job, it would not be farfetched for an ALJ to conclude that the claimant\u2019s pain does not prevent the claimant from working.\u201d). Panozzo washed dishes, pruned rose bushes, cooked meals, operated a motor vehicle and attended to grocery shopping. Although Panozzo admittedly had some limitations in these activities, the ALJ appropriately recognized the inconsistency in Panozzo\u2019s activity level compared to Panozzo\u2019s claim that he was totally disabled in occupations for which he was qualified.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-13\">The ALJ also presented clear and convincing reasons for rejecting Panozzo\u2019s testimony that Panozzo needed to lie down for 3-4 hours each work day because of drowsiness from his medication. The ALJ observed that if Panozzo had adverse side-effects from his medications, he could be expected to have his medication regimen adjusted or changed to ameliorate the alleged side-effects. Panozzo\u2019s claims were less credible because there was no evidence that Panozzo had raised serious fatigue concerns with his physician since 1997, even though Panozzo claimed that the symptom continued to present.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-14\">The ALJ further recognized the inconsistency between Panozzo\u2019s routine treatment regime and Panozzo\u2019s subjective complaints. The ALJ stated that although Panozzo complains of chronic neck and left shoulder pain, Panozzo\u2019s medical treatment since his final surgery in October 1993 had been routine, conservative and infrequent given Panozzo\u2019s level of claimed pain and discomfort. Although the opinion of the court claims that fifteen doctors visits between 1994 and 1998 is not conservative, an average of only three doctors visits a year is routine and inconsistent with claims of debilitating and constant pain. By 1997, Dr. Philips, the treating physician, was recommending that Panozzo continue with his medications and return for doctor visits every six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>We are not triers of fact. The ALJ is the trier of fact. The ALJ made specific findings justifying his decision to disbelieve Panozzo\u2019s testimony of extreme symptoms. Those findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record. In this case, \u201cour role is not to second-guess that decision.\u201d <em>Fair, </em>885 F.2d at 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Because the ALJ did not commit legal error and the ALJ decision is supported by substantial evidence, I would affirm the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b124-9\">. \"CT]he adjudicator must consider in addition to the objective medical evidence when assessing the credibility of an individual's statements ...
