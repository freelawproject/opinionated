Defendant W. James Oelsner already has served his prison term but seeks reversal to avoid the consequences of his multi-million dollar fine and restitution. For reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-17\">Defendants West Indies Transport, Inc., WIT Equipment Co., and their former chief executive officer, W. James Oelsner, were convicted of violating environmental, tax, and immigration laws in connection with their recruitment and hiring of Filipino workers to repair barges damaged by Hurricane Hugo in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands. The District Court sentenced Oelsner to 37 months incarceration and ordered defendants to pay fines in excess of $4 million and restitution in excess of $1 million. In 1997, on direct appeal, we affirmed the conviction and sentence. <em>United States v. West Indies Transp., Inc., </em>127 F.3d 299 (3d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-18\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-19\">Defendants present five distinct claims in their \u00a7 2255 motion. Because these are new claims, not raised at trial or on direct appeal, we must determine whether they are procedurally barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-20\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-21\">Section 2255 provides a remedy where it appears that \u201ca defendant stands convicted of an act that the law does not make criminal.\u201d <em>Bousley v. United States, </em>523 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>U.S. 614, 620, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Here, defendants contend one of the government theories charged in the visa fraud counts meets that standard. Specifically, they argue the indictment and jury instructions wrongly interpreted the statutory boundaries of a D-l visa and thus failed to state an offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">Procedural default bars a defendant from raising new claims in his \u00a7 2255 motion. Defendants here contend their visa fraud claim, not raised at trial or on direct appeal, is not procedurally barred because the government failed to raise procedural default as an affirmative defense to their \u00a7 2255 motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The Supreme Court has determined that \u201cprocedural default is an affirmative defense for\u201d the government. <em>Gray v. Netherlands </em>518 U.S. 152, 165-66, 116 S.Ct. 2074, 135 L.Ed.2d 457 (1996).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Where the government fails to raise an affirmative defense in a timely manner, it \u201close[s] the right to assert the defense thereafter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Under Rule 8(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a litigant should assert an affirmative defense in the appropriate responsive pleading or risk waiving its right to assert the defense. <em>Eddy v. V.I. Water &amp; Power Auth., </em>256 F.3d 204, 209 (3d Cir.2001). But we have adopted a more flexible approach in defining the Supreme Court\u2019s \u201ctimely manner\u201d requirement. In <em>Charpentier v. Godsil, </em>937 F.2d 859 (3d Cir.1991), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-9\">Under Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a), a responsive pleading may be amended at any time by leave of court to include an affirmative defense, and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires. Unless the opposing party will be prejudiced, leave to amend should generally be allowed .... It has been held that a defendant does not waive an affirmative defense if he raised the issue at a pragmatically sufficient time, and [the plaintiff] was not prejudiced in its ability to respond.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 863-64 (internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">Here, defendants filed their original \u00a7 2255 motion pro se, stating \u201c[t]he evidence at trial failed to prove that Movants violated any crimes. The evidence actually showed that Movants did not commit any crimes.\u201d The government, in its responsive pleading, interpreted this claim as one of new evidence. Prior to the \u00a7 2255 hearing, the District Court appointed Benson B. Weintraub as counsel to Oelsner. Weintraub, in his brief to the District Court, explained the visa fraud claim as \u201ca claim that the indictment failed to state an offense [sic] against the United States\u201d that proves \u201cwhy defendants\u2019 conduct does <em>not </em>constitute a violation of the statutes and laws of the United States and the Virgin Islands.\u201d He drew attention to the government\u2019s and District Court\u2019s \u201cerroneous\u201d characterization of the visa fraud claim as one of new evidence: \u201c[d]efense counsel is in receipt of the Court\u2019s [Pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Hearing] Order dated May 22, 2000 and respectfully seeks modification of its terms to the extent that the defendant\u2019s pro se Eighth Amendment and actual innocence claims should be denominated as a claim that the indictment fails to state an offense against the United States and Virgin Islands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The government contends it sufficiently raised the affirmative defense of procedural default in its initial response to defendants\u2019 \u00a7 2255 motion. The relevant portion of the government\u2019s response reads: \u201cPetitioner seeks to litigate issues that could have been raised on direct appeal (in fact, many, but not all, of these issues were raised and litigated at the trial court level). Petitioner is barred from raising them in this forum by the doctrine of procedural default.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Even if this \u201caffirmative defense\u201d is not specific to Oelsner\u2019s particular claim here, the government contends Oelsner\u2019s visa fraud claim asserted on appeal bears little resemblance to the one raised in the pro se \u00a7 2255 motion. The government argued to the District Court that \u201c[t]he issue of [Oelsner\u2019s] innocence has already been litigated and these claims serve only to relitigate issues that have already been raised. [Oelsner] is thereby barred from raising these issues now.\u201d Believing the issue had been litigated, the government elected not to raise the affirmative defense of procedural default for this specific claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Although this matter is not free from doubt, we believe Oelsner raised a \u201cfailure to state an offense\u201d claim in his pro se \u00a7 2255 motion. Therefore, this claim, which has not changed appreciably since its inception in the pro se \u00a7 2255 motion, was framed sufficiently for the government to respond with an affirmative defense of procedural default. The government failed to properly do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">Where the government asserts an affirmative defense of procedural default, it bears the burden of proof. <em>See Bennett v. Mueller, </em>296 F.3d 752, 762 (9th Cir.2002) (\u201c[T]here is good reason to place the burden of proving adequacy on the state, the most obvious of which is that procedural default is an affirmative defense.\u201d); <em>Hooks v. Ward, </em>184 F.3d 1206, 1216-17 (10th Cir.1999) (\u201c[T]he state is undoubtedly in a better position to establish the regularity, consistency, and efficiency with which it has applied [its procedural bar] than are habeas petitioners, who often appear pro se, to prove the converse.\u201d). Under the facts here, we do not believe the government\u2019s general statement was sufficiently specific to raise an affirmative defense to warrant forfeiture of defendants\u2019 visa fraud claim. <em>See Boykins v. Wainwright, </em>737 F.2d 1539, 1545 <em>&amp; </em>n. 3 (11th Cir.1984) (rejecting affirmative defense where government\u2019s assertion did not identify the specific claim).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We will consider the merits of Oelsner\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">On direct appeal, we affirmed defendants\u2019 convictions for aiding and abetting visa fraud based on Oelsner\u2019s securing D-l visas for the company\u2019s Filipino workers. <em>West Indies Transp., </em>127 F.3d at 304. As we stated, D-l visas are intended for non-immigrant foreign maritime crewmen. <em>Id. </em>Federal law permits granting a D-l visa to \u201can alien crewman serving in good faith ... in a capacity required for normal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>operation and service on board a vessel, as defined in [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1288(a)].\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a). The statute expressly defines the key phrase \u201cnormal operation and service on board a vessel\u201d to exclude long-shore work (loading or unloading of cargo, handling of mooring lines on the dock), but is silent with respect to drydock or any other type of work. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1288(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">In their \u00a7 2255 motion, defendants allege the indictment and jury instructions improperly included a drydock theory of culpability. They contend the government\u2019s expert witness, Jeffrey Gorsky, who testified as to a D-l visa\u2019s restrictions, impermissibly relied on a State Department advisory opinion. They argue the District Court then erred by incorporating Gorsky\u2019s erroneous interpretation in its jury instructions. They contend that no statute or regulation prohibits drydock work for a foreign worker on a D-l visa. Because drydock work by aliens is not statutorily prohibited, defendants argue the indictment and jury instructions failed to state a valid offense and therefore their conviction rested on an erroneous interpretation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Counts 12-19 of the indictment charged that the alien crewmen engaged in activities \u201cnot required for the normal operation and services of a seagoing vessel, including but not limited to activities such as dry-docking and longshoreman work.\u201d In its jury instructions, the District Court said: \u201cI instruct you that in order to qualify for [a] crewman\u2019s visa, the crewman\u2019s work must be restricted to that which is necessary for the normal operation and service of a vessel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">The jury instructions also cited to State Department regulations \u201cspecify[ing] that crewman\u2019s [sic] visas are not to be issued for the purpose of having alien workers come to the United States to perform dry-docking or other work not associated with the normal operation and service of a vessel.\u201d Defendants contend the reference to drydock work in the indictment and jury instructions constitutes legal error.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">We believe defendants\u2019 interpretation of legal error is overly narrow. In this case, the focus of the indictment and jury instructions is on the phrase \u201cnormal operation and service on board a vessel.\u201d The statutory language defines those eligible for a D-l, or crewman\u2019s, visa as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVs\">an alien crewman serving in good faith as such in a capacity required for normal operation and service on board a vessel ... or aircraft, who intends to land temporarily and solely in pursuit of his calling as a crewman and to depart from the United States with the vessel or aircraft on which he arrived or some other vessel or aircraft.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(15)(D)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">The common thread in the statutory language, superseding indictment, and jury instructions is the reference to work restricted to \u201cnormal operation and service on board a vessel.\u201d The indictment al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>leged \u2014 and the evidence at trial amply demonstrated \u2014 that the Filipino workers for whom Oelsner secured D-l visas did not work in \u201cnormal operation and service on board a vessel.\u201d On the contrary, the evidence demonstrated that the Filipino workers performed road work, worked on land on containers that were used to house employees\u2019 automobiles, moved cargo, drove to the post office to receive parts, performed carpentry work on land, did mechanical work and servicing on vehicles, and performed maintenance work on shore. <em>See West Indies Transp., </em>127 F.3d at 303-04. They were never put to sea and they demonstrated no intent, as required by the statute, \u201cto depart from the United States with the vessel.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(15)(D)(i). This work was not within the \u201cnormal operation and service of a vessel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">On direct appeal, we determined \u201cdefendants\u2019 intention [was] to employ as dock workers illegally underpaid foreign workers housed permanently on derelict barges.\u201d <em>West Indies Transp., </em>127 F.3d at 306. We concluded the vessel \u201cwas used to house foreign workers, not as a means of transport.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 309. Defendants paid the Filipino workers approximately $400 per month for a 56-hour work week. <em>Id. </em>at 304. As we stated, \u201chad immigration officials known the true facts behind the Filipino workers\u2019 applications for visas ... the visas would never have been granted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 306. The evidence also demonstrated that defendants obtained visas in excess of the number of employees needed to crew the vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">As noted, the indictment here cited to activities of the alien crewmen that were \u201cnot required for the normal operation and services of a seagoing vessel.\u201d The relevant jury instructions charged \u201cthat in order to qualify for [a] crewman\u2019s visa, the crewman\u2019s work must be restricted to that which is necessary for the normal operation and service of a vessel.\u201d While both the indictment and jury instructions made reference to drydoek work, they clearly defined the offense as work not within \u201cthe normal operation and service of a vessel.\u201d There was ample evidence the alien crewmen here engaged in work not within the normal operation and service of a vessel. That is the relevant inquiry. The references to drydoek work were neither improperly confusing nor misleading, and they did not make the indictment and instructions legally invalid. At worst, there was harmless error, which did not substantially affect defendants\u2019 rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">Defendants claim prosecutorial misconduct during closing and rebuttal arguments deprived them of due process. Here, we believe defendants\u2019 failure to raise these claims at trial or on direct appeal is a procedural bar to a \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">Defendants contend the prosecutor\u2019s remarks in his closing and rebuttal arguments were \u201cinflammatory and misleading\u201d and argue the prosecutor \u201cmisrepresent[ed] and wrongly capitalized] upon a single brief statement of Mr. Oelsner during his testimony.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In his testimony, Oelsner referred to his employees as \u201cskinny Filipinos.\u201d Emphasizing Oelsner\u2019s disregard for his employees, the prosecutor referred to this testimony four times during his closing and rebuttal arguments, using the phrase \u201cskinny little Filipinos.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defendants\u2019 trial counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>never objected to the prosecutor\u2019s characterizations. Instead, defendants\u2019 counsel chose to note in closing argument that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were \u201ca very unnecessary appeal to a baser element and to a prejudice that doesn\u2019t have any place in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">In contrast to the visa fraud claim, the government properly raised an affirmative defense at the first opportunity, in its initial response to the \u00a7 2255 motion. The government noted Oelsner \u201cdid not raise [the prosecutorial misconduct] claim on direct review and has therefore committed a procedural default.\u201d The government properly asserted procedural default.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">A procedural default will bar review under \u00a7 2255 unless a defendant can establish cause for the waiver of procedural default and can show \u201cactual prejudice\u201d resulting from the alleged violation. <em>Reed v. Farley, </em>512 U.S. 339, 354, 114 S.Ct. 2291, 129 L.Ed.2d 277 (1994) (quoting <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 84, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977)). Oelsner\u2019s trial counsel testified he made a strategic decision to respond to the prosecutor\u2019s statements in his own closing rather than draw the jury\u2019s attention by objecting. This was reasonable, especially since the prosecutor\u2019s statements substantially repeated Oelsner\u2019s own testimony. In any event, we see no prejudice. Oelsner\u2019s claim of prosecutorial misconduct is procedurally barred.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">Defendants claim ineffective assistance of counsel at trial and sentencing, and on direct appeal. We find these claims lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">The Supreme Court has developed a two-part test for ineffective counsel claims. A defendant must prove: (1) counsel\u2019s performance was deficient; and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <em>see also United States v. Roberson, </em>194 F.3d 408, 418-19 (3d Cir.1999). There is \u201ca strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct f[ell] within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-11\">Defendants rest their ineffective assistance claim on the belief that trial counsel Moore should have hired an expert to counteract the government\u2019s expert on sentencing and to establish their inability to pay fines or restitution. At the \u00a7 2255 hearing, defendants offered the testimony of Alan Chaset, a post-conviction sentencing expert. Chaset contended a reasonable attorney would have hired an expert to counter the government\u2019s expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-12\">But trial counsel Moore convincingly testified at the \u00a7 2255 hearing that he did not hire an expert because of Oelsner\u2019s views. Oelsner\u2019s self-admitted primary concern was jail time, and Moore focused his resources on challenging the pre-sentencing recommendations for incarceration. Although the trial court suggested the government and the defense split the costs of a single expert to determine defendants\u2019 ability to pay fines or restitution, Moore testified that Oelsner opposed mak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>ing even a partial contribution and made clear his fear that further financial scrutiny might incriminate him more deeply. The government decided to pay for an expert itself. Moore\u2019s inability to convince Oelsner to hire his own expert was hardly unreasonable, especially in light of Oelsner\u2019s paramount financial, privacy, and self-incrimination concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Moore provided effective assistance during trial and sentencing, and on direct appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At sentencing, Moore successfully challenged the Pre-Sentence Investigation Report\u2019s recommendation of 63-78 months incarceration and secured a reduction in Oelsner\u2019s jail time to 37 months. Also, Moore successfully moved for dismissal of a Virgin Islands territorial criminal action against Oelsner. Even defendants\u2019 expert at the \u00a7 2255 hearing acknowledged Moore\u2019s success in reducing Oelsner\u2019s jail time.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Moore\u2019s conduct was hardly deficient. Thus, we need not reach the question of prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 687, 694. Defendants received effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">At sentencing, the government introduced a Price Waterhouse expert report assessing defendants\u2019 ability to pay a fine. As noted, the District Court subsequently imposed a fine in excess of $4 million and ordered more than $1 million in restitution. Defendants claim the Price Water-house report contained materially inaccurate information on which the District Court erroneously relied.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-12\">At the \u00a7 2255 hearing, defendants retained an accountant expert, Stanley Food-man, who testified to some purported inconsistencies within the Price Waterhouse report. On cross-examination, however, Foodman admitted he had not looked at evidence beyond the Price Waterhouse report itself. During the \u00a7 2255 hearing, the government effectively used other trial testimony \u2014 of which Foodman was unaware \u2014 to clarify the purported inconsistencies. Oelsner now attempts to argue the Price Waterhouse report is tainted because its author did government contract work as well. But Oelsner makes no showing of prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-13\">At sentencing, the District Court took into account the Price Waterhouse report and also looked to defendants\u2019 vessel assets, insurance proceeds, salary, and other income. We see no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-14\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-15\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b446-7\">. Even if the government raised its affirmative defense of procedural default before the District Court, defendants urge us to consider ineffective assistance of counsel as the cause for that default.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b446-8\">. Other courts of appeals have raised issues of procedural bar sua sponte. <em>E.g., Rosario v. United States, </em>164 F.3d 729, 732 (2d Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Talk, </em>158 F.3d 1064, 1067 (10th Cir.1998). They have done so out of concern for judicial efficiency and to protect the finality of federal criminal judgments. <em>Rosario, </em>164 F.3d at 732. But the Supreme Court has stated clearly that an appellate court is not \"required\u201d to raise the affirmative defense of procedural default sua sponte. <em>Trest v. Cain, </em>522 U.S. 87, 89, 118 S.Ct. 478, 139 L.Ed.2d 444 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b447-8\">. At least one appellate court has looked to a district court\u2019s decision and assumed a waiver of the affirmative defense where the district court ruled based on the substantive merits of the petition. <em>Pennington v. Spears, </em>779 F.2d 1505, 1506 (11th Cir.1986). Here, the District Court elected to decide the visa fraud claim on substantive, rather than procedural, grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b448-6\">. In <em>Griffin v. United States, </em>502 U.S. 46, 59, 112 S.Ct. 466, 116 L.Ed.2d 371 (1991), the Supreme Court noted the distinction between legal error, which requires vacation of a verdict, and insufficiency of proof, which does not. Where an indictment or set of jury instructions contain legal error, the Supreme Court has stated the following rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\">Jurors are not generally equipped to determine whether a particular theory of conviction submitted to them is contrary to law \u2014 \u2022 whether, for example, the action in question is protected by the Constitution, is time barred, or fails to come within the statutory definition of the crime. When, therefore, jurors have been left the option of relying upon a legally inadequate theory, there is no reason to think that their own intelligence and expertise will save them from that error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-14\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b449-7\">. Overall, defendants asserted forty-three different instances of prosecutorial misconduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b449-13\">. In rebuttal, the prosecutor also asserted that Oelsner \"rented his Filipino laborers by the pound.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b450-8\">. Even if this claim was not procedurally barred, the evidence is insufficient for Oelsner to meet his \u201cheavy burden\u201d to prove prosecutorial misconduct. <em>See United States v. Locascio, </em>6 F.3d 924, 945 (2d Cir.1993). This court has given prosecutors \"considerable latitude\u201d in laying out the evidence and suggesting to a jury that they may draw permissible inferences from the evidence. <em>E.g., United States v. Green, </em>25 F.3d 206, 210 (3d Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Werme, </em>939 F.2d 108, 117 (3d Cir.1991). Here, Oelsner created his own problem when he described his employees as \"skinny Filipinos\u201d during his testimony. We see no appreciable difference between skinny Filipinos and skinny little Filipinos.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b451-9\">. Defendants also claim ineffective assistance at trial and on direct appeal. Specifically, defendants cite Moore\u2019s failure to call an immigration expert at trial and his failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s allegedly inflammatory remarks. The reasonableness of each of these claims is addressed in Parts II and III, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b451-10\">. According to defendants, the District Court refused to consider this claim in their \u00a7 2255 motion, which resulted in a denial of due process.
