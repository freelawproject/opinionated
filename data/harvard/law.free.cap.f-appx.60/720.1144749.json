R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">Petitioner Martha Gilliam appeals the Tax Court\u2019s dismissal of her petition for failure to prosecute, its determination that petitioner owed deficiencies in federal income tax, and its imposition of sanctions. We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7482(a)(1) and AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b753-11\">Petitioner filed no federal income tax returns for tax years 1994, 1995, and 1996. During that period, she and her husband derived income from USA Printing, a business owned and operated by petitioner\u2019s husband. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue (\u201cthe Commissioner\u201d) calculated the income earned by petitioner and her husband and attributed to petitioner in a notice of deficiency her one-half share of community income under New Mexico community property law. N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 40-3-8 (1978). The Commissioner also assessed penalties against petitioner for failure to file tax returns, under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6651(a)(1), and for failure to pay estimated taxes, under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6654.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-15\">Gilliam petitioned the Tax Court, attacking the notice of deficiency on several grounds. In response to the Commissioner\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, petitioner filed a document characterized by the Tax Court as an amendment to the petition. In this document, in addition to reiterating her arguments attacking the notice of deficiency, petitioner argued that she owed no taxes under New Mexico\u2019s community property law and that the notice of deficiency violated her constitutional rights. Finding only the allocation of community property justiciable, the Tax Court denied the Commissioner\u2019s motion, but struck all petitioner\u2019s remaining arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-16\">After the case was set for trial, the Commissioner filed a \u201cMotion to Show Cause Why Proposed Facts in Evidence Should Not Be Accepted as Established\u201d because petitioner refused to respond to requests for admissions, refused to enter into a stipulation of facts for trial, and continued to insist that the community property laws did not apply to her.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Tax Court issued an order explaining to petitioner that, under New Mexico law, she owned half of the community income from USA Printing. The order also character<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>ized petitioner\u2019s remaining arguments as \u201cerroneous, irrelevant, frivolous, or unintelligible.\u201d The Tax Court granted the Commissioner\u2019s motion, and deemed the facts and evidence set forth in the proposed stipulation established.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">On April 22, 2002, petitioner and her husband appeared, proffering to the court a \u201cnotice of misprision of felony,\u201d which attacked the validity of the notice of deficiency because it was not contained in petitioner\u2019s \u201cindividual master file.\u201d Based upon petitioner\u2019s continued insistence \u2014 in the face of the court\u2019s order to the contrary \u2014 that she was not subject to New Mexico community property law, and upon her continued insistence \u2014 in the face of the court\u2019s explanation to the contrary\u2014 that the notice of deficiency was invalid, the Commissioner filed a motion for sanctions under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6673.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the hearing, petitioner stated as follows: \u201cI\u2019m not here to give testimony; I\u2019m giving you notice. This court has been served notice of misprision of felony and has a fiduciary duty.\u201d In response, the Tax Court indicated its familiarity with the record and reiterated to petitioner that she was mistaken as to the notice of deficiency. In addition, the Tax Court characterized petitioner\u2019s arguments as \u201cgibberish\u201d and repeatedly warned petitioner that she risked sanctions if she continued to press frivolous arguments, suggesting that petitioner should consult competent counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">The Commissioner orally moved for dismissal of the petition for lack of prosecution and submitted to the court a proposed decision, which included a reduction in deficiencies and penalties based upon the Commissioner\u2019s concession of part of the self-employment taxes included in the original notice of deficiency. The Tax Court granted the motion, dismissing the case \u201cby reason of petitioner\u2019s failure to comply with the Court\u2019s Orders and Rules and otherwise properly prosecute.\u201d The court also assessed section 6773 penalties of $10,000 for delay and for advancing frivolous arguments. On May 2, 2002, the Tax Court issued a written order formally dismissing the petition and imposing sanctions. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b754-10\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b754-11\">Petitioner contends that we review the Tax Court\u2019s order dismissing for failure to prosecute de novo. Petitioner is mistaken. \u201c[I]t is well established that every court has the inherent power, in the exercise of its discretion, to dismiss a case for want of prosecution and that an appellate court will not reverse such a dismissal in the absence of abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Ducommun v. C.I.R., </em>732 F.2d 752, 754 (10th Cir.1983) (reviewing the Tax Court\u2019s dismissal of petition) (citation omitted). We likewise review the Tax Court\u2019s imposition of section 6673 sanctions for abuse of discretion. <em>Fox v. C.I.R., </em>969 F.2d 951, 953 (10th Cir.1992) (citation omitted). Because petitioner appears pro se, we construe her allegations more liberally than we would those prepared on her behalf by an attorney. <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972); <em>Hunt v. Uphoff, </em>199 F.3d 1220, 1223 (10th Cir.1999) (citation omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>B. The Tax Court\u2019s Dismissal of Gilliam\u2019s Petition</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Under Tax Court Rule 123(b), the Tax Court may dismiss a petitioner\u2019s case and enter a decision against the petitioner \u201c[flor failure ... properly to prosecute or to comply with these Rules or any order of the Court.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7453. It is abundantly clear that the Tax Court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing petitioner\u2019s case. Petitioner neither entered into a stipulation of facts, as required by Tax Court Rule 90(c), nor responded to requests for admissions, as required by Tax Court Rule 91(f). <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7453. Further, as our summary of the history of this case indicates, petitioner has persistently advanced frivolous legal arguments, in direct contravention of the court\u2019s orders and in spite of the court\u2019s repeated attempts to direct petitioner to the proper law. The Tax Court was, therefore, justified in dismissing Gilliam\u2019s petition. <em>See, e.g., Ducommun, </em>732 F.2d at 754 (\u201c[DJefiance of the [Tax Court\u2019s] Rules and Orders justified the dismissal of [petitioner\u2019s] action[ ].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">C. Petitioner\u2019s 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.1402(a)-8 Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">On appeal, petitioner relies upon 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.1402(a)-8, which regulates attribution of community property income when calculating tax on self-employment, for the proposition that the Commissioner should not have attributed fifty percent of her husband\u2019s USA Printing income to petitioner. Petitioner also relies on the \u201cnon-frivolous\u201d character of this argument to challenge the Tax Court\u2019s imposition of sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">Petitioner\u2019s argument is without merit for two reasons. First, the Commissioner conceded the self-employment tax in its revised calculation of petitioner\u2019s deficiency. Second, 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.1402(a)-8 regulates only the self-employment tax, which \u201cconcerns a tax which is imposed <em>in addition to </em>an income tax.\u201d <em>Davis v. Comm\u2019r, </em>56 T.C.M. (CCH) 1178, 1180 (1989) (emphasis in original). \u201c[Section 1.1402(a)-8] applies only to the <em>self-employment tax </em>imposed by Title 26, Subtitle A, Chapter 2, section 1401 et seq., on self-employment income.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). It does not, therefore, apply to petitioner under the facts of this case, which concern her regular income tax. Perhaps anticipating our agreement with the Tax Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Davis, </em>petitioner challenges that reasoning and urges us not to follow the case. We agree, however, with the Tax Court that the regulation applies only to self-employment income. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">For these reasons, we find petitioner\u2019s reliance upon 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.1402(a)-8 unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-11\">D. Sanctions under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6673</p>\n<p id=\"b755-12\">Under section 6673, the Tax Court may impose sanctions whenever it appears to the court, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201cproceedings before it have been instituted or maintained by a taxpayer primarily for delay ... [or] the taxpayer\u2019s position in such proceeding is frivolous or groundless.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6673(a). In its decision, the Tax Court may impose sanctions of up to $25,000. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b755-13\">In support of her appeal of these sanctions, petitioner advances no credible argument that the Tax Court abused its discretion in imposing section 6673 sanctions. We have reviewed the record, including the transcripts of hearings before the Tax Court, in which the frivolous nature of petitioner\u2019s arguments and her lack of respect for the court, its rules, and its orders are abundantly clear. Based upon this review, and for the same reasons we articulated <em>supra </em>in Part II.B, we hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>that the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing $10,000 in section 6673 sanctions on petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">For the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM the Tax Court\u2019s dismissal of petitioner\u2019s claims and its imposition of sanctions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b753-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b753-13\">. The Commissioner based his motion on Tax Court Rules 90(c), under which matters contained in requests for admissions are deemed admitted if not timely answered, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7453, and 91(f), under which a motion for deemed admission of a proposed stipulation may be filed if a party has refused to participate in the stipulation process, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7453.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b754-6\">. Under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6673, the Tax Court may impose sanctions where proceedings are instituted primarily for delay or where a taxpayer's position is frivolous or groundless.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b754-12\">. For this reason, we treat petitioner\u2019s appeal of \"the Tax Court Order entered April 3rd, 2002\u201d as an appeal of the Tax Court's May 2, 2002, Order of Dismissal and Decision. The latter is an appealable final decision; the former is not.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
