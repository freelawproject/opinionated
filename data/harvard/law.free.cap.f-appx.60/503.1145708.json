He was sentenced to twenty-seven months in prison, to be followed by five years on supervised release. Raynor\u2019s supervised release term began in October 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>In July 2002, a probation officer filed a petition to revoke Raynor\u2019s supervision, citing numerous Grade B and C violations of conditions of release. Following a hearing at which Raynor admitted to all the charged violations, the district court revoked supervision and imposed a twenty-month term of imprisonment. Raynor timely appealed. Counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising one issue for review but stating that the appeal presents no meritorious issues. Raynor was advised of his right to file a pro se brief, but has filed nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">We review a sentence imposed upon revocation of supervised release for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642 (4th Cir.1995). Our thorough review of the <em>Anders </em>brief and the entire record discloses no reversible error. Because Raynor admitted to the charged violations, including the condition that he not commit a crime, the district court was authorized to revoke release and impose a prison term of up to five years. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1014, 3581(b)(1), 3583(b)(1), 3583(e)(3) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Relevant guideline policy statements suggest that, for a defendant such as Ray-nor with a criminal history category of V who has committed a Grade B violation of supervised release, an appropriate term of imprisonment is between eighteen and twenty-four months. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7\u00a7 7B1.1(a)(2) (p.s.), 7B1.4(a) (p.s.) (2001). Raynor\u2019s twenty-month sentence falls within this range and is well under the statutory maximum that could have been imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">At the revocation proceeding, the district court heard counsel\u2019s argument that imprisonment was not warranted because Raynor complied with the conditions of supervised release until he began experiencing medical and marital problems. However, the court found that Raynor\u2019s pattern of criminal conduct required that he serve additional time in prison. This did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">We therefore affirm. We have, as required by <em>Anders, </em>reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy of the motion was served on his client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal arguments are adequately presented in the materials before us and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
