We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo dismissals under 28 U. S.C. \u00a7 1915A for failure to state a claim. <em>Resnick v. Hayes, </em>213 F.3d 443, 447 (9th Cir.2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-24\">The district court properly dismissed Young\u2019s claims of denial of access to the courts, because he faded to show the denial of library photocopying services hindered his ability to pursue a legal claim, so as to constitute actual injury. <em>See Madrid v. Gomez, </em>190 F.3d 990, 996 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-25\">The district court properly dismissed Young\u2019s equal protection claim because Young did not allege that any adverse actions taken against him were on the basis of his membership in a protected class. <em>See Barren v. Harrington, </em>152 F.3d 1193, 1194-95 (9th Cir.1998)(order).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-26\">The district court properly dismissed Young\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim, because he did not allege prison officials acted with a sufficiently culpable state of mind. <em>See Johnson v. Lewis, </em>217 F.3d 726, 731 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-27\">Young\u2019s claim that the handling of his prison grievance violated due process fails because he has \u201cno legitimate claim of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>entitlement to a [prison] grievance procedure,\u201d <em>Mann v. Adams, </em>855 F.2d 639, 640 (9th Cir.1988), much less a timely one.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Young\u2019s claim of retaliation fails because his second amended complaint did not contain sufficient allegations that retaliation was a substantial or motivating factor on the part of prison librarians. <em>See Pratt v. Rowland, </em>65 F.3d 802, 806 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b197-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
