Because we conclude that Petitioner has failed to make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2), the request for a COA is denied and the matter is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-24\">Petitioner was convicted of one count of aggravated battery, nine counts of burglary, ten counts of theft, and one count of obstruction of a law enforcement officer. He was sentenced to 238 months\u2019 impris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>onment. Petitioner\u2019s convictions were affirmed on direct appeal to the Kansas Court of Appeals, and the Kansas Supreme Court denied his petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">On May 23, 2002, Petitioner filed this \u00a7 2254 petition alleging he was entitled to relief because of the following five errors at his trial: (1) the improper admission of uncharged-crime evidence, (2) a violation of the law-of-the-case doctrine, (3) the improper admission of an address book, entitled \u201cPrison Fellowship,\u201d (4) a prejudicial in-court identification, and (5) insufficient evidence to support his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">The magistrate reviewed the petition thoroughly and recommended that it be denied. After Petitioner filed no objections to the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation, the district court adopted its reasoning and conclusions and dismissed the petition. This request for a COA followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">The magistrate and district court reached Petitioner\u2019s first, fourth, and fifth constitutional claims on the merits, and concluded that the second and third were procedurally defaulted. To obtain a COA on the claims decided on the merits, Petitioner \u201cmust demonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). But \u201c[w]hen the district court denies a habeas petition on procedural grounds without reaching the prisoner\u2019s underlying constitutional claim, a COA should issue when the prisoner shows, at least, that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right <em>and </em>that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">In assessing whether Petitioner has made these showings, we do not undertake a \u201cfull consideration of the factual or legal bases adduced in support of the claims.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>___ U.S. ___, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 1039, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). Rather, \u201c[t]he COA determination under \u00a7 2253(c) requires an overview of the claims in the habeas petition and a general assessment of their merits.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">With these benchmarks in mind, we have reviewed Petitioner\u2019s brief, the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation, the district court\u2019s order, and the record on appeal. Petitioner has failed to \u201cdemonstrate that reasonable jurists would find the district court\u2019s assessment of the constitutional claims debatable or wrong,\u201d and he has not shown \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484. Therefore, for substantially the same reasons set forth in the magistrate\u2019s December 12, 2002, report and recommendation, and the district court\u2019s January 7, 2003, order, we DENY Petitioner\u2019s request for a COA. The matter is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
