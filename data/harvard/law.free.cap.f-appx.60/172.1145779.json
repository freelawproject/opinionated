We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-23\">The district court properly concluded that the magistrate judge had jurisdiction to conduct a bench trial on the petty offense charge without Park\u2019s consent. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(a)(3) &amp; (4); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3401(b); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 19 (defining petty offense); 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 261.1b (stating penalty for violations of Part 261 include imprisonment of not more than six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>months); <em>U.S. v. Clavette, </em>135 F.3d 1308, 1309 (9th Cir.1998) (\u201cAny offense punishable by a prison term of six months or less is presumed to be petty.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Because Park appeals his conviction, we view the record in the light most favorable to the Government and determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found the elements of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See U.S. v. Willfong, </em>274 F.3d 1297, 1300 (9th Cir.2001). The evidence supports a finding that Park camped within the boundaries of the Ashland Watershed.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Because Park did not object to the admission of Exhibits 2 and 3 or the testimony of witness Dalke at trial, we review the admission of this evidence for plain error. <em>See U.S. v. Tisor, </em>96 F.3d 370, 376 (9th Cir.1996). We find none.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">We review de novo whether the district court erred by failing to provide Park with a free transcript and must reverse unless the failure to do so was harmless error. <em>U.S. v. Devlin, </em>13 F.3d 1361, 1363 (9th Cir.1994). Because the district court had granted Park\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis, the court erred by denying his requests to be provided with the trial transcript. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3401(e) (stating that the court shall provide a transcript of a proceeding before a magistrate judge to a person who establishes the inability to pay); Fed.R.Crim.P. 58(g)(1)(C) (accord). However, because Park received the transcript and presented his arguments regarding alleged trial errors to this court, he has not been prejudiced and any error was harmless. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 1364-65 (concluding error not harmless where defendant established actual prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">We reject Park\u2019s contention that his prosecution violated due process or equal protection because the mere fact that he had previously filed a civil action against Ranger Linda Duffy was insufficient evidence that his prosecution was improperly motivated. <em>See U.S. v. Nance, </em>962 F.2d 860, 865 (9th Cir.1992) (per curiam); <em>see also U.S. v. Garza-Juarez, </em>992 F.2d 896, 905-06 (9th Cir.1993) (discussing vindictive prosecution). Similarly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Park\u2019s motion to consolidate the civil and criminal cases. <em>See Investors Research Co. v. U.S. Dist. Court, </em>877 F.2d 777, 777 (9th Cir.1989) (order).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">We reject as meritless Park\u2019s contentions that his conviction violated the United Nations charter and that the magistrate judge was biased against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">We have not considered Park\u2019s arguments regarding his civil case against Ranger Duffy or the exhibits he submitted for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">We deny Park\u2019s request for an extension of time to provide a statement regarding oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b205-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
