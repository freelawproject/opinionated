We conclude that the record supports the immigration judge\u2019s conclusion that Abera failed to establish his eligibility for asylum. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a) (2002); <em>Gonahasa v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 538, 541 (4th Cir.1999). As the decision in this case is not manifestly contrary to law, we cannot grant the relief Abera seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-20\">Additionally, we find Abera\u2019s challenges to the Board\u2019s use of the streamlined review procedure set forth in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(a)(7) (2002) to be without merit. <em>See Gonzalez-Oropeza v. United States Attorney Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1333-34 (11th Cir.2003); <em>Albathani v. INS, </em>318 F.3d 365, 375-79 (1st Cir.2003). We further find that summary affirmance was appropriate in this case under the factors set forth in \u00a7 3.1(a)(7)(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-21\">Accordingly, we deny Abera\u2019s petition for review. We deny his motion to expedite the case as moot. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-22\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
