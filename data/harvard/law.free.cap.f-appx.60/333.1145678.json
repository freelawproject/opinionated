It is</p>\n<p id=\"b365-24\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the judgment and the resentencing order of the district court be affirmed for the reasons stated therein. Shark\u2019s argument against counting his prior conviction for attempted robbery toward his career offender status amounts to an improper collateral attack upon that conviction. The district court properly considered Shark\u2019s conviction for drug distribution in determining his career offender status pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 because the lack of a finding concerning the weight of the drugs does not affect the conviction for distribution for sentencing purposes and the grouping provisions of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2 do not preclude the use of the distribution conviction. As the district court explained, Shark failed to carry his burden of proof regarding his claims of prosecutorial misconduct and of ineffective assistance of counsel at the trial and appellate levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-25\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
