If Milios had placed a $1 bet prior to being dealt this hand, he would have been entitled to a \u201cprogressive jackpot\u201d of more than $158,000. But casino officials determined that he had not placed such a bet after reviewing a surveillance videotape of the table at which Milios had been playing. Milios unsuccessfully challenged this determination before defendant-appellee Mashantucket Pequot Gaming Commission, unsuccessfully appealed this ruling, and then unsuccessfully attempted to sue defendants in the Mash<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>antucket Tribal Court under the Indian Civil Rights Act (ICRA), 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1302(8). Thereafter, he brought the underlying federal court action, asserting that defendants had violated his civil rights under the ICRA and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(2), and had breached common law duties they owed to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">The district court dismissed Milios\u2019s complaint for want of subject matter jurisdiction. The court first reasoned that it lacked diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 because an Indian tribe is not a citizen of any state. <em>See Ninigret Development Corp. v. Narragansett Indian Wetuomuck Housing Auth., </em>207 F.3d 21, 27 (1st Cir.2000). The court next determined that it lacked federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1343(4) because (1) the only federal cause of action available under the ICRA is one brought pursuant to its habeas corpus provision, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1303, <em>see Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, </em>436 U.S. 49, 61, 98 S.Ct. 1670, 56 L.Ed.2d 106 (1978); (2) the portion of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(2) upon which Milios relied in his first amended complaint prohibits only conspiracies that interfere with the administration of justice in <em>federal </em>courts, <em>see Kush v. Rutledge, </em>460 U.S. 719, 724, 103 S.Ct. 1483, 75 L.Ed.2d 413 (1983), and no such conspiracy was alleged; and (3) an additional portion of \u00a7 1985(2) which prohibits conspiracies to obstruct \u201cthe due course of justice in any State or Territory\u201d \u2014 a provision not referenced in the first amended complaint\u2014 could not in any event provide Milios with a cause of action because an essential element of such a claim is a class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus, <em>see Hahn v. Sargent, </em>523 F.2d 461, 469 (1st Cir.1975), and Milios had not asserted that he was the victim of conduct so motivated.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Milios has appealed the district court\u2019s ruling only insofar as it rejected jurisdiction under the ICRA and the portion of \u00a7 1985(2) discussed by the court which his first amended complaint did not recite. We reject his appeal. As an initial matter, Milios failed to file a notice of appeal within the thirty days specified in Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(a). Although the district court summarily granted Milios\u2019s motion to extend the period of time in which he might take an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5)(A), the correctness of this ruling is open to serious doubt because Milios made no effort to establish that he missed the original deadline for good cause or through excusable neglect, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5)(A)(ii); <em>see also Graphic Communications Intern. Union, Local 12-N v. Quebecor Printing Providence, Inc., </em>270 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.2001). Regardless, Milios\u2019s arguments, which are somewhat difficult to understand, do not present us with any basis for concluding that the court misread <em>Santa Clara Pueblo </em>(and this court\u2019s cases elaborating upon this decision) or his first amended complaint in concluding that the pleading failed to set forth a colorable federal claim under either the ICRA or any portion of \u00a7 1985. We thus affirm on the basis of the lower court\u2019s memorandum and order to the extent that it addresses the issues raised by Milios\u2019s appeal. <em>See Lawton v. State Mut. Life. Assur. Co. of Am., </em>101 F.3d 218, 220 (1st Cir.1996) (\u201c[W]hen a lower court produces a comprehensive, well-reasoned decision, an appellate court should refrain from writing at length to other end than to hear its own words resonate.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">We <em>affirm </em>the dismissal of the action.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
