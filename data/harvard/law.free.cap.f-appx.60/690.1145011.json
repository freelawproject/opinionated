Mason failed adequately to preserve his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim. The only theory articulated in his appellate brief underlying that claim is that Mason was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>retaliated against for his anti-gay e-mail. In his opposition to summary judgment, however, Mason did not raise any freedom of speech issue and did not connect the cancellation of the motorcycle program or his e-mail account with his \u00a7 1988 claim. He cannot raise the speech retaliation issue for the first time on appeal. <em>See Gants Credit Corp. v. Anderson (In re Jan Weilert RV, Inc.), </em>315 F.3d 1192, 1199 (9th Cir.2003). Further, the district court had no obligation to search through the record looking for potentially supportive facts and theories for Mason\u2019s case. <em>See Carmen v. San Francisco Unified Sch. Dist., </em>237 F.3d 1026, 1031 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">2. Mason has failed to submit evidence establishing that President Harter acted with \u201cactual malice\u201d when she called him a bigot, and therefore has not met his evidentiary burden on the defamation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">A showing of actual malice requires proof that Harter knew that her statement was false or spoke with reckless disregard for whether it was false or not. <em>See N.Y. Times Co. v. Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 279-80, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964). Mason\u2019s e-mail suggested that homosexuality was a \u201cmental illness\u201d and called the school-sponsored Coming Out Day \u201ctrash.\u201d These statements are fairly characterized as exhibiting intolerant views of lesbian, bisexual, gay, and transgender people as a group. There was therefore a reasonable basis for Harter to conclude that Mason is a \u201cbigot,\u201d meaning \u201c[a] person obstinately and unreasonably wedded to a particular ... opinion.\u201d <em>See </em>Oxford English Dictionary 185 (2d ed. 1989). Harter was not obligated to investigate Mason\u2019s private life before stating that he was a \u201cbigot.\u201d <em>See Standing Comm. on Discipline v. Yagman, </em>55 F.3d 1430, 1440 (9th Cir.1995) (holding that the First Amendment protects an individual from being punished for accusing a judge of \u201canti-Semitism,\u201d when there is some factual basis for that opinion); <em>see also Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., </em>418 U.S. 323, 332, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974) (\u201c[M]ere proof of failure to investigate, without more, cannot establish reckless disregard for the truth.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">Even if Harter\u2019s statement was false, there is no evidence that she knew it was false. And, because she had a basis for assuming that Mason was a bigot when she made the statement, she did not recklessly disregard the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">3. The district court properly granted summary judgment on Mason\u2019s intentional infliction of emotional distress claim. Mason failed to provide evidence of the \u201csevere or extreme emotional distress\u201d required to make out such a claim. <em>See Miller v. Jones, </em>114 Nev. 1291, 970 P.2d 571, 577 (1998) (rejecting on summary judgment the plaintiffs claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress because he \u201cdid not seek any medical or psychiatric assistance\u201d and \u201cpresented no objectively verifiable indicia of the severity of his emotional distress\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b722-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
