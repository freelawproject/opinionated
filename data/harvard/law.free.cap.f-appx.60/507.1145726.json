Cruel was sentenced to thirty months imprisonment and we affirmed his conviction and sentence on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Cruel, </em>57 Fed.Appx. 186 (4th Cir.2003) (unpublished). One of the arguments Cruel raised in his direct appeal was that the Secret Service and the district court lacked authority to adjudicate the matter. <em>Id. </em>Cruel now appeals from the same criminal proceeding alleging that the district court erred by denying his motion to dismiss the indictment against him and his \u201cMotion to Dismiss for Lack of Territorial Jurisdiction,\u201d on the ground that the district court lacked jurisdiction over him. Because we addressed and rejected Cruel\u2019s jurisdictional arguments in his direct appeal, we decline to entertain the issue again. Thus, we affirm the orders of the district court. We dispense with oral argument as the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
