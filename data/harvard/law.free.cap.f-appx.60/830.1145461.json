The court has determined that the issues presented occasion no need for an opinion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C. Cir. Rule 34(j). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b862-19\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s orders filed July 15, 2002, and August 29, 2002, be affirmed. Appellant failed to present to the district court or the bankruptcy court his arguments that the bankruptcy court erred in concluding appellant filed the Chapter 13 petition in bad faith; the court failed to warn him that he was required to show good faith; appellant\u2019s testimony established that he filed the petition in good faith; and automatic stays are effective without no<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>tice to creditors. Accordingly, the court will not consider them. <em>See District of Columbia v. Air Florida, Inc., </em>750 F.2d 1077, 1084 (D.C.Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\"><em>As </em>to appellant\u2019s argument that the bankruptcy court erred in finding Aames Home Loan lacked notice of the Chapter 13 filing before the foreclosure sale, appellant has failed to show clear error. In light of the evidence adduced at the January 24, 2002, hearing, the bankruptcy court did not clearly err in concluding White did not make an adequate telephone call to put Aames\u2019 counsel on notice to stop the foreclosure sale. To the extent the bankruptcy court simply credited the testimony of the law firm employee involved in the foreclosure that no call was received from appellant regarding the Chapter 13 fifing over appellant\u2019s testimony, the court was entitled to do so. <em>See Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985) (\u201cWhere there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing <em>en banc. See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
