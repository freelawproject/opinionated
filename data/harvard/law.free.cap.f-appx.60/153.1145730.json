Although the initial deliberations that included two alternate jurors violated Fed.R.Crim.P. 24(c)(3), the district court\u2019s removal of the alternates and subsequent instruction for the jury \u201cto begin its deliberations anew\u201d was sufficient to prevent any prejudice to Sundaram.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. McFarland, </em>34 F.3d 1508, 1514 (9th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Acevedo, </em>141 F.3d 1421, 1424-25 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-12\">It would have been better had the district court elaborated on its direction to \u201cbegin ... anew,\u201d and instructed the jurors to disregard entirely any deliberations taking place prior to the removal of the alternates and to consider the evidence as if the previous deliberations had never occurred. We conclude, however, that the instruction given did not amount to plain error. The post-verdict poll indicated that the jury\u2019s verdict was unaffected by the alternates\u2019 deliberation, and there was no evidence of prejudice in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-13\">We also find no merit in Sundaram\u2019s other arguments on appeal. First, Sundaram waived his right to attack the indictment as duplicitous by objecting to an instruction proposed by the district court that would have cleared up any ambiguity in the indictment\u2019s language. <em>See Sovak v. Chugai Pharm. Co., </em>280 F.3d 1266, 1270 (9th Cir.2002) (holding that one may not allege errors on appeal for which he or she is responsible). Second, probable cause for an arrest was established by the facts that Sundaram was a suspected alien smuggler, that his name, along with the names of his traveling companions, had been used before by undocumented nationals seeking to enter the United States illegally, and that the individual Sundaram accompanied was unable to present any identification documents.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Finally, Sundaram\u2019s asserted inability to understand English did not render invalid his waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights. The record makes clear that Sundaram adequately understood the officer\u2019s recitation of his rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>and that he chose to proceed in English rather than waiting for an interpreter.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b186-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Cir.

Because there was no objection at the time, we review for plain error the district court\u2019s inadvertent decision to send the alternates in to deliberate with the jurors. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b186-15\">. We review de novo the district court\u2019s finding that probable cause exists. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Buckner, </em>179 F.3d 834, 837 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b187-18\">. We review for clear error the district court\u2019s finding that Sundaram waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>See United States v.
