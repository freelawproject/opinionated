We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253 and review the district court\u2019s denial of the habeas petition de novo. <em>Fernandez v. Roe, </em>286 F.3d 1073, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>1076 (9th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>___ U.S. ___, 123 S.Ct. 514, 154 L.Ed.2d 395 (2002). We can grant relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 only if we find that the state court decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. We affirm because the state court\u2019s decision was not an unreasonable application of clearly established law.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we will not recite them in this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Peace argues that the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of a defense witness regarding post-arrest silence of the witness violated the Fifth Amendment. The state responds that no clearly established law in 1999 extended Fifth Amendment protection to non-defendant witnesses and any relief under a new rule extending the Fifth Amendment would be barred under <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989). In any event, the prosecutor did not comment on Peace\u2019s right to remain silent. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">To determine whether law was clearly established under \u00a7 2254(d)(1), we look to clearly established law of the Supreme Court in 1999 when the California courts considered Peace\u2019s direct appeal and that appeal became final. <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 412, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). The Supreme Court has clearly held that the Fifth Amendment prohibits the government from commenting on a <em>defendant\u2019s </em>post-arrest silence or decision not to testify, or from introducing evidence of a <em>defendant\u2019s </em>post-arrest silence at trial. <em>Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976); <em>Griffin v. California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 615, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965). However, the Supreme Court has never held that a <em>non-defendant untness </em>cannot be impeached with <em>his </em>post-arrest silence. Reasonable jurists hearing Peace\u2019s claim in 1999 \u2014 or even now \u2014 would not have felt compelled by existing precedent to extend <em>Doyle </em>and <em>Griffin </em>to non-defendant witnesses. Therefore, \u00a7 2254(d)(1) bars relief. Williams, 529 U.S. at 381, 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">To the extent Peace argues that the comment on the silence of the witness was a comment on Peace\u2019s silence, the record does not support the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-11\">Peace argues that insufficient evidence supports his conviction under count I, aiding and abetting the assault with an automobile. Federal law regarding sufficiency of evidence at trial is clearly established. <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). Habeas corpus relief will be granted only if after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution no rational trier of fact could have found the essential element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 324. Because the California Court of Appeals applied this standard, we consider whether the California courts\u2019 decision that sufficient evidence existed is an unreasonable application of clearly established law.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-12\">Under California law, an aider and abetter \u201cshares the perpetrator\u2019s specific intent when he or she knows the full extent of the perpetrator\u2019s criminal purpose and gives aid or encouragement with the intent or purpose of facilitating the perpetrator\u2019s commission of the crime.\u201d <em>People v. Beeman, </em>35 Cal.3d 547, 560, 199 Cal.Rptr. 60, 674 P.2d 1318 (1984). The California Court of Appeal found that a rational trier of fact could have found that Peace aided and abetted the driver. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the driver pulled up next to the victim\u2019s car. Peace held the beer bot-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>tie out the window. The driver moved the car slightly ahead of the victim\u2019s car and Peace threw the bottle at the victim\u2019s windshield, breaking the windshield. Shortly after the bottle was thrown, the driver forced the victim\u2019s car to drive into traffic cones on the highway. Therefore, the jury could conclude that Peace aided and abetted the driver. This conclusion is not an unreasonable application of clearly established law.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b139-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
