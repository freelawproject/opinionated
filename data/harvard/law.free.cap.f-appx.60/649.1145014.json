Reed, </em>216 F.3d 682, 687 (8th Cir.2000) (standard of review), we conclude that the evidence presented at trial supports the magistrate judge\u2019s thorough, well-reasoned ruling that LCCC\u2019s policies did not violate Shelton\u2019s First Amendment right to freely exercise his religion, <em>see Turner v. Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78, 89-91, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987) (prison regulation that impinges on inmates\u2019 constitutional rights is valid if it is reasonably related to legitimate penological interests). We also decline to consider Shelton\u2019s arguments raised for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-22\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir.
