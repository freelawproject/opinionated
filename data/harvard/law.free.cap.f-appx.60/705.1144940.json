The BIA denied Castro-Gonzalez\u2019s motion because it found that he failed to demonstrate prima facie eligibility for relief under the CAT. We VACATE the BIA\u2019s decision not to reopen Castro-Gonzalez\u2019s deportation proceedings and remand the case to the BIA for reconsideration in light of <em>Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">The parties are familiar with the facts and the procedural history of the case. Therefore, we do not repeat them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">The BIA\u2019s decision whether to reopen a case is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 324, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992); <em>Kamalthas, </em>251 F.3d at 1281. However, any underlying issues of law are reviewed de novo. <em>Varela v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1237, 1239 (9th Cir.2000). \u201cThe BIA abuses its discretion when it fails to offer a reasoned explanation for its decision, distorts or disregards important aspects of the alien\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Konstantinova v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 528, 529 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-14\">Castro-Gonzalez\u2019s motion to reopen is governed by 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18, which provides that aliens whose removal orders became final before March 22, 1999 \u201cmay move to reopen proceedings for the sole purpose of seeking protection under \u00a7 208.16(c).\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Motions to reopen deportation proceedings before the BIA are discretionary. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-15\">In the instant case, the BIA determined that Castro-Gonzalez failed to make a prima facie showing of eligibility under the CAT. In doing so, it conflated the standard for granting asylum with that for granting relief under the CAT, and failed to take relevant evidence into consideration. <em>See Kamalthas, </em>251 F.3d at 1283. Specifically, the BIA \u201cfailed to recognize the central distinction that claims for relief under the Convention are analytically separate from claims for asylum----\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition, the BIA \u201cplainly overrelied on its prior adverse credibility finding\u201d against Castro-Gonzalez and failed to \u201cconsider probative evidence in the record,\u201d in particular the Guatemala country report, in contravention of \u00a7 208.16(c)(3)(iii) and (iv).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>at 1284. Under <em>Kamalthas, </em>these determinations constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Because \u201cthe BIA cannot deny a motion to reopen without recognizing the proper standard for establishing a prima facie case and giving weight to relevant country conditions[,]\u201d <em>id., </em>we vacate the BIA\u2019s decision and remand the case to the BIA for an independent and thorough analysis of Castro-Gonzalez\u2019s motion under the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b738-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b738-10\">. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c) provides the eligibility requirements for withholding of removal under the CAT.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b738-11\">. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.2(a) reads in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-12\">The decision to grant or deny a motion to reopen or reconsider is within the discretion of the Board, subject to the restrictions of this section.
