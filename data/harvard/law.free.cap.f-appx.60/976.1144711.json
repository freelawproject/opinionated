The magistrate judge recommended that relief be denied and advised Hogue that failure to file timely objections to this recommendation could waive appellate review of a district court order based upon the recommendation. Despite this warning, Hogue failed to object to the portion of the magistrate judge\u2019s report recommending dismissal of Hogue\u2019s claims on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">The timely filing of specific objections to a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation is necessary to preserve appellate review of the substance of that recommendation when the parties have been warned that failure to object will waive appellate review. <em>See Wright v. Collins, </em>766 F.2d 841, 845-46 (4th Cir.1985); <em>see also Thomas v. Arn, </em>474 U.S. 140, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 485 (1985). Hogue has waived appellate review by failing to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation to dismiss his petition on the merits. Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
