For the following reasons, we affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-24\">Fantin was indicted in the United States District Court for the Western District on December 5, 1997, and charged with violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 (mail fraud) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 (wire fraud) \u201cby devising a scheme to defraud and obtain money from individuals by means of false and fraudulent pretense, representations and promises.\u201d A at 22-23. He was arrested in Spain in January 1998, and extradited to this country in November of 1999. On March 9, 2001, approximately three weeks before his trial was to begin, he notified the court and the government of his intent to plead guilty. He was sentenced on March 25, 2002, at which time the district court granted him a two-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), but declined to reduce his offense level another point pursuant to \u00a7 3El.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-25\">In this Circuit \u201c[t]he sentencing court\u2019s evaluation of a defendant\u2019s acceptance [of responsibility] is entitled to great defer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>ence, and we will review factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Cox, </em>299 F.3d 143, 148 (2d Cir.2002) (citation omitted). \u201c \u2018A defendant who enters a guilty plea is not entitled to an adjustment under this section as a matter of right.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n. 3).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">The dispositive question in this appeal is whether Fantin notified the government and the court of his interest in pleading guilty with sufficient timeliness that wasteful preparation for trial had not already begun. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(b)(2) (defendant may qualify for reduction if he \u201ctimely notifies] authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty, thereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial and permitting the court to allocate its resources efficiently\u201d). Fantin\u2019s decision to plead guilty only three weeks before trial meant that extensive trial preparation had already been performed, thereby undermining judicial economy. <em>See United States v. Rogers, </em>129 F.3d 76, 80-81 (2d Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Patasnik, </em>89 F.3d 63, 73 (2d Cir.1996). For that reason, we defer to the district court\u2019s finding that Fantin was not entitled to an additional one-point reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">We have considered all of appellant\u2019s arguments. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
