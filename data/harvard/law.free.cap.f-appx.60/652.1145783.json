After reviewing the record and the parties\u2019 arguments, we are satisfied that the information in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>eluded in the warrant application and affidavit was sufficient to support a finding of probable cause for the issuance of the warrant. Because we believe that an extended recitation of the facts and the applicable legal principles would have no precedential value in this fact-intensive case, we affirm without any further discussion. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b684-28\">. The Honorable Michael J.
