R.App. P. 34(f). The case is therefore submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">This is a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 prisoner appeal. Mr. King pled guilty to one count of possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Mr. King was sentenced to the statutory minimum of 120 months of imprisonment. Mr. King did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">In his \u00a7 2255 motion, Mr. King requested that the court vacate his sentence based on claims that (1) the indictment failed to state the type of methamphetamine (inject-able versus non-injectable), (2) his sentence exceeded the statutory maximum, and (3) the court lacked jurisdiction to sentence him. The district court found no merit in Mr. King\u2019s substantive arguments, but did discover an error in his sentence. The district court granted the \u00a7 2255 motion and ordered Mr. King\u2019s sentence to be reduced to 96 months; it denied the remainder of the motion. Finding no merit in any of Mr. King\u2019s arguments, the district court declined to grant him a certificate of appealability. Petitioner then applied to this court for a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">In order for this court to grant a certificate of appealability, Petitioner must make a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To do so, Petitioner must demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">We have carefully reviewed the briefs, the district court\u2019s disposition, and the record on appeal. Nothing in the facts, the record on appeal, or the briefs raises an issue which meets our standards for the grant of a certificate of appealability. We conclude that for substantially the same reasons as set forth by the district court in its Orders of April 30 and July 31, 2002, we cannot say \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner.\u201d <em>Id,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b804-10\">We DENY Petitioner\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b803-8\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
