R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). Accordingly, on January 10, 2003, this court ordered the case submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Defendant Pedro R. Cazares (\u201cCazares\u201d) appeals from the denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. This court exercises jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and affirms the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Cazares is a citizen of Mexico who has resided in the United States for over twenty years. He became a permanent resident alien in 1987. On May 5, 2000, Cazares was arrested for selling cocaine to undercover police officers and federal agents <em>from his </em>place <em>of </em>business. He was released on May 8, 2000 to a third-party custodian after posting bond. At the time of his arrest, Cazares\u2019 net worth was over $500,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">On May 26, 2000, a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging Cazares with one count of conspiracy to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(B), and 846 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2; and six counts of distribution of less than 500 grams of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(C) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. On September 6, 2000, Cazares entered into a plea agreement with the United States and pleaded guilty to one count of distribution of less than 500 grams of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(C) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. The plea agreement contained the following waiver provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3b\">[T]he defendant knowingly waives the right to appeal any sentence within the guideline range applicable to the statute of conviction as determined by the court after resolution of any objections by either party to the presentence report to be prepared in this case, and the defendant specifically agrees not to appeal the determination of the court in resolving any contested sentencing factor. In other words, the defendant waives the right to appeal the sentence imposed in this case except to the extent, if any, that the court may depart upwards from the applicable sentencing guideline range as determined by the court. The defendant also waives his right to challenge his sentence or the manner in which it was determined in any collateral attack, including, but not limited to, a motion brought under Title 28, United States Code, Section 2255, except to the extent, if any, that the court may depart upwards from the applicable sentencing guideline range.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">On May 4, 2001, Cazares filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea. Cazares argued that he entered the plea agreement without being informed of his right to seek assistance from the Mexican consulate as provided by the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, Apr. 24, 1963, art. 36, 21 U.S.T. 77-78, 101, 596 U.N.T.S. 261 (\u2018Vienna Convention\u201d). The district court denied Cazares\u2019 motion on May 30, 2001 and sentenced him to thirty-seven months of imprisonment. Cazares now appeals the denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">A. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b257-13\">The United States argues that this court lacks jurisdiction over Cazares\u2019 appeal from the denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea because Cazares waived his right to appeal in the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Rubio, </em>231 F.3d 709, 711 (10th Cir.2000) (holding that this court lacks jurisdiction over an appeal brought by a defendant who has effectively waived his right to appeal in a plea agreement). Specifically, the United States argues that the holding in <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number><em>States v. Elliott, </em>264 F.3d 1171 (10th Cir.2001) is controlling and mandates the dismissal of Cazares\u2019 appeal. In <em>Elliott, </em>this court held that the defendant waived his right to appeal the denial of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea because he had explicitly waived his \u201cright to contest his conviction and sentence ... in any direct or collateral appeal.\u201d 264 F.3d at 1172-74. The court reasoned that because the \u201cdenial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea is an attempt to \u2018contest a conviction on appeal,\u2019 \u201d the defendant\u2019s appeal fell \u201cwithin the plain language of the waiver provision\u201d in his guilty plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1174.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">The plea agreement in this case is clearly distinguishable from the plea agreement in <em>Elliott. </em>Under the plain language of the plea agreement, Cazares explicitly waived his \u201cright to appeal any sentence.\u201d There is no language in the plea agreement, however, that could be interpreted as a waiver of Cazares\u2019 right to appeal his <em>conviction. </em>Accordingly, because Cazares retained his right to appeal his conviction under the plain language of the plea agreement, this court has jurisdiction to consider his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">B. Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">This court reviews the district court\u2019s denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea for abuse of discretion and \u201cwill not reverse absent a showing that the court acted unjustly or unfairly.\u201d <em>United States v. Graves, </em>106 F.3d 342, 343 (10th Cir.1997) (quotation omitted). The district court\u2019s finding of a factual basis for the guilty plea is reviewed for clear error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Cazares argues that he was entitled to withdraw his guilty plea because his rights under the Vienna Convention were violated when he was not informed of his right to seek assistance from the Mexican consulate prior to the entry of his plea. The law is unsettled as to whether the Vienna Convention gives rise to any individually enforceable rights. <em>See United States v. Minjares-Alvarez, </em>264 F.3d 980, 986 (10th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Chanthadara, </em>230 F.3d 1237, 1255 (10th Cir.2000). Nevertheless, we need not resolve this issue in this case. Even assuming that the Vienna Convention creates individually enforceable rights, and that the withdrawal of a guilty plea is an available remedy for a violation of the Vienna Convention, Cazares has failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the denial of such rights. <em>Cf. Minjares-Alvarez, </em>264 F.3d at 986-87 (holding that even if the defendant\u2019s rights under the Vienna Convention were violated when he was not informed of his right to access and consult his national consulate, he faded to show that the violation caused him prejudice). While Cazares alleges that he was unfamiliar with the criminal justice system in the United States, Cazares had resided in the United States for over twenty years and had prior criminal cases brought against him. Moreover, Cazares does not assert on appeal that he was innocent of the crime to which he pleaded guilty nor did he object to the factual assertions of the underlying offense contained in the presentence report. Finally, while Cazares was released on bond he did not attempt to contact the Mexican consulate. Accordingly, Cazares has failed to show he was prejudiced by the government\u2019s failure to inform him of his right to seek assistance from the Mexican consulate. Cazares, therefore, is not entitled to any relief as a result of a Vienna Convention violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">Alternatively, Cazares argues that the failure to inform him of his right to seek assistance from the Mexican consulate as provided under the Vienna Convention constitutes a fair and just reason for permitting the withdrawal of his guilty plea. <em>See Graves, </em>106 F.3d at 343 (dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>cussing the factors the court considers in deciding whether the defendant has shown a \u201cfair and just reason\u201d for the withdrawal of his guilty plea). Pursuant to Rule 32(e)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, a district court may permit a defendant to withdraw his guilty plea prior to sentencing \u201cif the defendant shows any fair and just reason\u201d for such action. Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(e); <em>see also Graves, </em>106 F.3d at 343. This court considers the following when determining whether the defendant has demonstrated a fair and just reason: \u201c(1) defendant\u2019s assertion of innocence; (2) resulting prejudice to the government; (3) defendant\u2019s delay in filing the withdrawal motion; (4) inconvenience to the court; (5) defendant\u2019s assistance of counsel; (6) knowledge and voluntariness of the plea; and (7) resulting waste of judicial resources.\u201d <em>Graves, </em>106 F.3d at 343. Cazares does not maintain his innocence on appeal. Moreover, allowing Cazares to withdraw his guilty plea after he delayed for eight months prior to moving for its withdrawal, would prejudice the government by the delayed re-institution of its burden to locate and subpoena trial witnesses. Further, Cazares was represented by counsel and has not alleged that this representation was inadequate or ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">While Cazares does not explicitly address the <em>Graves </em>factors on appeal, he argues that because he is a foreign national, he lacks an understanding of the criminal justice system in the United States. Cazares furthers argues that his lack of understanding would be remedied by the assistance of the Mexican consulate. This court, therefore, will construe Cazares\u2019 arguments as a challenge to the plea on the grounds it was not knowingly and voluntarily entered. Although Cazares alleges a lack of understanding of the criminal justice system in the United States, Cazares fails to allege the particular aspects of his plea that were entered into unknowingly. After reviewing the record, this court concludes that there is nothing in the record indicating Cazares\u2019 plea was not knowing and voluntary. Finally, because Cazares does not assert his innocence, permitting him to withdraw his guilty plea would waste judicial resources. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that Cazares failed to demonstrate a fair and just reason to permit him to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b259-11\">For the reasons stated above, this court affirms the district court\u2019s denial of Cazares\u2019 motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b256-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel.
