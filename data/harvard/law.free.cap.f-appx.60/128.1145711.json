We reverse and remand with instructions to direct the Social Security Commissioner to award Kilmurray the benefits claimed, as well as fees pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-23\">We review a district court\u2019s decision whether to remand for further proceedings or for the payment of benefits for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Harman v. Apfel, </em>211 F.3d 1172, 1178 (9th Cir.2000). Because 1) the ALJ failed to provide legally sufficient reasons for rejecting the relevant evidence, 2) there are no outstanding issues that must be resolved before making a determination of disability, and 3) it is clear from the record that the ALJ would be required to find the claimant disabled were the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>evidence properly credited, <em>id., </em>a remand for the award of benefits is required here.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">First, with respect to both Silva\u2019s subjective pain testimony and the lay testimony, the Commissioner conceded, and the district court found, error relating to the ALJ\u2019s failure to credit that evidence. Silva\u2019s pain testimony and lay witness testimony must be credited as a matter of law. <em>See Varney v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>859 F.2d 1896, 1401 (9th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Second, the ALJ\u2019s reasons for rejecting the opinion of Dr. Tullus, Silva\u2019s treating physician, were not supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 830 (9th Cir.1995). As already noted, the ALJ\u2019s adverse determination regarding Silva\u2019s excess pain testimony was erroneous. It follows, then, that it was also error for the ALJ to use Silva\u2019s report regarding his pain as the reason for discrediting Dr. Tullus\u2019s opinion and diagnosis. Silva\u2019s then-treating physician properly relied on his pain statements in concluding that Silva was not capable of performing any work. In view of our earlier findings, Dr. Tullus\u2019s opinion must be credited as a matter of law. <em>See Hammock v. Bowen, </em>879 F.2d 498, 502 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">Had the ALJ properly credited the evidence in question, Silva would have been considered \u201cdisabled\u201d as defined by the Social Security Act. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(2)(A). Given these circumstances, we conclude that the district court erred as a matter of law in remanding for further proceedings rather than for an immediate award of benefits. An error of law is an abuse of discretion. <em>Koon v. United States, 518 </em>U.S. 81, 100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">In addition, Kilmurray seeks fees as a \u201cprevailing party\u201d pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1), and the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b). We hold that Kilmurray is a prevailing party entitled to appropriate fees because the Commissioner\u2019s position was not substantially justified. <em>See Flores v. Shalala, </em>49 F.3d 562, 569-70 (9th Cir.1995). We note that an award of fees under both statutes does not amount to double recovery for the attorney. \u201cThe award under \u00a7 406(b) of the Social Security Act merely allows the claimant\u2019s attorney to collect his or her fee out of the claimant\u2019s past-due disability benefits, while the EAJA award is paid by the government to the claimant to defray the cost of legal services.\u201d <em>Russell v. Sullivan, </em>930 F.2d 1443, 1446 (9th Cir.1991). An award, however, necessitates computation based upon an itemized statement. Kilmurray may file an appropriate statement with the district court within 30 days of this order. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">REVERSED and REMANDED with instructions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b160-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b161-13\">GOULD, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Axd\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-14\">I respectfully dissent believing that the district court did not abuse its discretion in ordering a remand for further administrative proceedings instead of awarding a payment of benefits. <em>See Harman v. Apfel, </em>211 F.3d 1172, 1178 (9th Cir.2000) (holding that a remand for further administrative proceedings is proper when there are \u201coutstanding issues that must be resolved before a determination of disability can be made.\u201d) In my view, outstanding issues that should be resolved before making a determination of disability include a further assessment of conflicting medical testimony upon proper standards. At this point, it is premature for our court to foreclose further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
