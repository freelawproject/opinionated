Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b209-14\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-15\">Defendant Joseph S. Correia appeals from his convictions, after a jury trial, for conspiracy to distribute, and distribution of, crystal methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846, and for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) by possessing firearms after having been convicted of a felony. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-16\">1. The conviction for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) does not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause because Defendant\u2019s illegal conduct, the possession of firearms, occurred long after 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) took effect. <em>See United States v. Hancock, </em>231 F.3d 557, 565 (9th Cir.2000) (upholding a paragraph of \u00a7 922(g) against due process challenges); <em>United States v. ArzateNunez, </em>18 F.3d 730, 733 (9th Cir.1994) (stating test for ex post facto analysis).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-20\">2. Evidence of Defendant\u2019s 1959 burglary conviction was admissible to prove his status as a felon, which is an element the government had to prove under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), because Defendant refused to stipulate to his status as a felon. <em>See United States v. Lloyd, </em>981 F.2d 1071, 1072-73 (9th Cir.1992) (per curiam) (allowing government to prove predicate felonies under \u00a7 922(g)(1) when the defendant refused to stipulate).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-21\">3. The prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was not improper. A statement that a witness\u2019 testimony was \u201cuncontradicted\u201d or \u201cunrefuted\u201d did not, without more, suggest to the jury that it should draw an adverse inference from Defendant\u2019s failure to testify-</p>\n<p id=\"b209-22\">4. The district court did not clearly err when it found that Defendant was not entitled to a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See United States v. Innie, </em>7 F.3d 840, 848 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-23\">5. The district court gave individualized oral and written reasons for selecting a sentence at the middle of the guideline range, relying on the large quantities of drugs involved and the extensive profits Defendant made in his drug-trafficking enterprise. Defendant does not challenge the propriety of the range itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-24\">6. We decline to address Defendant\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel because there is not an adequate record before us; he may raise them collaterally. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number><em>See United States v.
