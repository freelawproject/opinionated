This case arises from the District\u2019s efforts to change the educational placement of Charles \u201cSpike\u201d Girty, a child with significant mental retardation, from full-time regular education to part-time life skills support. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401 et seq., (\u201cthe IDEA\u201d) requires states to establish and maintain procedures to \u201censure that children with disabilities and their parents are guaranteed procedural safeguards with respect to the provision of free appropriate public education....\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-25\">Pennsylvania has a two-tiered system which provides for an initial IDEA due process hearing at the local level conducted by a hearing officer, followed by review at the state level by an appeals panel. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(f)-(g). A party aggrieved by the findings and decision in the state due process hearing may seek review in federal district court. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A). The district court must afford \u201cdue weight\u201d to the state administrative proceedings when evaluating claims under the IDEA. <em>See Bd. of Educ. v. Rowley, </em>458 U.S. 176, 206, 102 S.Ct. 8034, 73 L.Ed.2d 690 (1982). In short, district courts have \u201cdiscretion to determine how much deference to accord the administrative proceedings, and although the district courts \u2018must consider administrative findings of fact, [they are] free to accept or reject them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Carlisle Area School District v. Scott P., </em>62 F.3d 520, 527 (3d Cir.1995) quoting <em>Oberti v. Bd. of Educ., </em>995 F.2d 1204, 1219 (3d Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-26\">The district court must give \u201cdue weight\u201d to the appeals panel\u2019s decision \u201cwhen it reverses the [local] hearing officer\u2019s conclusions of law, inferences from proven facts, and factual findings based on credibility judgments where non-testimonial, extrinsic evidence justified the appeals panel\u2019s contrary decision.\u201d <em>Carlisle Area </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number><em>School District, </em>62 F.3d at 529. If the district court chooses to depart from the agency\u2019s ruling, it should provide some explanation for its departure. <em>Id. </em>at 527. We exercise plenary review over the district court\u2019s conclusions of law and review its findings of fact for clear error. <em>Carlisle Area School District, </em>62 F.3d at 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">Inasmuch as the district court (McLaughlin, J.) has already set forth the factual and procedural history of this case, we need not repeat that history here. <em>See Girty v. School District of Valley Grove, </em>163 F.Supp.2d 527 (W.D.Pa.2001). The district court has carefully and completely explained its reasons for granting the parents\u2019 motion for summary judgment and denying the District\u2019s motion for summary judgment in its thoughtful Memorandum Opinion and Order. The district court accorded due weight to the state administrative proceedings, applied the correct legal standard, and made no clearly erroneous findings of fact. Given the district court\u2019s careful analysis, no purpose will be served by this court undertaking a redundant discussion simply to reach the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">Accordingly, we will affirm the decision of the district court substantially for the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s thoughtful Memorandum Opinion without further elaboration.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
