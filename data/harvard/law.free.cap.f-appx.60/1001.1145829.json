We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. We find that because the Chapter 7 policy statements of the United States Sentencing Guidelines are merely advisory in nature, the district court did not abuse its discretion by rejecting the suggested sentence and imposing the statutorily-authorized sentence it deemed appropriate. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642 (4th Cir.1995). The court explained its decision was based on the short time period between the commencement of Thomas\u2019s period of supervised release and the occurrence of the undisputed violations, coupled with his refusal to participate in in-patient drug treatment, which was a special condition of his supervised release. We also find that although a district court generally must provide an explanation for its departure from the recommended sentencing range, <em>see United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 882 (4th Cir.1992), where, as here, a sentence diverges from advisory policy statements, such divergence is not a departure. <em>See Davis, </em>53 F.3d at 642 n. 15. Accordingly, we affirm Thomas\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-20\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Thomas\u2019s sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-21\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-22\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
