Henderson, in response to this court\u2019s letter rejecting her petition for review, as a motion for leave to file an untimely petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-28\">A printout of the Merit Systems Protection Board\u2019s records indicates that Henderson received a copy of the Board\u2019s August 30, 2002 order on September 3, 2002. Henderson states that her petition \u201cestablishes the date of receipt as September 9, 2002.\u201d On November 12, 2002, or more than 60 days after either date of receipt, this court received Henderson\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-29\">A petition for review of a final decision or order of the Board is due within 60 days of the petitioner\u2019s receipt of the decision or order. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(b)(1). To be timely filed, a petition for review must be received by the court on or before the due date. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 15(a) and Fed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>R.App. P. 25(a). <em>See also Pinat v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>931 F.2d 1544, 1546 (Fed.Cir.1991) (filing of a petition for review occurs when the required papers are received by the clerk) and <em>Reeves v. Department of the Army, </em>228 Ct.Cl. 811, 812 (1981) (petition for review dismissed as untimely when petition of a Board decision was mailed within the statutory period but was received on the day after the statutory period expired). The period for filing a petition for review is \u201cstatutory, mandatory, [and] jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Monzo v. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>735 F.2d 1335, 1336 (Fed.Cir.1984). The court may not extend the statutorily imposed 60-day requirement. Fed. R.App. P. 26(b)(2). Therefore, the court must dismiss Henderson\u2019s petition for review as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">(1) Henderson\u2019s motion for leave to file an untimely petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">(2) Henderson\u2019s petition is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
