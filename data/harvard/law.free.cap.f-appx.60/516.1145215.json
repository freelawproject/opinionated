The record reveals that, upon Nagy\u2019s motion, the district court conducted a hearing pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4247(h) (2000). At the hearing, Dr. Herbel, a physician at FCI-Butner, testified that the underlying delusions that had previously led to Nagy\u2019s dangerous behavior were still present, despite medication and treatment. The district court had before it at the hearing two written evaluations, including one from Nagy\u2019s court-appointed psychiatrist, who concurred with Dr. Herbel that Nagy was delusional and should remain in the Attorney General\u2019s custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-21\">Based on our review of the record, the district court did not clearly err in determining that clear and convincing evidence established that Nagy was suffering from a mental disease or defect as a result of which his release would create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage to the property of another. We accordingly affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-22\">In No. 02-7849, Nagy appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to disqualify a court-appointed psychiatrist and the Assistant Federal Public Defender. We find no abuse of discretion and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-23\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before us and argument would not significantly aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-24\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
