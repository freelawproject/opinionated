Charitably construed, King\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim, which he filed pro se, alleged (1) that the NYPD violated his constitutional rights when it arrested him and detained him for over three months, and (2) that the Department of Social Services violated his Due Process rights a) when it failed to notify him of a hearing at which his parental rights were terminated and b) when it arranged for him to visit with his son on the day of that hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">Defendants filed a motion for partial judgment on the pleadings, arguing (1) that, pursuant to the domestic relations exception to federal jurisdiction, the district court should abstain from exercising subject matter jurisdiction over King\u2019s claim that Defendants caused his parental rights to be terminated wrongfully, (2) that his suit on that claim is barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine or collateral estoppel, and (3) that the complaint should be dismissed in its entirety against the NYPD, because the NYPD is a non-suable city agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">In response, King\u2019s appointed counsel argued that neither the \u201cdomestic relations exception,\u201d the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, nor collateral estoppel were applicable to Plaintiffs claims against the Department of Social Services. As to his claims against the NYPD, King (1) acknowledged that the NYPD is a non-suable entity, (2) conceded that \u201cit appears that probable cause did exist for plaintiffs arrest even though the charges later turned out to be unfounded,\u201d and (3) stated that he had \u201cno objection to the dismissal of the complaint as to the [NYPD] ... [but sought] leave to amend his complaint to include the City of New York and the New York City Commissioner of Social Services as defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">The district court\u2019s hearing on the motion focused entirely on King\u2019s claim involving the termination of his parental rights, and the court concluded that it was without jurisdiction to hear that claim. No mention was made of King\u2019s allegations of unlawful arrest, prosecution, and detention. Nevertheless, in the judgment issued after the hearing, the court dismissed the case in its entirety \u201cfor the reasons stated orally on the record.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-12\">The domestic relations exception to federal jurisdiction \u201cis not based on Article III of the Constitution but is instead an interpretation of the diversity statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332.\u201d <em>Williams v. Lambert, </em>46 F.3d 1275, 1283 (2d Cir.1995) (citing <em>Ank</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number><em>enbrandt v. Richards, </em>504 U.S. 689, 700-02, 112 S.Ct. 2206, 119 L.Ed.2d 468 (1992)). Moreover, \u201cthe exception is very narrow. ... [It does not] strip the federal courts of authority to hear cases arising from the domestic relations of persons unless they seek the granting or modification of a divorce or alimony decree ... or a child custody decree.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Ankenbrandt, </em>504 U.S. at 701-02, 112 S.Ct. 2206 (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">The instant appeal is brought pursuant to the court\u2019s federal question jurisdiction, not its diversity jurisdiction. Nevertheless, the City argues that the domestic relations exception is not limited to diversity cases. Although this seems contrary to precedent, the city does cite language to support its argument. <em>See, e.g., Ankenbrandt, </em>504 U.S. at 703, 112 S.Ct. 2206 (concluding, after explaining that the exception is a limitation on the courts\u2019 diversity jurisdiction, that \u201cthe domestic relations exception, as articulated by this Court since <em>Barber, </em>divests the federal courts of power to issue divorce, alimony, and child custody decrees\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">We need not examine this question, however, because even under the broadest interpretation of the exception, it applies only to cases that seek issuance or modification of divorce, alimony, or child custody decrees. Appellant is not seeking a domestic relations award, and he is not asking that his parental rights be reinstated. Instead, his complaint seeks monetary damages. The domestic relations exception to federal jurisdiction is therefore irrelevant to this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">\u201cThe <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine holds that inferior federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction \u2018over cases that effectively seek review of judgments of state courts and that federal review, if any, can occur only by way of a certiorari petition to the Supreme Court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Phifer v. City of New York, </em>289 F.3d 49, 55 (2d Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Moccio v. New York State Office of Court Admin., </em>95 F.3d 195, 197 (2d Cir.1996)). Jurisdiction is also lacking where plaintiffs claims before the district court are \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the state court\u2019s determinations. <em>Id. </em>(citing and quoting <em>District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 483 n. 16, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983)). We have held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkF\">\u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d means, at a minimum, that where a federal plaintiff had an opportunity to litigate a claim in a state proceeding (as either the plaintiff or defendant in that proceeding), subsequent litigation of the claim will be barred under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine if it would be barred under the principles of preclusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b907-10\"><em>Moccio, </em>95 F.3d at 199-200. Because both parties to the instant appeal agree that claim preclusion (i.e., res judicata) is not applicable to this case, the question is whether issue preclusion (i.e., collateral estoppel) applies. We hold that it does, as to some of Appellant\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">\u201cUnder New York law, the doctrine of issue preclusion only applies if (1) the issue in question was actually and necessarily decided in a prior proceeding, and (2) the party against whom the doctrine is asserted had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the first proceeding.\u201d <em>Colon v. Coughlin, </em>58 F.3d 865, 869 (2d Cir.1995) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-12\">King argued in the New York Appellate Division that his absence from the termination hearing was excusable because he was visiting with his son and the Department of Social Services did not tell him about the hearing. The Appellate Division concluded that \u201c[t]he father could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>not establish that his nonappearance at the fact-finding and dispositional hearings was other than willful,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he father failed to establish either a reasonable excuse for his default or a meritorious defense to the proceeding.\u201d <em>In re Irvin R., </em>257 A.D.2d 624, 624-25, 684 N.Y.S.2d 255 (N.Y.App.Div.1999). On the basis of these conclusions, the Appellate Division ultimately held that \u201c[t]he Family Court did not improvidently exercise its discretion when it denied the father\u2019s motion to vacate his default\u201d in the proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 624, 684 N.Y.S.2d 255. The issue Appellant raises with respect to the social service department\u2019s conduct, then, was considered and ruled upon by the Appellate Division, and its findings on that point were \u201cessential to the decision\u201d it rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">It follows that Appellant\u2019s claims with respect to the Department of Social Services and its actions are barred by collateral estoppel, and under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine the district court had no jurisdiction to hear them.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">Appellant\u2019s trial counsel conceded that there was probable clause for his arrest and also conceded that the complaint should be dismissed against the New York City Police Department. Appellees interpret these two concessions as indicating trial counsel\u2019s \u201cintent to withdraw this claim in its entirety.\u201d Appellant\u2019s counsel on appeal, however, note that their predecessor \u201cspecifically stated that she intended to replace the NYPD with the \u2018City of New York\u2019 because the NYPD \u2018does not maintain independent legal status,\u2019 ... implying that her concern was with the status of the defendant rather than the nature of the claim.\u201d Moreover, they say, \u201ctrial counsel expressed only an intent to drop a false arrest claim, not a wrongful seizure or malicious prosecution claim based on facts that became apparent after the arrest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">At the hearing in which the district court granted Appellee\u2019s motion for partial judgment on the pleadings and dismissed the suit, no mention whatsoever was made of Appellant\u2019s claims with respect to his arrest, detention, and prosecution. Nevertheless, the district court dismissed the case in its entirety \u201cfor the reasons stated orally on the record.\u201d In light of that omission, the dismissal must be vacated in part and remanded for clarification of the district court\u2019s decision with respect to Appellant\u2019s claims arising from his detention and prosecution. <em>See Beekford v. Portuondo, </em>234 F.3d 128, 130 (2d Cir.2000) (per curiam) (\u201cIf the court fails to make findings and to give an explanation, and the reason for the court\u2019s ruling is not clear to us, we will remand for findings and an explanation.\u201d <em>(quoting Orehano v. Advanced Recovery, Inc., </em>107 F.3d 94, 99 (2d Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-12\">On the basis of the foregoing, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of Appellant\u2019s claims involving the actions of the Department of Social Services with respect to termination of his parental rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We VACATE the dismissal of Appellant\u2019s claims involving his prosecution and detention, and REMAND for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b908-7\">. Given Appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s concession we also AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of Appellant\u2019s claim that his arrest lacked probable cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
