Reese was sentenced to 360 months in prison and eight years of supervised release. On appeal, Reese argues: (1) the police lacked reasonable suspicion to conduct an investigatory stop of his vehicle; (2) the search warrant issued to search his residence lacked probable cause; and (3) the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule is not applicable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-23\">We review the district court\u2019s factual findings underlying a motion to suppress for clear error, and the district court\u2019s legal determinations de novo. <em>See Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996); <em>United States v. Rusher, </em>966 F.2d 868, 873 (4th Cir.1992). When a suppression motion has been denied, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government. <em>See United States v. Seidman, </em>156 F.3d 542, 547 (4th Cir.1998). We have reviewed the district court\u2019s denial of Reese\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence seized following the investigatory stop of his vehicle and find no error. <em>See Illinois v. Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. 119, 123, 120 S.Ct. 673, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000). We also conclude the warrant established probable cause to search Reese\u2019s residence. We therefore find it unnecessary to review Reese\u2019s claim that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-24\">We therefore affirm Reese\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
