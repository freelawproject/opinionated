Fuentes argues that the order should be revoked and the consequent sentence be revisited because the District Court erred in failing to recognize its discretion to impose a concurrent sentence for a violation of supervised release under United States Sentencing Guidelines Section 7B1.3(f). In response, the government states (in its brief) that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-23\">[i]t is unclear from the record whether the district court[,] in imposing a sentence for a violation of supervised release which was consecutive to a term for the offense which gave rise to the violation, understood its discretion to impose a concurrent sentence. This, this Court may wish to remand the matter for clarification of the District Court\u2019s reasoning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-24\">Appellee\u2019s Brief at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-25\">The government then argues, however, that: (1) the sentence for violation of supervised release may be affirmed on the present record because Fuentes did not object at sentencing to the imposition of a consecutive sentence; (2) review is therefore for plain error; (3) there was none; and (4) this Court has discretion whether to correct the error. However, we think that the better course is to remand for clarification. Accordingly the judgment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>sentence will be vacated and the case remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
