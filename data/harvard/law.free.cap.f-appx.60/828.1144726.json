The court has determined that the issues presented occasion no need for an opinion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 36; D.C.Cir. Rule 36(b). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b860-35\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s judgment entered March 29, 2002 in favor of appellee Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>against appellants be affirmed. The district court correctly determined that the investment agreements at issue were \u201csecurities\u201d within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77b(a)(l), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78e(a)(10). <em>See SEC v. Banner Fund Int% </em>211 F.3d 602, 614 (D.C.Cir. 2000). Because appellants did not dispute that these securities were unregistered or that appellants made use of interstate transportation, communications and the mails to sell these securities, the district court properly granted summary judgment to the SEC on its claim that appellants violated section 5 of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77e(a), 77e(c), and properly enjoined appellants from violating that statute. The district court also correctly determined that the false and misleading statements made by appellants in connection with the sale of such securities had been made either knowingly or recklessly. <em>See SEC v. Steadman, </em>967 F.2d 636, 641-42 (D.C.Cir.1992). Thus, the court properly granted summary judgment to the SEC on its claims that appellants violated section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5, and properly enjoined appellants from violating that statute and rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Pursuant to D.C.Cir. Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
