The case has been referred to this panel pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. We unanimously agree that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-17\">Upon review of the briefs and the record, we affirm the court\u2019s judgment. Because the magistrate judge articulated specific and thorough reasons for the decision, the issuance of a detailed written opinion would be duplicative and would serve no useful purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-19\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment for the reasons stated by the magistrate judge in the opinion and order entered on June 19, 2002. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
