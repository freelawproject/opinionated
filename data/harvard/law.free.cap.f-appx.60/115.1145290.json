In her petition, Juarez-Guerra argues that the BIA erred in dismissing her appeal. She also argues that the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) did not allow her to present a full defense because he excluded her testimony regarding her son\u2019s presumed murder. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-18\">I. Dismissal of Juarez-Guerra\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b148-19\">We review the BIA\u2019s ruling that an applicant has not proven eligibility for asylum and its decision that an applicant is not entitled to withholding of removal under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See Cardenas v. INS, </em>294 F.3d 1062, 1065 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Molino-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.2002). Therefore, the BIA\u2019s decision must be affirmed if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence in the record. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-20\">The Attorney General may grant asylum to refugees, persons who are unable or unwilling to return to their country of origin because of \u201ca well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion[.]\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 1158(b). If the applicant can establish past persecution, there is a rebuttable presumption that he or she has a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Salazar-Paucar v. INS, </em>281 F.3d 1069, 1074, <em>amended by </em>290 F.3d 964 (9th Cir.2002). An applicant is entitled to withholding of removal under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>the INA if it is more likely than not that he or she will be persecuted based on one of the protected grounds if returned to the country of removal. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1281(b)(3)(A); <em>Katana v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 1107, 1113 (9th Cir.2000). If it is more likely than not that he or she will be tortured if returned to the country of removal, he or she is entitled to withholding of removal under the Convention. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 208.18(a)(1) (defining torture).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">In the present case, Juarez-Guerra testified that she left Guatemala because guerrillas came into her family\u2019s store, stole items, and threatened to kill her if she reported them. She also believes that the guerrillas killed her son and that the same thing will happen to her if she returns to Guatemala. However, she does not know with whom the guerrillas are associated. She argues that she has suffered past persecution and has a well-founded fear or future persecution based on political opinion. Even assuming that these acts constitute persecution, Juarez-Guerra is not eligible for asylum because she did not establish that the persecution she suffered, or would suffer upon her return, was based on a political opinion that she was known to have or was imputed to her. <em>See Sangha v. INS, </em>103 F.3d 1482, 1486-87 (9th Cir.1997). Juarez-Guerra\u2019s failure to meet the standard for asylum necessarily constitutes failure to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>Cf. Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1429 (9th Cir.1995). Further, Juarez-Guerra\u2019s did not present any evidence in support of her claim that it is more likely than not that she would be tortured if forced to return to Guatemala.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">There is substantial evidence supporting the BIA\u2019s rulings that Juarez-Guerra is not eligible for asylum or withholding of removal under the INA or for withholding of removal under the Convention. The BIA did not err in dismissing her appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">II. Exclusion of Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">Juarez-Guerra argues that the IJ erred in excluding her testimony regarding the presumed murder of her son by the guerrillas. However, even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the IJ erred in excluding the testimony, the error is harmless because the BIA considered the excluded testimony. The BIA ruled that, even assuming that Juarez-Guerra\u2019s son was murdered by the guerrillas, Juarez-Guerra failed to establish that it was an act of persecution based on one of the protected grounds. Therefore, a new hearing is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">Petition DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b148-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
