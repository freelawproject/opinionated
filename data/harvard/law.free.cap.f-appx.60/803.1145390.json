The court considers whether Bledsoe\u2019s petition for review should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">The court dismissed Bledsoe\u2019s petition for review on July 10, 2002 for failure to pay the filing fee or file a Fed. Cir. R. 15(c) statement concerning' discrimination. Over four months later, Bledsoe moved to reinstate. On January 13, 2003, the court granted Bledsoe\u2019s motion to reinstate \u201cwith some reluctance.\u201d The court ordered that Bledsoe file her brief within 30 days and stated that \u201c[n]o extensions\u201d would be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">When the court states \u201cno extensions,\u201d it means it. These words are not lightly or routinely added to orders. Because Bledsoe did not file a brief within the explicit deadline set by the court in its January 13, 2003 order, the motion is denied and the petition for review is dismissed. <em>See Julien v. Zeringue, </em>864 F.2d 1572 (Fed.Cir.1989) (court may dismiss for failure to file a brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b836-10\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b836-11\">(1) Bledsoe\u2019s motion for an extension of time is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-12\">(2) The petition for review is dismissed for failure to file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-13\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
