On appeal, Duckett argues that the district court erred in including in the amount of loss altered cashier\u2019s checks totaling more than $4,000,000, because they could not have been negotiated and thus could not have resulted in actual loss. In the alternative, he argues that he should have received a 3-level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X1.1 (1995), because the greater loss was merely attempted and not completed. After careful review of the record, we reject Duckett\u2019s arguments, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-19\">The district court did not clearly err in determining the amount of loss. See <em>United States v. Oligmueller, </em>198 F.3d 669, 671 (8th Cir.1999) (standard of review). Regardless of whether the checks could have been negotiated successfully, the evidence at sentencing indicated Duckett intended that they result in additional losses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1, comment, (n.7) (1995) (if intended loss that defendant was attempting to inflict can be determined, this figure will be used if it is greater than the actual loss). Further, a reduction under section 2X1.1 was not appropriate because the offense \u2014 conspiracy to possess forged securities \u2014 was completed, even if the loss was not inflicted. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 513(a); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2X1.1, comment, (backg\u2019d.) (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-20\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-21\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b680-23\">. The HONORABLE JAMES M.
