Gen. Surgical Innovations, Inc., </em>No. 1:00-CV-037 (E.D.Tex. May 22, 2002). Because claims 1-3 of the \u2019545 patent were properly held invalid under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b), we affirm the district court decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b317-16\">Appellants, the owners of the \u2019545 patent, filed suit against General Surgical Innovations (\u201cGSI\u201d), Tyco International, Ltd. (\u201cTyco\u201d), and Origin Medsystems, Inc. (\u201cOrigin\u201d) (collectively \u201cappellees\u201d) for infringement of claims 1-3 of the \u2019545 patent, entitled \u201cDissection of Tissue by Tissue Expander.\u201d The \u2019545 patent was filed on March 30, 1995, as U.S. Application No. 419,384 (\u201cthe \u2019384 application\u201d). The \u2019384 application claimed priority as a continuation-in-part of U.S. Application No. 134,629 (\u201cthe \u2019629 application\u201d) filed October 12, 1993, which claimed priority as a division of U.S. Application No. 832,072 (\u201cthe \u2019072 application\u201d) filed February 6, 1992. The \u2019072 application issued as U.S. Patent No. 5,258,026 (\u201cthe \u2019026 patent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-18\">The technology disclosed in the \u2019545 patent is directed to improved surgical methods for creating a space, cavity, or pocket between a patient\u2019s tissues, <em>e.g., </em>between skin and the underlying muscle. In the disclosed method, a surgeon makes an incision into the body and inserts a hollow tissue expander into the incision. Once the expander is in position, fluid is forced into the expander, which causes it to expand and separate the tissues between which it is positioned. The specification of the \u2019545 patent describes in detail the use of the disclosed method for performing endoscopic breast augmentation mammoplasty. The patent states, however, that \u201c[t]he description of breast surgery given below is a special case of the use of a hollow, expandable tissue expander for tissue dissection and the formation of a space, cavity or pocket.\u201d Col. 3, II. 64-67. The asserted claims all require that the tissue expander be removed upon completion of surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-19\">On April 17, 2001, GSI filed two motions for summary judgment that the priority date of the asserted claims of the \u2019545 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>patent was the March 80, 1995, and that the claims were, therefore, invalid under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b) as anticipated by printed publications, public uses, and sales more than one year prior to that date. Each of the asserted claims required a step of \u201cremoving the hollow member on completion of surgery.\u201d Claims 1-3 of the \u2019545 patent. According to GSI:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-4\">The \u2019026 patent did <em>not </em>describe a step of \u201cremoving the hollow member on completion of surgery,\u201d but instead described <em>only </em>a procedure wherein the <em>hollow member </em>is <em>left in place </em>in the body as an <em>implant, </em>i.e., an inflatable \u201chollow member\u201d is used to dissect a breast pocket, and the hollow member is then left in place as an implant within the breast pocket for the purpose of breast augmentation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">(J.A. 100.)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">By motion dated May 15, 2001, plaintiffs opposed summary judgment, arguing that the \u2019545 patent was entitled to a priority date of February 6, 1992, corresponding to the filing date of the application that issued as the \u2019026 patent. Plaintiffs argued that \u201c[although the principal focus of the \u2019026 patent was a new method of breast augmentation surgery, the subject matter of this patent did include the use of tissue expanders for dissection purposes\u201d and that \u201c[t]here is nothing in this patent which requires the surgeon to leave the tissue expander in the body.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">On January 14, 2002, the district court issued a decision, finding that \u201cthe step of \u2018removing the hollow member on completion of surgery\u2019 in claim 1 is explicitly mentioned nowhere in the original disclosure [of the \u2019026 patent].\u201d <em>Williams v. Gen. Surgical Innovations, Inc., </em>178 F.Supp.2d 698, ___, slip op. at 16 (E.D.Tex.2002) <em>(\u201cFirst Memorandum Opinion and Order\u201d). </em>The court found that \u201cno reasonable jury could find that the original disclosure reasonably conveyed to a skilled surgeon that the inventors had possession of the claimed method.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at ___, 23. The court, therefore, granted summary judgment that the effective filing date of claims 1-3 was March 30, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-12\">On April 17, 2002, GSI submitted an additional motion for summary judgment based on the court\u2019s January 14, 2002, decision and the admissions of the plaintiffs in response to GSI\u2019s Requests for Admission. On May 22, 2002, the court granted summary judgment of invalidity under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b) based on the plaintiffs\u2019 admission that \u201cthe subject matter of claims 1-3 of the patent-in-suit was used commercially in the United States by Dr. Johnson before the critical date of March 30, 1994.\u201d <em>Williams v. Gen. Surgical Innovations, Inc., </em>No. 1:00-CV-037 at 3 (E.D.Tex. May 22, 2002) <em>(\u201cSecond Memorandum Opinion and Order\u201d). </em>Plaintiffs timely filed this appeal. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b318-14\">This court reviews a grant of summary judgment without deference, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmovant and reapplying the standards used by the district court. <em>Slip Track Sys., Inc. v. Metal-Lite, Inc., </em>304 F.3d 1256, 1262, 64 USPQ2d 1423, 1426 (Fed.Cir.2002). Priority is a question of law based on subsidiary factual findings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-15\">The sole issue on appeal is whether claims 1-3 of the \u2019545 patent are entitled to the priority date of the \u2019072 application. The right to an earlier priority date is provided by statute as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-16\">An application for patent for an invention disclosed in the manner provided by the first paragraph of section 112 of this title <em>in an application previously filed </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number><em>in the United States ... </em>shall have the same effect, <em>as to such invention, as though filed on the date of the prior application, if filed before the patenting or abandonment of or termination of proceedings on the first application or on an application similarly entitled to the benefit of the filing date of the first application.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">35 U.S.C. \u00a7 120 (2000) (emphases added). The right to priority is based on a previously filed eo-pending application or a chain of applications without a break in pendency. The parties here and the district court assumed that the disclosure of the \u2019026 patent was materially identical to the \u2019072 application. While we note that amendments may be made to the written description of an application prior to issuance as a patent, <em>see </em>37 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.121(b), we will assume for the purposes of this appeal that the \u2019026 patent is not materially different from the \u2019072 application as originally filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Upon review of the \u2019026 patent, we find that there is no written description support for the claim recitation \u201cremoving the hollow member on completion of surgery.\u201d On appeal, appellants argue that \u201cthere is nothing in this patent which requires the surgeon to leave the tissue expander in the body.\u201d (Appellants\u2019 Br. at 5.) The absence of a requirement to leave the expander in place is not a teaching to remove it. As this court stated in <em>New Railhead Manufacturing, L.L.C. v. Vermeer Manufacturing Co., </em>298 F.3d 1290, 63 USPQ2d 1843 (Fed.Cir.2002),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-7\">The purpose of the written description requirement is broader than to merely explain how to \u201cmake and use\u201d; the applicant must also convey with reasonable clarity to those skilled in the art that, as of the filing date sought, he or she was in possession of the invention .... That is, the disclosure must show he had invented each feature that is included as a claim limitation. <em>The adequacy of the written description </em>fia, <em>the disclosure) is measured from the face of the application.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 1295, 298 F.3d 1290, 63 USPQ2d at 1847 (citation omitted) (emphasis added). The \u2019026 patent does not, on its face, disclose the removal of the tissue expander. Appellants do not contest this fact, but rather rely on expert declarations to the effect that those skilled in the art would have known that the expander could be removed as part of surgery. (Appellants\u2019 Br. at 12.) The declarations, however, were not directed to what the patent actually disclosed, but rather what a skilled artisan could conclude therefrom. We, therefore, hold that under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 120 the \u2019545 patent cannot claim the priority date of the \u2019072 application for failure to meet the requirements under the first paragraph of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112. The critical date, therefore, is March 30, 1994. Based on the plaintiffs admissions to public uses and sales of the claimed invention prior to March 30, 1994, summary judgment was properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-12\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b319-13\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
