Bechtel alleged deliberate indifference to his medical needs and the use of excessive force when a cell door was slammed on his hand. The district court dismissed the action because Bechtel failed to exhaust administrative remedies as required by the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">The PLRA requires that Bechtel \u201cexhaust remedies as are available\u201d before bringing an action in federal court. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). The Supreme Court has interpreted this language to require a prisoner to exhaust all administrative remedies even if those remedies do not provide for pecuniary damages when the prisoner only seeks a monetary reward. <em>Booth v. Churner, </em>582 U.S. 731, 741, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001). Even though Bechtel filed his complaint before the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Booth, </em>the Supreme Court\u2019s decision construing the PLRA applies retroactively to pending cases. <em>Rivers v. Roadway Express, Inc., </em>511 U.S. 298, 313-12, 114 S.Ct. 1510, 128 L.Ed.2d 274 (1994); <em>Harper v. Virginia Dep\u2019t of Taxation, </em>509 U.S. 86, 97, 113 S.Ct. 2510, 125 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Bechtel admits that he did not file a grievance form as required by prison policy. Therefore, the district court correctly dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b733-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
