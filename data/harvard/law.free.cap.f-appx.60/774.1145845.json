R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-20\">This matter is before the court on Sylvester Johnlouis\u2019 <em>pro se </em>request for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d). Johnlouis seeks a COA so that he can appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A) (providing that no appeal may be taken from a final order denying a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition unless the petitioner first obtains a COA). Because Johnlouis has not made a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d this court denies his request for a COA and dismisses this appeal. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-21\">Johnlouis was convicted in New Mexico state court of first degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder, robbery, and tampering with evidence; he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of forty-five years. After exhausting his state court remedies, Johnlouis filed the instant \u00a7 2254 habeas petition in federal district court asserting that his trial counsel had been ineffective in several particulars. The district court referred the matter to a magistrate judge for initial proceedings pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B). In a thorough report and recommendation, the magistrate judge noted that each aspect of Johnlouis\u2019 ineffective assistance claim had been addressed on the merits by the state courts. Accordingly, the magistrate judge concluded that the appropriate question was whether the state courts\u2019 analysis of Johnlouis\u2019 ineffective assistance claims was \u201ccontrary to\u201d or an \u201cunreasonable application of\u2019 clearly established Supreme Court precedent or \u201cresulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>tion of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). With that analytical framework in mind, the magistrate judge noted that in resolving Johnlouis\u2019 claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, the state courts had applied the correct governing Supreme Court precedent, <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). The magistrate judge further noted that in his habeas petition Johnlouis had merely repeated the claims he made in state court and had failed to rebut the factual findings under-girding the state courts\u2019 decisions by clear and convincing evidence. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). Because the relevant state court decisions were neither \u201ccontrary to\u201d nor an \u201cunreasonable application of\u2019 <em>Strickland, </em>the magistrate judge recommended that Johnlouis\u2019 petition be denied. Upon <em>de novo </em>review, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and denied the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">To be entitled to a COA, Johnlouis must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2258(c)(2). To make the requisite showing, he must demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>587 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (quotations omitted). In deciding whether Johnlouis has carried his burden, this court undertakes \u201ca preliminary, though not definitive, consideration of the [legal] framework\u201d applicable to each of his claims. <em>Id. </em>at 1040. Although Johnlouis need not demonstrate that his appeal will succeed to be entitled to a COA, he must \u201cprove something more than the absence of frivolity or the existence of mere good faith.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1040.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">Having undertaken a review of Johnlouis application for a COA and appellate brief, the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, the district court order, and the entire record on appeal pursuant to the framework set out by the Supreme Court in <em>Miller-El, </em>this court concludes that Johnlouis is not entitled to a COA. The district court\u2019s resolution of Johnlouis\u2019 claims is not reasonably subject to debate and the claims are not adequate to deserve further proceedings. Accordingly, this court DENIES his request for a COA and DISMISSES this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b806-18\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
