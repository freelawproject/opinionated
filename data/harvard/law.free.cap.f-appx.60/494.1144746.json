We conclude that we lack jurisdiction to review this claim pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) (2000). <em>See Tsevegmid v. Ashcroft, </em>318 F.3d 1226, 1229-30 (10th Cir.2003); <em>Molino-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Fahim v. U.S. Attorney Gen., </em>278 F.3d 1216, 1217-18 (11th Cir.2002); <em>Ismailov v. Reno, </em>263 F.3d 851, 854-55 (8th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-24\">Second, while we would have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a) to consider Hailu\u2019s claims for withholding of removal and pursuant to the Convention Against Torture, we find that they have been waived. <em>See Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999) (\u201cFa\u00fcure to comply with the specific dictates of [Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(a)(9)(A)] with respect to a particular claim triggers abandonment of that claim on appeal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">We accordingly dismiss the petition for review as to the determination of Hailu\u2019s ineligibility to seek asylum under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a) and deny the petition for review as to the denial of withholding of removal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
