We affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural histories of this case, we need not recount them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Ramirez\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing on his motion to suppress. Evidentiary hearings on motions to suppress need be held only when the \u201cmoving papers allege[ ] facts with sufficient definiteness, clarity, and specificity to enable the trial court to conclude [either] that relief must be granted if the facts alleged are proved[,]\u201d <em>United States v. Carrion, </em>463 F.2d 704, 706 (9th Cir.1972) (citation omitted), or \u201cthat contested issues of fact exist.\u201d <em>United States v. Howell, </em>231 F.3d 615, 620 (9th Cir.2000) (citations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 831, 122 S.Ct. 76, 151 L.Ed.2d 40 (2001). Absent sufficiently definite and specific moving papers, a district court\u2019s decision to conduct or not to conduct an evidentiary hearing on a motion to suppress need only rest within the district court\u2019s \u201creasoned discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Walczak, </em>783 F.2d 852, 857 (9th Cir.1986), <em>citing, United States v. Santoro, </em>600 F.2d 1317, 1320 (9th Cir.1979); <em>see also United States v. Wardlow, </em>951 F.2d 1115, 1116 (9th Cir.1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 976, 113 S.Ct. 469, 121 L.Ed.2d 376 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">The declaration filed concomitantly with the suppression motion fails to \u201callege facts with sufficient definiteness, clarity, and specificity to enable the trial court to conclude that contested issues of fact exist,\u201d <em>Howell, </em>231 F.3d at 620 (citation omitted), or that \u201crelief must be granted if the facts alleged are proved.\u201d <em>Carrion, </em>463 F.2d at 706 (citation omitted). The relevant questions in this case include whether Ramirez was speeding on December 5, 1997, and whether probable cause supported both stop and search. <em>Cf. Walczak, </em>783 F.2d at 857. Bakman\u2019s declaration is, with regard to these questions, inapposite; it does nothing to show that Ramirez was not \u2014 or may not have been \u2014 driving unlawfully fast on the day at issue, and it does nothing to controvert the district court\u2019s finding of drug-based probable cause. Thus, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying an evidentiary hearing on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">The district court also did not err in denying the suppression motion. It is axiomatic that \u201c[p]robable cause exists when police officers have facts and circumstances within their knowledge sufficient to warrant a reasonable belief that the suspect has committed or was committing a crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Wallace, </em>213 F.3d 1216, 1220 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 974, 121 S.Ct. 418, 148 L.Ed.2d 323 (2000), <em>citing, United States v. Fouche, </em>776 F.2d 1398, 1403 (9th Cir.1985) (internal quotation marks omitted). A \u201cfluid\u201d rather than an abstract or a static concept, a probable cause determination depends entirely on an \u201cassessment of the probabilities in particular factual contexts.\u201d <em>Illinois v. Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 232, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">When determining whether sufficient knowledge undergirds particular law enforcement conduct, this court has \u201clook[ed] to the collective knowledge of all the officers involved in the criminal investigation,\u201d not simply the discrete knowledge of the \u201cofficer who actually makes the stop.\u201d <em>United States v. Sutton, </em>794 F.2d 1415, 1426 (9th Cir.1986); <em>see also United States v. Michael R., </em>90 F.3d 340, 346 (9th Cir.1996) (noting that the term \u201ctrained officer\u2019s experience\u201d includes the \u201ccollective knowledge of the officers involved ... \u201d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>(citation omitted). Permissible deductions and rational inferences drawn from officers\u2019 experience, training, and expertise form a part of this \u201ccollective knowledge,\u201d as long as rooted in \u201cobjective facts\u201d and as long as amenable to \u201crational explanation.\u201d <em>Michael R., </em>90 F.3d at 346.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">The collective knowledge of \u201call the officers involved in the [relevant] criminal investigation\u201d supports the district court\u2019s probable cause decision here: Before ordering the stop of Ramirez\u2019 vehicle, members of the joint task force intercepted a series of evidently drug-sale-related phone calls; they witnessed Ramirez\u2019 arrival and departure and noted that these events coincided precisely with the placement of relevant- phone calls; they observed Ramirez depart in the direction indicated by his putative boss; and they drew a rational inference from these \u201cobjective facts\u201d that Ramirez was involved in the delivery of cocaine. <em>Cf. Michael R., </em>90 F.3d at 346; <em>Sutton, </em>794 F.2d at 1426 (listing seven \u201cfacts\u201d supportive of the \u201cfounded suspicion\u201d that a given defendant was involved in criminal activity). From this factual and inferential predicate, it is clear that, \u201cat the moment of [Ramirez\u2019] arrest,\u201d the collective knowledge of all of the law enforcement officers involved was adequate for a prudent person to believe that Ramirez had, was then, or would soon commit a drug-related offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The Supreme Court has posited a two-part test for determining whether the so-called \u201cautomobile exception\u201d to the general requirement of \u201csecuring a warrant\u201d for a search is satisfied: one, the car must be \u201creadily mobile\u201d; and, two, \u201cprobable cause [must] exist[] to believe [the car] containfs] contraband.\u201d <em>See Pennsylvania v. Labron, </em>518 U.S. 938, 940, 116 S.Ct. 2485, 135 L.Ed.2d 1031 (1996) (\u201cIf a car is readily mobile and probable cause exists to believe it contains contraband, the Fourth Amendment permits police to search the vehicle without more.\u201d) (citation omitted). Officer Hetherington\u2019s cursory search of Ramirez\u2019 truck, Detective Agnevds more invasive search of that truck, and Officers Geiger and Hill\u2019s pre-impound search of the truck all satisfy this two prong test.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">First, and most basically, all of the searches of Ramirez\u2019 vehicle were conducted while the truck remained \u201creadily mobile\u201d: both Hetherington\u2019s and Agnew\u2019s searches occurred as the truck sat roadside, available to be moved, and Geiger and Hill\u2019s search fits within the definition of \u201creadily mobile\u201d developed by the Supreme Court and this court. <em>See especially Michigan v. Thomas, </em>458 U.S. 259, 261, 102 S.Ct. 3079, 73 L.Ed.2d 750 (1982) (\u201cIt is thus clear that the justification to conduct such a warrantless search does not vanish once the car has been immobilized.\u201d) (citations omitted); <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>205 F.3d 1182, 1187 (9th Cir.2000) (finding that a vehicle remained \u201cmobile\u201d and, thus, continued to fit the \u201cautomobile exception\u201d even after it was towed).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">Second, the same facts \u2014 e.g., the timing and content of the phone calls, the appearance and departure of \u201cGordo\u201d \u2014 informing probable cause for the stop support a finding of sufficient probable cause \u201cto believe [Ramirez\u2019 vehicle] contain[ed] contraband.\u201d <em>Labron, </em>518 U.S. at 940; <em>cf. United States v. Patzer, </em>277 F.3d 1080, 1083 (9th Cir.2002) (declaring a supposedly incidental search invalid where the arresting officer \u201cdid not have probable cause to arrest [defendant] for driving under the influence of marijuana\u201d). Thus, all three searches were permissible, both in timing and in intrusiveness, under the \u201cautomobile ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>ception\u201d to the bar against warrantless searches.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b162-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
