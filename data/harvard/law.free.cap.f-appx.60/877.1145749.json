Davis\u2019s sentence also included $800 in criminal penalties and payment of restitution to the victim banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-22\">In his appeal, Davis challenges the district court decision to add (1) an additional criminal history point pursuant to Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 4Al.l(c) for his prior conviction of second-degree harassment; and (2) an additional two criminal history points under Guideline \u00a7 4Al.l(d) because Davis was subject to conditional release for the harassment offense when he committed his final robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-23\">We review the district court\u2019s application and interpretation of the guidelines de novo, <em>see United States v. Sanders, </em>205 F.3d 549, 552 (2d Cir.2000) (per curiam), but note that \u201cwhere, as here, a statute punishes a range of conduct under the broad rubric of \u2018harassment,\u2019 the comparison contemplated by section 4A1.2(c) must focus on the particular conduct of the defendant. In such circumstances, a sentencing judge making the \u2018similar to\u2019 com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>parison is applying the guideline to the facts, a matter to which we are to give \u2018due deference.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Morales, </em>239 F.3d 113, 118 (2d Cir.2000) (vacating and remanding where the district court added an additional criminal history point for defendant\u2019s prior sentence of conditional release for second-degree harassment). However, while we will defer to a district court\u2019s findings, we have consistently stressed the importance of making adequate factual findings at sentencing. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Smith, </em>174 F.3d 52, 57 (2d Cir.1999) (vacating and remanding because \u201c[t]he district court\u2019s findings in this case are insufficient to enable us meaningfully to review the propriety of the firearm adjustments\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">Here, we have no factual findings from the district court which might distinguish Davis\u2019s second-degree harassment conviction from the second-degree harassment conviction in <em>Morales, </em>where we held that the same offense was insufficient to warrant the additional criminal history point. 239 F.3d at 120. Unless Davis\u2019s offense is factually distinguished from the list of criminal justice sentences excluded from calculations under \u00a7 4A1.2(c), the additional point under \u00a7 4A1.1(c) may not be assessed. <em>See id. </em>Absent such findings, we are unable to determine whether the \u00a7 4A1.1(e) adjustment was or was not appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">Davis\u2019s additional two criminal history points under Guideline \u00a7 4A1.1(d) are contingent on the disposition of the above issue. Under \u00a7 4A1.1(d), two points may be added \u201cif the defendant committed the instant offense while under any criminal justice sentence,\u201d and a conditional discharge can qualify as a criminal justice sentence under the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Labella-Szuba, </em>92 F.3d 136, 138 (2d Cir.1996). However, the sentence is subject to the same analysis as a possible additional point under \u00a7 4Al.l(c), in that the sentence in question must be \u201ccountable under \u00a7 4A1.2.\u201d U.S.S.G. Commentary Note 4, \u00a7 4Al.l(d). In other words, the offense for which the criminal justice sentence was imposed can not be substantially similar to the excluded offenses in \u00a7 4A1.2(c). As a result, we are again faced with the question of whether Davis\u2019s second-degree harassment conviction in this case is distinguishable from the conviction in <em>Morales, </em>a question we do not have adequate factual findings to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">The judgment of the district court is VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
