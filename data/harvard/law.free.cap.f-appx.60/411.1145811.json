Gaud claims that the District Court erred in concluding that the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u2019s\u201d) findings were supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-20\">The District Court exercised jurisdiction over Gaud\u2019s request for review of the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). Because the District Court\u2019s Order was a final judgment that disposed of all of the Parties\u2019 claims, we exercise jurisdiction over the instant appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-21\">We review de novo the issue of whether the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Plummer v. Apfel, </em>186 F.3d 422, 427 (3d Cir.1999) (stating that \u201c[t]he role of this Court is identical to that of the District Court, namely to determine whether there is substantial evidence to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision.\u201d) Substantial evidence \u201cdoes not mean a large or significant amount of evidence, but rather such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Hartranft v. Apfel, </em>181 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>358, 360 (3d Cir.1999) (citing <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 565, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988)). \u201cWe will not set aside the Commissioner\u2019s decision if it is supported by substantial evidence, even if we would have decided the factual inquiry differently.\u201d <em>Hartranft, </em>181 F.3d at 360 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">After a careful review of the record and the Parties\u2019 arguments, we find no basis for disturbing the District Court\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned opinion. The District Court conducted a comprehensive analysis of the evidence considered by the ALJ, including a summary of medical reports from ten sources dealing with Gaud\u2019s diagnoses and treatment. The District Court then evaluated each of the alleged errors set forth by Gaud in challenging the ALJ\u2019s decision and concluded that the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. Gaud raises essentially the same issues before this Court as she did before the District Court. Because we agree that the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence, we will affirm the judgment for substantially the same reasons set forth in the record.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
