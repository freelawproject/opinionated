Code Ann., Lab. &amp; Empl. (1991, 2016 Repl. Vol.) (\u201cLE\u201d) \u00a7\u00a7 9-101 to 9-1201, \u201cis to protect workers and their families from hardships inflicted by work-related injuries by providing workers with compensation for loss of earning capacity resulting from accidental injury arising out of and in the course of employment.\u201d Hollingsworth v. Severstal Sparrows Point, LLC, 448 Md. 648, 665, 141 A.3d 90, 94 (2016) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). For purposes of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, \u201can accidental injury that arises out of and in the course of employment\u201d is known as an \u201caccidental personal injury[.]\u201d LE \u00a7 9-101(b)(1). The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act divides disabilities that are caused by accidental personal injuries into four categories:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqB\">temporary partial disability (disability which is temporary in duration and partial in extent) ...; temporary total disability (disability which is temporary in duration but total in extent) ..,; permanent partial disability (disability which is permanent in duration and partial in extent) .,.; and permanent total disability (disability which is permanent in duration and total in extent)[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">Wal Mart Stores, Inc. v. Holmes, 416 Md. 346, 353 n.2, 7 A.3d 13, 17 n.2 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">In this matter of first impression\u2014where an employee suffered an accidental personal injury and incurred a subsequent injury outside the course of employment, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) awarded permanent partial disability benefits, and, later, the employee alleged a worsening of the employee\u2019s medical condition\u2014we must decide whether the existence of a subsequent intervening <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>event finding by the Commission precluded the Commission from awarding additional permanent partial disability benefits and other workers\u2019 compensations benefits for worsening of the employee\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Michael L. LaBonte (\u201cLaBonte\u201d), Respondent, was an electrician who worked for Electrical General Corporation, Petitioner, which had workers\u2019 compensation insurance through Selective Insurance Company of America, Petitioner (together, \u201cElectrical General\u201d). LaBonte suffered an accidental personal injury to his back at work when he caught and pushed a large ladder that had been falling down. LaBonte filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation and multiple Issues<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with the Commission, seeking temporary total disability benefits and temporary partial disability benefits, both of which the Commission awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Later, LaBonte was injured outside of the workplace in an unrelated matter. Specifically, a law enforcement officer initiated a traffic stop of a vehicle that LaBonte had been driving outside the course of his employment. According to LaBonte, during the traffic stop, the law enforcement officer grabbed him and pushed him down onto the vehicle, causing his existing back pain to be aggravated.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">LaBonte filed Issues with the Commission again, seeking additional temporary total disability benefits. The Commission issued an Order denying LaBonte\u2019s request, observing that he had been \u201cinvolved in a subsequent event on\u201d the date of the incident with the law enforcement officer. LaBonte filed Issues with the Commission again, this time seeking permanent partial disability benefits. In an Award of Compensation, the Commission awarded LaBonte permanent partial disability benefits, finding that his disability was partly due to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>accidental personal <em>injury\u2014ie., </em>his work-related injury\u2014and partly due to \u201cpre-existing and subsequent conditions!.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Years later, LaBonte filed a Petition to Reopen<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with the Commission, alleging that his back condition had worsened, and requesting additional permanent partial disability benefits. The Commission granted the Petition to Reopen, but found that there had not been a worsening of LaBonte\u2019s back condition that was causally related to his accidental personal injury because the Commission\u2019s previous Order and Award of Compensation established a \u201csubsequent intervening event\u201d that broke the \u201ccausal nexus\u201d between LaBonte\u2019s accidental personal injury and his existing back condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">LaBonte filed a Petition for Judicial Review. In the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, a jury found that LaBonte\u2019s accidental personal injury was the cause of the recent worsening of LaBonte\u2019s back condition. Electrical General noted an appeal, and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed, holding that the incident with the law enforcement officer did not preclude Electrical General\u2019s liability for the worsening of LaBonte\u2019s back condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Before us, Electrical General argues that, where an employee suffers both an accidental personal injury that causes a permanent partial disability and a subsequent intervening <em>event\u2014e,g., </em>an injury sustained outside the course of employment\u2014a finding that the employee has incurred a subsequent intervening event precludes the accidental personal injury from being the proximate cause of worsening of the disability. In other words, Electrical General asserts that a finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>an employee sustained a subsequent intervening injury forecloses an employer\u2019s further liability for permanent partial disability benefits and other workers\u2019 compensation benefits due to an alleged worsening of the employee\u2019s condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">As explained below, in our view, Electrical General conflates the law that applies to a temporary disability with the law that applies to a permanent disability. Liability for a temporary disability depends on the injury that occurred last. See Martin v. Allegany Cty. Bd. of Cty. Comm\u2019rs, 73 Md.App. 695, 700, 536 A.2d 132, 134 (1988). By contrast, liability for a permanent disability is to be apportioned among all of the injuries that caused the permanent disability, not just the injury that occurred last. See LE \u00a7 9-656. Applying these principles, we hold that, where the Commission has awarded permanent partial disability benefits based on an accidental personal injury or occupational disease and has also determined that the employee incurred a subsequent intervening <em>event\u2014e.g., </em>an injury sustained outside the course of employment\u2014upon a request to reopen alleging worsening of the employee\u2019s medical condition, the employee is entitled to compensation for permanent partial disability for any portion of such disability that is caused by and reasonably attributable solely to the employee\u2019s accidental personal injury or occupational disease. Stated otherwise, where an employee has incurred both accidental personal injury or occupational disease, and a subsequent intervening injury, and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission has apportioned permanent partial disability benefits for an accidental personal injury or occupational disease, the existence of a subsequent intervening event finding does not preclude the Commission from awarding additional permanent partial disability benefits for worsening of the employee\u2019s condition caused by and reasonably attributable solely to the accidental personal injury or occupational disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Further, the existence of a subsequent intervening event does not, <em>per se, </em>preclude an employer\u2019s liability for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. An employer may be liable for workers\u2019 compensation benefits where an employee demonstrates that a worsening of the employee\u2019s medical condition was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>caused by an accidental personal injury or occupational disease. And, the issues of whether an accidental personal injury or occupational disease, or a subsequent intervening event, caused a worsening of an employee\u2019s medical condition, and whether, for purposes of permanent partial disability benefits, a worsening of an employee\u2019s medical condition was reasonably attributable solely to an accidental personal injury or occupational disease, are factual matters for the Commission to determine in each individual case.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Accidental Personal Injury, Claim, and Initial Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">On September 2, 2004, while on the job, LaBonte and a helper maneuvered a 40-foot ladder that weighed more than 300 pounds. The ladder started to fall, and LaBonte caught it and pushed it back up. LaBonte felt something shift in his back. Later, LaBonte began experiencing constant back pain, and it was determined that LaBonte had suffered a herniated disc.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">LaBonte was either not working, or working in \u201ca light duty position,\u201d throughout nearly all of the period from September 13, 2004 to December 19, 2006. During that period, on May 24, 2006, LaBonte underwent back surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">On September 27, 2004, LaBonte filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation with the Commission, requesting temporary total disability benefits, medical treatment, and medical expenses. On June 16, 2006, the Commission conducted a hearing. In an Award of Compensation dated June 22, 2006, the Commission found that, on September 2, 2014, LaBonte had suffered an accidental personal injury that caused a disability. The Commission did not specify the type of disability that LaBonte\u2019s accidental personal injury had caused. The Commission reserved on the issue of temporary total disability benefits because no medical documentation had been submitted. The Commission granted LaBonte\u2019s requests for medical treatment and medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">LaBonte filed Issues with the Commission, requesting additional medical treatment in the form of a neurological consult; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>temporary partial disability benefits from March 18, 2005 to October 21, 2005; and temporary total disability benefits from September 13, 2004 to October 24, 2004, from November 23, 2004 to December 30, 2004, from February 24, 2005 to March 17, 2005, and from October 21, 2005 onward. On October 21, 2005, the Commission conducted a hearing. In an Order dated November 10, 2005, the Commission granted LaBonte\u2019s request for additional medical treatment, and awarded LaBonte all of the temporary partial disability benefits that he had requested. The Commission reserved on LaBonte\u2019s request for temporary total disability benefits from October 21, 2005 onward; denied LaBonte\u2019s request for temporary total disability benefits from March 8, 2005 to March 17, 2005; and awarded LaBonte all of the other temporary total disability benefits that he had requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">LaBonte filed Issues with the Commission a second time, requesting additional medical treatment that his physician had recommended, and temporary total disability benefits from January 5, 2006 onward. On March 10, 2006, the Commission conducted a hearing. In an Order dated March 15, 2006, the Commission granted LaBonte\u2019s request for additional medical treatment, and awarded LaBonte temporary total disability benefits starting on January 5, 2006, and continuing as long as he remained temporarily totally disabled as a result of his accidental personal injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">LaBonte filed Issues with the Commission a third time, requesting temporary total disability benefits from March 18, 2005 to October 21, 2005, and temporary partial disability benefits from March 18, 2005 onward. On June 29, 2006, the Commission conducted a hearing. In an Order dated July 20, 2006, the Commission awarded LaBonte all of the temporary total disability benefits that he had requested, and denied LaBonte\u2019s request for temporary partial disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">Incident with the Law Enforcement Officer and Subsequent Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">On December 31, 2006, a law enforcement officer initiated a traffic stop of a vehicle that LaBonte had been driving outside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>the course of employment. LaBonte was unable to perform sobriety tests to the officer\u2019s satisfaction, and the officer arrested and handcuffed LaBonte. According to LaBonte, the handcuffs came loose, and the officer grabbed LaBonte and pushed him down onto the vehicle. According to LaBonte, after the incident with the law enforcement officer, his back pain was aggravated.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">On January 15, 2007, a doctor recommended that LaBonte be placed on off-work status, and scheduled another appointment for February 5, 2007. Sometime after the February 5, 2007 appointment, LaBonte returned to work. LaBonte was prescribed medication and exercise, but no additional surgery was performed on his back.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">LaBonte filed Issues with the Commission a fourth time, requesting temporary total disability benefits from January 4, 2007 to March 9, 2007 and additional medical treatment in the form of lumbar epidural injections. On March 9, 2007, the Commission conducted a hearing. In an Order dated March 30, 2007, the Commission found that LaBonte\u2019s need for lumbar epidural injections was not causally related to his accidental personal injury. The Commission further stated that LaBonte had been \u201cinvolved in a subsequent event on December 31, <em>2006\u201d\u2014ie., </em>the date of the incident with the law enforcement officer\u2014and denied LaBonte\u2019s requests for temporary total disability benefits and additional medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">LaBonte filed Issues with the Commission a fifth time, requesting temporary total disability benefits from February 11, 2006 to March 20, 2006; temporary partial disability benefits from October 6, 2006 to December 19, 2006; permanent partial disability benefits from December 20, 2006 onward; and expenses for medical treatment that he had received between January 15, 2007 and March 5, 2007. On October 4, 2007, the Commission conducted a hearing. In an Award of Compensation dated October 15, 2007, the Commission found that LaBonte had \u201coverall 30% industrial [permanent partial] disability to the body due to an injury to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>back; 20% is due to [his] accidental [personal] injury, and 10% is causally connected to pre-existing and subsequent eondi-tions[.]\u201d The Commission awarded LaBonte all of the temporary total disability benefits and temporary partial disability benefits that he had requested. The Commission awarded LaBonte permanent partial disability benefits in the form of $247 weekly, starting on December 20, 2006, and continuing for 100 weeks, and denied LaBonte\u2019s request for medical expenses that had been incurred between January 15, 2007 and March 5, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">Petition to Reopen</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Approximately five years later, on October 10, 2012, La-Bonte filed a Petition to Reopen with the Commission, alleging that his back condition had worsened, and requesting additional medical treatment, payment of medical expenses that he had incurred on February 16, 2012, and additional permanent partial disability benefits. The Commission granted the Petition to Reopen. On January 16, 2013, the Commission conducted a hearing. In an Order dated January 24, 2013, the Commission found that there had not been a worsening of LaBonte\u2019s back condition that was causally related to his accidental personal injury because the Commission\u2019s Order dated March 30, 2007 and its Award of Compensation dated October 15, 2007 \u201cestablish[ed] a subsequent intervening event [that] breaks the causal nexus between the accidental [personal] injury and the [existing back] condition.\u201d The Commission denied LaBonte\u2019s requests for additional medical treatment, medical expenses, and additional permanent partial disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Proceedings in the Circuit Court</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">LaBonte filed a Petition for Judicial Review in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. The case was transferred to the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (\u201cthe circuit court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Electrical General filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, contending that, as a matter of law, the Commission\u2019s orders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>precluded a finding that LaBonte\u2019s accidental personal injury-caused his back condition\u2019s worsening. The circuit court denied the Motion for Summary Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">At a jury trial, in a video deposition, Michael Franchetti, M.D., testified as an expert witness for LaBonte in the fields of orthopedic surgery and medicine. Dr. Franchetti testified that he examined LaBonte at his counsel\u2019s request on two occasions\u2014first on May 22, 2007, and second on September 18, 2012.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> During the first examination, Dr. Franchetti determined that LaBonte had 43% \u201cwhole person impairment due to\u201d his accidental personal injury. During the second examination, Dr. Franchetti determined that LaBonte\u2019s whole person impairment had increased to 53%. Dr. Franchetti testified that the incident with the law enforcement officer did not result in any permanent worsening of LaBonte\u2019s back condition, and that LaBonte\u2019s back condition was causally related to his accidental personal injury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">In another video deposition, Edward R. Cohen, M.D., testified as an expert witness for Electrical General in the fields of orthopedic surgery and medicine. Dr. Cohen testified that he examined LaBonte at Electrical General\u2019s request on two occasions\u2014first in 2004, and second in 2014. Dr, Cohen opined that, in light of the incident with the law enforcement officer, LaBonte\u2019s existing back condition was not causally related to his accidental personal injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Using a special verdict sheet, the jury found that LaBonte\u2019s existing back condition was causally related to his accidental personal injury; that 100% of the worsening of LaBonte\u2019s permanent partial disability since October 15, 2007 was due to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>his accidental personal injury; that LaBonte\u2019s request for medical treatment was reasonable, necessary, and causally related to his accidental personal injury; and that LaBonte\u2019s request for medical expenses that he had incurred on February 16, 2012 was reasonable, necessary, and causally related to his accidental personal injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The circuit court reversed the Commission\u2019s January 24, 2013 order and remanded with instructions to issue an order consistent with the jury\u2019s verdict. Electrical General filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, which the circuit court denied. Electrical General noted an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Opinion of the Court of Special Appeals</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the circuit court\u2019s judgment, holding that the incident with the law enforcement officer \u201cdid not, <em>per se, </em>preclude further liability on the part of [Electrical General] for the permanent partial injury [that LaBonte] sustained on the job.\u201d Elec. Gen. Corp. v. LaBonte, 229 Md.App. 187, 196, 208, 144 A.3d 856, 861, 868, reconsideration denied (Sept. 28, 2016). The Court of Special Appeals concluded that \u201cthere was sufficient proof that [LaBonte]\u2019s back condition was caused by his [accidental personal injury] and not by the [ ] incident with the [law enforcement] officer.\u201d Id. at 197, 144 A.3d at 862 (citation omitted). The Court of Special Appeals explained that \u201cpermanent disability benefits, unlike temporary disability benefits, can be caused by both an initial [accidental personal injury] and a subsequent accident so as to preserve the liability of the employer for that portion of the disability that is attributable to the initial accident.\u201d Id. at 201, 144 A.3d at 864.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Electrical General filed a motion for reconsideration, contending that the opinion of the Court of Special Appeals was internally inconsistent and conflicted with precedent. The Court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Petition for a Writ of <em>Certiorari</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Electrical General petitioned for a writ of <em>certiorari, </em>raising the following four issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">1. Whether the previously determined finding that [La-Bonte] sustained a subsequent intervening accident barred any further liability of [Electrical General] for workers\u2019 compensation benefits due to a prior [accidental personal] injury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-8\">2. Whether the Circuit Court erred by allowing the jury to consider whether [LaBonte] sustained a subsequent intervening accident to his back because litigation of that issue was precluded under the doctrine of collateral estoppel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-9\">3. \u201cWhether the Circuit Court erred in submitting the jury question of whether [LaBonte]\u2019s back condition was causally related to the [accidental personal] injury because the question was insufficient to resolve the factual disputes between the parties and improperly shifted the burden of proof to [Electrical General]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-10\">4. \"Whether the Circuit Court erred by allowing the jury to decide issues that were not previously decided by the [ ] Commission?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">This Court granted the petition. See Elec. Gen. Corp. v. LaBonte, 450 Md. 662, 150 A.3d 818 (2016).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Ael\">The Parties\u2019 Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">Electrical General contends that it is not liable for permanent partial disability benefits or any other workers\u2019 compensation benefits due to the worsening of LaBonte\u2019s back condition because the Commission previously found the existence of a subsequent intervening act. Electrical General argues that it is undisputed that LaBonte sustained a subsequent intervening accident on December 31, 2006, and that the Commission found as much in its Order dated March 30, 2007 and its Award of Compensation dated October 15, 2007. Electrical General asserts that, because LaBonte suffered an accidental personal injury, and the Commission found that he incurred a subsequent injury outside the course of employment, the subsequent intervening accident severed the causal nexus between LaBonte\u2019s disability and the accidental personal injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">As such, Electrical General maintains that, although it was liable for the portion of LaBonte\u2019s back condition that was caused by his accidental personal injury, the subsequent intervening event\u2014namely, the incident with the law enforcement officer\u2014precluded its liability for any worsening of LaBonte\u2019s back condition. Electrical General contends that the Commission\u2019s Order dated March 30, 2007 and its Award of Compensation dated October 15, 2007 constituted the law of the case because no party petitioned for judicial review of either decision. According to Electrical General, once the incident with the law enforcement officer was found to be a subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>intervening event, as a matter of law, that event became the cause of any alleged additional disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">LaBonte requests that the Court affirm the decision of the Court of Special Appeals because his back condition\u2019s worsening was independent of the subsequent event. LaBonte contends that, where an accidental personal injury causes a permanent disability, the finding of a subsequent intervening event does not discharge the employer from any further responsibility under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. LaBonte argues that the determination of a subsequent intervening event does not sever the causal relationship between the accidental personal injury and any worsening of the employee\u2019s medical condition. LaBonte notes that, unlike liability for temporary disability benefits, liability for permanent disability benefits may be apportioned among multiple injuries. Specifically, LaBonte observes that, under LE \u00a7 9-656(a), where it appears that an employee\u2019s permanent disability is partly due to an accidental personal injury and partly due to a preexisting condition, the Commission must determine the proportion of the permanent disability that is reasonably attributable to the accidental personal injury, and the proportion of the permanent disability that is reasonably attributable to the preexisting condition. LaBonte asserts that, irrespective of the Commission\u2019s Order dated March 30, 2007 and its Award of Compensation dated October 15, 2007, the jury had the authority to determine how much, if any, of the worsening of his back condition was caused by his accidental personal injury, LaBonte maintains that the evidence adduced at trial supported the jury\u2019s finding that his accidental personal injury was the only cause of his back condition\u2019s worsening.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">LaBonte contends that adopting Electrical General\u2019s position would create a new legal rule and allow employers and insurers to escape liability for accidental personal injuries in situations in which a subsequent intervening event is not the cause of an employee\u2019s ongoing or worsening injury. LaBonte argues that such a result would be contrary to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act\u2019s language and remedial purpose, which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>to provide compensation for lost earning capacity that results from accidental personal injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">In an action for judicial review, this Court reviews the administrative agency\u2019s decision, not the decision of the circuit court or the Court of Special Appeals.

This Court observed that an accidental personal injury is the proximate cause of an employee\u2019s disability where the accidental personal injury could have caused the employee\u2019s disability and \u201cno other efficient cause has intervened!!.]\u201d Id. at 581, 105 A.2d at 239. This Court concluded that an accidental personal injury is not the proximate cause of an employee\u2019s disability where the employee\u2019s disability \u201censues from some hazard to which [the employee] would have been equally exposed apart from his [or her] employment.\u201d Id. at 582, 105 A.2d at 239 (citation omitted). In Reeves, id. at 579, 105 A.2d at 238, an employee incurred an accidental personal injury when he dislocated his shoulder while working in a garage, and was compensated for a week that he missed from work. Afterward, the employee dislocated his shoulder several more times, both in and outside the course of employment, with the most recent shoulder dislocation occurring at the workplace. See id. at 579-80, 105 A.2d at 238. The employee\u2019s physician treated him for his most recent work-related shoulder dislocation. See id. at 580, 105 A.2d at 238. After the treatment, there was no limitation of movement in the employee\u2019s shoulder, which was in approximately the same condition that it had been before his most recent work-related shoulder dislocation. See id. at 580, 105 A.2d at 238. Subsequently, the employee underwent surgery on his shoulder, which became partially immobilized as a result. See id. at 580-81, 105 A.2d at 239. The employee filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation as to his most recent work-related shoulder dislocation, seeking both temporary total disability benefits and permanent partial disability benefits. See id. at 582-83, 105 A.2d at 239-40. The Commission denied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>employee\u2019s claim. See id. at 578, 105 A.2d at 237. The employee appealed. See id. at 578, 105 A.2d at 237. A jury found that the employee\u2019s most recent work-related shoulder dislocation had caused his temporary total disability and his permanent partial disability. See id. at 578, 105 A.2d at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">This Court reversed,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> concluding that, in light of the evidence concerning the intervening surgery, the trial court had erred in not withdrawing from the jury the issue of whether the employee\u2019s most recent work-related shoulder dislocation had caused his permanent partial disability. See Reeves, 204 Md. at 583, 105 A.2d at 240. This Court observed that there was no evidence that the employee\u2019s most recent work-related shoulder dislocation had caused his permanent partial disability, as the employee\u2019s expert witness, his physician, testified that his most recent work-related shoulder dislocation did not cause his condition after the surgery, See id. at 582-83, 105 A.2d at 239-40. Additionally, the expert did not testify that the employee\u2019s most recent work-related shoulder dislocation necessitated the surgery. See id. at 582, 105 A.2d at 239. We noted: \u201cThis is not the case of reopening an old claim for injury wherein the claimant\u2019s condition has become worse or new disability has developed.\u201d Id. at 582, 105 A.2d at 239. In sum, in Reeves, id. at 582-83, 105 A.2d at 239-40, this Court found that there was no evidence of a causal connection between the accidental personal injury on which the employee relied and the surgery and subsequent disability, and concluded that the trial court erred in allowing the issue of permanent partial disability to go to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">In Martin, 73 Md.App. at 700, 536 A.2d at 134, the Court of Special Appeals held that the principle \u201c[t]hat benefits are to be awarded for a temporary disability without regard to preexisting disease or infirmity makes clear that it is the final accident contributing to the disability which is to serve as the basis for liability.\u201d In Martin, id. at 73 Md.App. at 696, 536 A.2d at 132-33, an employee suffered an accidental personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>injury involving his back and filed a claim for workers\u2019 compensation, and the Commission awarded him temporary total disability benefits. The employee started a new job with a different employer, suffered two more accidental personal injuries involving his back, and filed a second claim for workers\u2019 compensation. See id. at 696, 636 A.2d at 132-33. The Court of Special Appeals observed that the record on appeal in Martin did not include a copy of the Commission\u2019s order as to the employee\u2019s second claim. See id. at 696, 536 A.2d at 133. Accordingly, it was unknown whether the Commission awarded the employee any temporary total disability benefits as to his second claim. See id, at 696, 536 A.2d at 133. In any event, the Commission\u2019s order as to the employee\u2019s second claim was appealed to a trial court, in which a jury found that the employee\u2019s temporary total disability was causally related to all three of his accidental personal injuries. See id. at 696-97, 536 A.2d at 133. The trial court remanded the case to the Commission with instructions to determine the amount of compensation, if any, to which the employee was entitled. See id. at 697, 536 A.2d at 133. No party appealed from the proceedings in the trial court. See id. at 697, 536 A.2d at 133. On remand, based on the employee\u2019s first accidental personal injury, the Commission awarded the employee temporary total disability benefits, to be paid entirely by the employee\u2019s first employer. See id. at 697, 536 A.2d at 133. The employee\u2019s first employer sought judicial review. See id, at 697, 536 A.2d at 133. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the employee\u2019s first employer, and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed. See id. at 698, 701, 536 A.2d at 133, 135,</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The Court of Special Appeals concluded that the jury\u2019s findings of a causal relationship between each of the employee\u2019s three accidental personal injuries and his temporary total disability became the law of the case because no party appealed from the jury\u2019s verdict. See id. at 698-99, 536 A.2d at 133. Next, the Court of Special Appeals held that the Commission\u2019s award of temporary total disability benefits was inconsistent with the jury\u2019s finding that the employee\u2019s temporary total disability was causally related to his third accidental personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>injury, <em>ie., </em>an injury that occurred while the employee was working for his second employer. See id. at 700, 586 A.2d at 134. The Court of Special Appeals noted that, because the case involved a temporary disability rather than a permanent disability, the award of disability benefits was not to be apportioned to account for all three accidental personal injuries. See id. at 699, 536 A.2d at 134. The Court of Special Appeals stated that, given that an award of temporary disability benefits is not to be apportioned to assess for a preexisting disease or infirmity, it follows that the last accident that contributes to a temporary disability determines which employer is liable. See id. at 700, 536 A.2d at 134. As such, the Court of Special Appeals determined that the employee\u2019s second employer was liable for his disability because he was working for his second employer when he suffered his third and final accidental personal injury. See id. at 700, 536 A.2d at 134. The Court of Special Appeals explained that, although the jury found that the employee\u2019s temporary total disability was causally related to his first accidental personal injury, the same was not the proximate cause of his temporary total disability because the employee\u2019s later two accidental personal injuries were intervening efficient causes. See id. at 700-01, 536 A.2d at 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">As to causation, Maryland Civil Pattern Jury Instruction 30:12, which applies to workers\u2019 compensation cases and was given at trial in this case, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">In order to be compensable there must be proof that the injury could have been caused by the accident and nothing else after the accident occurred to cause the injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-7\">When an Employee has an injury that arises out of and in the course of employment, every natural consequence that flows from the injury likewise arises out of the employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">Here, we conclude that, where the Commission has awarded permanent partial disability benefits based on an accidental personal injury, and the Commission has also determined that the employee has incurred a subsequent intervening event\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number><em>e.g., </em>an injury sustained outside the course of employment\u2014 the employer may be liable for a worsening of the employee\u2019s condition that is caused by and reasonably attributable solely to the accidental personal injury. Where it appears that an employee\u2019s permanent disability was caused in part by an accidental personal injury and in part by a preexisting disease, LE \u00a7 9-656(a) directs the Commission to determine the proportion of the disability that is reasonably attributable to the accidental personal injury, and the proportion of the disability that is reasonably attributable to the preexisting disease. Under LE \u00a7 9\u2014656(b)(1), the employee is entitled to benefits for the portion of the permanent disability that is reasonably attributable solely to the accidental personal injury. It is entirely logical that an employer and its insurer are liable for the portion of a worsening of an employee\u2019s medical condition that was caused by, and is reasonably attributable solely to, an accidental personal injury. The issues of whether an accidental personal injury or a subsequent intervening event caused a worsening of an employee\u2019s medical condition, and whether, for purposes of permanent partial disability benefits, the worsening of the employee\u2019s medical condition was reasonably attributable solely to the accidental personal injury, are factual matters for the Commission to determine in each individual case.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">It is evident that, in this case, the Commission interpreted its Order dated March 30, 2007\u2014in which it stated that LaBonte had been \u201cinvolved in a subsequent event\u201d\u2014and its Award of Compensation dated October 15, 2007\u2014-in which it apportioned LaBonte\u2019s permanent partial disability, -with 10% of the disability as being \u201ccausally connected to preexisting and subsequent conditions\u201d\u2014to be findings of a circumstance that, as a matter of law, precluded further liability on the part of Electrical General for worsening of LaBonte\u2019s medical condition.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Indeed, in its Order dated January 24, 2013, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Commission stated that the previous Order and Award \u201cestablished] a subsequent intervening event which breaks the causal nexus between the accidental [personal] injury and the current condition.\u201d Despite the Commission\u2019s determination, we unequivocally hold that, if an employee incurs a subsequent intervening <em>event\u2014e.g., </em>an injury sustained outside the course of employment\u2014further liability of an employer for permanent partial disability and other workers\u2019 compensation benefits is not precluded as a matter of law. An employer may be liable for permanent partial disability benefits for a worsening of the employee\u2019s condition that is caused by and reasonably attributable solely to the accidental personal injury, and liable for other workers\u2019 compensation benefits such as medical treatment and medical expenses subject to a case-by-case determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The analysis that applies to the determination of permanent disability benefits significantly differs from the one that applies to a determination of temporary disability benefits. As LE \u00a7 9-655(1) and (2) provide, LE \u00a7 9-656 is inapplicable to temporary disability benefits. Instead of being apportioned among multiple injuries under LE \u00a7 9-656, liability for a temporary disability depends entirely on the injury that occurred last. In other words, as the Court of Special Appeals stated in Martin, 73 Md.App. at 700, 536 A.2d at 134, \u201cit is the final accident contributing to [a temporary] disability which is to serve as the basis for liability.\u201d The exclusive focus on the injury that occurred last, however, has no application in a determination of liability for a permanent disability, as to which LE \u00a7 9-656 provides for apportionment of liability among multiple injuries. Simply put, the \u201cfinal accident\u201d rule that the Court of Special Appeals articulated in Martin, 73 Md.App. at 700, 536 A.2d at 134, applies only to the determination of temporary disability benefits, not to the assessment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>of permanent partial disability benefits. We are unpersuaded by Electrical General\u2019s reliance on Martin for the proposition that the final accident that contributes to a worsening of an employee\u2019s medical condition serves as the basis for liability for permanent partial disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">In the Petition to Reopen, LaBonte requested not only a finding of apportionment of permanent partial disability benefits for worsening of his medical condition, but also medical treatment. On brief, Electrical General contends that medical treatment is not apportionable, and that its liability for medical treatment is precluded by the Commission\u2019s finding of a subsequent intervening event. The only case upon which Electrical General relies in support of its argument is J &amp; M Const. Co. v, Braun, 44 Md.App. 602, 609, 410 A.2d 607, 611 (1980), in which the Court of Special Appeals stated that LE \u00a7 9-656\u2019s predecessor \u201cprovide[d] for apportionment of only [permanent disability.\u201d In J <em>&amp; </em>M Const., id. at 603, 605, 410 A.2d at 608, 609, an employee suffered two separate accidental personal injuries while working for two different employers, and the second employer and its insurer contended that the first employer\u2019s insurer should have contributed to the employee\u2019s vocational rehabilitation expenses. The Court of Special Appeals rejected this contention on the ground that it had not been found that the employee had a permanent disability as a result of the second accidental personal injury; instead, the Commission had found that the employee had a temporary disability. See id. at 609, 603-04, 410 A.2d at 611, 608. J <em>&amp; </em>M Const. stands for the principle that, under LE \u00a7 9-656, liability for permanent disability benefits is apportionable, while liability for temporary disability benefits is not. As such, J &amp; M Const. does not support Electrical General\u2019s proposition that medical treatment cannot be awarded where an employee demonstrates that a worsening of his or her medical condition was caused by an accidental personal injury or occupational disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">In the Order dated January 24, 2013, the Commission found a subsequent intervening event and denied authorization for medical treatment and the payment of medical expenses. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>According to the Commission, the prior Order and Award of Compensation \u201cestablish[ed] a subsequent intervening event which breaks the causal nexus between the accidental injury and the current condition.\u201d In light of our holding that the subsequent intervening event does not, <em>per se, </em>preclude an employer\u2019s liability due to the worsening of an employee\u2019s medical condition, the summary denial of medical treatment and medical expenses is not warranted. The question is not whether medical treatment can be apportioned; the question is whether a worsening of an employee\u2019s medical condition was caused by the accidental personal injury, and, thus, necessitated additional medical treatment and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Electrical General is also incorrect in contending that, here, the Commission\u2019s Order dated March 30, 2007 and its Award of Compensation dated October 15, 2007 became the law of the case because there was no petition for judicial review of either decision. Generally, \u201c[t]he law of the case doctrine is one of appellate procedure. Once an appellate court rules upon a question presented on appeal, litigants and lower courts become bound by the ruling, which is considered to be the law of the case.\u201d Dep\u2019t of Pub. Safety &amp; Corr. Servs. v. Doe, 439 Md. 201, 216, 94 A.3d 791, 800 (2014) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The doctrine of the law of the case typically does not apply to a decision of a trial court because, \u201c \u2018as a general principle, one judge of a trial court ruling on a matter is not bound by the prior ruling in the same ease by another judge of the court.\u2019 \u201d Scott v. State, 379 Md. 170, 184, 840 A.2d 715, 723 (2004) (quoting Gertz v. Anne Arundel Cty., 339 Md. 261, 273, 661 A.2d 1157, 1163 (1995)).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>Similarly, in Gertz, 339 Md. at 272, 661 A.2d at 1163, this Court held that a trial judge\u2019s order did not become the law of the case, and thus did not preclude another trial judge from consideration of a legal issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Electrical General provides no authority, and we know of none, in which the doctrine of the law of the case has been applied to an award or order of the Commission. Indeed, at oral argument, when asked by the Court to explain Electrical General\u2019s contention regarding the doctrine of the law of the case, tellingly, without addressing the doctrine of the law of the case, Electrical General\u2019s counsel responded that the doctrine of collateral estoppel applied to the issue of whether the incident with the law enforcement officer was a subsequent intervening event because neither party sought judicial review of the Commission\u2019s March 30, 2007 Order and its October 15, 2007 Award of Compensation. When asked whether a Maryland appellate court had ever applied the doctrine of the law of the case in a workers\u2019 compensation case to enforce orders or awards of the Commission, Electrical General\u2019s counsel identified the case of Criminal Injuries Comp. Bd. v. Gould, 273 Md. 486, 331 A.2d 55 (1975). In Gould, id. at 513, 331 A.2d at 72, this Court observed that the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board conceded that it was estopped from contending that its decision was not subject to judicial review because the Board\u2019s counsel had informed the opposing party\u2019s counsel that the Board\u2019s decision was subject to judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">For obvious reasons, this Court\u2019s holding in Gould does not support Electrical General\u2019s contention regarding the doctrine of law of the case. Gould did not involve an issue as to the doctrine of the law of the case, and this Court did not mention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>the doctrine anywhere in Gould. Nor does the holding in Gould support the proposition that an award or order of the Commission can have preclusive effect under the doctrine of collateral estoppel. Put simply, nowhere in Gould did this Court indicate that the doctrine of collateral estoppel applied to an award or order of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">In any event, the doctrine of the law of the case and the doctrine of collateral estoppel are distinct. The doctrine of the law of the case precludes a party from re-litigating an issue of which an appellate court in the same case has already disposed. See Doe, 439 Md. at 216, 94 A.3d at 800. By contrast, \u201c[t]he doctrine of collateral estoppel precludes a party from re-litigating a factual issue that was essential to a valid and final judgment against the same party in a prior action.\u201d Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, PA. v. The Fund for Animals, Inc., 461 Md. 431, 463-64, 153 A.3d 123, 142 (2017) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The doctrine of collateral estoppel applies where: (1) the issue that was decided in a prior adjudication is identical to the issue that the party seeks to re-litigate; (2) the court issued a final judgment on the merits; (3) the party that seeks to re-litigate the issue was either a party to, or in privity with a party to, the prior adjudication; and (4) the party that seeks to re-litigate the issue was given a fair opportunity to be heard on the issue. See id. at 464, 163 A.3d at 142.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act negates both Electrical General\u2019s contention regarding the doctrine of the law of the case in its brief, and its contention regarding the doctrine of collateral estoppel at oral argument. LE \u00a7 9-736(b)(1) provides that \u201c[t]he Commission has continuing powers and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>jurisdiction\u201d in workers\u2019 compensation cases. LE \u00a7 9\u2014736(b)(2) allows the Commission, within a certain time period, to \u201cmodify any finding or order as the Commission considers justified.\u201d Under LE \u00a7 9-736(b), the Commission is not bound to follow its previous awards and orders; to the contrary, the Commission has the express authority to modify the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">LE \u00a7 9-736(b) unequivocally supports our holding that, where the Commission has determined an employee\u2019s permanent partial disability and apportioned between an accidental personal injury and a subsequent intervening injury, if the employee\u2019s condition worsens, the Commission is not precluded from awarding workers\u2019 compensation benefits due to the accidental personal injury. In its March 30, 2007 Order, the Commission properly denied LaBonte\u2019s request for additional temporary total disability benefits because the injury that occurred <em>last\u2014ie,, </em>the injury that resulted from the incident with the law enforcement officer\u2014precluded liability for temporary disability benefits, as opposed to permanent disability benefits. In its October 15, 2007 Award of Compensation, because LaBonte had sought permanent disability benefits instead of temporary disability benefits, the Commission properly determined the portion of his back condition that was due to his accidental personal injury. Nothing in either of these two orders precluded the Commission from determining at a later date how much, if any, a worsening of LaBonte\u2019s back condition was due to his accidental personal injury. Indeed, LE \u00a7 9-656(a) empowered the Commission to make such a determination, and LE \u00a7 9-736(b)(2) authorized the Commission to modify its previous finding of the proportion of La-Bonte\u2019s back condition that was due to his accidental personal injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Electrical General is mistaken in arguing that Reeves, 204 Md. at 582, 105 A.2d at 239, bars an employer\u2019s further liability for any worsening of an employee\u2019s medical condition after a finding of a subsequent intervening event. In Reeves, id. at 583, 580-81, 105 A.2d at 240, 239, this Court held that an employer was not liable for permanent partial disability benefits where an employee suffered a shoulder dislocation in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>course of employment, and a surgeon operated on the employee\u2019s shoulder, which became partially immobilized as a result; <em>ie., </em>the surgery constituted a subsequent intervening event. Critical to this Court\u2019s conclusion were the circumstances that the employee\u2019s physician testified that the employee\u2019s work-related shoulder dislocation did not cause his shoulder\u2019s partial immobility, and did not testify that the employee\u2019s shoulder dislocation necessitated the surgery. See id. at 582,105 A.2d at 239. In short, there was no evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding that the employee\u2019s work-related shoulder dislocation had caused his shoulder\u2019s partial immobility; to the contrary, the evidence indicated that the subsequent surgery was the sole cause of permanent partial disability. See id. at 582-83, 105 A.2d at 239-40. And, as this Court observed, Reeves was not a case involving the reopening of a prior claim for injury upon the claimant\u2019s condition\u2019s worsening. See id. at 582, 105 A.2d at 239. In sum, Reeves did not involve a petition to reopen based on worsening of a medical condition, and this Court\u2019s holding in Reeves merely establishes the proposition that a causal connection between an accidental personal injury and a disability is required for an initial award of permanent partial disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">In contrast to Reeves, in this case, ample evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding that LaBonte\u2019s accidental personal injury, not the incident with the law enforcement officer, caused the worsening of LaBonte\u2019s back condition. As a result of his accidental personal injury, LaBonte was mostly either not working, or working in a light duty position, for more than two years; by contrast, as a result of the incident with the law enforcement officer, LaBonte missed less than a month from work. Whereas LaBonte underwent back surgery as a result of his accidental personal injury, medication and exercise were prescribed as a result of the incident with a law enforcement officer. Dr, Franchetti, LaBonte\u2019s medical expert, examined him on two occasions; the first examination occurred approximately five months after the incident with the law enforcement officer, and the second examination occurred more than five years after the incident. As a result of the first examina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>tion, Dr. Franchetti determined that LaBonte had 43% \u201cwhole person impairment due to\u201d his accidental personal injury. After the second examination, Dr. Franchetti determined that LaBonte\u2019s whole person impairment had increased to 53%. At deposition, Dr. Franchetti testified that the incident with the law enforcement officer did not result in any permanent worsening of LaBonte\u2019s back condition, and that LaBonte\u2019s back condition was causally related to his accidental personal injury. These circumstances more than support the jury\u2019s finding that LaBonte\u2019s accidental personal injury was the cause of his back condition\u2019s <em>worsening\u2014ie., </em>that the incident with the law enforcement officer was not a cause of LaBonte\u2019s back condition\u2019s worsening.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">In sum, the Commission erred in concluding that its March 30, 2007 Order and its October 15, 2007 Award of Compensation were dispositive as to the issue of whether LaBonte\u2019s accidental personal injury had caused a worsening of his back condition. Where an employee seeks reopening of a workers\u2019 compensation claim based on the worsening of a medical condition, the employer may be liable for permanent partial disability benefits for the portion of any subsequent worsening of the employee\u2019s medical condition that is caused by and reasonably attributable solely to the accidental personal injury or occupational disease. In other words, in the event that the Commission has apportioned liability for an employee\u2019s permanent partial disability between an accidental personal injury or occupational disease, and a subsequent intervening event, and the employee\u2019s condition has worsened, the Commission may determine the extent to which the worsening was caused by and was reasonably attributable solely to the accidental personal injury or occupational disease, and further award permanent partial disability benefits. And, where an employee moves to reopen a workers\u2019 compensation claim, the existence of a subsequent intervening event finding does not, <em>per se, </em>preclude an employer\u2019s liability for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Rather, an employer may be liable for workers\u2019 compensation benefits where the employee demonstrates a worsening of his or her medical condition was caused by an accidental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>personal injury or occupational disease. As such, the circuit court did not err in submitting to the jury the question of how much, if any, of LaBonte\u2019s back condition\u2019s worsening was caused by his accidental personal injury. The jury\u2019s determination that LaBonte\u2019s accidental personal injury was the cause of his back condition\u2019s worsening is amply supported by the evidence adduced at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

During the video deposition, the date on which Dr, Franchetti conducted the second examination of LaBonte is identified as both September 8, 2012 and September 18, 2012; however, the date on which the second examination occurred is of no consequence to the outcome of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b152-9\">.

The circuit court denied the motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b153-8\">. The Court of Special Appeals also concluded that the Commission\u2019s finding of a subsequent intervening event, <em>i.e., </em>the incident with the law enforcement officer, \"did not, under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, preclude the jury from considering whether [LaBonte]\u2019s current back condition is causally connected to his [accidental personal injury]\u201d; that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in submitting to the jury the issue of whether LaBonte\u2019s back condition\u2019s worsening was causally related to his accidental personal injury; and that the circuit court did not err in allowing the jury to decide issues related to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>apportionment and the reasonableness and necessity of LaBonte\u2019s requests for medical treatment and payment of medical expenses. See LaBonte, 229 Md.App. at 204, 206-07, 144 A.3d at 866, 867-68. As discussed below in Footnote 6, Electrical General has not briefed these issues in this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b154-13\">. This Court granted the petition as to all of the questions presented. Nonetheless, in its brief, Electrical General addresses only the first question <em>presented\u2014i.e., </em>the issue regarding whether the incident with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>the law enforcement officer barred liability\u2014and did not brief the questions presented regarding collateral estoppel, the burden of proof, or issues being submitted to the jury that were not previously decided by the Commission. Because Electrical General has not briefed the second, third, and fourth questions presented, we do not address them. Cf. Menefee v. State, 417 Md. 740, 746 n.9, 12 A.3d 153, 156 n.9 (2011) (\"Because the issue relating to the limitations period for submitting a claim to the Treasurer was not briefed by either party, it is not, at present, before this Court.\" (Citation omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b160-6\">.

The Commission labelled the circumstance a subsequent intervening event. For purposes of this opinion, we use the terms subsequent intervening event and subsequent intervening injury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b166-5\">. The general principle that a trial judge's ruling does not bind another trial judge in the same case is fully consistent with the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s holding in Martin, 73 Md.App. at 698, 536 A.2d at 133-34, in which the Court concluded that the doctrine of the law of the case applied to a jury's findings of a causal relationship between an employee\u2019s accidental personal injuries and his disability, In Martin, id. at 697, 536 A.2d at 133, after the jury made its finding, the trial court remanded the case to the Commission so that the employee could prove the amount of benefits to which he was entitled. The Court of Special Appeals explained that, on remand, \u201c[t]he Commission could not ignore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>or amend the jury\u2019s finding. There was no need for the Commission to take evidence on a matter [that] had already been decided for it by the circuit court, a higher tribunal.\u201d Id. at 698, 536 A.2d at 134. In other words, the Commission was bound by the jury\u2019s finding of a causal relationship between the employee\u2019s accidental personal injuries and his disability because the jury\u2019s finding essentially constituted a decision of a higher tribunal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b168-6\">. As explained earlier, Electrical General has not briefed the issue of the applicability of the doctrine of collateral estoppel in this case.
