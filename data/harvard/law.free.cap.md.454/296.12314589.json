Ms. M. knew Fuentes as a Marriott employee through her own former employment as a cook at the hotel. During cross-examination of Ms. M, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-15\">BY [DEFENSE COUNSEL]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-16\">Q. [Ms. R.] told you Miguel was the one that impregnated her, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-18\">A.

The jury acquitted Fuentes of fourth-degree sexual offense and second-degree assault. The trial court sentenced Fuentes to twenty years of incarceration in the Division of Correction, with all but twelve suspended, for second-degree rape and ten years, all but one suspended, for third-degree sexual offense, to run concurrently. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed in an unreported opinion dated August 18, 2016, Thereafter, we granted Fuentes\u2019 Petition for Writ of Certiorari. <em>Fuentes v. State, </em>450 Md. 419, 149 A.3d 546 (2016). Fuentes presents the following questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">1. Was the evidence legally insufficient to support Petitioner\u2019s convictions where the convictions were contingent on [the victimj\u2019s status as a \u201cmentally defective\u201d individual and the State failed to present evidence that she had been diagnosed with either mental retardation or a mental disorder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-7\">2. Where Petitioner\u2019s knowledge of [the victimj\u2019s purported mental deficiency was a required element of both convictions, was it reversible error for the State to inform the jury at closing argument that Petitioner had admitted to taking advantage of her \u201cmental diminished capacity\u201d in an interview that was never admitted into evidence at trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-8\">3. Where [the victimj\u2019s ability to understand the conduct of others and to communicate with others was central to the jury\u2019s determination of whether she could be considered a \u201cmentally defective\u201d individual, did the trial court err in refusing to allow the defense to present employment performance evaluations that assessed both of these skills during her employment which is when the sexual activity took place?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the judgments of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">The charges here stemmed from a sexual incident between Fuentes and Ms. R.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a thirty-eight-year-old woman at the time of trial. The incident occurred in Prince George\u2019s County in 2012 at a Marriott hotel where both were employed. The State alleged that Ms. R. was deaf and mentally defective as defined under Md. Code Ann., Criminal Law (2002, 2012 Repl. Vol.) (\u201cCrim. Law\u201d) \u00a7 3-301 and unable to consent to the sexual activity. Fuentes countered that Ms. R. initiated the sexual contact and fully understood what would transpire.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Ms. R.\u2019s testimony was elicited through an American Sign Language interpreter, a certified deaf interpreter, and a Spanish interpreter who interpreted for the deaf interpreter. When asked whether she was previously employed at the Marriott, Ms. R, testified, \u201cI work before and then there was a closet and I said no. The folding table. I\u2019m afraid. Someone grabbed me and I said no.\u201d When asked who grabbed her, she testified, \u201c[h]is name is Miguel.\u201d Ms. R. testified that she was folding clothes on a table, putting them on shelves, when Fuentes came up to her and put his hands over her mouth. Ms. R. then fell down. When asked if he touched her anywhere else, she responded in the negative. She testified that he came up to her and she said \u201c[n]o[,]\u201d and that he \u201cstarted,\u201d and she told him to stop. She demonstrated with two dolls indicating that Fuentes came up from the back, grabbed her, opened her zipper, pulled down her pants, and then \u201ctouched [her] behind and [she] pushed him away.\u201d Afterwards, in pain, Ms. R. went to the bathroom and was surprised to see something red<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> coming from \u201cthe lower of [her] body[.]\u201d A calendar from 2012 was admitted into evidence, and Ms. R. indicated that the events transpired in February 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">During trial, Ms. R. shrugged when the prosecutor asked if she saw Miguel in the courtroom, but she identified \u201cMiguel\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>from a photograph the State introduced into evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Ms. M., Ms. R.\u2019s mother, worked at the Marriott as a cook. Ms. M. characterized Ms. R. as disabled, and stated that Ms. R. went to a high school where \u201cthere is a class for students with disabilities!;,]\u201d and indicated that it was \u201c[t]he special school for disability!;,]\u201d from which Ms. R. graduated in 1998. Ms. M. testified that Ms. R. is not able to cook for herself or go to work by herself, and Ms. M. had difficulties talking with her. Ms. M. further testified that Ms. R. maintained her job in the housekeeping department at the Marriott for fourteen and a half years. In February and March of 2012,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Ms. M. noticed that her daughter\u2019s demeanor had changed. Ms. M. noticed her daughter crying on several occasions. Ms. M. initially attributed the change to the death of her husband, Ms. R.\u2019s stepfather, which occurred in February 2012. By May 2012, she noticed that Ms. R. was gaining weight. A June 2012 blood test revealed that Ms. R. was pregnant. When Ms. M. asked who had impregnated her, Ms. R. \u201cwrote [Miguel\u2019s] name.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Ms. M. reported the situation to the Marriott administration and the Office of the State\u2019s Attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Ms. R. gave birth to a daughter in November, 2012. Vanessa Covert, a DNA analyst, testified that the results of a paternity test indicated that there was a 99.9999996% probability that Fuentes was the child\u2019s father.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Bonnie Bland, an employee at Humana, an organization that helps the disabled, knew Ms. R. through case management and job coaching. Ms. Bland met with Ms. R. monthly and tried to help her develop skills in order to look for jobs and to maintain her job. Ms. Bland testified that Ms. R. \u201chas so many disabilities,\u201d \u201chas limited language[,]\u201d and was \u201cnot able to express herself.\u201d Although Ms. R. uses \u201cbroken English signs[ ]\u201d to communicate with Ms. Bland, Ms. Bland, who is also deaf, stated that she is able to understand Ms. R.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">S.R., Ms. R.\u2019s sister, testified that she communicated with her through signs the siblings developed as children.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> S.R. usually understood her sister, but they would have difficulty communicating with one another. S.R. stated that Ms. R. cannot be left alone in the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">Detective Nicholas Collins of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department was the lead investigator in the case. He interviewed Ms. R. on June 14, 2012, with the assistance of a sign language interpreter. He testified that she had difficulty understanding and responding to his questions. He further testified that \u201cit took [Ms. R.] about five minutes to explain that\u201d the man alleged to have raped her bent her over a chair and locked the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">In his defense, Fuentes presented the testimony of three coworkers from the hotel. When asked to describe Ms. R., Eleticia Hernandez, a former co-worker at Marriott, stated that Ms. R. is \u201c[a] girl that is intelligent. She knows her job.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Ms. Hernandez further testified that Fuentes was a serious, respectful man, and a good worker. Roxana Martinez, another employee of the Marriott, worked with Fuentes for fourteen years and also worked with Ms. R. She thought that Fuentes and Ms. R. were friends. She observed Fuentes and Ms. R. at work and noted that they often ate lunch together. Ms. Martinez did not know sign language but was able to communicate with Ms. R. through gestures. She stated that Fuentes was an honest and decent worker. Liliana Fuentes, Fuentes\u2019 daughter, and also an employee at the Marriott, testified that she was friends with Ms. R., and that she could communicate with her despite not knowing sign language. Ms. Fuentes noticed that Ms. R. \u201cfollowed] [Fuentes] all the time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AAp\">Fuentes, a fifty-nine-year-old father of six, worked at the Marriott for nineteen years. He had known Ms. R. for fourteen years prior to the incident. Once she started working in housekeeping, they would see each other \u201call the time, because [they] had to use the same elevator.\u201d Fuentes admitted to having sexual contact with Ms. R., but claimed it was consensual and initiated by Ms. R. He further testified that she had touched him inappropriately before and that he had informed her mother of the behavior. He testified that on the date in question, he encountered Ms. R. on the third floor and then accompanied her to a closet on the fourth floor. He further testified that she opened the closet and made a motion to him to go inside, and he complied. According to Fuentes, they then engaged in consensual sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar6\">Fuentes moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief, and renewed his motion at the close of all evidence. Both motions were denied by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"AXq\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"APR\">Fuentes first argues that the evidence was legally insufficient because his convictions were contingent on Ms. R.\u2019s status as a mentally defective individual and the State failed to establish that she had been diagnosed with either mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>retardation or a mental disorder. Fuentes argues that on this record, no rational juror could find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Ms. R. was either mentally retarded or suffered from a mental disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The State counters that the plain language and legislative history of Crim. Law \u00a7 3-301 and Maryland case law, do not support Fuentes\u2019 statutory construction. Furthermore, the State argues that Fuentes incorrectly points to definitions in other titles of the Maryland Code, because there is statutory language that limits the scope of those definitions to their particular title, without statutory language incorporating those definitions in the Criminal Law Article. The State contends that courts in other jurisdictions have held that expert evidence is not required to establish that a victim lacked the mental capacity to consent to sexual acts. Lastly, the State avers that lay testimony, and the jury\u2019s observation of the victim during her testimony, was sufficient to demonstrate that she had a mental disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">In determining whether the evidence is legally sufficient, we examine the record solely to determine whether <em>\u201cany </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>McKenzie v. State, </em>407 Md. 120, 136, 962 A.2d 998, 1007 (2008) (citing <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 315-16, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2786-87, 61 L.Ed.2d 560, 571 (1979)). In examining the record, we view the State\u2019s evidence, including all reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, in the light most favorable to the State. <em>State v. Rendelman, </em>404 Md. 500, 513-14, 947 A.2d 546, 553 (2008) (citing <em>Harrison v. State, </em>382 Md. 477, 487-88, 855 A.2d 1220, 1226 (2004)); <em>State v. Suddith, </em>379 Md. 425, 429-31, 842 A.2d 716, 718-19 (2004) (citing <em>State v. Smith, </em>374 Md. 527, 533-34, 823 A.2d 664, 668 (2003)). In so doing, \u201c[i]t is not our role to retry the case.\u201d <em>Smith v. State, </em>415 Md. 174, 185, 999 A.2d 986, 992 (2010). Rather, \u201c[b]ecause the fact-finder possesses the unique opportunity to view the evidence and to observe first-hand the demeanor and to assess the credibility of witnesses during their live testimony, we do not re-weigh <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>the credibility of witnesses or attempt to resolve any conflicts in the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Tarray v. State, </em>410 Md. 594, 608, 979 A.2d 729, 737 (2009)). We defer to any possible reasonable inferences the jury could have drawn from the admitted evidence and need not decide whether the jury could have drawn other inferences from fhe evidence, refused to draw inferences, or whether we would have drawn different inferences from the evidence. <em>Smith, </em>374 Md. at 557, 823 A.2d at 682; <em>see also State v. Albrecht, </em>336 Md. 475, 478, 649 A.2d 336, 337 (1994) (\u201c[I]t is not the function or duty of the appellate court to undertake a review of the record that would amount to, in essence, a retrial of the case.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Second-degree rape is defined by Crim. Law \u00a7 3-304(a), which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">Prohibited</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-7\">(a) A person may not engage in vaginal intercourse with another:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-8\">(1) by force, or the threat of force, without the consent of the other;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-9\">(2) if the victim is a mentally defective[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] individual, a mentally incapacitated individual, or a physically helpless individual, and the person performing the act knows or reasonably should know that the victim is a mentally defective individual, a mentally incapacitated individual, or a physically helpless individual!).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-10\">\u215c * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-11\">Penalty</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-12\">(c)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, a person who violates subsection (a) of this section is guilty of the felony of rape in the second degree and on conviction is subject to imprisonment for not exceeding 20 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-13\">Third-degree sexual offense is proscribed by Crim. Law \u00a7 3-307:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Prohibited</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-4\">(a) A person may not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\">(1)(i) engage in sexual contact with another without the consent of the other; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">(ii) 1. employ or display a dangerous weapon, or a physical object that the victim reasonably believes is a dangerous weapon;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">2. suffocate, strangle, disfigure, or inflict serious physical injury on the victim or another in the course of committing the crime;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">3. threaten, or place the victim in fear, that the victim, or an individual known to the victim, imminently will be subject to death, suffocation, strangulation, disfigurement, serious physical injury, or kidnapping; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-9\">4. commit the crime while aided and abetted by another;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-10\">(2) engage in sexual contact with another if the victim is a mentally defective individual, a mentally incapacitated individual, or a physically helpless individual, and the person performing the act knows or reasonably should know the victim is a mentally defective individual, a mentally incapacitated individual, or a physically helpless individual!:.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-11\">* \u215c *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-12\">Penalty</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-13\">(b) A person who violates this section is guilty of the felony of sexual offense in the third degree and on conviction is subject to imprisonment not exceeding 10 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-14\">When second-degree rape or third-degree sexual offense involving a legally incompetent victim is charged pursuant to Crim. Law \u00a7\u00a7 3\u2014304(a)(2) or 3-307(a)(2), \u201clack of consent does not have to be established independently by showing either resistance or fear of resistance but is automatically established, as a matter of law, by the status of the victim.\u201d <em>See Travis v. State, </em>218 Md. App. 410, 428-29, 98 A.3d 281, 291-92 (2014). The three classes of individuals in Crim. Law \u00a7\u00a7 3\u2014 304(a)(2) and 3-307(a)(2)\u2014mentally defective individuals, mentally incapacitated individuals, and physically helpless individuals\u2014\u201care incapable of consenting!!,]\u201d and thus, \u201c[t]he State is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>relieved from having to prove directly what it has already proved indirectly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 429, 98 A,3d at 292. Lack of consent \u201cdoes not have to be proved directly not because it is not required but only because it is implicit in the victim\u2019s condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 431, 98 A.3d at 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Lastly, Crim. Law \u00a7 3-301 defines \u201cmentally defective indi-vid\u00faale:]\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">In general</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\">(a) In this subtitle the following words have the meanings indicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-8\">Mentally defective individual</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-9\">(b) \u201cMentally defective individual\u201d means an individual who suffers from mental retardation or a mental disorder, either of which temporarily or permanently renders the individual substantially incapable of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-10\">(1) appraising the nature of the individual\u2019s conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-11\">(2) resisting vaginal intercourse, a sexual act, or sexual contact; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-12\">(3) communicating unwillingness to submit to vaginal intercourse, a sexual act, or sexual contact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-13\">To sustain a conviction of second-degree rape under Crim, Law \u00a7 3-304(a)(2), the State was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that: (1) Fuentes had vaginal intercourse with Ms. R.; (2) Ms. R. was mentally defective, mentally incapacitated, or physically helpless; and (3) Fuentes knew or reasonably should have known that Ms. R. was mentally defective, mentally incapacitated, or physically helpless. To sustain a conviction of the crime of third-degree sexual offense under Crim. Law \u00a7 3-307(a)(2), the State was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that: (1) Fuentes engaged in sexual contact with Ms. R.; (2) Ms. R. was mentally defective, mentally incapacitated, or physically helpless; and (3) Fuentes knew or reasonably should have known that Ms. R. was mentally defective, mentally incapacitated, or physically helpless.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-14\">There is no dispute that Fuentes engaged in sexual contact with Ms. R. and had vaginal intercourse with her. Here, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>must determine whether the evidence was sufficient to prove that Ms. R. was a mentally defective individual, and, if so, whether Fuentes knew or reasonably should have known that she was a mentally defective individual.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Fuentes argues that \u201c[b]oth \u2018mental retardation\u2019 and \u2018mental disorder\u2019 are medical diagnoses made by medical professionals based on specific and established scientific evidence after thorough and rigorous examination of the patient.\u201d Accordingly, he argues that without medical evidence that Ms. R. was diagnosed with mental retardation or a mental disorder, the jury could not find that Ms. R. was mentally defective. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Fuentes recognizes that the term \u201cmental disorder\u201d is not defined in Crim. Law \u00a7 3-301, but asks this Court to adopt the definition contained in the Health\u2014General Article and/or the Criminal Procedure Article of the Maryland Code. The General Assembly, however, could have, but did not adopt the definition of the term as defined in the Health\u2014General or Criminal Procedure Articles.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">The General Assembly knows how to explicitly incorporate definitions from other titles, yet did not do so here. <em>See Holmes v. State, </em>362 Md. 190, 195 n. 2, 763 A.2d 737, 739 n. 2 (2000) (stating that \u201cwhen the Legislature chooses to permit home detention as a condition of probation, it knows how to do so.\u201d). The Criminal Law Article contains examples of explicit incorporation of definitions from other articles, including Health\u2014General.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> There are six statutes, in three different articles, that explicitly incorporate the definition of \u201cmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>disorder\u201d contained in \u00a7 10-101 of the Health\u2014General Article. For example, the Correctional Services Article has a provision regarding expenses for treatment in a state facility that provides: \u201cA county or managing official is not responsible for payment for services or treatment rendered to an inmate as a result of admission to a State facility for individuals who have <em>mental disorders as defined by in \u00a7 10-101(i) of the Health\u2014General Article.\u201d </em>Md. Code Ann., Correctional Services \u00a7 11-204 (emphasis added). The Family Law Article explicitly incorporates that same definition: \u201c \u2018Disability\u2019 means: ... <em>mental disorder, as defined in \u00a7 10-101 of the Health\u2014General Article </em>..,. \u201d Md. Code Ann., Family Law \u00a7 5\u2014101(f)(3) (emphasis added). The Public Safety Article explicitly incorporates that definition in four different statutes.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">One statute explicitly incorporates both definitions cited by Fuentes: \u201c \u2018Mental facility\u2019 means any place providing a clinic, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>hospital, day residential or other progranas, public or private, other than a veterans\u2019 hospital, which purports to or does provide treatment for persons suffering <em>from mental disorders as defined in \u00a7 10-101(i) of the Health\u2014General Article or \u00a7 3-101(g) of the Criminal Procedure Article </em>....\u201d Md. Code. Ann., Estates &amp; Trusts \u00a7 13-101(m) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">In addition, another subtitle of the Health\u2014General Article has a definition of \u201cmental disorder,\u201d that is unlike those cited by Fuentes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">(e)(1) \u201cMental disorder\u201d means the behavioral or other symptoms that indicate:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-7\">(1) To a lay petitioner who is submitting an emergency petition, a clear disturbance in the mental functioning of another individual; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-8\">(ii) To the following health professionals doing an examination, at least one mental disorder that is described in the version of the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s \u201cDiagnostic and Statistical Manual\u2014Mental Disorders\u201d that is current at the time of the examination:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-9\">***</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-10\">(2) \u201cMental disorder\u201d does not include intellectual disability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">Md. Code Ann., Health\u2014General \u00a7 10-620. In enacting Crim. Law \u00a7 3-301, the General Assembly did not adopt the definition of the term \u201cmental disorder\u201d as set forth in the Health\u2014 General or Criminal Procedure Articles. Therefore, we reject Fuentes\u2019 suggestion that we import the definition from one or both of those articles.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">Cases from other jurisdictions have also come to the conclusion that expert evidence is not required to establish that a victim lacked the mental capacity to consent to sexual acts. <em>See State v. Hunt, </em>365 N.C. 432, 722 S.E.2d 484, 492 (2012) (concluding that the State was not required in that case to use expert testimony to establish the extent of the victim\u2019s mental capacity to consent to sexual acts); <em>see also State v. Collins, </em>7 Neb.App. 187, 202, 583 N.W.2d 341, 350-51 (1998); <em>Jackson v. State, </em>890 P.2d 587, 589-90 (Alaska Ct.

Law \u00a7 3-301(b). The statutes at hand, Crim. Law \u00a7\u00a7 3\u2014301(b), 3-304(a)(2), and 3-307(a)(2), protect a class of vulnerable individuals, and the requirement of medical evidence would not conform with the statutes\u2019 protection. Thus, in cases such as this, a court must determine whether the evidence was sufficient on the question of whether the victim was capable of consent. Here, although no medical evidence or expert testimony was presented to establish that Ms. R. suffered from a mental defect, the jury was able to observe Ms. R. and assess her mental capacity. Further, the jury heard the following testimony to support its finding that Ms. R. was mentally defective as defined by Crim. Law \u00a7 8-301(b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-5\">1) Ms. R.\u2019s mother testified that Ms. R. is not able to go to work, cook, or go to the store by herself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\">2) Ms. R.\u2019s mother said Ms. R. went to a high school where \u201cthere is a class for students with disabilities\u201d and indicated that it was \u201c[t]he special school for disability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-7\">3) Bonnie Bland, a \u201ccase manager/job coach[ ]\u201d who worked with Ms. R. at Humana, an organization that \u201chelps people with disabilities!;,]\u201d providing \u201ccase management and job coachingf,]\u201d testified for the State regarding Ms. R.\u2019s capabilities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-8\">4) Ms. Bland testified that \u201c[bjecause [Ms. R.] has so many disabilities, she has limited language. She\u2019s not able to express herself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-9\">5) Ms. R.\u2019s sister testified that \u201cshe\u2019s never been by herself. There\u2019s always been somebody at home when she\u2019s there.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-10\">6) Ms. R.\u2019s sister said that sometimes Ms. R. \u201crepeats what I have just communicated.... If she\u2019s just shadowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>what I m saying to her, then there s no way to communicate because we can\u2019t advance from that point.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMW\">7) Ms. R.\u2019s sister testified that the victim \u201ccouldn\u2019t take care of herself for a whole day[ ]\u201d and \u201cwould never be able to take care of herself. We never tried to do that to try to find out.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQH\">In addition, the jury was able to observe Ms. R.\u2019s demeanor when she testified and draw inferences relative to her limited ability to communicate. We agree with the Court of Special Appeals that the jury was able to reasonably infer that Ms. R. suffered from a mental defect which rendered her incapable of consenting to sexual intercourse and sexual contact under Crim. Law \u00a7\u00a7 3-304(a)(2) and 3-307(a)(2).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Further, the jury reasonably could have inferred that Fuentes knew or reasonably should have known of her mental deficits, given their fourteen-year work relationship and the testimony presented at trial regarding their relationship. Thus, the evidence was sufficient to prove the crimes of second-degree rape and third-degree sexual offense.</p>\n<p id=\"Am1\">Fuentes next argues that the trial court erred in allowing the State to inform the jury during rebuttal closing argument that Fuentes had admitted to taking advantage of Ms. R.\u2019s \u201cmental diminished capacity\u201d in an interview that was never admitted at trial. The prosecutor\u2019s argument referred to Fuentes\u2019 interview with Marriott security personnel on June 7, 2012. The prosecutor cross-examined Fuentes regarding that interview:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqC\">Q. Okay. And you realized working with her that she has diminished capacity, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>A.

No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-13\">Q. You did not say that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-14\">A.

The written statement, itself, marked for identification as defense exhibit number six, was not entered into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-16\">During rebuttal closing argument, the prosecutor referred to this interview conducted by Marriott security staff on June 7, 2012 after Ms. M. reported the alleged rape of her daughter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-17\">[PROSECUTOR]: ... He [DEFENSE COUNSEL] will also have you believe that the defendant doesn\u2019t speak enough English, and so when he was interviewed on June 7th by the Marriott security, he didn\u2019t understand and they made him sign it, and so when he said that he took advantage of her mental diminished mental capacity\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQk\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection, Your Honor.

And if your memory from the evidence differs from anything that I or the lawyers may say, you must rely on your own memory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-14\">Fuentes contends that the prosecutor\u2019s comments during rebuttal closing argument were improper because they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>referred to facts not in evidence and that he suffered unfair prejudice as a result. \u201cThe regulation of argument rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Grandison v. State, </em>341 Md. 175, 224, 670 A.2d 398, 421 (1995). Generally, \u201c[t]he prosecutor is allowed liberal freedom of speech and may make any comment that is warranted by the evidence or inferences reasonably drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Whaley v. State, </em>186 Md.App. 429, 452, 974 A.2d 951, 964 (2009) (quoting <em>Spain v. State, </em>386 Md. 145, 152, 872 A.2d 25, 29 (2005)). Nonetheless, \u201cnot all statements are permissible during closing arguments.\u201d <em>Donaldson v. State, </em>416 Md. 467, 489, 7 A.3d 84, 97 (2010). \u201cFor instance, counsel may not \u2018comment on facts not in evidence or ... state what he or she would have proven.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mitchell v. State, </em>408 Md. 368, 381, 969 A.2d 989, 997 (2009) (quoting <em>Smith and Mack v. State, </em>388 Md. 468, 488, 880 A.2d 288, 299 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Arguing facts not in evidence is highly improper. <em>See, e.g., Lawson v. State, </em>389 Md. 570, 591, 886 A.2d 876, 888 (2005) (prosecutor may make arguments warranted by evidence or reasonable inferences therefrom); <em>Spain v. State, </em>386 Md. 145, 156, 872 A.2d 25, 31 (2005) (\u201cCourts consistently have deemed improper comments made during closing argument that invite the jury to draw inferences from information that was not admitted at trial\u201d). In rebuttal, the prosecutor stated that, during Fuentes\u2019 June 7, 2012 interview, he acknowledged to Marriott security staff that he took advantage of Ms. R.\u2019s diminished mental capacity. This alleged statement was never admitted into evidence, and Fuentes\u2019 responses to the relevant questions concerning its contents were in the negative. Therefore, the prosecutor\u2019s argument to the court, upon defense counsel\u2019s objection to her rebuttal closing, that \u201cI\u2019m only saying as to what the actual statement said[,]\u201d was misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The State argues that the jury could have disbelieved Fuentes\u2019 testimony that he did not acknowledge and state to Marriott security staff that he took advantage of Ms. R., given her mental state and diminished capacity. That is, the State contends that the jury could have disbelieved Fuentes\u2019 denial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>that he made this statement. The State then claims that, from this disbelief of Fuentes\u2019 denial, the jury could have found that Fuentes actually did acknowledge and state to Marriott security staff that he took advantage of Ms. R.\u2019s mental state and diminished capacity. In support, the State contends that while it is well established that disbelief of testimony is not the same as finding evidence to the contrary, there is an exception for scienter\u2014the \u201cknowledge that makes a person legally responsible for the consequences of his or her act or omission[.]\u201d SCIENTER, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014); <em>see Hayette v. </em>State, 199 Md. 140, 145, 85 A.2d 790, 792 (1952) (recognizing the scienter exception and stating that \u201c[o]rdi-narily disbelieving evidence is not the same thing as finding evidence to the contrary. But on questions of scienter reason for disbelieving evidence denying scienter may also justify finding scienter.\u201d); <em>Marini v. State, </em>30 Md.App. 19, 30-31, 351 A.2d 463, 470 (1976) (\u201cGenerally, disbelieving evidence provides no basis for finding evidence to the contrary; however, there is an exception involving scienter or guilty knowledge, i.e., reasons for disbelieving a denial of scienter may provide a basis for finding scienter.\u201d (quoting <em>Carter v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 50, 53, 267 A.2d 743, 745 (1970))).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The scienter exception is inapplicable because the relevant statement was never admitted into evidence. From an eviden-tiary standpoint, there is a key distinction between (1) a defendant\u2019s denial of scienter and (2) a defendant\u2019s denial of making a statement which allegedly admitted scienter. In the latter, the statement contains the evidence of scienter. Here, the statement was never admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">While denial of scienter may permit a finding of scienter, Fuentes\u2019 denial that he made a statement to Marriott personnel does not, alone, permit an evidentiary finding that he, in fact, made this statement. <em>See Carter, </em>10 Md.App. at 54, 267 A.2d at 745 (\u201cThe rule concerning finding scienter in no way affects other aspects of criminal law.\u201d). Fuentes\u2019 proffered admission of scienter in a statement to Marriott staff was not admitted as evidence. Thus, the prosecutor\u2019s argument was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Not every improper comment by the prosecutor requires reversal, as error in closing argument is subject to harmless error review. <em>Lee v. State, </em>405 Md. 148, 174, 950 A.2d 125, 140 (2008). \u201c[T]he State bears the burden of proving that an error is harmless and must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the contested error did not contribute to the verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, \u201can error will be deemed harmless only if \u2018a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict....\u2019 \u201d <em>Simpson v. State, </em>442 Md. 446, 457, 112 A.3d 941, 947 (2015) (quoting <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665, 678 (1976)). Here, to determine \u201cwhether overruling defense objections to improper statements during closing argument constitutes reversible, or harmless, error,\u201d we focus our attention on three factors: first, \u201cthe weight of the evidence against the accused[;]\u201d second, \u201cthe severity of the remarks, cumulatively[;]\u201d and third, \u201cthe measures taken to cure any potential prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 174, 950 A.2d at 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">There is no dispute that Fuentes engaged in sexual contact and vaginal intercourse with Ms. R. Fuentes\u2019 unintro-duced statement, which the prosecutor improperly referenced in closing argument, primarily supported a determination that Fuentes had <em>knowledge of </em>Ms. R.\u2019s status as a mentally defective individual. <em>See </em>Crim. Law \u00a7 3-304(a)(2) (requiring that the State prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant \u201cknows <em>or reasonably should know </em>that the victim is a mentally defective individual\u201d (emphasis added)); Crim. Law \u00a7 3-307(a)(2) (same); <em>see also Travis v. State, </em>218 Md. App. 410, 428-29, 98 A.3d 281, 291-92 (2014) (holding that there is a \u201csignificant evidentiary difference when the prosecutor sets out to prove a case of rape\u201d involving legally incompetent victims, as \u201clack of consent ... is automatically established as a matter of law, by the status of the victim.\u201d). To the extent that Ms. R. had a mental defect, the State\u2019s case was strong pertaining to a determination that Fuentes, at a minimum, reasonably should have known of it. As the State asserts, this is not a matter in which a defendant first meets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>the victim briefly before the alleged sexual offense. It was undisputed that Fuentes worked with the victim for over a decade. Fuentes testified that he had extensive contact with her. In closing argument, defense counsel argued that Fuentes and Ms. R. \u201csat together at a minimum of 15 years and broke bread together.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Significantly, Fuentes\u2019 testimony contains an ambiguity that could reasonably be construed as an admission of his knowledge of Ms. R.\u2019s mental defect. On cross-examination, this exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">Q. Okay. And you realized working with her that she has diminished capacity, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">A. Because she wouldn\u2019t talk and she could not hear.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHF\">Although Fuentes\u2019 answer may be susceptible to more than one interpretation, his failure to deny knowledge of Ms. R.\u2019s diminished mental capacity, together with the duration of their working relationship, strongly supports a finding that he knew or reasonably should have known of her diminished capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Lastly, we look at the measures taken to cure any potential prejudice. Shortly after Fuentes\u2019 objection, at the close of the State\u2019s rebuttal closing argument, the trial court\u2019s instruction reminded the jurors to rely on their \u201cown memory\u201d of the testimony. <em>See Lawson, </em>389 Md, at 601, 886 A.2d at 894; <em>Spain, </em>386 Md. at 159-60, 872 A.2d at 33-34. <em>Spain </em>is instructive. In <em>Spain, </em>386 Md. at 151, 872 A.2d at 29, the trial judge, in response to an objection by defense counsel, which was overruled, informed the jury \u201cthat this of course is closing argument, and that they will [consider the statements to be] lawyers\u2019 arguments.\u201d We also concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-9\">More importantly, however, before jury deliberations began, the trial judge gave, among others, a jury instruction, based on Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instructions \u00a7 3:10, that emphasized the argumentative nature of closing arguments, and explicitly instructed the jurors as to relevant factors to consider .... Maryland courts long have subscribed to the presumption that juries are able to follow the instructions given to them by the trial judge, particularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>where the record reveals no overt act on the jury\u2019s part to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 160, 872 A.2d at 34 (citing <em>Wilson v. State, </em>261 Md. 551, 570, 276 A.2d 214, 223-24 (1971); <em>Brooks v. State, </em>85 Md.App. 355, 360-61, 584 A.2d 82, 85 (1991)). Similarly, here, we determine that the trial judge\u2019s instruction ameliorated any prejudice that may have been caused by the prosecutor\u2019s improper argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Under these particular circumstances, given: (1) the undisputed evidence that Fuentes and Ms. R. engaged in sexual contact and vaginal intercourse, (2) the evidence regarding the extent that Ms. R exhibited a mental defect, (3) the duration of the relationship between Fuentes and Ms. R., which supports the determination that Fuentes, at a minimum, reasonably should have been aware of her mental defect, (4) Fuentes\u2019 failure to deny knowledge of her diminished mental capacity on cross-examination, and (5) the trial court\u2019s instruction, the prosecutor\u2019s improper argument does not warrant reversal. Accordingly, we are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the error in no way influenced the verdict. <em>Dorsey, </em>276 Md. at 659, 350 A.2d at 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">Lastly, Fuentes argues that the trial court erred when it declined to admit into evidence, on relevance grounds, over 300 pages of Ms. R.\u2019s employment records from the Marriott.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> These records included performance evaluations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>dating back to 1998. Fuentes contends that these records supported a finding regarding her ability to maintain her employment and perform her job duties independently. He claims that these records contradicted the State\u2019s claim that she suffered from a mental defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">At the conclusion of evidence, defense counsel sought to admit employee records from Marriott, including performance evaluations of Ms. R. The trial court excluded the evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AoG\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Thank you, Your Honor. And I do have one more. This is the records from Marriott, the work records. There were performance evaluations of the victim and certificates. I put the State on notice as well. I am inclined to have this marked as Defendant\u2019s Exhibit Number 7 and move that into evidence at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AaP\">[PROSECUTOR]: I will object, Your Honor. The State hasn\u2019t gotten a copy, hasn\u2019t been able to review any of this to see what exactly is in it and that there might be some things that might not be relevant or appropriate to be in there. And it\u2019s quite lengthy and I\u2019m just being shown this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXh\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: If I may, Your Honor, I provided appropriate notice within appropriate timeframe of the rules. As a matter of fact, these documents were available. They were made available to counsel. On one occasion, I actually drove to State\u2019s attorney\u2019s office here in Upper Marlboro from Rockville to view any other documents that may have been in this case, which they had a right to see. They were filed within statutory timeframe. There was no objection filed, and within the rules, I would submit to Your Honor that they are relevant. I do have the certification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZG\">THE COURT: Yes, but what are they relevant to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADJ\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: They\u2019re relevant to show part of what\u2019s been made an issue is that she\u2019s doing one sort of menial task and it\u2019s all repetitive and the violations that are included and the 15\u201414 years that she did work at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>Marriott, she had her ability to communicate, her ability to perform the job, her ability to communicate the issues to perform the job, so she was much more self-sufficient than the State would argue to the jurors given the instruction that she\u2019s mentally defective to the point that she\u2019s not able to understand and perform other than robotic type of behavior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: And I would object to that, Your Honor, because these people did not testify in any way. I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re basing this on. And I would just object.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABa\">THE COURT: I\u2019m not going to allow it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Thank you, Your Honor.

Thus, we conduct a <em>de novo </em>review of the trial court\u2019s ruling,</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Ms. R.\u2019s employment records were irrelevant to a determination of whether she suffered from a mental defect that rendered her legally incapable of consenting. We agree with the State that the question of whether Ms. R. was able to perform various housekeeping duties was several inferential leaps removed from whether she was capable of \u201cappraising the nature of the individual\u2019s conduct\u201d of a sexual nature, or of \u201cresisting vaginal intercourse, a sexual act, or sexual contact,\u201d or of \u201ccommunicating unwillingness to submit to vaginal intercourse, a sexual act, or sexual contact,\u201d The records would not have made it more or less probable that Ms. R. met the legal definition of a mentally defective individual. The trial court\u2019s exclusion of the employment records was legally correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">For the reasons explained above, we shall affirm the Court of Special Appeals. We hold that evidence of a medical diagnosis is not required to establish that a victim is mentally defective so as to render him or her unable consent to sexual acts. We determine the error in the prosecutor\u2019s improper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>closing argument was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

Here, the Court of Special Appeals conflated the appropriate standards of review, and incorrectly reviewed the determination of whether the employment records were relevant under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>Compare DeLeon v.

For example, one of Ms. R.\u2019s annual performance reviews states, \u201cWe have developed ways of communication in spite of her inability to speak.\u201d Another evaluation says that she \u201cmanages to get her point [across] to fellow associates and management\u201d and \u201chaving worked with her for several years now[] makes it easier.\u201d This evidence supports the testimony of Ms. R.\u2019s coworkers, who stated that she was able to communicate with them. The records also speak to the extent of Ms. R.\u2019s intellectual disability because they provide insight into whether she could \u201ccommunicat[e] unwillingness to submit\u201d to sexual intercourse\u2014a critical issue in this case. Md. Code (1957, 2012 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 3-301(b)(3) of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cCR\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Ms. R.\u2019s employment records contain other evidence that potentially undercuts the State\u2019s argument regarding the severity of Ms. R.\u2019s intellectual disabilities. The records include quizzes about on-the-job safety in which Ms. R. answered questions about bloodborne pathogens and minimizing the risk of fire. They also contain emergency contact and change of address forms completed by Ms. R. They show that, at least to some extent, she is able to read and write. These records certainly have the tendency to make it less probable that Ms. R. was a \u201cmentally defective individual\u201d within the meaning of CR \u00a7 3-301(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The records are especially important\u2014and their exclusion prejudicial\u2014because the State presented rather limited evidence regarding Ms. R.\u2019s intellectual abilities. It relied solely on lay testimony from Ms. R. and her family to show that Ms. R. was \u201cmentally defective.\u201d Ms. R.\u2019s mother testified that her daughter went to a high school for \u201cstudents with disabilities,\u201d that she took her daughter to and from work, and that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>reminded her to perform certain daily tasks. Ms. R.\u2019s sister testified that Ms. R. \u201ccouldn\u2019t take care of herself for a whole day.\u201d She further testified that she sometimes had difficulties communicating with Ms. R. Finally, when Ms. R. testified, the sign language interpreter had difficulty understanding her responses.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">In light of this testimony pertaining to Ms. R.\u2019s disabilities and difficulties communicating, excluding evidence to the contrary was not harmless. On this record, I cannot say that, beyond a reasonable doubt, the exclusion of Ms. R.\u2019s employment records did not contribute to the guilty verdict against Fuentes. <em>See Simpson v. </em>State, 442 Md. 446, 457, 112 A.3d 941 (2015) (\u201c[A]n error will be deemed harmless only if a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict.\u201d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">The Majority\u2019s harmless error analysis regarding Fuentes\u2019s written statement to hotel security is also troubling. It places undue weight on Fuentes\u2019s answer to the prosecutor\u2019s question, \u201c[Y]ou realized working with [Ms. R.] that she has diminished capacity, correct?\u201d Fuentes responded, \u201cBecause she wouldn\u2019t talk and she could not hear.\u201d The Majority acknowledges that his response is ambiguous, but then proceeds to accord it significance as a \u201cfailure to deny.\u201d Maj. Op. at 308, 322-24, 164 A.3d at 272, 280-81. Fuentes\u2019s use of \u201cbecause\u201d and his follow-on explanation could be construed as an implicit admission that he knew the victim was of diminished capacity. But his answer may well have meant that he did not know she was intellectually impaired, only that she could not hear or speak. I submit that an admittedly ambiguous statement cannot logically be transformed into a concrete \u201cfailure to deny\u201d that \u201cstrongly supports a finding that he knew or reasonably should have known\u201d that Ms. R. was intellectually disabled. Maj. Op. at 322, 164 A.3d at 285. This ambiguous statement does not tip the scales in favor of finding harmless error. Nor does it move the State closer to meeting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>its weighty burden of proof\u2014that, beyond a reasonable doubt, the error in no way influenced the verdict.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
