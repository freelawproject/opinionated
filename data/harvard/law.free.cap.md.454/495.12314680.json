Following that meeting, Mr. Butler was subsequently robbed, struck in the head with a gun, and his cellphone, bus pass, and cash were stolen. Mr. Butler\u2019s assailants were subsequently identified as Appellant and Derrick Johnson (\u201cMr. Johnson\u201d). Appellant was arrested and charged with multiple offenses, including robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon, use of a handgun in a crime of violence, and conspiracy to commit robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">During voir dire, counsel for both parties requested that the trial judge ask the venirepersons whether they would give undue weight to a police-witness\u2019s testimony based on his or her occupation, because two poliee officers and a detective were anticipated to testify in the case. Rather than propound the police-witness question as requested, the trial judge posed a lengthy question that was not specifically tailored to the occupation of the witnesses testifying in Appellant\u2019s case. Appellant was subsequently convicted by a jury of robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon, use of a handgun in a crime of violence, and conspiracy to commit robbery. Appellant was sentenced to forty years\u2019 incarceration, with all but thirty years suspended, and five years of supervised probation. Appellant appealed his convictions to the Court of Special Appeals. After canceling oral argument, the Court of Special Appeals filed a certified question of law with this Court, which we reformulated to ask whether a broader occupational bias question posed during voir dire was appropriate in determining whether potential jurors would give undue weight to a police officer\u2019s testimony, based on his or her position as a police officer, when a more specific police-witness question was requested by Appellant\u2019s counsel..</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">For the reasons that follow, we answer the reformulated certified question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">I. Underlying Criminal Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">Because the issue dispositive of this appeal does not require a detailed recitation of the facts, we include only a brief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>summary of the underlying evidence that was established at trial. The record reflects that on September 14, 2014, Appellant invited Mr. Butler to meet him in Owings Mills so that Appellant could purchase drugs. After meeting with Appellant, Mr. Butler was subsequently robbed by multiple individuals who struck Mr. Butler in the head with a gun, and took his cell phone, bus pass, and cash. Upon investigation, the police identified Appellant and Mr. Johnson as the individuals who robbed Mr. Butler.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The State charged Appellant with: (1) robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon, (2) use of a handgun in a crime of violence, (3) robbery, (4) first-degree assault, (5) theft of less than $1,000, (6) conspiracy to commit robbery, and (7) conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">On May 21, 2015, following a two-day trial, Appellant was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County of robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon, use of a handgun in a crime of violence, and conspiracy to commit robbery. Appellant was acquitted of the conspiracy to commit armed robbery charge, and the charge of theft of less than $1,000 was entered <em>nolle prosequi. </em>The remaining charges were merged for sentencing purposes. Appellant was sentenced to forty years of incarceration with all but thirty years suspended, and to an additional five years of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">II. Voir Dire</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Prior to trial, both parties requested that the trial judge ask the venire what we will refer to as the police-witness question. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Appellant\u2019s counsel phrased the police-witness question in his written request for voir dire as follows:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-5\">If you are selected as a juror in the case you may hear the testimony of one or more law enforcement officers. Do any of you believe that a law enforcement officer\u2019s testimony is entitled to greater weight than any other witness just because he is a law enforcement officer?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Rather than pose the question as provided by Appellant\u2019s counsel, the trial judge instead engaged in the following monologue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">Another principle of law about which the jury will be instructed is what we call credibility of witnesses. In all jury trials, whether it\u2019s civil or criminal, the judge decides issues of law, but the jury decides issues of fact. In that regard, based on testimony and other admissible evidence, the jury decides what evidence they find persuasive. My instructions will include some factors that you may consider in judging witness credibility. Ultimately, if selected as a juror in this case, it will be for you to decide who you believe. That is to say, who is right or wrong, who is truthful or untruthful or who is correct or mistaken, At the conclusion of the case and during deliberations, the jury will have had the benefit of listening to and observing each witness, viewing all the other evidence presented and discussing the evidence with your fellow jurors. Mindful of that principle, are there any prospective jurors who would automatically give more or less weight to the testimony of any witness merely because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>of the witness\u2019 title, profession, education, occupation or employment? Now, that\u2019s a long question and it\u2019s asked in a vacuum. To start with, we want jurors who don\u2019t know anything about this case. But let me see if I can give you an example of what I\u2019m talking about. If anyone here is a physician, I\u2019m not picking on you. We have two physicians. And I pick physicians because they\u2019re similarly trained. They went to grade school. High school. College. Medical school. So, they\u2019re very\u2014they have similar characteristics. They\u2019re having lunch one day. They walk out of lunch. They\u2019re walking down the street. They\u2019re chit-chatting, chitchatting about whatever doctors chit-chat about and there\u2019s an accident that happens in front of them. One of the physicians saw it and thought the light was green and the other physician thought the light was red. And if that\u2019s all you had, and you were asked to make a decision, how would you decide? Well, most people would say, well, I gotta hear all the facts from everybody. And that\u2019s kind of the point of this question. So, stated another way, if you were selected as a juror in this case, would you be able to judge the credibility of each witness\u2019 testimony based on their testimony, rather than merely relying on his or her title, profession, education, occupation, or employment? For example, would any of you automatically give more or less weight to the testimony of a physician, a clergyman, a firefighter, a police officer, psychiatrist, social worker, electrician or any other witness merely because of their title, profession, education, occupation or employment? If so, please stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-4\">* * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">None of the venirepersons responded to the question. After the trial judge completed his questioning, Appellant\u2019s counsel took exception to how the trial judge phrased the police-witness question and the following exchange ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALm\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Yes, Your Honor. I\u2019d ask that you give my number 15[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] as written rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>classify the police with pharmacists and firemen, none of which are gonna testify. The issue is whether or not a juror will give more weight particularly to a uniformed police officer, or person identifying themselves as a police officer, as opposed to any other witness. So, putting them in a category with 12, or 5 or 6, other people, I don\u2019t think covers what <em>[Bowie v. State, </em>824 Md. 1, 595 A.2d 448 (1991)], which is the state that I\u2014case that I cited intends.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-4\"># * \u215b</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-5\">[THE COURT]: Okay. Well, come in a little closer, [Prosecutor]. What evidence will be presented by the police in this case? Because I\u2019m, I\u2019m\u2014I am aware of Judge Watts\u2019 opinion in <em>[Pearson v. State, </em>437 Md. 350, 86 A.3d 1232 (2014)]. And in Savante (phonetic,), <em>[Pearson], </em>she said that, that question doesn\u2019t even have to be asked unless there\u2019s evidence in the case. And I think I\u2019ve complied with <em>[Pearson] </em>anyway. But she said that question doesn\u2019t even have to be asked unless there is going to be substantial\u2014and I\u2019m using the term loosely\u2014substantial evidence derived from the police department. So, what evidence is the, the State gonna introduce in terms of police officer testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AAq\">[PROSECUTOR]: There is no confession\u2014no statement from the [Appellant], so I\u2014I mean, other than the search of the area where they uncover evidence, other than the issue of them stopping the cab that the Defendant was in, other than that,\u2014I, I mean, this was typical follow-up by police officers. But again, I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s going to be a question of credibility between the other police officers, and the police (inaudible) to the [Appellant].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\">[THE COURT]: Okay. Well, [Appellant\u2019s Counsel], I\u2019m, I\u2019m, I\u2019m gonna decline to ask the question the\u2014specifically the way you presented it. I think that the Court has fairly covered the, the issues that have been addressed in <em>[Thomas v. State, </em>139 Md.App. 188, 775 A.2d 406 (2001)], and <em>[Davis v. State, </em>333 Md. 27, 633 A.2d 867 (1993)] going back, and, and <em>[Pearson], </em>Quite frankly, if, if I read <em>[Pearson] </em>correctly, I don\u2019t even have to ask these people whether they\u2019ve been victims of crime. I do that out of an abundance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>of caution, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s required. So, I think the Court has fairly covered your questions and I think your objections are noted for the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-5\">\u215c * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">After the trial judge ruled on Appellant counsel\u2019s exceptions, the trial judge brought the venirepersons who had responded affirmatively to the bench to discuss their responses and then empaneled a jury, which subsequently convicted Appellant of the crimes discussed, <em>supra,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">III. Proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal of his convictions to the Court of Special Appeals. The Court of Special Appeals scheduled oral argument for December 6, 2016, but canceled it that morning. On December 27, 2016, then Chief Judge Krauser of that Court filed a certified question of law to this Court pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-304.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On January 19, 2017, we issued an order granting <em>certiorari </em>on the Court\u2019s certified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>question. Pursuant to Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCts. &amp; Jud. Proc.\u201d) \u00a7 12-604,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we rephrase the certified question to ask:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">Whether a broader occupational bias question posed during voir dire is appropriate in determining whether potential jurors would give undue weight to a police officer\u2019s testimony, based on his or her position as a police officer, when a more specific police-witness question was requested by Appellant\u2019s counsel?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">For the reasons that follow, we answer the reformulated certified question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">It is well-settled that a trial judge has broad discretion in the conduct of voir dire, especially regarding the scope and form of the questions propounded, and that he or she need not make any particular inquiry of the prospective jurors unless that inquiry is directed toward revealing cause for disqualification. <em>Dingle v. State, </em>361 Md. 1, 13-14, 759 A.2d 819, 826 (2000). Because trial judges retain wide discretion regarding the voir dire process, we review a trial judge\u2019s decisions during voir dire under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Pearson v. State, </em>437 Md. 350, 356, 86 A.3d 1232, 1236 (2014) (quoting <em>Washington v. State, </em>425 Md. 306, 314, 40 A.3d 1017, 1021 (2012)).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>We have previously held that \u201can examination of a juror on his [or her] voir dire is proper as long as it is conducted within the right to discover the juror\u2019s state of mind in respect to the matter in hand or any collateral matter reasonably liable to unduly influence him [or her].\u201d <em>Langley v. State, </em>281 Md. 387, 342, 378 A.2d 1338, 1340 (1977) (citations omitted). We have also made clear, however, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-4\">parties to an action triable before a jury have a right to have questions propounded to prospective jurors on their <em>voir dire, </em>which are directed to a specific cause for disqualification, and failure to allow such questions is an abuse of discretion constituting reversible error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-5\"><em>Moore v. State, </em>412 Md. 635, 646, 989 A.2d 1150, 1156 (2010) (quoting <em>Langley, </em>281 Md. at 341-42, 378 A.2d at 1340). There are two categories of specific cause for disqualification: \u201c(1) a statute disqualifies a prospective juror; or (2) a \u2018collateral matter [is] reasonably liable to have undue influence over\u2019 a prospective juror.\u201d <em>Pearson, </em>437 Md. at 357, 86 A.3d at 1236 (quoting <em>Washington, </em>425 Md. at 313, 40 A.3d at 1021).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">In <em>Langley, </em>we determined that the police-witness question is \u201cdirected to a specific cause for disqualification\u201d and is required to be asked by a trial judge if requested because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-7\">A juror who states on <em>[voir </em>dire] that he would give more credit to the testimony of police officers than to other persons has prejudged an issue of credibility in the case. Regardless of his efforts to be impartial, a part of his method for resolving controverted issues will be to give greater weight to the version of the prosecution, largely because of the official status of the witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-9\">As Judge Horney pointed out for the court in <em>Casey v. Roman Catholic Arch., </em>217 Md. 595, 607, 143 A.2d 627 [ (1958) ], \u2018a party is entitled to a jury free of all disqualifying bias or prejudice without exception, and not merely a jury free of bias or prejudice of a general or abstract nature.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>* * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-5\"><em>Langley, </em>281 Md. at 348-49, 378 A.2d at 1343-44 (quoting <em>Casey, </em>217 Md. at 607, 143 A.2d at 632); <em>see also Bowie v. State, </em>324 Md. 1, 8-9, 595 A.2d 448, 451 (1991) (holding that <em>Langley </em>is dispositive). Accordingly, if police-witnesses are anticipated to testify in a criminal case, it is an abuse of discretion for a trial judge to fail to propound the police-witness question when requested by a party to the action. <em>See Langley, </em>281 Md. at 338, 349, 378 A.2d at 1338, 1344 (holding that it was prejudicial error for the trial judge to have failed to ask the venire whether \u201cthere is anyone here who would give more credit to the testimony of a police officer over that of a civilian merely because of his status as a police officer?\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">The parties agree that when requested by a party, a trial judge is required to ask the police-witness question during voir dire. <em>See Bowie, </em>324 Md. at 8-11, 595 A.2d at 451-62; <em>Langley, </em>281 Md. at 348, 378 A.2d at 1343. The parties disagree, however, on whether the question posed by the trial judge in the instant case was sufficient to satisfy the purpose and spirit of the question\u2014to identify a juror\u2019s predisposition to give a police officer\u2019s testimony greater or lesser weight than that of another witness due to his or her position as a police officer. <em>See Langley, </em>281 Md. at 348, 378 A.2d at 1343.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">Appellant argues that the trial judge posed a lengthy, convoluted inquiry that consisted of 450 words and was 30 sentences long, which obfuscated the police-witness question, thereby evading the spirit of the required inquiry and serving no legitimate purpose. In support of this view, Appellant analogizes the case at bar to our decision in <em>Wright v. State, </em>411 Md. 503, 983 A.2d 519 (2009), where we held that the trial court abused its discretion when it asked the venire seventeen questions in a row before requesting their individual responses. <em>Wright, </em>411 Md. at 509-11, 515, 983 A.2d at 522-24, 526. Appellant also relies on our decision in <em>Dingle, </em>where we determined that a trial judge abused his discretion by asking the venire compound questions that shifted the responsibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>of determining bias from the judge to the venirepersons and deprived the defendant of an opportunity to challenge jurors for cause. <em>Dingle, </em>361 Md. at 21, 759 A.2d at 830. Appellant avers that the rationale underlying our decisions in these two cases was that potential jurors should not be asked questions during voir dire in an indigestible fashion. Here, Appellant argues that the trial judge\u2019s question was unduly long, confusing, and difficult for the venire to follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">In contrast, the State argues the question posed by the trial judge followed a clear structure beginning with an explanation of the concept of witness credibility and occupational bias, then providing an illustration that sought to demonstrate the mechanics of occupational bias in determining whether to believe a witness, and concluding the inquiry with the police-witness/occupational bias question. The State avers that because \u201cpolice officer\u201d was contained in the question portion of the trial judge\u2019s inquiry, the question \u201csufficiently indicated\u201d to the venire what possible bias or prejudice was being probed. The State contends that the trial judge\u2019s decision to include other occupations in the inquiry does not mean the venire did not appreciate that they should respond if they would give the testimony of a police officer more or less weight solely due to his or her occupation. The State also distinguishes the facts in the present case from <em>Wright </em>by noting this case only deals with a single topic of inquiry; whereas, <em>Wright </em>addressed the challenge of comprehending seventeen consecutive voir dire questions. <em>See Wright, </em>411 Md. at 509-11, 515, 983 A.2d at 522-24, 526. The State also differentiates <em>Dingle </em>by noting that in this case the question posed by the trial judge did not seek to shift the bias determination from the trial judge to the prospective jurors, unlike the compound voir dire questions posed in <em>Dingle. </em>361 Md. at 21, 759 A.2d at 830.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">We have previously described voir dire as \u201cthe process by which prospective jurors are examined to determine whether cause for disqualification exists\u201d and that the \u201coverarching purpose of voir dire in a criminal case is to ensure a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>fair and impartial jury.\u201d <em>Dingle, </em>361 Md. at 9, 759 A.2d at 823 (citations omitted). In determining whether a \u201ccause for disqualification!; ]\u201d exists, we have also held that \u201cthe questions should focus on issues particular to the defendant\u2019s case so that biases directly related to the crime, the witnesses, or the defendant may be uncovered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10, 759 A.2d at 824; <em>see also Washington, </em>425 Md. at 313, 40 A.3d at 1021 (quoting same); <em>State v. Shim, </em>418 Md. 37, 52, 12 A.3d 671, 679 (2011) (observing that \u201ca proposed voir dire question must be aimed at uncovering biases <em>directly related </em>to the crime, the witnesses, or the defendant\u201d) (citing <em>Curtin v. State, </em>393 Md. 593, 903 A.2d 922 (2006) (emphasis in original). We acknowledge that \u201c[v]oir dire is not a foolproof process, and we do not require perfection in its exercise[,]\u201d but we do require \"a comprehensive, systematic inquiry that is reasonably calculated, in both form and substance, to elicit all relevant information from prospective jurors.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>411 Md. at 514, 983 A.2d at 525. \u201c[T]he standard is whether the questions posed and the procedures employed have created a reasonable assurance that prejudice would be discovered if present.\u201d <em>Stewart v. State, </em>399 Md. 146, 159, 923 A.2d 44, 51-52 (2007) (quoting <em>White v. State, </em>374 Md. 232, 242, 821 A.2d 459, 464 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">As Appellant notes, the trial judge\u2019s inquiry consisted of 450 words and was more than 30 sentences long, in direct contrast to the requested question submitted by Appellant\u2019s counsel, which was a single, concise sentence comprising of a total of 50 words. The trial judge\u2019s inquiry also stands in stark contrast to the Maryland State Bar Association\u2019s (\u201cMSBA\u201d) model voir dire question, which contains 22 words, and asks, \u201c[wjould you tend to believe or disbelieve the testimony of a law enforcement officer more than the testimony of any other witness?\u201d Maryland State Bar Ass\u2019n, Model Jury Selection Questions for Criminal Trials, 1, 11, http:// perma.cc/A8Y7-QJWH. Although relevant to our inquiry, the length of the trial judge\u2019s question, by itself, is not dispositive of whether the judge abused his or her discretion. As noted, <em>supra, </em>we give the trial court broad discretion in determining the scope and the form in which the voir dire questions are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>propounded, and the length of an inquiry, alone, does not satisfy the high bar necessary to show an abuse of discretion. Rather, our review focuses on the substance of the trial judge\u2019s inquiry, and whether the question posed by the trial judge properly focused on the \u201cissues particular to [Appellant\u2019s] case\u201d and was \u201creasonably calculated, in both form and substance, to elicit\u201d the potential biases the venirepersons may hold regarding police officer testimony. <em>See Dingle, </em>361 Md. at 10, 759 A.2d at 824; <em>Wright, </em>411 Md. at 514, 983 A.2d at 525.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Although Appellant attempts to analogize <em>Wright </em>and <em>Dingle </em>to the case at bar, we conclude that both cases are factually distinguishable. In <em>Wright, </em>we determined that \u201c[t]he presentation of a lengthy roster of questions to the venire, without providing the opportunity to answer each question as it was posed, required each venireperson to comprehend and retain far too much information to guarantee that the questions were answered properly.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>411 Md. at 509, 983 A.2d at 522. After quoting the trial judge\u2019s seventeen-question inquiry, we observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">the voir dire comprised five and a half minutes of continuous questioning, without pause, after which each venireperson was called to the bench one at a time. This process resulted in substantial delay between presentation of the questions and the answers. Of the twelve jury members ultimately seated, four approached the bench more than thirty minutes after the voir dire questions had been read; the last of these approached more than fifty minutes after the reading.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ate\"><em>Id. </em>at 511-12, 983 A.2d at 524. We noted that \u201c[w]hile we have every confidence in our jurors\u2019 abilities to respond intelligently and effectively to inquiries posed during voir dire, we are also duty-bound to eliminate any doubt or error in the process, inasmuch as possible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 512, 983 A.2d at 524. Ultimately, we concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-7\">it is the multiplicity of the questions that is problematic, not the means by which the questions were broadcast. The key to an effective voir dire is allowing venirepersons the meaningful opportunity to digest the individual questions posed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>to them and to respond fully to each one while the question is at the forefront of their minds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 514, 983 A.2d at 525. In the present case, rather than considering the \u201cmultiplicity of the questions\u2019' asked by the trial judge, we are solely tasked with determining whether it is appropriate for a trial judge to ask a broader occupational bias question to determine whether potential jurors would give undue weight to a police officer\u2019s testimony, based on his or her position as a police officer\u2014a single inquiry. The factual circumstances underlying our decision in <em>Wright </em>are, therefore, distinguishable from the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">In <em>Dingle, </em>we examined whether the trial judge abused his discretion in asking the venire compound questions that required them to reflect on whether their individual biases would impact their ability to judge the trial fairly before responding to the trial judge\u2019s inquiry. <em>Dingle, </em>361 Md. at 4-5, 759 A.2d at 820-21. To illustrate the style of the trial judge\u2019s inquiry, we noted he posed, <em>inter alia, </em>the following question to the venire:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-7\">Again, a number of two-part questions, ladies and gentlemen. Only stand if your answer is yes to both parts of the question. Have you or any family member or close personal friend ever been a victim of a crime, and if your answer to that part of the question is yes, would that fact interfere with your ability to be fair and impartial in this case in which the state alleges that the defendants have committed a crime?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 5, 759 A.2d at 821. We concluded that because the trial judge \u201cdetermines the content and scope of the questions on voir dire[ ]\u201d and how voir dire will be conducted, it follows \u201cthat it is the trial judge that must decide whether, and when, cause for disqualification exists for any particular venire person. That is not a position occupied, or a decision to be made, by either the venire or the individual venire persons,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14-15, 759 A.2d at 826. We determined that since the trial judge is the focal point of the voir dire process, his or her \u201cpredominant function in determining juror bias involves cred<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>ibility findings\u201d and that for voir dire to be meaningful, it \u201cmust uncover more than \u2018the jurors\u2019 bottom line conclusions [to broad questions], which do not in themselves reveal automatically disqualifying biases as to their ability to fairly and accurately decide the case, and, indeed, which do not elucidate the bases for those conclusions^]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15, 759 A.2d at 826 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">We determined that the trial judge in <em>Dingle </em>failed to appreciate that, upon a challenge, he had the responsibility to decide\u2014based on the circumstances then existing\u2014\u201cwhether any of the venire persons occupying the questioned status or having the questioned experience should be discharged for cause, or whether \u2018a demonstrably strong correlation [exists] between the status [or experience] in question and a mental state that gives rise to cause for disqualification.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17, 759 A.2d at 828 (citations omitted). We held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-5\">[b]ecause [the trial judge] did not require an answer to be given to the question as to the existence of the status or experience unless accompanied by a statement of partiality, the trial judge was precluded from discharging his responsibility, <em>ie. </em>exercising discretion and, at the same time, the petitioner was denied the opportunity to discover and challenge venire persons who might be biased.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-6\"><em>Id. </em>As the State argues, Appellant is not alleging that the trial judge failed to discharge his responsibility of assessing venire-persons\u2019 response to the police-witness question for potential biases, which was the basis for our decision in <em>Dingle. </em>Rather, Appellant is arguing that the trial judge abused his discretion relative to the manner in which the question was posed. Thus, our decision in <em>Dingle </em>is also distinguishable from the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">The thrust of the State\u2019s argument is that it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial judge to ask the police-witness question within the broader framework of the occupational bias question we discussed in <em>Moore. </em>In <em>Moore, </em>we expanded our holding in <em>Langley, </em>concluding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>it is apparent that the <em>Langley </em>Court, from the outset, understood that, although it was addressing police officer credibility and, thus, some of the cases were not directly on point, the underlying issue of prejudgment encompassed more than police officers, that many more occupations and categories potentially were implicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\">\u215c \u2021 \u215c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">The principles prescribed and enunciated by <em>Langley </em>and embodied in its holding cannot be, as we have seen, so narrowly interpreted or applied to police officers. At its core, the <em>Langley </em>Court\u2019s holding is that it is grounds for disqualification for a juror to presume that one witness is more credible than another simply because of that witness\u2019s status or affiliation with the government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-7\"><em>Moore, </em>412 Md. at 649-50, 989 A.2d at 1158. We also determined that <em>\u201cBowie </em>is simply an explication and application of the standard acknowledged and even enforced in <em>Langley. </em>In that regard, <em>[Bowie] </em>articulated expressly that the issue suggested by the police witness question is broader than those witnesses and, therefore, has relevance beyond cases involving police officers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 650-51, 989 A.2d at 1158. We concluded that \u201c[a]t the heart of the issues presented in <em>Langley, Borne, </em>and the case at bar is whether it is appropriate for a juror to give \u2018credence\u2019 to a witness simply because of that witness\u2019s \u2018occupation,\u2019 or \u2018status,\u2019 or \u2018category,\u2019 or \u2018affiliation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 652, 989 A.2d at 1159 (quoting <em>Langley, </em>281 Md. at 349, 378 A.2d at 1338, 1344). Thus, <em>Moore </em>stands broadly for the proposition that if a potential juror is likely to give more credibility to a specific witness based on that witness\u2019s occupation, status, category, or affiliation then, upon request, the trial judge must ask a voir dire question that seeks to uncover that bias. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">We reiterated in <em>Moore, </em>however, that for the inquiry requested by a party to be mandatory,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Amk6\">the questions proposed must relate to uncovering bias that could arise, given the facts of the case. Accordingly, as a prerequisite to asking the question, there must be a qualify<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>ing witness, one, who, because of occupation or category, may be favored, or disfavored, simply on the basis on that status or affiliation. Where, therefore, no police or other official witnesses will be called by the State, the occupational, or status, question need not be asked. On the other hand, if the case is one in which one or more police or official witnesses will be called to testify, the occupational witness question(s) must be asked, if requested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 654-55, 989 A.2d at 1161. Accordingly, our decision in <em>Moore </em>also stands for the proposition that the occupational bias question is only mandatory if the trial judge determines that a specific witness who is testifying in the case could, due to his or her occupation, status, or affiliation, be favored or disfavored exclusively on the basis of his or her occupation, status, or affiliation. The inquiry must, therefore, be tailored to the witnesses who are testifying in the case and their specific occupation, status, or affiliation. In the case at bar, the parties agree that the only witnesses testifying in this case, for which the occupational bias question was relevant, were two police officers and one detective. Thus, the trial judge was required to tailor the occupational bias question specifically to the witnesses\u2019 occupation as police officers, which he failed to do when he included six other occupations in his inquiry that were not relevant to the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">In summary, we answer the reformulated certified question in the negative.- We hold that when a party requests that an occupational bias question be asked during voir dire, including the police-witness question, the trial judge is required to initially determine whether any witnesses testifying in the case\u2014based on their occupation, status, or affiliation\u2014may be favored or disfavored on the basis of that witness\u2019s occupation, status or affiliation, and then propound a voir dire question that is tailored to those specific occupations, statuses, or affiliations. <em>See Moore, </em>412 Md. at 654-55, 989 A.2d at 1161.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">THE REFORMULATED CERTIFIED QUESTION ANSWERED.
