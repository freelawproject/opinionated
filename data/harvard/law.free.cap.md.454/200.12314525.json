Grossman, Esq., and Assistant Bar Counsel, Amy S. Paulick, Esq., filed with the Court of Appeals on 25 February 2016 public charges in this matter against Respondent, Melodie Venee Shuler. The charges stemmed from a complaint lodged by Calvin A. Keene, a former client of Respondent. Respondent was charged with violating the following Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (MLRPC):<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (1) Rule 1.1 (Competence); (2) Rule 1.2(a) (Scope of Representation and Allocation of Authority Between Client and Lawyer); (3) Rule 1.3 (Diligence); (4) Rule 1.4 (Communication); (5) Rule 8.1 (Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters); and, (6) Rule 8.4 (a), (c), and (d) (Misconduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>The charges were assigned by this Court to the Hon. Ronald A. Silkworth of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County for the conduct of an evidentiary hearing and the rendition of findings of fact and conclusions of law. The hearing occurred over two days, 14 October and 1 November 2016.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Respondent, who lived apparently in South Carolina at the time, participated in the hearings by telephone. <em>See </em>Rules 16-757 and 2-513.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">On 25 January 2017, Judge Silkworth filed with the Court his written findings of fact and conclusions of law, dated 13 January 2017. He concluded that Respondent violated MLRPC 1.1,1.2,1.3,1.4(a), 1.4(b), 8.1, 8.4(a), 8.4(c), and 8.4(d). In addition, he found that Petitioner demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence nine aggravating factors infecting Respondent\u2019s misconduct. Respondent did not persuade Judge Silkworth, by a preponderance of the evidence, of the existence of any mitigating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Petitioner filed no exceptions to Judge Silkworth\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law, and recommended this Court disbar Respondent, noting also that Respondent stood before the Court suspended from the practice of law in Maryland as a result of a prior disciplinary action, <em>Atty. Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Shuler, </em>443 Md. 494, 117 A.3d 38 (2015). Respondent filed written exceptions. Concurrently with filing her exceptions, Respondent filed a motion requesting the Court to sanction Assistant Bar Counsel Paulick for making allegedly false assertions during the proceedings regarding the amount and payment of the legal fee to Respondent on Mr. Keene\u2019s behalf, by his mother, Ms. Gale Scoggins. The Court denies Respondent\u2019s motion to sanction Assistant Bar Counsel Paulick.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Oral argument before the Court of Appeals on Respondent\u2019s exceptions and Bar Counsel\u2019s recommendation for disbarment was scheduled for a date in March 2017, with notice to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>parties. Respondent sought a continuance. The Court, by order of 29 March 2017, granted a continuance to 3 April 2017 and required Respondent\u2019s appearance at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">Assistant Bar Counsel Paulick appeared before the Court on April 3. Respondent did not, nor did she communicate contemporaneously with the Court as to why she could not appear. The case was submitted on the papers and record. The Court entered a per curiam order disbarring Respondent the same day.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We explain now the basis for that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">As Chief Judge Barbera noted, writing for the Court recently in <em>Atty. Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Sweitzer, </em>452 Md. 26, 37, 156 A.3d 134, 140 (2017), <em>reconsideration denied </em>(Apr. 21, 2017):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-7\">\u201cIn attorney discipline proceedings, this Court has original and complete jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Page, </em>430 Md. 602, 626, 62 A.3d 163 (2013). If no exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact are filed, this Court may treat the facts as conclusively established. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kwarteng, </em>411 Md. 652, 659-60, 984 A.2d 865 (2009). If exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact are filed, we will not overrule the findings unless we are persuaded that they are clearly erroneous. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Mahone, </em>435 Md. 84, 104, 76 A.3d 1198 (2013). This Court conducts a <em>de novo </em>review of the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Garcia, </em>410 Md. 507, 515, 979 A.2d 146 (2009). Accordingly, this Court must determine, based on a \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard of proof, whether sufficient evidence existed in the record to support the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Tanko, </em>427 Md. 15, 27, 45 A.3d 281 (2012).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>HEARING JUDGE\u2019S FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Satisfied that Bar Counsel met the clear and convincing evidence standard placed on it <em>(see </em>Md. Rule 16-757(c)) in attorney disciplinary cases, the hearing judge found the following facts, which we summarize.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">Ms. Gale Scoggins, mother of Calvin Keene and herself apparently a person of modest means, retained Respondent in March 2011 to represent her son in pursuit of a modification of sentence in two criminal cases in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Scoggins paid Respondent $750 in cash to obtain her representation of Keene in the modification matter. According to Md. Rule 4-345(e)(1)(B), governing the revisory power of a sentencing court over sentences, the sentencing court\u2019s ability to revise/modify a sentence expires five years \u201cfrom the date the sentence originally was imposed .... \u201d Accordingly, because Keene had been sentenced on 14 August 2008, any modification had to be acted on or before 14 August 2013, or the sentencing court would lose its authority to act in such regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">Respondent entered her appearance as Counsel for Keene in the two criminal matters on 8 June 2011. Although she acted promptly to gain access to Keene\u2019s pre-trial sentencing report in the cases (which the trial court granted on 14 June 2011), Respondent\u2019s communications with Scoggins about the sentence modification initiative became sporadic quite soon thereafter. According to Scoggins, many of her telephone and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>text messages to Respondent seeking status updates went unanswered for weeks at a time.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">According to Scoggins, it was not until 3 April 2012 that Respondent recommended that October 2012 would be the \u201cbest time\u201d to file a Motion for Modification of Sentence \u201cbecause that would be five years after the offense.\u201d Respondent promised to visit Keene in jail in May of 2012 and to seek a meeting later in April 2012 with the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office to attempt to gain support for sentence modification. Respondent did none of these things in the time frames promised or otherwise, and continued not to respond timely to Scoggins\u2019s letters seeking updates on efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">On 5 February 2013, Scoggins sent Respondent an email expressing concern about Respondent\u2019s uncommunicative posture. Respondent responded to the email, offering excuses about having personal problems that prevented her from receiving telephone, email, or regular mail. She promised that she would visit Keene and file the modification motion later in February. She did not accomplish either task, however. Similar representations were made by Respondent to Scoggins in March, May, July, and August of 2013, all of which proved equally hollow.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">In a surprise to Scoggins, Respondent requested on 2 October 2013 an additional $500 to complete the representation of Keene, stating that Respondent discovered only lately that Keene had been sentenced in two criminal cases, rather than one (seemingly overlooking the fact that on 8 June 2011 she entered her appearance as Keene\u2019s counsel in both cases). On or about 4 February 2014, Scoggins paid an additional $300, as an installment, to Respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">The cycle of unfulfilled promises to act by Respondent resumed in May, June, and September of 2014. On 15 October 2014, Respondent represented to Keene that she was \u201cin the process of filing\u201d a Motion for Post-Conviction Relief on his behalf. At the same time, she solicited an additional $400, noting that the new total fee would be $1,500. Respondent stated, however, that the payment of the balance claimed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>would not prevent her from completing her representation of Keene.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Apparently appreciating that, by operation of the time bar of Md. Rule 4-345(e)(1)(B), the trial court no longer could grant relief to modify his sentences, Keene acquiesced initially in January 2015 to Respondent\u2019s suggestion to file instead a post-conviction petition. Despite all that had gone before, Respondent, in February 2015, now used the excuse that, because pursuit of the modification motion was no longer viable, she needed more time to draft a post-conviction petition. She promised Scoggins that it would be filed before the end of March 2015. Instead, Respondent filed a motion to withdraw as Keene\u2019s counsel on 30 April 2015, having not filed any of the motions for relief she was engaged to prepare and prosecute, when she learned that Keene had filed a bar complaint about her representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Indeed, Keene filed with Petitioner on 16 February 2015 a complaint against Respondent. Respondent did not respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s multiple requests in February and March for a response to the complaint. She did respond, of a sort, to Bar Counsel\u2019s third invitation by advising Bar Counsel that she had been diagnosed with pneumonia on or about 26 February 2015. Thereafter, Respondent rebuffed Bar Counsel\u2019s investigatory requests for information and indicated that she would respond, if at all, solely to emails. Respondent\u2019s intransigence continued to the time of public charges in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">After the two days of hearings, the hearing judge concluded as follows regarding the charges against Respondent and relevant aggravating/mitigating factors bearing on the sanction, if any:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-7\">Rule 1.1 Competence</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADs\">Rule 1.1 provides that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-8\">A lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client. Competent representation requires the legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>knowledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for representation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">If an attorney \u201cfails to act or acts in an untimely manner, resulting in harm to his or her client,\u201d generally the Court finds a violation of Rule 1.1. <em>Atty. Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Brown, </em>426 Md. 298, 319, 44 A.3d 344, 357 (2012). Evidence that an attorney failed \u201cto apply the requisite thoroughness and/or preparation in representing a client is sufficient alone to support a violation of Rule 1.1.\u201d <em>Atty. Griev. Comm\u2019n v. McCulloch, </em>404 Md. 388, 398, 946 A.2d 1009, 1015 (2008); <em>Atty. Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Garrett, </em>427 Md. 209, 223, 46 A.3d 1169, 1177 (2012) (concluding that failure to take \u201cnecessary, fundamental steps to further the client\u2019s case\u201d is a violation of Rule 1.1).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The Attorney Grievance Commission argues that Respondent violated this rule because she failed to request a hearing on behalf of her client on the two motions, Motion for Reconsideration of Sentence and Application of Review of Sentence, filed prior to the start of her representation. However because this Court takes Judicial Notice of the fact that the Motion for Reconsideration was held sub curia and the Application for Review of Sentence was acted upon by a three judge review panel and the sentence was confirmed without change by Order of Court dated November 19, 2008, this Court concludes that requesting a hearing would not have been the proper procedural step regarding the Application for Review of Sentence. By the time that Respondent was heard, this was already finally resolved. Because of this, the Court cannot find, by clear and convincing evidence, that the Respondent was acting as an incompetent attorney when she failed to obtain a hearing on the review Application.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">The Court does find, however, that the Respondent violated Rule 1.1 because she failed to. check on the status of her client\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration of Sentence and inform her client of that status. Instead, she left him unapprised of the status of those motions and allowed the five year deadline to run out without checking on the status of those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>motions or requesting a hearing on the Reconsideration request. It is clear that Respondent was aware of the five year deadline because she advised Ms. Scoggins on March 14, 2013 that \u201cIt will be 5 years and time to file in Motion in May or June.\u201d [ ][<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>] Failing to check on the status of the case or promptly inform her client at any point was clearly incompetent representation. While it is not clear that the trial judge would have granted a modification, any opportunity to address the trial judge to convince him was lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Respondent also violated Rule 1.1 by giving her client contradictory and false information. After the deadline passed for a Motion for Modification to be ruled on, Respondent told Ms. Scoggins and Mr. Keene that there was no deadline and continued to attest that she would file a Motion for Modification, even though one had already been filed by her client. [ ]</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">It is clear that the Respondent gave her client misinformation about the status of his case because she had, in violation of Rule 1.1, not made an attempt to verify the status of his case or to take any of the next procedural steps. Had Respondent appropriately reviewed his case file, she would have determined that a significant portion of Mr. Keene\u2019s sentence (18 years) was to be served without the possibility of parole. Appropriate research would have been required to determine his eligibility for drug treatment pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Health-Gen. \u00a7 8-507. This would have required a separate motion which would not have been barred by the five year limit discussed herein. This was not done.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Rule 1.2 Scope of Representation and Allocation of Authority Between Client and Lawyer</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Rule 1.2 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-9\">(a) Subject to paragraphs (c) and (d), a lawyer shall abide by a client\u2019s decisions concerning the objectives <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>of the representation and, when appropriate, shall consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued. A lawyer may take such action on behalf of the client as is impliedly authorized to carry out the representation. A lawyer shall abide by a client\u2019s decision whether to settle a matter. In a criminal case, the lawyer shall abide by the client\u2019s decision, after consultation with the lawyer, as to a plea to be entered, whether to waive jury trial, and whether the client will testify.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">When an attorney fails to file the legal documents that a client retained her to file, the attorney violates Rule 1.2. <em>See Atty. Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Kreamer, </em>404 Md. 282, 946 A.2d 500 (2008) (holding that an attorney violated Rule 1.2 when he failed to dissolve the client\u2019s corporation as per the client\u2019s request); <em>Atty. Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Granger, </em>374 Md. 438, 823 A.2d 611 (2003) (holding that an attorney violated Rule 1.2 when he failed to immediately file for bankruptcy on her behalf where the client instructed the attorney to do so in order to avoid foreclosure on her home).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Here, Respondent violated Rule 1.2 by failing to consult with her client in order to discuss how to pursue the client\u2019s objectives in light of the fact that a Motion for Modification of Mr. Keene\u2019s criminal sentence had already been filed prior to the expiration of the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction over the matter in accordance with Maryland Rule 4-345(e)(1)(B). Respondent failed to determine the status of the previously filed application for Review of Sentence, although as stated herein, that issue was resolved prior to Respondent being retained. Respondent made no mention of the impact of a sentence without parole on the modification previously filed. Nor did she consider Md. Code Ann., Health-Gen. \u00a7 8-507.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Rule 1.3 Diligence</p>\n<p id=\"Aqr\">Rule 1.3 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-8\">A lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>An attorney violates this Rule when she takes no action whatsoever in representing her client. <em>Atty. Griev. Comm\u2019n v. De La Paz, </em>418 Md. 534, 554, 16 A.3d 181, 193 (2011); <em>Atty Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Shakir, </em>427 Md. 197, 205, 46 A.3d 1162, 1167 (2012). Failing to keep a client informed as to the status of the case and failing to respond to the client\u2019s inquiries also violates Rule 1.3. <em>See Atty. Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Park, </em>427 Md. 180, 192, 46 A.3d 1153, 1160 (2012). In this case, Respondent violated Rule 1.3 by failing to meet with Mr. Keene in order to discuss the necessary steps to be taken in light of the fact that a Motion for Modification of Mr. Keene\u2019s criminal sentence had already been filed. Furthermore, Respondent failed to determine the status of the previously filed application for Review of Sentence. Respondent also violated Rule 1.3 by failing to file or pursue the previously filed Motion for Modification on Mr. Keene\u2019s behalf while the judge still had jurisdiction over the matter (i.e., within five years) pursuant to Maryland Rule [4-3451(e)(1)(B) [sic]. Respondent further failed to consider what options Mr. Keene had for treatment in light of the sentence [he] was serving without parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Rule 1.4(a) Communication</p>\n<p id=\"ALt\">(a) A lawyer shall:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">(1) promptly inform the client of any decision or circumstance with respect to which the client\u2019s informed consent, as defined in Rule 1.0(f), is required by these Rules;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-7\">(2) keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-8\">(3) promptly comply with reasonable requests for information; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-9\">(4) consult with the client about any relevant limitation on the lawyers\u2019 conduct when the lawyer knows that the client expects assistance not permitted by the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct or other law. Comment [5] to Rule 1.4 explains that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-10\">\u201c[t]he client should have sufficient information to participate intelligently in decisions concerning the objectives of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>the representation and the means by which they are to be pursued .... Adequacy of communication depends in part on the kind of advice or assistance that is involved. <em>Atty. Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Narasimhan, </em>438 Md. 638, 656, 92 A.3d 512, 523 (2014).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">Paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this Rule, respectively, require a lawyer to keep her client \u201creasonably informed\u201d about the status of the case, and to promptly respond to reasonable requests for information from the client. <em>Atty. Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Van Nelson, </em>425 Md. 344, 354-55, 40 A.3d 1039, 1045 (2012). In <em>Van Nelson, </em>the Court of Appeals found that the attorney failed to return his client\u2019s persistent telephone calls and email requests. <em>Id. </em>Further, the client learned that a $10,000.00 payment she had made had been seized by the federal government not from her own attorney, but from opposing counsel. <em>Id. </em>She only learned this by virtue of her own efforts to secure information about her case. <em>Id. </em>As such, the attorney in Van Nelson did not keep his client reasonably informed. <em>Id. </em>The Court found, therefore, by clear and convincing evidence that Van Nelson violated Rule 1.4(a)(2) and (3). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">In the instant case, Respondent failed to \u201cpromptly inform the client of any decision ... with respect to which the client\u2019s informed consent is required\u201d when she failed to notify him that she would be unable to pursue the previously filed Motion for Modification of Sentence while the trial judge still had jurisdiction over the matter pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-345(e)(1)(B). After she missed the deadline, she failed to inform Mr. Keene that the court no longer had jurisdiction. Instead, she tried to convince him that a Motion for Post Conviction Relief would be more advantageous in his case. When Mr. Keene and Mrs. Scoggins informed Respondent that they believed that there was a five year deadline, she brushed aside their concerns by saying, \u201cOf course it is not to[o] late. Attorneys usually wait until 5 years to do it and just don\u2019t do it sooner because it has been the practice of the courts in Maryland to want the person to wait at least 5 years to do so. But no, it is never a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>time limit,\u201d [] Respondent also failed to investigate the status of the Application for Review of Sentence although this failure caused no harm to Mr. Keene because it was due long before Respondent was even hired and there was nothing she could have done to change or appeal the ruling. Lastly, as stated herein, Respondent failed to communicate with Mr. Keene [regarding] [sic ] his sentence without parole and any options available to him as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Rule 1.4(b) Communication</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Rule 1.4(b) requires that a lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation. <em>See Atty. Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Narasimhan, </em>438 Md. 638, 668-59, 92 A.3d 512, 523-24 (2014) (citing <em>Atty. Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Rand, </em>429 Md. 674, 716, 57 A.3d 976, 1001 (2012)). In <em>Rand, </em>the Court of Appeals held that, when analyzing whether or not an attorney has violated Rule 1.4(b), [] its analysis needs to \u201ctake into account the entire interaction between [the attorney] and [the client] and the information that was communicated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 717, 57 A.3d at 1001.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">In the instant case, Mrs. Scoggins\u2019s testimony and her emails with the Respondent clearly show that Respondent did not explain the matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation. Respondent continually promised that she would visit Mr. Keene in jail to discuss his case, file a Motion for Modification of Sentence, and schedule a hearing before the judge. She never did so. She did not explain to Mr. Keene and Mrs. Scoggins that the judge only had jurisdiction over Mr. Keene\u2019s criminal matter for five years. In fact, when confronted by the client and his mother, she denied that there was a five year deadline. Her failure to communicate that there was a five-year time limit within which Mr. Keene\u2019s sentence could be modified was a violation of Rule 1.4(b). See <em>Rand </em>at 429 Md. 674, 716, 57 A.3d 976, 1001. Further, Respondent did not determine the status of the Application for Review of Sentence and explain that status to Mr. Keene. Respondent failed to review and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>explain to Mr. Keene his options in light of his sentence without parole, i.e., Md. Code Ann., Health-Gen. \u00a7 8-507.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Rule 8.1 Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">Rule 8.1(b) makes it a violation to \u201cknowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information ... [from Bar Counsel].\u201d <em>See Atty. Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Garrett, </em>427 Md. 209, 226, 46 A.3d 1169, 1179 (2012) (failing to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s request for information is a violation of Rule 8.1(b)). <em>See also Atty. Griev. Comm\u2019n v.

Petitioner sent three letters to Respondent before she provided a response to the Complaint. When she did respond, her responses were incomplete. For example, she answered, \u201cYou should ask Mr. Keene for copies of the letters\u201d and \u201cI will not talk to you because you are a dishonest person.\u201d [ ] When Petitioner\u2019s Investigator contacted Respondent, she refused to return his calls. When Assistant Bar Counsel asked Respondent to return the Investigator\u2019s calls, Respondent replied that she would not do so. <em>Id. </em>Finally, when Assistant Bar Counsel sent correspondence asking Respondent for additional information, she replied, \u201cI spent my entire summer dealing with your bogus claims involving Mr. Kevin Wilson; I will not spend my entire summer with this matter. Therefore, it will not be within 10 days that I will review this matter but in September.\u201d [] In her dealings with Bar Counsel, whether it be refusing to accept certified mail, refusing to speak to Bar Counsel\u2019s investigator, or refusing to respond to Bar Counsel requests for information in a timely fashion, Respondent violated Rule 8.1 in that she \u201cknowingly fail[ed] to respond to a lawful demand for information from [an] authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">Disciplinary Rule 8.4(a) Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>\u201cIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to: (a) violate or attempt to violate the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct, knowingly assist or induce another to do so, or do so through the acts of another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the Court finds that Respondent has violated Rules 1.1,1.2,1.3, 1.4(a) and (b), 8.1(b), and 8.4(d), it therefore finds that Respondent has violated Rule 8.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">Rule 8.4(c) Misrepresentation</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Rule 8.4(c) provides, \u201c[i]t is professional misconduct for a lawyer to ... engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation!!.]\u201d \u201cDishonest acts, in and of themselves are violative of [RULE] 8.4(c).\u201d <em>Atty. Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Barnett, </em>440 Md. 254, 266, 102 A.3d 310, 318 (2014) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">In this case, there is clear and convincing evidence that Respondent made several misrepresentations to Mr. Keene and Ms. Scoggins. First, she continually represented that she would visit Mr. Keene, visit the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office, and file a Motion for Modification of Sentence for him, but after having the representation for almost four years, she never did so. [ ]</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">Next, she misrepresented to Mrs. Scoggins and Mr. Keene that there was no deadline for obtaining a hearing on a Motion for Modification of a Sentence. [ ] Specifically, she stated, \u201ctime to file has not passed .... Usually for serious offenses the [ ] modification is requested within [fjive years ... a little more time for filing would be beneficial.\u201d Once Mr. Keene and Mrs. Scoggins confronted Respondent with the knowledge they obtained from other sources regarding the five year deadline, Respondent again misrepresented the significance of the deadline to them by stating, \u201cOf course it is not to[o] late. Attorneys usually wait until 5 years to do it and just don\u2019t do it sooner because it has been the practice of the courts in Maryland to want the person to wait at least 5 years to do so. But no, it is never a time limit. It can be done at any time. It can be done sooner than 5 years or later.\u201d [ ]</p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Knowing that this statement was false, Respondent then tried to convince Mr. Keene and Ms. Scoggins that a Motion for Post-Conviction Relief would be more beneficial to Mr. Keene. [ ] When Mr. Keene persisted in having a Motion for Modification of Sentence filed instead[,] Respondent then drafted a Belated Motion for Modification of Sentence. [ ] She further misrepresented the reason for her delay in filing the motion when, in the body of the motion, she states: \u201cThe undersigned counsel informed the defendant that the court does not have jurisdiction to modify a Sentence after five years of sentencing under Maryland Rule 4\u2014845(b) but given the following circumstances he should be entitled to a belated motion for modification of his sentence.\u201d [ ] She then blamed Mr. Keene for failing to communicate with her. [ ] She blamed Mrs. Scoggins for failing to timely pay her fees, [] Finally, she blamed the jail for refusing to allow her visitation. [ ]</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">Rule 8.4(d) Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Rule 8.4(d) states that it is professional misconduct for an attorney to \u201cengage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d Conduct which is likely to impair the public confidence in the profession, impact the image of the legal profession and engender disrespect for the court is conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. <em>Atty. Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Childress, </em>360 Md. 373, 381-82, 768 A.2d 117, 121 (2000). Respondent\u2019s failure to pursue a previously filed Motion for Modification of Sentence on Mr. Keene\u2019s behalf is a violation of Rule 8.4(d). Her failures constitute conduct which is likely to impair public confidence in [ ] the legal profession.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">AGGRAVATING FACTORS</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">In <em>Atty. Griev.

See <em>Atty. Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Shuler, </em>443 Md. 494, 117 A.3d 38 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Factor (2)[,] a dishonest or selfish motive[,] is apparent in Respondent\u2019s violation of Rule 8.4(c) by misrepresenting to Mr. Keene and Ms. Scoggins that she had not missed the deadline to file Mr. Keene\u2019s sentence modification. Further, a dishonest or selfish motive was present here when Respondent refused to refund any of Mr. Keene\u2019s funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">A pattern of misconduct (Factor 3) is present here because, over the course of four years, Respondent represented to Mrs. Scoggins that she would visit Mr. Keene and file a motion on his behalf but she never did. Her violations of Rules 1.1,1,3,1.4, and 8.4(c) and (d) are numerous throughout the representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">Further, as for factor (4)[,] multiple violations of the RULE, Respondent has violated Rules 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 8.1(b) and 8.4(a), (c), and (d) in this matter. Factor (5), bad faith obstruction of the attorney discipline proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with the Maryland Rules or orders of this Court or the hearing judge, is also present in this case. Respondent blatantly stated, \u201cI refuse to speak with your investigator\u201d and \u201cI will not respond within 10 days, but in September.\u201d [ ]</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Factor (7), a refusal to acknowledge the misconduct\u2019s wrongful nature[,] is present in the instant matter. Respondent does not take responsibility for her mistakes, but instead blames Mr. Keene, Ms. Scoggins, and the jail for her failures to complete the representation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-5\">As for factor (8)[,] the victim\u2019s vulnerability, Mr. Keene was a vulnerable client because he was incarcerated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-6\">Respondent has also shown indifference to making restitution or rectifying the misconduct\u2019s consequences (factor 10).

She has never offered to refund their money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-7\">Finally, factor (12), the likelihood of repetition of the misconduct, is also present here.

We shall summarize them, as best as we can.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>1. Keene knew about the five-year deadline for obtaining a hearing on a Motion for Sentence Modification, thus undermining the hearing judge\u2019s findings or conclusions. Keene\u2019s alleged equivocation about which motion to pursue, Respondent\u2019s alleged explanation to Keene of his legal options over the phone, and her communication to Scoggins that she was unable to take action in June 2013 until her license to practice law was reinstated impugn further the hearing judge\u2019s findings or conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">A. Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Respondent expounds at length that the court\u2019s findings of fact show that Keene knew all along about the five-year deadline, arguing, apparently, that she could not have misled Keene during the course of her representation. Respondent maintains that 1) \u201cshe advised Ms. Scoggins on March 14, 2013 that \u2018It will be 5 years and time to file [a] Motion in May or June;\u2019 \u201d 2) \u201cKeene[\u2019s] prior attorney Michael Blumenthal informed Keene of the deadline ... 3) \u201cKeene testified that inmates told him [about the five-year deadline];\u201d and, 4) Respondent informed Keene, in November 2014, that the five-year period lapsed. In a related argument, Respondent states that she was not dishonest about the existence of the deadline, nor did she attempt to cover-up her failure to file anything by the deadline: \u201cthe client himself when confronted during deposition admitted that he received the \u2018Belated\u2019 motion. In reading the motion is clearly stated that he missed the deadline and was informed that he did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">In another theme, Respondent argues that Keene changed his mind several times over the course of the representation about which procedural option he would like to pursue, preventing Respondent from obtaining consent to any specific course of action. Respondent asserts that a letter from Keene <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>to her shows that Keene \u201cchanged his mind because he wanted the [Post&gt;-Conviction] Petition filed first and the Modification later.\u201d She states that \u201cyou see a change of mind in November of 2014 from a Petition to Motion for Modification then a change of mind from Motion for Modification to Petition in January.\u201d Respondent contends that \u201cfrom April of 2011 to November of 2014[, Keene] stated he did not want a Motion for Modification of his Sentence filed[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Respondent asserts also that she provided proper legal advice to Keene about his legal options. She argues that her \u201chand written notes\u201d confirm that she advised Keene thoroughly, and that she did not try to convince unduly Keene or Scoggins to pursue a Petition for Post-Conviction Relief <em>in lieu </em>of sentence modification. Respondent states that she counseled Keene that \u201cdue to the history of the case [ ] it was unlikely that the Motion [for Reconsideration] would be granted .... Instead of providing a compelling argument that he could convince a Judge Keene would state he wanted a Petition for Post-Conviction Relief filed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Respondent cites a 4 June 2013 email correspondence to Scoggins, which Respondent claims \u201c[t]he hearing Judge ignored,\u201d and which stated that, for the month of June, she could not \u201cfil[e] the case\u201d because she needed to have her attorney license reinstated; she concluded, \u201c[i]f you can not wait until then I will suggest to get another attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">B. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">Respondent asserts correctly that Keene knew about the five-year period, imposed by Md. Rule 4\u2014345(e)(1)(B), in which a sentencing court has revisory power over a sentence. This fact, however, has no exculpatory value for Respondent, who, according to the record, misled Keene and Scoggins by: 1) responding on 2 October 2013 to a 1 October 2013 email from Scoggins, in which Scoggins stated that Calvin \u201csee[ms] to think that his chance for a sentence of modification is past <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>due,\u201d that the \u201ctime to file has not passed;\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 2) promising repeatedly to visit Keene in prison; and, 3) representing repeatedly to Keene and Scoggins that she would file either a Motion for Modification of Sentence or a Petition for Post-Conviction Relief, neither of which she did. This non-exhaustive list of broken promises and misinformation furnished by Respondent to Keene and Scoggins provides ample evidence from which to find that Respondent misled Keene over the course of the representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">Respondent argues that her inability to obtain Keene\u2019s consent on any particular course of action foiled her ability to take any legal action on his behalf for nearly four years. Under Rule 1.2(a), however, attorneys have the implied authority to make legal decisions that align with the stated goals of their clients: \u201can attorney shall abide by a client\u2019s decisions concerning the objectives of the representation and, when appropriate, shall consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued. An attorney may take such action on behalf of the client as is impliedly authorized to carry out the representation.\u201d Respondent appears to cite Keene\u2019s alleged changes of mind to justify her failure to take any actions on his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Even if the hearing judge had credited Respondent\u2019s \u201chand written notes\u201d as bolstering Respondent\u2019s argument that she discussed Keene\u2019s legal options with him over the phone on one occasion, she failed repeatedly to meet with him\u2014for years\u2014to keep him apprised of any progress (or lack thereof) in his case. The hearing judge was justified in not being persuaded by Respondent\u2019s explanations of alleged difficulties beyond her control for failing to obtain direct, face-to-face aecess to the incarcerated Keene.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The fact that Respondent sent an email approximately two months before the end of the five-year period, stating that she could not work on Keene\u2019s behalf until she got her law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>practice license reinstated and that Keene should find another attorney if \u201c[he] can not wait until then,\u201d erects no safe harbor for Respondent. At that point, she had done nothing for her client for two years. Her self-inflicted loss of her law license at the end of the period did not excuse any of her preceding misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">We overrule this grouping of exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s fact-finding. Additionally, assuming that Respondent\u2019s argument that \u201c[t]he [hearing court] contradicts itself\u2019 by \u201cfinding] that Keene was mislead\u201d is a challenge to the court\u2019s conclusion that Respondent violated Rule 8.4(c), we overrule this exception to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion of law with respect to misrepresentation because Respondent did in fact mislead Keene.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">2. Scoggins and/or Keene failed to pay fully and timely Respondent\u2019s fee. Keene changed his mind as to which remedy he wanted Respondent to pursue.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">A. Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">\u201cOn or about February 4, 2014, Ms. Scoggins paid the Respondent an installment of $250.00; not $300.00; the court err[ ]s on this fact .... Ms. Scoggins paid additional amount of $150.00. Both amount of $300 and $150.00 were after the August 2013 deadline.\u201d Respondent indicates that this \u201cis relevant because the client kept pretending he would pay and then would change his mind causing a delay by saying he wanted something else to be filed. Ms, Shuler stated to the client that if he would not pay by a certain date she would withdraw then the client would say that he wanted additional work done or something else preventing Ms. Shuler from filing the document and/or withdrawing from the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">B. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">The record includes an exchange of emails between Respondent and Scoggins on 4 February 2014 in which Scoggins wrote: \u201cGood morning[,] the check has been mail[ed] off. Don\u2019t put the check in the bank until Friday because it will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>bounce. Also I was able to send $300 and not $350 as stated funds added up wrong. ...\u201d In light of this email, we hold not to be clearly erroneous the judge\u2019s finding that Scoggins paid Respondent an installment of $300 on or about that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">Respondent ties the client\u2019s alleged failure to render full and timely payment to her allegation that Keene prevented Respondent from performing any work. If indeed Keene was a difficult client, the Rules allow an attorney to withdraw from representing a client if \u201cthe client fails substantially to fulfill an obligation to the lawyer regarding the lawyer\u2019s services and has been given reasonable warning that the lawyer will withdraw unless the obligation is fulfilled!!]\u201d Rule 1.16(b)(5). Instead, Respondent did not do so until learning that Keene had filed a complaint with Bar Counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">We override this grouping of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">3. Keene refused to consent to any course of action and failed to complain preliminarily about Respondent\u2019s misconduct. Respondent offered a partial refund of fees paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">A. Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Under this heading, Respondent rehashes her arguments that she was unable to perform any legal work for her client because of his alleged failure to pay timely and in full, her client\u2019s alleged equivocation on which legal route to pursue, and her client\u2019s alleged failure to consent to a particular course of legal action.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">She adds to this iteration of oft-repeated exceptions the argument that, prior to filing with Petitioner on 16 February 2016 his bar complaint against Respondent, \u201cKeene never complained to the court in the numerous letters he wrote after the deadline was missed and never complained to Ms. Shuler at all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">Respondent argues also that, \u201c[cjontrary to the court conclusion that Ms. Shuler never attempted to return the money to Mr. Keene[,]\u201d she offered Keene a refund: \u201cMs. Shuler <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>suggested the refund because .., she could clearly see that Keene was going back and forth in the filings and becoming a problem client.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">B. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">We overrule this group of reiterated exceptions for the reasons expressed previously in addressing related exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">In addition, Respondent\u2019s argument that Keene failed to complain about Respondent\u2019s conduct prior to filing his official complaint appears to be either 1) a factual argument that does not seem to challenge any of the hearing judge\u2019s factual findings; or, 2) a factual argument joined with an implied legal argument that Keene had a duty to mitigate before lodging an official complaint, and, having failed allegedly to do so, one could assume reasonably only that he was not concerned about Respondent\u2019s representation. The value of this argument to Respondent is unclear to us, and, in any event, the record includes years of email correspondence to Respondent from Scoggins articulating her and her son\u2019s concerns about Respondent\u2019s representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Regarding Respondent\u2019s exception to a hearing judge\u2019s legal conclusion, we assume that she is referring to the judge\u2019s determinations regarding aggravating factors that \u201c... a dishonest or selfish motive was present here when Respondent refused to refund any of Mr. Keene\u2019s funds[;]\u201d and, regarding the factor of indifference to making restitution or rectifying the misconduct\u2019s consequences, \u201c[s]he has never offered to refund their money.\u201d On 14 June 2016, Respondent filed, as Exhibit F in support of her Motion to Vacate Entry of Default and Request for Sanctions Against Amy Paulick and Glenn Grossman, an email to Scoggins dated 24 January 2014, which stated, in part: \u201cAt this time the option I know that time is pas[s]ing by fast so I suggest 1) Pay the $750.00 or 2) I can reimburse you [ ] a portion of the $750.00 you already paid.\u201d Notwithstanding Respondent\u2019s correct assertion that she offered to Scoggins a partial refund in January 2014, we overrule nonetheless her exception on this point. With respect to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>the aggravating factor of a dishonest or selfish motive, the hearing judge identified an additional supporting factual basis: Respondent\u2019s \u201cmisrepresent[ation] to Mr. Keene and Ms. Scoggins that she had not missed the deadline to file Mr. Keene\u2019s sentence modification.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Similarly, regarding the factor of indifference, the judge explained also that \u201c[s]he has never apologized to Mr. Keene or Mrs. Scoggins for missing the deadline to modify Mr. Keene\u2019s sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">4. Respondent could not visit Keene in jail because of institutional racism in the administration of the detention facility where Keene was housed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">A. Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Under this heading, Respondent posits a justification for failing to visit Keene in jail, after promising multiple times to do so: \u201cdue to racism the institution denied her entry. Ms. Shuler put in numerous requests. If the requests were granted Ms. Shuler would have visited the client. ... Ms. Shuler was denied entry based on her race.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">B. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">Respondent testified at the evidentiary hearing that \u201can employee [of the jail] named April told me directly that she did not believe I\u2019m an attorney. ... She said because my speech sound just like my client. ... So they have their own rules about who they\u2019re going to let into that institution.\u201d Scoggins testified, however, that \u201cI even called myself, to the prison, and they said one thing they don\u2019t do, is refuse an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>inmate visit[ ], even if they on lock-down, from they lawyer.\u201d The hearing judge was entitled to credit Scoggins\u2019s live testimony on this score over Respondent\u2019s uncorroborated and sweeping claims of racism. Moreover, the record does not include any convincing evidentiary support for Respondent\u2019s allegation that the jail personnel prevented Respondent from visiting Keene for improper reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">We overrule this exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">5. Respondent did not refuse intentionally to comply with Bar Counsel\u2019s demands for information.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">A. Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Respondent argues that she did not receive Assistant Bar Counsel\u2019s 25 February 2015 request for comments regarding Keene\u2019s complaint, and that she did not refuse delivery of the second request sent on 24 March 2015. Respondent states that 1) the claim that she refused delivery is \u201cridiculous;\u201d 2) she previously requested that communications be sent by email; and, 3) because of her \u201ctemporary relocation] to North Carolina!,]\u201d she \u201cwas not living at the address the mail[ ] was sent to ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">Respondent argues also that \u201c[she] never refused to answer any questions in April of 2015 about the Keene case and did in fact speak with the investigator who only demanded that she consent to an indefinite suspension.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">Finally, Respondent maintains that she had addressed already the Commission\u2019s July 2015 requests, and that in any event, the 10-day period to respond to \u201cover 100 requests and 50 pages of documents\u201d was burdensome and unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">B. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">Respondent\u2019s express arguments do not overcome the ample evidence in the record from which the hearing judge concluded that she violated Rule 8.1(b), knowingly failing to respond to lawful demands for information from a disciplinary authority. For example, as pointed out in the hearing judge\u2019s conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>sions of law, Respondent stated, in response to a 30 June 2015 request from the Attorney Grievance Commission for information within ten days about Respondent\u2019s representation of Keene, \u201c... because I spent my entire summer dealing with your bogus claims involving Mr. Kevin Wilson [another of her clients], I will not spend my entire summer with this matter. Therefore, it will not be within 10 days that I will review this matter but in September.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">We overrule these exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">SANCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">None of Respondent\u2019s exceptions are sufficient to turn the tide against the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions that Respondent violated Rules 1.1, 1.2(a), 1.3, 1.4(a) and (b), 8.1(b), and 8.4(a), (c), and (d). She does not persuade us that any of the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous, nor do her arguments convince us that the judge drew any legal conclusions without clear and convincing evidence. In consideration of these violations, Bar Counsel \u201crecommends that Respondent be disbarred from the practice of law based on her dishonest conduct, multiple aggravating factors, and her prior disciplinary history.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-7\">In arriving at the appropriate sanction, we are guided by our interest in protecting the public and the public\u2019s confidence in the legal profession. The purpose of [disciplinary] proceedings is not to punish the lawyer, but should deter other lawyers from engaging in similar conduct. The public is protected when we impose sanctions that are commensurate with the nature and gravity of the violations and the intent with which they were committed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-8\"><em>Atty. Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Patton, </em>432 Md. 359, 379, 69 A.3d 11, 23 (2013) (quoting <em>Atty. Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Guida, </em>391 Md. 33, 61, 891 A.2d 1085, 1101 (2006)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-9\">A broad universe of misbehavior is encompassed by MLRPC 8.4(c). Dishonesty is the broadest of the four terms, and encompasses, <em>inter alia, </em>conduct evincing a lack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>of honesty, probity or integrity of principle; [a] lack of fairness and straightforwardness.... Thus, what may not legally be characterized as an act of fraud, deceit or misrepresentation may still evince dishonesty. Clients trust rightfully their attorneys with their most private affairs, and accordingly attorneys must exercise the utmost good faith, fairness, and fidelity towards them. Attorneys violate MLRPC 8.4(c) when they misrepresent to their clients the status of their clients\u2019 cases, or conceal material information from their clients, even if they have not misrepresented explicitly the information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-5\"><em>Atty. Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Thomas, </em>440 Md. 523, 555, 103 A.3d 629, 647-48 (2014) (citations and quotations marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">As discussed above, Respondent engaged in dishonest conduct by failing to follow through on her promises to visit Keene in jail and file motions on his behalf, and by misrepresenting the operation of the five-year deadline for obtaining a disposition hearing on a Motion for Modification of Sentence. She appeared also to fail to recognize that Keene\u2019s prior counsel had filed an unacted-upon sentence modification motion because she spent considerable time promising to prepare and file such a motion. \u201cDisbarment ordinarily should be the sanction for intentional dishonest conduct.\u201d <em>Atty. Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 418, 773 A.2d 463, 488 (2001) (explaining that intentional dishonesty \u201cis closely entwined with the most important matters of basic character to such a degree as to make intentional misconduct by a lawyer almost beyond excuse.\u201d). We have disbarred attorneys for misconduct similar to that engaged in by Respondent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASK\">Concerning the misrepresentation, we find guidance in <em>Atty. Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Lane, </em>367 Md. 633, 790 A.2d 621 (2002), in which we disbarred a lawyer for misrepresentations to his clients. As we described, the lawyer had \u201cfailed to diligently act on his clients\u2019 behalf and he then compounded this failure by engaging in a pattern of deceitful and lying conduct designed to conceal his lack of diligence.\u201d <em>Lane, </em>367 Md. at 647, 790 A.2d at 629, This is similar to what Kane described in his testimony: that London met <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>with him as many as 10 times about the 813 N. Carey Street matter, each time representing that he was working on transferring and filing the deed, but never completed the task. Kane testified: \u201cAfter three to four years of getting the run around from [London], I was able to [complete the transfer myself] within days.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-5\"><em>Atty. Griev. Comm\u2019n v. London, </em>427 Md. 328, 355, 47 A.3d 986, 1002 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Moreover, Respondent disregarded repeatedly the legal needs of, and requests for communication by, Keene and Scoggins. \u201cViolations of MLRPC 8.4(d) may occur when attorneys fail to keep their clients advised of the status of their representation or, more grievously, fail to represent diligently their clients.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>440 Md. at 555, 103 A.3d at 648 (citations omitted). \u201cDisbarment is warranted in cases involving flagrant neglect of client affairs, including the failure to communicate with clients or respond to inquiries from Bar Counsel.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>440 Md. at 558, 103 A.3d at 649 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">In addition to these violations, each of which may warrant disbarment alone, Respondent\u2019s misconduct was compounded by a variety of aggravating factors, including the likelihood of repeating similar misconduct in the future.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-8\">To be sure, a persistent or more egregious course of conduct in violation of our disciplinary rules may lead to much more severe sanctions. We have also recognized that an attorney\u2019s voluntary termination of the misconduct, accompanied by an appreciation of the serious impropriety of that past conduct and remorse for it, is evidence that the attorney will not hereafter engage in such unethical conduct if permitted to continue practice. The likelihood of repetition is a factor to be considered in determining the appropriate sanction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-9\"><em>Atty. Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Paul, </em>423 Md. 268, 285, 31 A.3d 512, 522 (2011) (citations and quotation marks omitted). Here, Respondent engaged repeatedly, without regret or apology, in misconduct. Respondent continues to deny any wrongdoing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>blaming instead her client, her client\u2019s mother, the jail housing her client, employees of the Attorney Grievance Commission, and a variety of alleged personal problems and events, such as bouts of homelessness, illness, and a house fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Illustrating further the prospect of Respondent\u2019s continued transgressions, we suspended her license, in 2015, for similar violations;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-5\">Here, Shuler violated MLRPC 1.3 by failing to act with reasonable diligence to ameliorate her failure to appear at oral argument; MLRPC 1.4(a)(2) by failing to inform Wilson that he had not prevailed in the appeal; and MLRPC 8.4(d) by essentially abandoning her representation of Wilson. The hearing judge found that Shuler was <em>careless\u2014ie., </em>negligent\u2014and that Shuler failed to advance Wilson\u2019s interests and caused him to lose the opportunity to timely petition for writ of <em>certiorari </em>in this Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-7\">As the hearing judge found, Shuler has demonstrated a pattern of misconduct; Wilson\u2019s was the second case in which Shuler both failed to appear at a court date due to illness and failed to sufficiently ameliorate her failure to appear. Although occasionally missing court dates due to illness may be excusable, doing so repeatedly within a five-month period and without sufficient amelioration is not. Despite having been informally admonished by Bar Counsel of the District of Columbia, Shuler once again missed a court date and failed to ameliorate her failure to appear; thus, we must do more than slap Shuler on the wrist to protect the public and to impress upon Shuler the importance of remedying failures to appear and managing health issues so that they do not cause violations of the MLRPC.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Azo\"><em>Atty. Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Shuler, </em>443 Md. 494, 508-510, 117 A.3d 38, 47-48 (2015), <em>reconsideration denied </em>(July 24, 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">Respondent\u2019s history of violating our rules of professional conduct and lack of remorse or ameliorative action suggests that her continuance of the ability to practice law in Maryland represented a grave risk to the public and the legal profession. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we issued a per curiam order disbarring Respondent on 3 April 2017.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b229-10\">. On 1 June 2016, the Court of Appeals adopted (effective 1 July 2016) an order (filed on 6 June 2016) accomplishing, among other things, a reconfiguration and reformatting of the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (renamed the Maryland Attorneys' Rules of Professional Conduct) and Title 16 of the Maryland Rules as new Title 19, Chps. 300 and 700, respectively. The Court\u2019s June 1 Order provided, however, that \"attorneys shall continue on or after July 1, 2016 to be subject to discipline for violations of the current Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct occurring prior to July 1, 2016 ....\u201d Because Shuler\u2019s conduct which is the subject of this case occurred before 1 July 2016, we shall refer in this opinion to the relevant provisions of the Code of Conduct as it existed prior to 1 July 2016.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b230-7\">. In order to comply with the regulatory requirement that the hearing be completed within 120 days of the service upon Respondent of the order designating the judge to hold the hearing in the case, Petitioner requested, and this Court granted, an extension of time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b231-8\">. Respondent filed a Motion for Rehearing on or about 13 April 2017. The Court, by order dated and filed on 4 May 2017, denied that motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b232-8\">. The hearing judge took judicial notice of certain facts appearing on the Maryland Judiciary Case Search engine of the Judiciary\u2019s website regarding these cases, to wit: (1) a Motion for Reconsideration had been filed by Keene, through his counsel at the time, on 9 September 2008, which motion remained unacted upon technically through the time of the evidentiary hearing in the present attorney disciplinary case; and, (2) an Application for Review of Sentence filed concurrently with the Motion for Reconsideration had been denied by a three-judge panel on or about 19 November 2008. Respondent here, it appeared to the hearing judge, had not checked the criminal case files or other available sources to learn of this information in the course of her representation of Keene.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b234-9\">. Scoggins paid, by February 2015, the full additional balance demanded by Respondent,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b236-10\">. Ellipses appear in this opinion to denote where we have deleted supporting citations to the record appearing in the hearing judge's conclusions of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b246-12\">. We are unable to make sense (logically, grammatically, or otherwise) of some of Respondent\u2019s written exceptions, illustrated by her following statement: \u201cThe claims that Ms. Shuler brushed the respondents statement of the 5 years as being misleading.\u201d Additionally, some of Respondent's \u201carguments\" do not even challenge the findings or conclusions of the court. For example, Respondent states that \u201cthe Court cannot find, by clear and convincing evidence that the Respondent was acting as an incompetent attorney when she failed to obtain a hearing on the Review Application,\u201d because, \u201c[b]y the time that Respondent was heard, this was already finally resolved.\u201d This statement is actually an unattributed quotation from the hearing court\u2019s conclusions of law, the relevance of which to Respondent's exceptions arguments is unclear, because the court determined her incompetence for a variety of other reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>We shall not re-imagine Respondent\u2019s exceptions, but rather, like the proverbial Summer rule of golf that directs that one play the ball where and as one finds it, we shall treat largely her exceptions \u201cas is,\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b249-7\">. As noted earlier, the five-year period expired on 14 August 2013, five years after his 14 August 2008 sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b253-10\">. It remains a glaring flaw in Respondent\u2019s array of neglect that she failed to learn that Keene\u2019s prior lawyer had filed, prior to her involvement, a Motion for Reconsideration of Sentence that remained undis-posed. Thus, she could have spared Scoggins and Keene a lot of time, anguish, and fees by simply seeking a timely hearing on that motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b253-11\">. Respondent restates in the heading for this fourth group of factual exceptions her arguments that Keene failed allegedly to pay the legal fee in full, changed frequently his mind about the legal vehicle he wished to pursue, and withheld consent for Shuler to act, preventing her from following through with taking actions on Keene's behalf.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
