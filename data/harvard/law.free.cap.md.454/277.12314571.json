But in the complex field of behavioral disorders, the task of determining whether causation testimony rests on sound science is fraught with potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>pitfalls. This case presents the question of whether studies concluding that lead exposure causes various attention problems constitute a sufficient factual basis for an expert\u2019s testimony that lead caused the plaintiffs Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (\u201cADHD\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Respondent Starlena Stevenson was born on December 22, 1990. For the first ten months of her life, Stevenson lived at 2110 Clifton Avenue in Baltimore City with her mother, Charlena Montgomery, and maternal grandmother, Lorena Cooks. In the fall of 1991, Stevenson and Montgomery moved to 3823 Fairview Avenue (\u201cFairview\u201d), where they lived for 15 months. At the time, Fairview was owned in part by Petitioner Stanley Rochkind. According to Montgomery, Fairview contained chipping and flaking paint on the windowsills, floors, and front porch. Montgomery witnessed Stevenson mouthing the windows at Fairview. In early 1993, Stevenson and her mother moved to an apartment on Pennsylvania Avenue (\u201cPennsylvania\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">In 1992 and 1993, Stevenson\u2019s blood lead level was tested three times. The results were as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">Date Age Blood Lead Level,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Residence</p>\n<p id=\"AMy\">October 29. 1992 1 year, 10 months 14 \u00b5g/dL Fairview</p>\n<p id=\"AlD\">January 8,1993 2 years 13 \u00b5g/dL Fairview</p>\n<p id=\"AB8n\">March 17,1993 2 years, 3 months 11 \u00b5g/dL Pennsylvania</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">[Editor\u2019s Note: The preceding image contains the reference for footnote1].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">When Stevenson was five years old, she was evaluated by Thomas Ley, Ph.D., a psychologist with the Kennedy Krieger Institute, because she was struggling to pay attention in school. Dr. Ley found that Stevenson\u2019s cognitive functioning was within the \u201clow average to borderline range.\u201d He diagnosed Stevenson with ADHD and recommended that she begin taking medication to treat it. Over the next few years, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Stevenson was prescribed Dexedrine, Ritalin, and Adderall to treat her ADHD. In 2004, when she was thirteen years old, Stevenson attempted suicide by cutting her wrists and overdosing on prescription medication. The following year, Stevenson complained of auditory hallucinations and depression. She was evaluated by a psychologist at Mount Washington Pediatric Hospital (\u201cMWPH\u201d) who diagnosed her with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Since graduating from high school in 2008, Stevenson has been sporadically employed. She has worked as a patient transporter for the University of Maryland Medical System (\u201cUMMS\u201d), a cashier for Royal Farms, and a babysitter. Stevenson was fired from her job at UMMS, and she testified that she quit her job at Royal Farms because she was bored. As of October 2014, Stevenson was unemployed.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">In December 2011, Stevenson filed suit against Rochkind in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City for negligence and violations of the Maryland Consumer Protection Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In July 2012, Arc Environmental, Inc. conducted lead testing at Fairview. The testing detected lead-based paint on 22 interior surfaces and nine exterior surfaces. In February 2013, Cecilia Hall-Carrington, M.D., a pediatrician, filed a report concluding to \u201ca reasonable degree of medical probability\u201d that Stevenson was poisoned by lead at Fairview, and that \u201cher lead poisoning is a significant contributing factor\u201d to her neuropsychological problems, including her ADHD.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Before trial, Rochkind filed four motions <em>in limine </em>seeking to exclude Dr. Hall-Carrington\u2019s testimony. He argued that she should not be permitted to testify that Fairview was a source of Stevenson\u2019s lead exposure or that such exposure caused Stevenson\u2019s \u201ccognitive deficits,\u201d including, specifically, ADHD. Rochkind requested a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing on each motion. The court denied his request. After hearing argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>ments on the motions <em>in limine, </em>the court denied them as well. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Stevenson, awarding her $829,000 in economic damages and $534,000 in noneconomic damages. Rochkind filed a motion for a new trial, or, in the alternative, a remittitur. The court granted his motion in part and ordered a new trial on the issue of damages alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The partial new trial began in October 2014, Before trial, Rochkind renewed his motions <em>in limine </em>to exclude Dr. Hall-Carrington\u2019s ADHD testimony, which were again denied. The court declined to hold a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing, explaining that Dr. Hall-Carrington\u2019s opinions are \u201cnot new science\u201d or \u201cnew conclusions.\u201d It admitted her testimony under Maryland Rule 5-702 because it found that she drew from \u201creliable sources.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">During trial, Dr. Hall-Carrington testified as to both general and specific ADHD causation. She explained that studies show that lead exposure can cause \u201cattention problems[ ] or ADHD\u201d generally. She also opined \u201cwithin a reasonable degree of medical probability\u201d that lead exposure caused Stevenson\u2019s ADHD specifically. To support her testimony, Dr. Hall-Carrington relied on a publication from the Environmental Protection Agency reviewing the most recent studies on the effects of lead exposure in children, titled \u201cIntegrated Science Assessment for Lead\u201d (\u201cthe EPA-ISA\u201d). She testified that the EPA-ISA concluded that there is a causal relationship between lead exposure and the symptoms of ADHD, such as attention decrements, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Dr. Hall-Carrington also testified that \u201csome years ago there was a concern with suicide in kids [taking] Adderall.\u201d In closing argument, Stevenson\u2019s counsel implied that Stevenson\u2019s depression and hallucinations were side effects of her ADHD medications, including Adderall.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">The jury awarded Stevenson $753,000 in economic damages and $700,000 in noneconomic damages. Due to the statutory cap on noneconomic damages, the court reduced the total judgment to $1,103,000. <em>See </em>Md. Code (1986, 2013 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 11-108 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Roehkind filed a motion for a new trial, which the court denied. He filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The Court of Special Appeals held that the trial court did not err in failing to hold a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing on Dr. Hall-Carrington\u2019s general causation testimony because the studies she relied upon did not reach novel conclusions and \u201cused methodologies that are generally accepted\u201d in the scientific community. <em>Rochkind v. Stevenson, </em>229 Md.App. 422, 464, 145 A.3d 570 (2016). The intermediate appellate court also held that the trial court properly admitted Dr. Hall-Carrington\u2019s specific causation testimony under Rule 5-702 because her opinion \u201cwas supported by an adequate factual basis and was sufficient to allow the jury to decide the causal connection, if any, between lead exposure and [ ] Stevenson\u2019s ADHD.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 465, 145 A.3d 570. Roehkind appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">We granted <em>certiorari </em>to answer the following questions:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-7\">1. Did the trial court err in admitting Dr. Hall-Carring-ton\u2019s general and specific ADHD causation testimony under Maryland Rule 5-702?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-8\">2. Did the trial court err in failing to hold a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing on Dr. Hall-Carrington\u2019s general ADHD causation testimony?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Because we answer the first question in the affirmative, we reverse the decision of the Court of Special Appeals and remand for a new trial on the issue of damages. Therefore, we do not reach the second question.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Rochkind challenges the trial court\u2019s decision to admit Dr. Hall-Carrington\u2019s expert testimony on the causal relationship between lead exposure and ADHD. \u201c[T]he admissibility of expert testimony is a matter largely within the discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Bryant v. State, </em>393 Md. 196, 203, 900 A.2d 227 (2006) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, we review a trial court\u2019s decision to admit or exclude expert testimony only for an abuse of discretion. <em>Rollins v. State, </em>392 Md. 455, 499-500, 897 A.2d 821 (2006). \u201cSuch a ruling, however, may be reversed on appeal if it is founded on an error of law or some serious mistake, or if the trial court clearly abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Sippio v. State, </em>350 Md. 633, 648, 714 A.2d 864 (1998) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Additionally, we will not affirm a decision within the discretion of the trial court if the judge acts in an \u201carbitrary or capricious manner\u201d or \u201cbeyond the letter or reason of the law.\u201d <em>Gary v. Gary, </em>393 Md. 225, 238, 900 A.2d 739 (2006) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Rochkind argues that Dr. Hall-Carrington\u2019s testimony should have been excluded because it failed to meet the requirements of both Maryland Rule 5-702 and our <em>Frye-Reed </em>standard for testimony based on a novel scientific theory. Rule 5-702 governs the admissibility of all expert testimony. <em>Reed v. State, </em>283 Md. 374, 391 A.2d 364 (1978), which adopted the standard set forth by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in <em>Frye v. United States, </em>293 F. 1013 (D.C. Cir, 1923), added an additional requirement for expert testimony based on a novel scientific method. Under <em>Frye-Reed, </em>a trial court must determine whether a novel scientific method is generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>accepted within the relevant scientific community before testimony based on that method can be admitted. <em>Reed, </em>283 Md. at 381, 391 A.2d 364. Stevenson contends that Dr. Hall-Carrington\u2019s testimony was properly admitted because it clears both hurdles. We begin with Rule 5-702.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Maryland Rule 5-702</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">To determine whether expert testimony \u201cwill assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,\u201d Rule 5-702 directs a trial court to evaluate \u201c(1) whether the witness is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education[;] (2) the appropriateness of the expert testimony on the particular subject[;] and (3) whether a sufficient factual basis exists to support the expert testimony.\u201d The burden rests with the proponent of the expert testimony to demonstrate that these requirements have been met. <em>Bomas v. State, </em>412 Md. 392, 417-18, 987 A.2d 98 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">We have interpreted the third prong of this analysis\u2014sufficient factual basis\u2014to include two subfactors: an adequate supply of data and a reliable methodology. <em>Roy v. Dackman, </em>446 Md. 23, 42-43, 124 A.3d 169 (2015) (citation omitted); <em>see also Exxon Mobil Corp, v. Ford, </em>433 Md. 426, 478, 71 A.3d 105 (2013). To constitute \u201cmore than mere speculation or conjecture,\u201d the expert\u2019s opinion must be based on facts sufficient to \u201cindicate the use of reliable principles and methodology in support of the expert\u2019s conclusions.\u201d <em>Ford, </em>433 Md. at 478, 71 A.3d 105 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). To demonstrate a sufficient factual basis, an expert must establish that her testimony is supported by both subfactors.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">The data supporting an expert\u2019s testimony \u201cmay arise from a number of sources, such as facts obtained from the expert\u2019s first-hand knowledge, facts obtained from the testimony of others, and facts related to an expert through the use of hypothetical questions.\u201d <em>Sippio, </em>350 Md. at 653, 714 A.2d 864 (citation omitted). The facts or data that form the basis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>the expert\u2019s opinion may be \u201cperceived by or made known to the expert at or before the hearing.\u201d Md. Rule 5-703(a), If the materials the expert relies upon are \u201cof a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions or inferences upon the subject,\u201d they do not need to be admissible in evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">In addition to drawing from an adequate supply of data, an expert must use a reliable methodology to reach her conclusions. <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Albright, </em>433 Md. 303, 418-19, 71 A.3d 30 (2013) (citation omitted). To satisfy this prong, \u201can expert opinion must provide a sound reasoning process for inducing its conclusion from the factual data and must have an adequate theory or rational explanation of how the factual data led to the expert\u2019s conclusion.\u201d <em>Ford, </em>433 Md. at 481, 71 A.3d 105 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We have explained that \u201cfor an opinion to assist a trier of fact, the trier of fact must be able to evaluate the reasoning underlying that opinion.\u201d <em>Ross v. Horn. Auth. of Balt. City, </em>430 Md. 648, 663, 63 A.3d 1 (2013). Thus, conclusory statements of opinion are not sufficient\u2014the expert must be able to articulate a reliable methodology for how she reached her conclusion. <em>Ford, </em>433 Md. at 481-82, 71 A.3d 105 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Rochkind argues that Dr. Hall-Carrington\u2019s specific causation testimony does not satisfy Rule 5-702(3) because she did not rule out other potential causes of Stevenson\u2019s ADHD or otherwise demonstrate a reliable methodology for her opinion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Rochkind contends that in lieu of a differential diagnosis, Dr. Hall-Carrington was required to cite epidemiological studies that found a causal link between lead and ADHD. Stevenson responds that Dr. Hall-Carrington\u2019s testimony satisfies Rule 5-702(3) because the studies she relied upon provide extensive support for the conclusion that lead can cause attention deficits in children.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\n<em>Adequate Supply of Data</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">To support her testimony that lead exposure can cause ADHD, Dr. Hall-Carrington relied on the EPA-ISA paper, which explains that \u201cmultiple, high quality epidemiologic studies\u201d have revealed \u201ca causal relationship between [lead] exposure and attention decrements, impulsivity, and hyperactivity in children.\u201d U.S. Envtl, Prot. Agency, EPA/600/R-10/075F, Integrated Science Assessment for Lead 4-314 tbl. 4-17, 4-289 (2013) [hereinafter EPA-ISA], https://www.epa. gov/isa/integrated-science-assessment-isa-lead (follow \u201cPDF\u201d hyperlink) [https://perma.cc/ECQ7-TFWS]. During the second trial, Dr. Hall-Carrington testified that these studies found that children with blood lead levels similar to Stevenson\u2019s \u201ccan have attention problems, or ADHD, as well as learning disabilities.\u201d When asked if this portion of the EPA-ISA mentions ADHD specifically, she testified, \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t.\u201d She continued, \u201cIt basically is listing the symptoms, so to speak, of ADHD.\u201d As to Stevenson\u2019s ADHD specifically, Dr. Hall-Carrington testified that it was caused by her exposure to lead.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">We have yet to decide the extent to which epidemiological studies can support expert testimony on causation. Thus, we look to other jurisdictions for guidance. In <em>General Electric Co. v. Joiner, </em>522 U.S. 136, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997), the U.S. Supreme Court evaluated expert testimony relying on epidemiological studies for the conclusion that polychlorinated biphenyls (\u201cPCB\u2019s\u201d) can cause lung cancer.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 145-46, 118 S.Ct. 512. The Court held that the studies could not support the expert testimony because none of them had found a causal link between PCB\u2019s and cancer. <em>Id. </em>As to one study that noted that lung cancer deaths among former employees of an electrical plant were higher than expected, the Court explained that \u201c[g]iven that [the researchers] were unwilling to say that PCB exposure had caused cancer among the workers they examined, their study did not support the experts\u2019 conclusion that Joiner\u2019s exposure to PCB\u2019s caused his cancer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 145, 118 S.Ct. 512. The Court explained that \u201cnothing in ... the Federal Rules of Evidence requires a district court to admit opinion evidence that is connected to existing data only by the <em>ipse dixit </em>of the expert.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 146, 118 S.Ct. 512. Rather, the Court reasoned, a \u201ccourt may conclude that there is simply too great an analytical gap between the data and the opinion proffered.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Blackwell v. Wyeth, </em>408 Md. 575, 606-10, 971 A.2d 235 (2009) (evaluating whether expert testimony suffered from \u201canalytical gap\u201d under our <em>Frye-Reed </em>framework); <em>Mitchell v. Gencorp Inc., </em>165 F.3d 778, 782-83 (10th Cir. 1999) (holding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>expert testimony suffered from \u201can analytical gap\u201d when studies only supported a connection between the chemical agent and the plaintiffs leukemia, not a causal relationship (quoting <em>Joiner, </em>522 U.S. at 146, 118 S.Ct. 512)).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Dr. Hall-Carrington did not provide a sufficient factual foundation for why she thought the EPA-ISA supported her conclusion that lead exposure can cause ADHD. The studies described in the EPA-ISA finding a causal relationship between lead exposure and attention deficits and hyperactivity do not go that far. The American Psychiatric Association\u2019s <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders </em>(\u201cthe <em>DSM-V\u2019) </em>lists several criteria for an ADHD diagnosis, including that the patient exhibit a minimum number of specific symptoms \u201cfor at least [six] months to a degree that is inconsistent with [the patient\u2019s] developmental level and that negatively impacts directly on [the patient\u2019s] social and academic/occupational activities.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Am. Psychiatric Ass\u2019n, <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders </em>59 (5th ed. 2013) [hereinafter <em>DSM-V]. </em>Dr. Hall-Carrington did not provide any information on this diagnostic criteria or otherwise differentiate between general attention deficits and a clinical ADHD diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Although research shows that lead exposure can cause general attention deficits and hyperactivity, these lead-caused behaviors do not necessarily indicate that an individual has ADHD because these behaviors are also symptoms of a variety of other disorders and learning disabilities. <em>See id. </em>at 63-65; Nat\u2019l Inst, of Mental Health, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactiv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>ity Disorder (ADHD): The Basics, https://www.nimh.nih.gov/ health/publications/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd-the-basics/index.shtml (follow \u201cDownload PDF\u201d hyperlink) [https://perma.cc/89RV-AGRQ]; <em>Guckenberger v. Boston Univ., </em>974 F.Supp. 106, 131 (D. Mass. 1997). Indeed, the <em>DSM-V </em>instructs clinicians to rule out several other behavioral disorders with similar symptoms before diagnosing a child with ADHD, <em>DSM-V </em>at 63-65. Clearly, general attention deficits and ADHD are not one and the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The jump from attention deficits and hyperactivity to a clinical ADHD diagnosis may seem reasonable, but we have explained that \u201cjust because a conclusion is reasonable does not mean that a court must permit an expert to make it.\u201d <em>Ross, </em>430 Md. at 664, 63 A.3d 1. Because of the added weight a jury might give to testimony from a designated expert, the trial court \u201cought to insist that a proffered expert bring to the jury more than the lawyers can offer in argument.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). In equating attention deficits and hyperactivity with a clinical ADHD diagnosis, Dr. Hall-Carrington painted an inaccurate picture of the scientific research regarding lead poisoning\u2014she overstated the known effects of lead exposure. Her testimony suffers from the same \u201canalytical gap\u201d described in <em>Joiner.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">To be sure, the EPA-ISA includes discussion of studies exploring the relationship between lead exposure and ADHD specifically,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but these cannot bolster Dr. Hall-Carrington\u2019s opinion because they only reveal an association between lead exposure and ADHD. The EPA-ISA explains that an association\u2014a statistical relationship between two variables\u2014\u201cis insufficient proof of a causal relationship between an exposure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>and a health outcome.\u201d EPA-ISA at li. The Supreme Court of West Virginia has explained that determining the \u201csoundness of an epidemiological study and its [usefulness] in resolving causation\u201d requires evaluating whether the study reveals a causal relationship between the chemical agent and the disease. <em>Harris v. CSX Transp., Inc., </em>232 W.Va. 617, 753 S.E.2d 275, 282 (2013) (citing Michael D. Green et al., <em>Reference Guide on Epidemiology, in </em>Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence 549, 553 (3d ed. 2011)). Similarly, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington has explained that epidemiological studies are \u201cprobative of general causation\u201d when \u201cthe study properly accounts for potential confounding factors and concludes that exposure to the agent is what increases the probability of contracting the disease.\u201d <em>Henricksen v. ConocoPhillips Co., </em>605 F.Supp.2d 1142, 1158 (E.D. Wash. 2009) (emphasis omitted) (citation omitted). The ADHD studies summarized in the EPA-ISA do not meet this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Indeed, the EPA-ISA explains that in declaring a causal relationship between lead exposure and attention deficits, impulsivity, and hyperactivity, studies finding a lead-associated increase in ADHD were \u201cnot a major consideration\u201d because of \u201cinconsistent consideration for potential confounding by factors such as [socioeconomic status], parental education, or parental caregiving quality.\u201d EPA-ISA at 4-289-90. The EPA-ISA also notes that ADHD is \u201cconsidered to have a strong familial component\u201d and that studies revealing an association between lead exposure and ADHD have been critiqued for failing to take parental history of ADHD into account. <em>Id. </em>at 4-151 (citations omitted). Thus, without accounting for potential confounding factors, including family history of ADHD, these epidemiological studies cannot support Dr. Hall-Carrington\u2019s general causation testimony.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See Henricksen, </em>605 F.Supp.2d at 1158 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Apart from the EPA-ISA, Dr. Hall-Carrington did not cite to any other studies to support her opinion that lead exposure can cause ADHD.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Without scientific evidence, Dr. Hall-Carrington cannot be permitted to testify that such a causal connection exists generally, or that lead exposure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>caused Stevenson\u2019s ADHD specifically.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See Bomas, </em>412 Md. at 420, 987 A.2d 98 (holding expert testimony on eyewitness identification properly excluded when the \u201cwitness offered nothing to support his general statements\u201d).

Carroll, </em>355 Md. 312, 338, 734 A.2d 697 (1999). Thus, Stevenson failed to carry her burden of demonstrating that Dr. Hall-Carrington had an adequate supply of data to support her general causation testimony. Accordingly, her testimony is not admissible under Rule 5-702(3). We do not reach the question of whether Dr. Hall-Carrington utilized a reliable methodology to formulate her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>In sum, the trial court failed to determine whether Stevenson\u2019s proffered sources logically supported Dr. Hall-Carrington\u2019s opinion that lead exposure can cause ADHD. In other words, it failed to check for an \u201canalytical gap\u201d between the expert\u2019s data and her conclusion. Because we find that the trial court clearly erred in this respect, we hold that it abused its discretion in admitting the expert testimony.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See Roy, </em>445 Md. at 40,124 A.3d 169 (reversing the trial court\u2019s decision to exclude expert testimony because it constituted \u201ca clear abuse of discretion\u201d); <em>Albright, </em>433 Md. at 424, 71 A.3d 30 (\u201cBecause the trial court\u2019s admission of [the expert] testimony was clear error, we ... direct remand for a new trial.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\"><em>Frye-Reed </em>Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Rochkind argues that the trial court should have held a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing as to Dr. Hall-Carrington\u2019s general causation testimony because the existence of a causal link between lead exposure and ADHD is novel, and it is not generally accepted in the scientific community.

Thus, the trial court abused its discretion in permitting her to opine that lead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>exposure can cause ADHD generally and that lead caused Stevenson\u2019s ADHD specifically.

Did the CSA err by conducting its <em>own, </em>non-adversarial <em>Frye-Reed </em>analysis on whether lead exposure causes ADHD rather than remanding to the Circuit Court for an adversarial evidentiary hearing, which would have demonstrated that the EPA publication upon which the CSA exclusively relied is (i) controversial, (ii) subject to heavy criticism, and (iii) not accepted in the medical community?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-12\">3. Did the CSA err when it failed to apply the \"reliable methodology\u201d requirement of Rule 5-702 to Dr. Hall-Carrington\u2019s opinion that lead exposure \"caused\" Stevenson\u2019s ADHD (specific causation)?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b313-7\">, Rochkind does not argue that Dr. Hall-Carrington\u2019s general causation testimony fails to satisfy Rule 5-702\u2014he urges us to exclude that testimony under <em>Frye-Reed, </em>But both general and specific causation testimony are subject to Rule 5-702, and Dr. Hall-Carrington\u2019s specific causation testimony relies on the admissibility of her general causation testimony. If she cannot testify that lead exposure can cause ADHD, she cannot testify that lead exposure caused Stevenson's ADHD. <em>See In re Mirena IUD Prods, Liab.

Rather, like the EPA-ISA, they describe a connection between lead exposure and general attention problems. <em>See </em>Robert Kliegman et al., Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics 2914 (18th ed. 2007) (\"Hyperactivity is noted in young school age children with histories of lead poisoning or with concurrent elevations in [blood lead level].\"); Comm, on Envtl.
