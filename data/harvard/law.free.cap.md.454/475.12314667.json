At the heart of this appeal is whether White Flint Express Realty Group Limited Partnership, LLLP (\u201cWhite Flint\u201d), respondent, was entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees expended in connection with an action to enforce the contract between White Flint and Bainbridge St. Elmo Bethesda Apartments, LLC (\u201cBainbridge\u201d), petitioner. The Court of Special Appeals held that the contract provided expressly for attorney\u2019s fees to be recovered in a first-party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>indemnification action. <em>Bainbridge St. Elmo Bethesda Apartments, LLC v.

Penske Truck Leasing Co., </em>405 Md. 435 [952 A.2d 275] (2008), concerning the limited circumstances under which a contractual indemnity provision can be read as a first-party fee shifting provision overriding the American Rule that each party bears its own attorneys\u2019 fees?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Apn\">Petition for Writ of Cert., <em>Bainbridge St. Elmo Bethesda Apartments, LLC v.

We shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, and hold that the contract contains express provisions authorizing first-party fee shifting, entitling White Flint to attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"AiZ\">\n<em>i\u2014i</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AGM\">Bainbridge, an entity formed by the Bainbridge Companies to manage the construction and operation of a new 17-story high rise apartment building in Bethesda, owns the property immediately adjacent to 4905 and 4909 Fairmont Avenue (\u201cthe Fairmont Properties\u201d). Located on the Fairmont Properties were two one-story concrete buildings owned by White Flint that were leased to a restaurant and a children\u2019s dance studio. Bainbridge engaged sub-contractor Turner to build the 17-story apartment building on its property for an estimated cost of $45,000,000. The construction project required excavation of a 50-foot-deep hole on the property, to be held open by steel cables protruding under and onto White Flint\u2019s property<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>prevent soil and sub-surface structures from moving toward or into the excavation area. Bainbridge sought an easement from White Flint for access to the space \u201cunder, over, across and on the Fairmont Properties.\u201d Bainbridge also wanted additional easements to swing a crane and extend scaffolding above the Fairmont properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">On September 7, 2011, after several months of negotiation, and before construction began, Bainbridge and White Flint entered into a \u201cCrane Swing, Tie Back and Swing Scaffold Easement Agreement\u201d (\u201cthe Agreement\u201d). Bainbridge agreed to pay White Flint $425,000 as consideration for the Agreement and the requested easements.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The Agreement recognized Bainbridge\u2019s right to access the air space above and the ground below White Flint\u2019s Property, and it provided White Flint a means to seek redress for any potential damage from the construction. Under Article 3, Bainbridge promised that it would not use a \u201cpile-drive\u201d system to secure the hole, and would follow the appended plan\u2019s use of tie-backs and bracket piles placed into pre-drilled holes. Article 7 provided that Bainbridge would ensure that all excavation and foundation work conformed to applicable professional standards of care while minimizing the inconvenience to White Flint, would protect all individuals in and around the properties, and would not undermine the improvements on the Fairmont Properties. In Article 9 of the Agreement, Bain-bridge agreed to permit White Flint to engage, at Bain-bridge\u2019s expense, consultants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">\u201c[T]o monitor performance of the work by Bainbridge, and identify any perceived deficiencies that could result in injury to people occupying or visiting any part of the White Flint Property, or in damage to the White Flint Property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3N\">If White Flint\u2019s consultants identified a Major Deficiency (over $25,000), Bainbridge had the right to have its own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>consultant \u201creview and assess the perceived Major Deficiency.\u201d Article 9 provided that if Bainbridge\u2019s consultants did not agree with White Flint\u2019s consultants as to a perceived Major Deficiency, the parties were obligated to \u201cwork together in good faith to find a mutually acceptable resolution.\u201d And then if a resolution could not be reached within 60 days, the dispute would be submitted to binding arbitration. Finally, Article 9 included a fee-shifting agreement specifying that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-4\">\u201cThe prevailing party in any arbitration shall be awarded reasonable counsel fees, expert and non-expert witness costs and expenses and all other costs and costs and expenses reasonably incurred, directly or indirectly, in connection with said arbitration, and all costs and fees of such arbitration shall be borne exclusively by the non-prevailing party.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Article 16 established Bainbridge\u2019s responsibility to either repair and restore White Flint\u2019s property to its original condition or reimburse White Flint for doing so. Article 17(a)-(b) provided that Bainbridge would pay White Flint $425,000 upon entering into the Agreement, and established an escrow account to reimburse White Flint for costs associated with negotiating and monitoring Bainbridge\u2019s compliance with the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Most relevant to the present appeal is Article 19, the indemnification clause of the contract, which provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-7\">\u201cIndemnity. Bainbridge hereby indemnifies, and agrees to defend and hold harmless White Flint ... from any and all claims, demands, debts, actions, causes of action, suits, obligations, losses, costs, expenses, fees, and liabilities (including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, disbursements, and litigation costs) arising from or in connection with Bainbridge\u2019s breach of any terms of this Agreement or injuries to persons or property resulting from the Work, or the activities of Bainbridge or its employees, agents, contractors, or affiliates conducted on or about the White Flint Property, including without limitation, for any rent loss directly attributable to any damage to the White Flint Property caused by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>the construction of the Project, however Bainbridge shall not be liable for matters resulting from the negligence or intentional misconduct of White Flint, its agents, employees, or contractors. The indemnification obligations set forth herein shall survive the termination of this Agreement indefinitely.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">During the Project\u2019s excavation stage, White Flint\u2019s experts detected damage to White Flint\u2019s Property, alerted Bain-bridge to the damage, and asked for assurances that the damage would be remedied. White Flint claimed that Bain-bridge and its contractors did not drill the holes properly for the steel beams, resulting in soil loss beneath the Fairmont Properties, and that pile-drivers were used instead of drills to install the steel beams, in contravention of the express language of the Agreement. White Flint complained that the use of the pile-driver caused the buildings to shake, causing additional damage and soil movement underneath the buildings. By February 2012, the owner of the children\u2019s dance studio on White Flint\u2019s property reported seeing numerous cracks in the walls, that she feared a roof collapse on her students, and that many parents would not bring their children to class until she received assurances by Montgomery County that the building was safe.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Turner, Bainbridge\u2019s general contractor for the Project, stopped the excavation and braced White Flint\u2019s buildings to prevent further damage. Bainbridge hired a structural engineer, Allyn Kilsheimer, who on February 27, 2012, advised that Turner should \u201c[plerform no additional construction work within 20 horizontal feet\u201d of the White Flint Property, other than work necessary to stabilize the site. He recommended evacuation of the White Flint building and that it remain unoccupied for precautionary purposes until the completion of the investigation. Because of building movement and damage, on March 7, 2012, Montgomery County stopped all but safety work on the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">In response to Mr. Kilsheimer\u2019s recommendation, White Flint determined that Bainbridge was in breach of Article 7 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>the Agreement, terminating the Agreement for material breach. White Flint alleged that Bainbridge had known beforehand that White Flint should expect damages to its property because the sheeting and shoring system was designed to move. Further, White Flint alleged that Bainbridge\u2019s work did not conform to the plans and specifications because it used pile drivers instead of drills to install the steel beams.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Bainbridge, in a letter to White Flint, represented that it had \u201cobserved and honored each of its obligations\u201d and that White Flint\u2019s termination of the contract was itself a material breach. Bainbridge invited White Flint to engage in a confidential settlement discussion on repairing the properties and making White Flint whole. White Flint declined to participate, and in response, Bainbridge disclaimed any further ongoing contractual duties to White Flint, including its duties to repair the property and indemnify White Flint under Article 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">On April 24, 2012, White Flint filed a complaint for declaratory relief claiming that Articles 16, 17, and 19 survived the contract\u2019s termination and that Bainbridge was bound to comply with those obligations. The Project\u2019s primary insurer, Liberty Mutual, made an interim payment of $191,005 to White Flint for the losses it had quantified to that date, including the lost rent projected through February 2013 ($149, 685), third-party legal fees ($23,008), and parking charges ($18,312).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">On September 18, 2012, Bainbridge submitted a settlement proposal to White Flint, which rejected the proposal, arguing that Bainbridge offered only a small cash sum and the prospect that Bainbridge\u2019s insurer would address White Flint\u2019s claim at an uncertain date in the future. Following its rejection of the settlement proposal, White Flint filed its first of six amended complaints<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to add breach of contract and tort claims and added Turner and Schnabel Foundation Company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>(\u201cSchnabel\u201d), Turner\u2019s sheeting and shoring subcontractor, as defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">On November 25, 2013, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County granted White Flint partial summary judgment on most claims and entered a declaratory judgment finding: that Bainbridge\u2019s obligations survived the termination, that Bain-bridge materially breached the agreement, and that Bain-bridge had continuing duties to White Flint. And, significantly, the circuit court found that under Article 19 of the Agreement, White Flint was entitled to attorney\u2019s fees. Concerning the award of attorney\u2019s fees, the circuit court reasoned that <em>Nova Research, Inc. v. Penske Truck Leasing Co,, </em>405 Md. 435, 952 A.2d 275 (2008), did not require an indemnity provision to \u201csay enforce first party claims...\u201d to authorize first-party fee shifting. The circuit court examined Article 19 and concluded that White Flint was entitled to recover attorney\u2019s fees because the \u201clanguage and structure\u201d of Article 19 authorized first-party fee indemnity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">After the circuit court\u2019s partial summary judgment order, four issues remained for trial: (1) negligent misrepresentation and fraud, (2) compensatory damages, (3) punitive damages, and (4) the amount of attorney\u2019s fees and expenses. The parties settled the issues of liability and damages, reserving the award of attorney\u2019s fees and expenses.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The circuit court held a hearing on the fee petition, and on April 7, 2014, the court awarded White Flint $3,520,256.59 in attorney\u2019s fees, and $411,391.88 in costs and expenses, for a total of $3,931,648.47.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Bainbridge appealed the fee award. The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, affirmed. <em>Bainbridge, </em>2016 WL 1321205, at *6. The Court of Special Appeals concluded that <em>Nova Research\u2019s </em>rejection of first-party fee shifting was not controlling, based on two primary grounds: (1) that \u201cunlike <em>Nova Research, </em>the contract litigation in the present case was for enforcement of the agreement, not the determination of a right to indemnity,\u201d and (2) that the inclusion of the words \u201cattorney\u2019s fees\u201d in Article 19, together with a reference to damages \u201carising out of ... breach\u201d constituted an express provision authorizing first-party fee shifting as required by <em>Nova Research. Id. </em>at *6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">We granted Bainbridge\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari, appealing solely the issue of whether the Agreement entitled White Flint to recover first-party attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Bainbridge, </em>449 Md. at 408, 144 A.3d at 704.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Before this Court, Bainbridge argues that Article 19, the indemnity clause of the Agreement, does not authorize an award of attorney\u2019s fees in first-party actions and supports an award of attorney\u2019s fees only for third-party actions. Relying on <em>Nova Research </em>for the proposition that an indemnity provision such as Article 19 must unmistakably and specifically authorize a first-party attorney\u2019s fee award in the context of the contract as a whole, Bainbridge maintains that the language of Article 19 addresses third-party claims against which Bainbridge is to \u201cdefend\u201d and to \u201chold harmless,\u201d negating any suggestion that Article 19 was intended to indemnify White Flint for fees in a first-party action for any breach of the Agreement. In support of this argument, Bainbridge looks to Article 9, in which the parties expressly and unmistakably agreed to resolve first-party disputes, and included a \u201cprevailing party\u201d fee-shifting clause. Concluding, Bainbridge states that Article 9\u2019s express first-party fee-shifting provision is incompatible with the interpretation that Article 19 can be read to indemnify White Flint for first-party fees in litigation over construction-related damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>White Fhnt, on the other hand, argues that Article 19\u2019s clear language and structure, along with the business context in which the Agreement was reached, support the trial court and intermediate appellate court\u2019s holdings that an award of attorney\u2019s fees was proper under that clause. Bainbridge breached the Agreement, severely damaging White Flint\u2019s property, forcing White Flint to incur substantial attorney\u2019s fees, disbursements and costs, and the need to file a claim for the breach of contract. White Flint maintains that \u201cthe express indemnity in Section 19 of the parties\u2019 Crane Swing, Tie Back and Swing Scaffold Easement Agreement ... clearly and unambiguously requires Petitioner Bainbridge St. Elmo Bethesda Apartments, LLC ... to reimburse Respondent White Flint Express Realty Group Limited Partnership LLLP ... for the attorney\u2019s fees [first-party claim] caused by Bainbridge\u2019s breaches of contract.\u201d Resp. Br. at 2. White Flint points to Article 19\u2019s language that states explicitly that White Flint may recover \u201cany and all ... losses, costs, expenses, fees, and liabilities (including <em>attorney\u2019s fees, </em>disbursements, and litigation costs) arising from or in connection with Bain-bridge\u2019s breach of any terms of this agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In sum, White Flint maintains that the very purpose of the Agreement was to ensure that White Flint would be made whole if Bainbridge breached and injured White Flint, and that would include attorney\u2019s fees (under the indemnity clause) incurred to enforce the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">h\u2014f (\u2014\u00cd</p>\n<p id=\"b511-3\">The issue at the heart of this case is the interpretation of the contractual agreement between petitioner and respondent as to the entitlement of attorney\u2019s fees in this action. The interpretation of a written contract is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. Atlantic Contracting &amp; Material Co., Inc. v. Ulico Cas. Co., </em>380 Md. 285, 300-01, 844 A.2d 460, 468-69 (2004). We apply the objective interpretation of contracts. <em>Id. </em>at 301, 844 A.2d at 469. In interpreting the meaning of a contract, we consider \u201cthe customary, ordinary, and accepted meaning of the language used.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>omitted). We interpret the language of the contract in context, looking at \u201cthe entire language of the agreement, not merely a portion thereof.\u201d <em>Jones v, Hubbard, </em>356 Md. 513, 534, 740 A.2d 1004, 1016 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Maryland follows the common law American Rule, which states that, generally, a prevailing party is not awarded attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Nova Research, </em>405 Md. at 445, 952 A.2d at 281. <em>See also </em>11 Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 57.9 (2005) (stating that \u201c[u]nder the prevailing American rule, legal fees in an action against the breaching party cannot be recovered.\u201d). Under the American Rule there is a fundamental distinction \u201cbetween the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees incurred in defending against [a] third-party claim and those expended in prosecuting a claim against the indemnitor,\u201d <em>Nova Research, </em>405 Md. at 453, 952 A.2d at 283 (quoting Philip L, Bruner &amp; Patrick J. O\u2019Connor, Jr., 3 Construction Law \u00a7 10:51 (2007)). In <em>Peter Fabrics, Inc. v. S.S. Hermes, </em>765 F.2d 306 (2d Cir. 1985), the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit articulated clearly the reason for the distinction between attorney\u2019s fees in third-party actions versus first-party actions, explaining as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-5\">\u201cIndemnity obligations, whether imposed by contract or by law, require the indemnitor to hold the indemnitee harmless from costs in connection with a particular class of claims. Legal fees and expenses incurred in defending an indemnified claim are one such cost and thus fall squarely within the obligation to indemnify. Consequently, attorney\u2019s fees incurred in defending against liability claims are included as part of an indemnity obligation implied by law, ... and reimbursement of such fees is presumed to have been the intent of the draftsman unless the agreement explicitly says otherwise .... Such reasoning does not apply to fees and expenses incurred in establishing the existence of an obligation to indemnify, since such expenses are not by their nature a part of the claim indemnified against. Rather, they are costs incurred in suing for a breach of contract, to wit, the failure to indemnify. As such, fees and expenses incurred in establishing the indemnity obligation fall within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>the ordinary rule requiring a party to bear his own expenses of litigation, <em>see </em>Berger, <em>Court Awarded Attorneys\u2019 Fees: What is \"Reasonable\u201d?, </em>126 U.Pa.L.Rev. 281, 281 (1977). <em>Cf. </em>5 Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 1037 (1964) (attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses may be recovered if they constitute damages from the breach of a contract but not if they are incurred in proving the breach).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 316 (some internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">There are four exceptions to the American Rule where a prevailing party may be awarded attorney\u2019s fees: \u201c(1) the parties to a contract have an agreement to that effect, (2) there is a statute that allows the imposition of such fees, (3) the wrongful conduct of a defendant forces a plaintiff into litigation with a third party, or (4) a plaintiff is forced to defend against a malicious prosecution.\u201d <em>Nova Research, </em>405 Md. at 445, 952 A.2d at 281 (quoting <em>Thomas v. Gladstone, </em>386 Md. 693, 699, 874 A.2d 434, 437 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The present certiorari question is predicated upon this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Nova Research </em>and its discussion on the first exception to the American Rule, <em>ie., </em>the parties have a contractual agreement to shift attorney\u2019s fees. In <em>Nova Research, </em>we considered the question of whether the parties\u2019 contract provision for indemnification included first-party attorney\u2019s fees, where the contract language did not provide expressly for the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees. We held that the attorney\u2019s fees expended by Penske in establishing the right to indemnification were not recoverable. <em>Nova Research, </em>405 Md. at 458, 952 A.2d at 289. We explained that the question of whether first-party attorney\u2019s fees are covered under the contract is determined by basic contract interpretation principles in order to determine the scope of the indemnification provision and whether the clause covers first-party enforcement rights. <em>Id. </em>at 449, 952 A.2d at 284. We noted as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-7\">\u201cThe scope of indemnification is a matter of contract interpretation, and as such may or may not include attorneys\u2019 fees in first party enforcement actions, in addition to the standard allowance of attorney\u2019s fees in defense of suits by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>third parties. This concept is expressed in DAN B. DOBBS, LAW OF REMEDIES \u00a7 3:10(3) n,5 (2d Ed. 1993), which states that \u2018[wjhether the contract covers only fee costs incurred in third party litigation or also covers fee costs incurred in litigation between the parties themselves is of course a question to be answered by interpretation of the contract.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-4\"><em>Id. See also </em>Howard O. Hunter, Modern Law of Contracts \u00a7 18.3 (March 2017) (stating that whether a party is entitled by contract to recover attorney\u2019s fees in enforcing the fee-shifting provision is a matter of contract interpretation).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">While <em>Nova Research </em>leads courts to look at the terms of the contract to decide whether the parties agreed expressly that attorney\u2019s fees would be recoverable in a first-party action, we nonetheless made clear that as such an agreement invokes an exception to the American Rule, under which parties ordinarily bear their own counsel fees, the agreement must be based upon express terms and cannot be found by implication or inference. <em>Nova Research, </em>405 Md. at 451, 952 A.2d at 289.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In other words, in order to preserve the distinction between third and first party claims, the underlying purpose behind the American Rule, attorney\u2019s fees provisions \u201cmust be strictly construed to avoid inferring duties that the parties did not intend to create. ...\u201d Robert L. Rossi, Attorneys\u2019 Fees \u00a7 9:18 (3d. Ed. 2002, Cum. Supp. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">In interpreting the contract in <em>Nova Research, </em>we held that, under the parties\u2019 contract, extending the exception urged upon by Penske to imply a fee-shifting provision for first-party actions, where the contract does not permit one expressly, would be overbroad and permit the exception to swallow the rule, gutting the presumption of the American rule disallowing recovery of first-party attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Nova Research, </em>405 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Md. at 450-67, 952 A.2d at 284-89. In contrast, as the Court of Special Appeals noted, in this case, considering the contract as a whole, and the underlying purpose of the parties\u2019 contract, Article 19 of the Agreement \u201ccontains the type of express first party attorneys\u2019 fees language that the commercial vehicle lease contract in <em>Nova Research </em>lacked.\u201d <em>Bainbridge, </em>2016 WL 1321205 at *6.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">Unlike <em>Nova Research, </em>the Agreement before this Court contains several express provisions providing for first-party counsel fees. As we explained in <em>Nova </em>Research:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">\u201cAlthough some courts have interpreted a contract provision to include first party attorney\u2019s fees incurred in enforcement actions, the vast majority of the contracts involved in those cases explicitly allowed for the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees by express inclusion of the phrase \u201cattorney\u2019s fees\u201d in the respective indemnity provisions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">405 Md. at 457, 952 A.2d at 288. Article 19 provides expressly for the payment of \u201cattorney\u2019s fees;\u201d it ties payment of those fees expressly to an action for \u201cbreach\u201d of the contract; and it confirms the intent of the parties to cover first-party counsel fees by referring to \u201crent loss,\u201d a first-party loss arising from a breach of the Agreement. The Court of Special Appeals did not undermine or fail to apply the precepts of <em>Nova Research. </em>Instead, that Court found correctly that the Agreement, which was negotiated by sophisticated business entities, contained express terms that the contract at issue in <em>Nova Research </em>lacked. <em>See Balcor Real Estate Holdings, Inc. v. Walentas-Phoenix Corp., </em>73 F.3d 150, 153 (7th Cir. 1996) (finding that a contract with an indemnification agreement that required ap-pellee to \u201chold [[appellant] and its affiliates] harmless ... against any... expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys\u2019 <em>fees </em>and expenses) ... incurred by [appellant] as a direct or indirect result of ... any breach or default by [appellee]\u201d constituted an explicit first-party fee shifting clause.\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Thomas v. Capital Med. Mgmt. Assocs., LLC, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>189 Md.App. 439, 467-72, 986 A.2d 51, 67-71 (2009) (declining to find that a contract with a clause on \u201cTermination and Breach\u201d that did not include a reference to the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees and a separate clause on indemnification that did include a reference to \u201cattorney\u2019s fees,\u201d but only in relation to the \u201cperformance of [the] Agreement,\u201d and not to \u201cdefault or termination under the Agreement,\u201d constituted a first-party fee-shifting clause in the event of a default).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">Our plain language interpretation that Article 19 is sufficient to entitle White Flint to first-party attorney\u2019s fees is confirmed by the three clauses within the indemnification article. We disagree with petitioner\u2019s claim that the clause \u201cindemnif[y], and agrees to defend and hold harmless White Flint\u201d restricted Article 19 to third-party claims because, according to the petitioner, the verbs \u201cdefend and hold harmless\u201d refer to third-party claims only, and by the principle of <em>noscitur </em>sociis,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that limitation applied to the promise to indemnify. Article 19 is divided into three clauses,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of which, only the latter two (\u201cinjuries to persons...\u201d or \u201cthe activities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>of Bainbridge... \u201d) protected White Flint from third-party claims. Each item in a string of terms, separated by the disjunctive \u201cor,\u201d is given independent meaning. <em>See Loughrin v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 2384, 2390, 189 L.Ed.2d 411 (2014). Therefore, Article 19\u2019s reference \u201cdefend and hold harmless\u201d language does not limit \u201cindemnity\u201d to third-party claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">We disagree with petitioner\u2019s assertion that our holding obliterates the distinction between third-party and first-party actions established by <em>Jones v. Calvin Taylor Banking Co., </em>253 Md. 430, 441, 253 A.2d 742, 748 (1969), <em>Atlantic, </em>and <em>Nova Research. </em>In <em>Jones, </em>this Court found a fee-shifting provision in a contract to allow an indemnitee to recover reasonable attorney\u2019s fees incurred in defending against a third-party action. <em>Jones, </em>253 Md. at 441-42, 253 A.2d at 748-49. Under the agreement in <em>Atlantic, </em>Ulico was to act as a surety for Atlantic, and issued a performance and payment surety bond on behalf of Atlantic to a third party. <em>Atlantic, </em>380 Md. at 291-92, 844 A.2d at 463. A third-party made a claim on the bond, and Ulico brought a suit against Atlantic to recover the loss it suffered, paying out the bond and the attorney\u2019s fees it incurred in pursuing indemnification from Atlantic. <em>Id. </em>This Court affirmed the right of Ulico, the surety, to recover fees to enforce the indemnity agreement, which covered \u201cfrom and against any and all Loss ..,\u201d where the contract defined loss as \u201c[a]ny and all damages, costs, charges, and expenses of any kind, sustained or incurred by [plaintiff] in connection with or as a result of ... the enforcement of this Agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 302, 316-18, 844 A.2d at 469, 478-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Importantly, as noted in <em>Nova Research, </em>this Court did not uphold the award in <em>Atlantic </em>under the theory of implied fee shifting for attorney\u2019s fees from third-party defensive actions, but \u201cupheld the award of attorney\u2019s fees after interpreting the indemnification contract.\u201d <em>Nova Research, </em>405 Md. at 448-49, 952 A.2d at 283. Under the terms of the agreement, \u201cAtlantic was obligated by contract to pay Ulico the sums it incurred to enforce the agreement, which included attorneys\u2019 fees, costs, and expenses.\u201d <em>Atlantic, </em>380 Md. at 316, 844 A.2d at 478. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>further, we determined that \u201c[indemnity agreements of this kind are interpreted generally to entitle the surety to recover fees, costs, and expenses incurred in enforcing them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 316, 844 A.2d at 478. Thus, our holding in <em>Atlantic </em>\u201c[does] not obviate the need to apply contract interpretation to determine the scope of the indemnification provision and whether the clause covers first party enforcement rights.\u201d <em>Nova Research, </em>405 Md. at 449, 952 A.2d at 283-84. Petitioner argues that the express words \u201cin the enforcement of the agreement\u201d in the indemnification agreement in <em>Atlantic </em>were essential to its holding and that Article 19 does not contain that exact phrase. The language in <em>Atlantic, </em>however, is analogous to the case at issue, as an action for \u201cenforcement of the contract\u201d is effectively the same as an \u201caction for breach of contract.\u201d <em>See Columbia Gas Transm\u2019n Corp. v. Ashleigh Heights LLC, </em>261 F.Supp.2d 332, 333 (D. Md. 2002) (stating \u201c[enforcement of a .,. agreement is essentially an action for breach of contract</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Moreover, we distinguished the type of contract at issue in <em>Nova Research </em>from indemnity contracts, like <em>Atlantic, </em>where first-party protection is critical. In <em>Atlantic, </em>the \u201csole purpose of the arrangement was to secure credit or a guarantor. The creditor or guarantor relied on indemnification as assurance in undertaking the deal.\u201d <em>Nova Research, </em>405 Md. at 450, 952 A.2d at 284. By comparison, the primary purpose of the contract in <em>Nova Research </em>\u201cwas to lease a truck and trailer\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>and was \u201cmeant to protect a commercial lessor against tort and casualty loss\u201d from third parties injured by the lessee. <em>Id. </em>at 450-51, 952 A.2d at 284-86.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">The Agreement here is closer to the surety contract in <em>Atlantic </em>than the truck rental lease in <em>Nova Research. </em>Bain-bridge and White Flint designed the agreement to ensure that Bainbridge, and not White Flint, carried all of the risk from the construction work; otherwise, White Flint had no incentive to support Bainbridge\u2019s plans. Thus, the parties designed Article 19 to ensure that White Flint would be made whole if Bainbridge breached the agreement, which supports first-party fee shifting. <em>See Pacific Indem. Co. v. Interstate Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>302 Md. 383, 388, 488 A.2d 486, 488 (1985) (stating that \u201cMaryland courts should examine the character of the contract, its purpose, and the facts and circumstances of the parties at the time of execution\u201d to determine the intention of the parties to a contract).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Petitioner references <em>Oscar Gruss &amp; Son, Inc. v. Hollander, </em>337 F.3d 186 (2d Cir. 2003), cited to in <em>Nova Research </em>as an instructive example of the distinction between first-party and third-party claims, for the proposition that the language in Article 19 did not expressly allow for first-party fee shifting. In <em>Oscar Gruss, </em>the indemnity provision provided for \u201clegal or other expenses ... (including, <em>without limitation, in connection with the enforcement of the Agreement </em>and the indemnification obligations set forth herein).\u201d 337 F.3d at 199. Petitioner also references <em>Hooper Associates v. AGS Computers, </em>74 N.Y.2d 487, 549 N.Y.S.2d 365, 548 N.E.2d 903 (1989), where the indemnification provision obligated AGS computer to \u201c \u2018indemnify and hold harmless [Hooper] ... from any and all claims ... including reasonable counsel fees\u2019 arising out of breach of warranty claims ....\u201d 549 N.Y.S.2d 365, 548 N.E.2d at 905.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>We do not agree with petitioner that the indemnification clauses in <em>Oscar Grass </em>and <em>Hooper, </em>where the courts in both cases prohibited first-party fee shifting, are analogous to the instant case. The indemnification clauses in both New York cases contained notice and assumption of defense clauses, where the indemnitee had to provide the indemnitor with notice of any indemnification claim, allow the indemnitor to assume its defense, and request the indemnitor\u2019s permission before settling any lawsuit. <em>Oscar Grass, </em>337 F.3d at 200; <em>Hooper, </em>549 N.Y.S.2d 365, 548 N.E.2d at 905. In <em>Oscar </em>Gross, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit determined that this additional language applied only to third-party claims. 337 F.3d at 200-01. In <em>Hooper, </em>the Court of Appeals of New York found that the notice and assumption of defense clause had \u201cno logical application to a suit between the parties..,\u201d and required a construction limiting the indemnity in order to \u201caffordt ] a fair meaning to all of the language\u201d and \u201cleave[ ] no provision without force and effect.\u201d 549 N.Y.S.2d 365, 548 N.E.2d at 905 (internal citation omitted). Article 19 in the instant case does not contain a similar notice and assumption of defense clause that would limit it to third-party claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Finally, we do not agree with Bainbridge that Section 9 of the Agreement is a broad dispute resolution provision, covering all disputes. Section 9 provides merely for binding arbitration in certain circumstances, and contains a \u201cprevailing party\u201d fee provision. It does not address unresolved breaches by Bainbridge and damages claims for any such breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">We hold that the Agreement contains express provisions that authorized first-party fee shifting, and subsequently White Flint is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED. PETITIONERS TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AT0S\">, Bainbridge proposed to hold open the hole with a \u201csheeting and shoring system\u201d built by placing vertical steel I-beams (\"piles\u201d) into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>pre-drilled holes, locked into place by \"tie-backs\u201d\u2014long steel cables extending back from the piles into adjacent properties and welded to \"brackets\u201d\u2014with L-shaped steel shelves extending onto and underneath the neighboring building foundations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b508-7\">.
