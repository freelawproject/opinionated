He argues that the circuit court imposed an illegal sentence after it bound itself to a \u201c[e]ap of four years on any executed incarceration.\u201d Petitioner contends that a reasonable lay person in his position would not have understood the agreement\u2019s cap to mean that the circuit court could have imposed a suspended sentence and probation in addition to incarceration for up to four years. We affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, holding that the plain language of the cap was clear and unambiguous, and thus, Petitioner\u2019s sentence was legal.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-11\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b592-12\">Petitioner was charged by indictment in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County with conspiracy to commit theft of property with a value over $1,000, theft scheme, identity fraud, and making a false statement to the police. After the denial of his motion to suppress evidence, Petitioner and the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>entered into the following agreement: Petitioner would proceed by way of a plea of not guilty with an agreed statement of facts on the conspiracy and false statement charges, and the State would enter the remaining counts as <em>nolle prosequi. </em>This agreement was written, signed by the prosecutor and Petitioner\u2019s attorney, and submitted to the circuit court\u2019s Assignment Office, in the form of an agreement memorandum. The memorandum contained the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-5\">The defendant agrees to proceed by way of an agreed statement of facts on count one, amended to allege conspiracy to commit theft of property having a value at least $1,000 but less than $10,000 and on count four, alleging false statement when under arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-6\">Cap of four years on any executed incarceration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-7\">Judg[ ]ments of restitution totaling $8,377 will be entered as part of the sentence, not merely as a term of probation. The State will enter nolle prosequi as to counts two and three at sentencing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-8\">The State will defer to the Court as to the defendant\u2019s bond status between the date of the trial and the date of sentencing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-9\">The defendant will waive his right under Maryland Rule 4-345(e) to request modification of his sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-10\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">In addition to the agreement memorandum, the record reflects a form entitled \u201cGUILTY PLEA\u2014VOIR DIRE[J\u201d We recognize that the form\u2019s title is inaccurate\u2014Petitioner did not enter a guilty plea. This form was characterized at the hearing at which Petitioner pleaded not guilty on an agreed statement of facts as an \u201cadvice of rights form[.]\u201d At the hearing, Petitioner\u2019s counsel stated \u201cI have crossed out a number of items\u201d on the form \u201cthat deal with the appeal issues because [Petitioner] would maintain his appeal rights[.]\u201d The form, signed by Petitioner and his counsel, outlines the elements of the conspiracy and false statement counts, and states that \u201c[t]he maximum penalty for the offense you are offering to plead guilty is: 10 years + 6 months[,]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>The hearing at which Petitioner pleaded not guilty on an agreed statement of facts, and the subsequent trial, were held on April 18, 2011. The circuit court read into the record the terms of the agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-5\">THE COURT: The terms of the plea are that [Petitioner] agrees to proceed by way of an agreed statement of facts on Count 1, amended to allege conspiracy to commit theft of property having a value of at least $1,000 but less than $10,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">And on Count 4, alleging false statement when under arrest. There\u2019s a cap of four years [on executed<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] incarceration. The State will enter a nolle prosequi to Counts 2 and 3 at sentencing, and the State will defer to the Court as to defendant\u2019s bond status between the date of trial and the date of sentencing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-7\">The defendant will waive any right under Maryland [R]ule 4-345(e) to request a modification of his sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-8\">Are those the complete terms of the agreement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: They are, Your Honor. Mr. Montgomery, understanding those terms of the agreement\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-10\">Are those the terms of the plea agreement that you and I discussed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-11\">[PETITIONER]: Yes, What was it about the bond issue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-12\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: The bond is that the State\u2019s not going to be asking to have your bond revoked\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-13\">$ \u215c \u215c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>THE COURT: Whether you stay out of jail between now and the time you get sentenced or not, the State is not going to request that you be locked up while you\u2019re waiting for sentencing, okay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-5\">[THE STATE]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-6\">[PETITIONER]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-7\">THE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">The State then read into the record the agreed statement of facts, and the circuit court found Petitioner guilty of conspiracy to commit theft and making a false statement while under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">The parties appeared before the circuit court for sentencing on August 11, 2011. The State repeated the facts of the case and reminded the judge of the parties\u2019 agreement: \u201cIn this ease, Your Honor agreed to a cap of four years of any executed incarceration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-10\">The circuit court imposed the following sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-11\">Now, on the first count, conspiracy to commit theft, the Court will impose a sentence of 10 years to the Maryland Department of Corrections; I\u2019ll suspend all but four years and that will be concurrent with the sentence in the Hagers-town case.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-12\">Now, with the false statement ..., the Court will impose a sentence of six months, which is the maximum sentence in that particular case, and that will be concurrent with the sentence in Count 1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-13\">Upon release, [Petitioner] will be on a period of probation of four years supervised probation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-14\">On March 23, 2015, Petitioner filed a motion to correct illegal sentence, contending that the sentence exceeded the maximum sentence authorized by the agreement. Petitioner contended that he, or a reasonable lay person in his position, would have understood the agreement was limited to a maxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>mum total sentence of four years, not suspended time and probation in addition to a four-year term of incarceration. The State filed a motion in opposition, asserting that the sentence imposed by the circuit court was \u201cin accordance with the plain terms\u201d of the agreement. The State noted that the four-year cap was qualified by the term \u201cexecuted[,]\u201d and Petitioner had been advised of the maximum penalty of ten years for the conspiracy count. On July 24, 2015, the circuit court denied the motion without a hearing or a written opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Petitioner appealed the denial of his motion to correct illegal sentence to the Court of Special Appeals. He argued that his sentence was illegal because a reasonable lay person in his position would not have understood that he could have received a total sentence in excess of four years. Petitioner further contended that the only potential term of incarceration mentioned in the agreement and by the parties was the cap on \u201cexecuted incarceration[,]\u201d without mention of an additional period of suspended punishment and probation. The State countered that Petitioner\u2019s sentence was legal because the agreement expressed a four-year cap on <em>executed </em>incarceration. Further, the State contended that Petitioner understood that there could be an additional, but unexecuted, portion imposed in his sentence because Petitioner had been advised that he was subject to a maximum sentence of ten-and-a-half years.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">In a reported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the denial of Petitioner\u2019s motion to correct illegal sentence. <em>Ray v. State, </em>230 Md.App. 157, 146 A.3d 1157 (2016). The court held that the meaning of a \u201c[c]ap of four years on any executed incarceration\u201d is clear and unambiguous. The Court of Special Appeals determined there was \u201cno ambiguity in the critical terms of the plea bargain[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 187, 146 A.3d at 1174. Thus, the court held that it was not necessary to consider \u201cwhat a reasonable lay person in [Petitioner\u2019s] position and unaware of the niceties of sentencing law would have understood the agreement to mean, based on the record developed at the plea proceeding.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 187-189, 146 A.3d at 1174-75 (quoting <em>Cuffley v. State, </em>416 Md. 568, 582, 7 A.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>557, 565 (2010)). Moreover, the intermediate appellate court went on to consider, only for the purposes of argument, \u201cthat the term \u2018executed incarceration\u2019 \u201d was ambiguous. <em>Id. </em>at 187, 146 A.3d at 1174. The court concluded a reasonable person in Petitioner\u2019s position, unaware of the niceties of sentencing law, would have understood the meaning of \u201cexecuted incarceration,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 187-94, 146 A.3d at 1174-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">We granted Petitioner\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari, <em>Ray v. State, </em>451 Md. 249, 152 A.3d 753 (2017), to consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-5\">1. Under this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Cuffley v. State, </em>416 Md. 568[, 7 A.3d 557] ( 2010), and <em>Baines v. State, </em>416 Md. 604[, 7 A.3d 578] (2010), which require that a plea agreement be construed according to what a reasonable lay person in [Petitioner\u2019s] position, unaware of the niceties of sentencing law, would understand it to mean, would a reasonable lay person understand \u201ca cap of four years on executed incarceration\u201d to mean that the court could impose suspended time in addition to a four-year term of non-suspended incarceration?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">2. Where the circuit court bound itself to a \u201ccap of four years on executed incarceration,\u201d but the term \u201cexecuted\u201d was never explained to Petitioner and he was never informed that the court could impose suspended time in addition to incarceration for up to four years, and the court sentenced him to ten years\u2019 incarceration, with six years suspended, is the sentence imposed on Petitioner illegal?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AqJ\">Parties\u2019 Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">Petitioner maintains that under the agreement with the State, which the circuit court approved, Petitioner was entitled to a maximum total sentence not exceeding four years. The circuit court sentenced Petitioner to ten years\u2019 incarceration, with six years suspended, and four years of probation. Thus, Petitioner urges that the circuit court exceeded the maximum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>sentence authorized by the agreement, thereby imposing an illegal sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">In response, the State argues that the circuit court sentenced Petitioner within the terms and sentencing cap of Petitioner\u2019s negotiated agreement, as the executed portion of Petitioner\u2019s sentence was capped at four years. The State contends that the Court of Special Appeals correctly determined that Petitioner\u2019s agreement was clear and unequivocal, and the sentence imposed by the circuit court fully complied with that agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">If a trial court approves an agreement reached by the parties, \u201cthe judge shall embody in the judgment the agreed sentence, disposition, or other judicial action encompassed in the agreement ....\u201d Md. Rule 4\u2014243(c)(3); <em>see also Dotson v. State, </em>321 Md. 515, 523, 583 A.2d 710, 714 (1991) (\u201cWhen the judge accepted the pleas, the agreement as to punishment came into full bloom; it stood approved by the judge. Thereafter, the agreement was inviolate, and the judge was required under the dictate of Rule 4-243(c)(3) to embody in the judgment the agreed sentence.\u201d). Maryland Rule 4-345(a) provides: \u201cThe court may correct an illegal sentence at any time.\u201d The illegality must be inherent in the sentence. <em>See, e.g., Tshiwala v. State, </em>424 Md. 612, 619, 37 A.3d 308, 312 (2012) (\u201c[W]here the sentence imposed is not inherently illegal, and where the matter complained of is a procedural error, the complaint does not concern an illegal sentence for purposes of Rule 4-345(a).\u201d). This Court has held that \u201ca sentence imposed in violation of the maximum sentence identified in a binding plea agreement and thereby \u2018fixed\u2019 by that agreement as \u2018the maximum sentence allowable by law,\u2019 is ... an inherently illegal sentence!),]\u201d and is cognizable under Maryland Rule 4-345(a). <em>Matthews v. State, </em>424 Md. 503, 519, 36 A.3d 499, 508 (2012) (quoting <em>Dotson, </em>321 Md. at 524, 583 A.2d at 714).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">\u201cWhether a trial court has violated the terms of a plea agreement is a question of law, which we review de novo.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number><em>Cuffley, </em>416 Md. at 581, 7 A.3d 557. Interpretation of an agreement as to sentencing, including the question of whether the agreement\u2019s language is ambiguous, is a question of law, subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>United States v.

State, </em>416 Md. 568, 7 A.3d 557 (2010); <em>Baines v. State, </em>416 Md. 604, 7 A.3d 578 (2010); and <em>Matthews v. State, </em>424 Md. 503, 36 A.3d 499 (2012). Here, our brethren on the Court of Special Appeals coined these cases as the <em>Cuffley </em>Trilogy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-7\">The promulgation of the Cuffley Trilogy was truly a watershed. The Trilogy vastly expanded the potential for legitimate Rule 4-345(a) challenges. Construing the meaning of a plea bargain, moreover, is a far more complicated and ad hoc exercise than was ever the construing of a statute in the simpler pre-Cuffley era. Rule 4-345(a) has taken on a much larger life and Maryland law is still adjusting to it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-8\"><em>Ray v. State, </em>230 Md.App. 157, 174, 146 A.3d 1157, 1167 (2016). Reflection on the <em>Cuffley </em>Trilogy provides the background for our clarification of the law governing plea agreement interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">In <em>Cuffley, </em>we decided that a sentence of fifteen years\u2019 incarceration, with all but six years of that term suspended in favor of five years\u2019 probation, was illegal where the defendant pleaded guilty pursuant to a binding plea agreement that called for a sentence within the Sentencing Guidelines range of four to eight years\u2019 incarceration. 416 Md. at 577, 7 A.3d at 562. During the plea proceeding, the prosecutor advised the court that the agreement called for a \u201csentence within the guidelines[,]\u201d which was \u201cfour to eight years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 584, 7 A.3d at 566-67. \u201cDefense counsel added nothing to explain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>further what the parties meant by that sentencing term,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 585, 7 A.3d at 567. The court then stated its understanding of the agreement: \u201cThe plea agreement, as I understand it, is that I will impose a sentence somewhere \u2019within the guidelines. The guidelines in this case are four to eight years. Any conditions of probation are entirely within my discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 585, 7 A.3d at 567. The circuit court subsequently sentenced Cuffley to \u201c15 years at the Department of Correction, all but six years suspended, consecutive to the sentence imposed by [the judge who presided over the violation of probation]. Upon release the defendant will be placed on a period of probation for five years [with a number of special conditions].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 574, 7 A.3d at 560. We recognized that the circuit court violated the plea agreement by imposing a sentence that exceeded a total of eight years\u2019 incarceration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-5\">No mention was made at any time during that proceeding-much less before the court agreed to be bound by the agreement and accepted Petitioner\u2019s plea-that the four-to-eight-year sentence referred to executed time only. Neither counsel nor the court stated that the court could impose a sentence of more than eight years\u2019 incarceration that would include no more than eight years of actual incarceration, with the remainder suspended. Based on this record, a reasonable lay person in Petitioner\u2019s position would not understand that the court could impose the sentence it did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A04\"><em>Id. </em>at 585, 7 A.3d at 567 (footnote omitted). We thus held that Cuffley was entitled to have his sentence corrected to conform to what he bargained for, <em>ie., </em>a total sentence of no more than eight years, a portion of which could be suspended in the court\u2019s discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\"><em>Baines, </em>filed on the same day as <em>Cuffley, </em>also considered \u201cwhether a judge who agrees to be bound to the terms of a plea agreement that calls for a sentence \u2018within the guidelines\u2019 may impose a \u2018split sentence\u2019 that exceeds the guidelines and suspends all but the part of the sentence that falls within the guidelines.\u201d 416 Md. at 607, 7 A,3d at 580. The State and Baines negotiated a plea agreement, accepted by the circuit court, which called for him to plead guilty to two counts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>armed robbery, in exchange for \u201csentencing within the guidelines!;.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>The guidelines range was seven to thirteen years. <em>Id. </em>The court sentenced Baines on the first count to twenty years\u2019 incarceration, all but seven years suspended, and on the second count to a consecutive twenty years, all but six years suspended, followed by five years of probation. <em>Id. </em>We noted that \u201c[t]here was no indication, much less <em>a plain statement, </em>that the court, consistent with the agreement, was free to impose a sentence beyond the guidelines so long as the court suspended all but the part of the sentence that was within the guidelines.\u201d Thus, the sentence was in breach of the plea agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 620, 7 A.3d 578, 416 Md. at 588, 7 A.3d 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">In <em>Matthews, </em>the defendant pleaded guilty to attempted first-degree murder, two counts of first-degree assault, and use of a handgun in the commission of a felony. 424 Md. at 506-07, 36 A.3d at 501. At the plea proceeding, the prosecutor advised the court that, in exchange for Matthews\u2019 plea, the State would enter a <em>nolle prosequi </em>as to the remaining counts in that case (and the charges in a related ease) and would argue \u201cfor incarceration within the\u2014to the top of the guidelines range ...[,] twenty-three to forty-three years[,]\u201d and \u201cbe asking for incarceration of forty-three years. ... That cap is a cap as to actual and immediate incarceration at the time of initial disposition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 507, 36 A.3d at 501. Before accepting Matthews\u2019 guilty plea, the court told him that \u201c[y]our guidelines are twenty-three to forty-three years[,]\u201d that \u201c[t]he [c]ourt has agreed to cap any sentence and your defense attorneys are free to argue[,]\u201d and that \u201ctheoretically I can give you anything from the mandatory minimum on the one count, which is five years without parole, up to the maximum of life imprisonment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 522-23, 36 A,3d at 510-11. At sentencing, the State asked for imposition of a life sentence with all but forty-three years suspended. <em>Id. </em>at 507, 36 A.3d at 501. The court sentenced Matthews to a \u201ctotal sentence of life imprisonment, with thirty years of it as executed time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 507, 36 A.3d at 501-02. Matthews challenged that the sentence imposed was illegal because it exceeded the sentencing cap to which the trial court agreed to be bound. <em>Id. </em>at 506, 36 A.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>501. The State rebutted that the circuit court agreed only to cap the sentence at forty-three years of executed time, excluding any suspended time. <em>Id, </em>at 523, 36 A.3d at 511. We rejected that argument and agreed with Matthews that \u201cthe record of the plea hearing is ambiguous on this point and the ambiguity must be resolved in favor of [Matthews].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Agreement Interpretation</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Plea bargains are similar to contracts. <em>See, e.g., Hartman v. State, </em>452 Md. 279, 289, 156 A.3d 886, 892 (2017). Thus, when interpreting plea agreements, courts draw upon contract law as a guide to ensure that each party receives the benefit of the bargain. We recognize that plea agreements, of course, involve more than contract rights. Accordingly, exclusive application of contract law is inappropriate because \u201c[d]ue process concerns for fairness and the adequacy of procedural safeguards guide any interpretation of a court approved plea agreement.\u201d <em>Solorzano v. State, </em>397 Md. 661, 668, 919 A.2d 652, 656 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">Here, the Court of Special Appeals recognized the need for clarification regarding the application of contract law to plea agreements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">Between the plea bargain and the contract there is an enigmatic attraction-but-rejection relationship. In these \u201cyes, but\u201d discussions the reader is very much left at sea. Shall we swim to the shore\u2014or back to the ship? This indeterminate status of principles of contract interpretation can create a troubled middle ground when it comes to applying the principles to a given plea agreement. In terms of sometimes lacking analytic balance on the subject, appellate opinions themselves have not been without sin. Those opinions holding a defendant not bound by the arguably binding terms of his plea agreement stress the dissimilarities between the two contexts and tend to ignore totally the similarities that might cut the other way. Conversely, the opinions holding a defendant bound by the terms of the plea agreement stress the similarities between the two contexts and tend to ignore the dissimilarities. <em>What is desperately </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number><em>needed is the appreciation that 1) the construing of a plea agreement is not, to he sure, slavishly controlled by contract principles but that 2) contract principles may nonetheless control a given outcome and may not be blithely repudiated or ignored.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-5\"><em>Ray, </em>230 Md.App. at 182, 146 A.3d at 1171 (emphasis added). Here, we clarify the relationship between plea agreement interpretation and contract law.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">First, we must determine whether the plain language of the agreement is clear and unambiguous as a matter of law.

Third, if, after we have examined the agreement and plea proceeding record, we still find ambiguity regarding what the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>defendant reasonably understood to be the terms of the agreement, then the ambiguity should be construed in favor of the defendant. <em>See Solorzano, </em>397 Md. at 673, 919 A.2d at 659,</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">The Plain Language of the Agreement\u2019s Sentencing Cap Was Clear and Unambiguous</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">We determine <em>de novo </em>whether the plain language of the disputed provision in the agreement is ambiguous. Where the plain language of a disputed provision of an agreement is clear and unambiguous, we give effect to its meaning, and there is no need to look elsewhere to determine the provision\u2019s meaning. Here, the disputed provision of the agreement contains the language \u201c[c]ap of four years on any executed incarceration.\u201d We agree with the Court of Special Appeals that the plain language of this provision is clear and unambiguous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">We hold that the meaning of those words is perspicaciously clear and unambiguous. They mean four years to be served in jail. They mean four years of \u201chard time.\u201d They make no reference whatsoever to any suspended sentence and, indeed, distinguished themselves from it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-8\"><em>Ray, </em>230 Md.App, at 186, 146 A.3d at 1173, Further, it is unreasonable to interpret the plain language of the agreement as prohibiting a <em>total </em>sentence beyond the cap specifically imposed on <em>executed </em>incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">The Court of Special Appeals provided sage analysis regarding why a specific sentencing cap on \u201cexecuted incarceration[ ]\u201d is unambiguous, while a non-specific cap is ambiguous:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Akh\">The perennial flaw with most non-specific sentencing caps imposed on split sentences is that the ostensibly limiting cap provision does not indicate which part of a split sentence is being capped. A non-specific cap leaves open the possibility that the entire sentence (the unsuspended and the suspended portions alike) is being capped rather than that only the \u201chard time\u201d is being capped.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 186, 146 A.3d at 1173. All three cases in the <em>Cuffley </em>Trilogy provided for a non-specific cap on the sentence, gener<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>ally. In all three cases, there was no express indication as to whether the cap was upon the executed portion of the sentence, or on the total sentence. We agree with the Court of Special Appeals that the sentencing caps in the <em>Cuffley </em>Trilogy of cases \u201cwere accordingly ambiguous by definition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 186, 146 A.3d at 1174. Furthermore, we emphasize the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 distinguishing of <em>Cuffley.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-5\">There is even a suggestion in Cuffley, 424 Md, at 524, 36 A.3d [at 512], that an adjective (past participle) such as \u201cexecuted\u201d is exactly what the plea bargain in that case needed to dissipate any possible ambiguity:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-6\">\u201cNeither did the State, defense counsel, or the Court explain for the record that the words \u2018guideline range\u2019 referred solely to executed time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-7\"><em>Ray, </em>230 Md.App. at 187, 146 A.3d at 1174 (quoting <em>Cuffley, </em>424 Md. at 524, 36 A.3d at 512). Here, unlike in <em>Cuffley, </em>the agreement expressly provided that the sentencing cap was to be imposed on executed time. The plain language of the disputed provision of the agreement was clear and unambiguous. It is thus unnecessary to look elsewhere to determine the provision\u2019s meaning. <em>See Jordan, </em>509 F.3d at 195; <em>Brendsel v. Winchester Constr.

Further, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals that even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the plain language of the disputed provision was ambiguous, the Petitioner would still not prevail. If the plain language of the disputed provision of the agreement is ambiguous, then we conduct a test to determine what a defendant reasonably understood at the time of his plea. We described this test in <em>Cuffley.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-10\">The test for determining what the defendant reasonably understood at the time of the plea is an objective one. It depends not on what the defendant actually understood the agreement to mean, but rather, on what a reasonable lay person in the defendant\u2019s position and unaware of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>niceties of the sentencing law would have understood the agreement to mean, based on the record developed at the plea proceeding. It is for this reason that extrinsic evidence of what the defendant\u2019s actual understanding might have been is irrelevant to the inquiry.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">416 Md. at 582, 7 A.3d 557-66 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The record contains a form entitled \u201cGUILTY PLEA\u2014 VOIR DIRE[.]\u201d As we have noted, this form\u2019s title is inaccurate, as Petitioner did not enter a guilty plea. Accordingly, this form was characterized at the April 18, 2011 hearing, at which Petitioner\u2019s plea was entered, as an \u201cadvice of rights form[.]\u201d At the hearing, Petitioner\u2019s counsel stated \u201cI have crossed out a number of items\u201d on the form \u201cthat deal with the appeal issues because [Petitioner] would maintain his appeal rights[.]\u201d The form was signed by Petitioner and his counsel, set out the elements of the conspiracy and false statement counts, and informed Petitioner of the maximum statutory penalty: \u201c10 years + 6 months[.]\u201d We determine that because Petitioner acknowledged that he was subject to a maximum sentence of ten years and six months, his argument that he did not understand that his \u201cexecuted\u201d incarceration would be limited to four years to be \u201ccarried out\u201d or \u201cperformed,\u201d <em>Ray, </em>230 Md.App, at 186-87, 146 A.3d 1157, was refuted by the record.

After the transcription services company issued a correction, Petitioner's counsel filed a motion to correct the record in the Court of Special Appeals. As the Court of Special Appeals noted: \"The court reporter made an obvious error in transcription and wrote \u2018un-executed incarceration' instead of \u2018on executed incarceration.' All parties were in absolute agreement that the judge said \u2018on executed incarceration,\u2019 exactly as it was written in the formal Memorandum.\u201d <em>Ray v.
