It presents the question of whether a surety who issued a performance bond on a subcontract is bound by that contract\u2019s arbitration clause when the surety is jointly and severally liable for the \u201cperformance of\u2019 the subcontract and the entire subcontract is incorporated into the bond by reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">In May 2009, Petitioner Schneider Electric Buildings Critical Systems, Inc. (\u201cSchneider\u201d) entered into a contract with National Control Services, Inc. (\u201cNCS\u201d), an electrical subcontractor, for the \u201clabor, material, equipment and services necessary to perform work in connection with construction projects, from time to time\u201d (\u201cMaster Subcontract Agreement\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Master Subcontract Agreement included the following mandatory arbitration clause, which provided that disputes between the contractor and subcontractor would be subject to arbitration in accordance with the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-10\">19.2 Disputes between Contractor and Subcontractor. In the event that the provisions for dispute resolution between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>Contractor and its customer under the Contractor\u2019s Contract do not permit consolidation or joinder with disputes of third parties, such as the Subcontractor, or in the absence of a disputes resolution procedure in such Contract or if such dispute is only between the Contractor and Subcontractor, except for claims which have been waived by the making or acceptance of final payment and except for intellectual property issues which shall be settle[d] by litigation, then the parties shall resolve the dispute following procedures set forth below.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-4\">19.2.1 Any dispute or controversy between the parties shall be submitted by one party to the other in writing and the parties shall attempt to resolve the dispute through good faith negotiations and settlement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-5\">19.2.2 If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute through good faith negotiations and settlement, then the dispute shall be submitted to binding arbitration within thirty (30) days after demand for arbitration and conducted in the locale of the project before a single arbitrator, unless the parties mutually agree otherwise ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">That October, Schneider was hired by Clark Construction Group, LLC, to help construct a medical research facility at Aberdeen Proving Ground in Harford County, Maryland. Pursuant to the Master Subcontract Agreement, Schneider entered into a subcontract with NCS to perform work on that project (\u201cNCS Subcontract\u201d). The NCS Subcontract incorporated the entire Master Subcontract Agreement, including the arbitration clause, by reference. It also required NCS to furnish a performance bond for 100 percent of the NCS Subcontract value, which was $2,050,000. NCS obtained a performance bond (\u201cthe Bond\u201d) from Respondent Western Surety Company (\u201cWestern\u201d). Referring to the NCS Subcontract, the Bond stated that the \u201cContractor and the Surety, jointly and severally, bind themselves ... to the Owner for the performance of the Construction Contract, which is incorporated herein by reference.\u201d By incorporating the NCS Subcontract, the Bond also incorporated the Master Subcontract Agreement, including the arbitration clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>During construction, a dispute arose between Schneider and NCS, and NCS abandoned the job site. After sending the required default notices, Schneider terminated the NCS Subcontract for refusal to perform the agreed-upon work. It claims approximately $1,500,000 in damages from this breach of contract. In February 2014, Schneider filed a demand for arbitration with NCS. Two months later, it amended the demand to include Western.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">In April 2014, Western filed a petition in the Circuit Court for Howard County seeking a stay of arbitration pursuant to Maryland Code (1957, 2013 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 3-208 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Western also requested that the court issue a declaratory judgment stating, in part, that Western was not bound by the arbitration clause. Schneider moved to dismiss the action for improper venue. When Western agreed to a change of venue, the case was transferred to Harford County.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">In the Circuit Court for Harford County, Western filed a motion for partial summary judgment asking the court to stay the arbitration proceedings. In a memorandum opinion, the Circuit Court granted partial summary judgment in favor of Western, holding that it could not be compelled to participate in the pending arbitration proceedings between Schneider and NCS. <em>Western Sur. Co. v. Schneider Elec. Bldgs. Critical Sys., Inc., </em>No. 12-C-14-2396, slip op, at 12 (Cir. Ct. Harford Cty. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>Feb. 20, 2015). It explained that the Bond \u201cis only insuring that Western is liable for any construction that has <em>not </em>been performed, and the court can find no evidence of an intention that Western should be bound to dispute resolution provisions of the construction contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8 (emphasis in original). Schneider appealed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed. It held that \u201cthe \u2018joint and several\u2019 obligation clause in ... the performance bond does not evince Western Surety\u2019s assent to be bound by the arbitration clause in the incorporated-by-reference chain of documents.\u201d <em>Schneider Elec. Bldgs. Critical Sys., Inc. v. Western Sur. Co., </em>231 Md.App. 27, 46, 149 A.3d 778 (2016). Additionally, the intermediate appellate court held that Western \u201cis not compelled to arbitrate any dispute involving the performance bond it issued[ ] simply because that bond incorporated by reference an agreement, to which it was not a party, containing a mandatory arbitration clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49, 149 A.3d 778. Schneider filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, which we granted.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-5\">Schneider presented the following question for our review: [Is] the surety on a performance bond issued for a subcontract [] bound by an arbitration clause set forth in the subcontract where the bond expressly incorporates, and states that the surety is jointly and severally bound for the performance of[ ] the subcontract?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Because we answer no to this question, we affirm the decision of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">Schneider appeals from the Circuit Court\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment. A court may grant summary judgment in favor of the moving party \u201cif the motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Md. Rule 2-501(f). Because the grant of summary judgment is a question of law, it is \u201csubject to a non-deferential review on appeal.\u201d <em>Tyler v. City of Coll. Park, </em>415 Md. 475, 498, 3 A.3d 421 (2010) (citations omitted). In conducting this <em>de novo </em>review, we evaluate \u201cthe record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and construe any reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the well-plead facts against the moving party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 499, 3 A.3d 421 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Schneider contends that Western is bound by the NCS Subcontract\u2019s arbitration clause because (1) Western is jointly and severally liable \u201cfor the performance of the Construction Contract,\u201d which includes the arbitration clause, and (2) the arbitration clause is incorporated into the Bond by reference. Additionally, it argues that the presumption in favor of arbitration under the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d) requires us to compel Western to arbitrate. Western argues that the arbitration clause is not part of the \u201cperformance of the Construction Contract\u201d and that its incorporation by reference does not bind Western. It contends that we should apply state contract law to interpret its obligations under the Bond. Without an enforceable arbitration clause between the parties, Western argues, the FAA is inapplicable. We first address the parties\u2019 contentions regarding the FAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">The Effect of the Federal Arbitration Act</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Schneider argues that the FAA governs this case because the Bond \u201ccontains an agreement in writing providing for arbitration\u201d\u2014it incorporates the NCS Subcontract\u2019s arbitration clause by reference\u2014and \u201cevidences a transaction involving interstate commerce.\u201d Therefore, Schneider contends, we must apply a presumption in favor of arbitration. Western urges us to apply state contract law to determine whether an agreement to arbitrate exists between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>The question before us is whether the Bond contains an agreement between Western and Schneider to arbitrate their disputes. The Supreme Court has explained, \u201cWhen deciding whether the parties agreed to arbitrate a certain matter ... courts generally ... should apply ordinary state-law principles that govern the formation of contracts.\u201d <em>First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, </em>514 U.S. 938, 944, 115 S.Ct. 1920, 131 L.Ed.2d 985 (1995). We have also recently held that \u201ccontract-based challenges to the enforcement of an arbitration clause ... are governed by applicable state law.\u201d <em>Cain v. Midland Funding, LLC, </em>452 Md. 141, 154, 156 A.3d 807 (2017) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, we apply Maryland law to determine whether Western has agreed to arbitrate its dispute with Schneider.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">Maryland Contract Law</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">In Maryland, the \u201cfundamental rule in the construction and interpretation of contracts is that the intention of the parties as expressed in the language of the contract controls the analysis.\u201d <em>O\u2019Brien &amp; Gere Engs., Inc. v. City of Salisbury, </em>447 Md. 394, 421, 135 A.3d 473 (2016) (citation omitted). Accordingly, if \u201cthe language of the contract is unambiguous, we give effect to its plain meaning and do not delve into what the parties may have subjectively intended.\u201d <em>Rourke v. Amchem Prod., Inc., </em>384 Md. 329, 354, 863 A.2d 926 (2004) (citation omitted). As to arbitration clauses in particular, we have explained, \u201cArbitration is a process whereby <em>parties voluntarily agree </em>to substitute a private tribunal for the public tribunal otherwise available to them.\u201d <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co. v. Scarlett Harbor Assocs., </em>346 Md. 122, 127, 695 A.2d 153 (1997) (emphasis in original) (alterations, internal quotation marks, and citations omitted). Accordingly, an arbitration clause \u201ccannot impose obligations on persons who are not a party to it and do not agree to its terms.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Here, we must interpret the Bond, which incorporates the NCS Subcontract by reference. The NCS Subcontract, in turn, incorporates the Master Subcontract Agreement. To determine the plain meaning of the Bond, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>\u201cconstrue the contract as a whole\u201d\u2014we do not read each clause or provision separately. <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. Cook, </em>386 Md. 468, 497, 872 A.2d 969 (2005) (citation omitted). Additionally, because \u201cthe contract comprises two or more documents, the documents are to be construed together, harmoniously, so that, to the extent possible, all of the provisions can be given effect.\u201d <em>Rourke, </em>384 Md. at 354, 863 A.2d 926.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">The Bond\u2019s first paragraph provides: \u201cThe Contractor and the Surety, jointly and severally, bind themselves ... to the Owner for the performance of the Construction Contract, which is incorporated herein by reference.\u201d Schneider argues that Western\u2019s liability for the \u201cperformance of the Construction Contract\u201d makes Western \u201cas much a party to the NCS Subcontract as NCS itself.\u201d Thus, Schneider claims, Western is bound by the arbitration clause. Western responds that its obligations under the Bond are only triggered if NCS fails to perform\u2014it is not interchangeable with NCS in the NCS Subcontract. Accordingly, it contends, it is not bound by the arbitration clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">We look at this paragraph in the context of the entire contract. The second paragraph provides: \u201cIf [NCS] performs the Construction Contract, [Western] and [NCS] shall have no obligation under this Bond .... \u201d (Emphasis added.) And the third paragraph states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-6\">If there is no [default by Schneider], [Western\u2019s] obligation under this Bond shall arise after ... [Schneider] has notified [NCS] and [Western] ... that [Schneider] is considering declaring a [default by NCS] and has requested and attempted to arrange a conference with [NCS] and [Western] ... to discuss methods of performing the Construction Contract. If [Schneider], [NCS,] and [Western] agree, [NCS] shall be allowed a reasonable time to perform the Construction Contract ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">(Emphasis added.) As the Court of Special Appeals aptly explained, the use of the term \u201cperform\u201d in these subsequent provisions \u201crefers to the performance of the work [NCS] agreed to complete and not to every contractual provision in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>the incorporation-by-reference chain.\u201d <em>Schneider, </em>231 Md.App. at 46,149 A.3d 778. Viewing the disputed clause in context, we conclude that Western\u2019s agreement to be jointly and severally liable \u201cfor the performance of the Construction Contract\u201d does not constitute assent to the NCS Subcontract\u2019s mandatory arbitration clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Next, Schneider argues that Western is bound by the arbitration clause because it is incorporated by reference into the Bond. The relevant portions of the arbitration clause provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-5\">19.2 Disputes between Contractor and Subcontractor. In the event that the provisions for dispute resolution between the Contractor and its customer under the Contractor\u2019s Contract do not permit consolidation or joinder with disputes of third parties, such as the Subcontractor, or in the absence of a disputes resolution procedure in such Contract, or if such dispute is only between the Contractor and Subcontractor, ... then the parties shall resolve the dispute following procedures set forth below.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-7\">19.2.2 If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute through good faith negotiations and settlement, then the dispute shall be submitted to binding arbitration within thirty (30) days after demand for arbitration ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">(Emphasis added.) The language within the clause unambiguously limits its application to disputes between Schneider and NCS. This section of the Master Subcontract Agreement is explicitly labeled \u201cDisputes between Contractor and Subcontractor.\u201d The clause specifically uses the terms \u201cContractor,\u201d \u201cSubcontractor,\u201d and \u201cparties.\u201d An earlier provision within the contract defines \u201cContractor\u201d as Schneider and \u201cSubcontractor\u201d as NCS. \u201cParties\u201d is defined as \u201cContractor\u201d and \u201cSubcontractor.\u201d Moreover, the term \u201csurety\u201d is used in other provisions of the Master Subcontract Agreement\u2014\u201csurety\u201d and \u201cSubcontractor\u201d were clearly not intended to be interchangeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>In <em>Scarlett Harbor, </em>we held that a surety company could not compel a condominium developer to arbitrate their dispute under the mandatory arbitration clause in the subcontract between the developer and its contractor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 346 Md. at 129-30, 695 A.2d 153. Like this case, the surety\u2019s performance bond incorporated the subcontract by reference. <em>Id. </em>at 125, 695 A.2d 153. The arbitration clause at issue in <em>Scarlett Harbor </em>similarly referred explicitly to the parties to the contract. It provided for arbitration of \u201call claims, disputes and other matters in question between the Contractor and the Owner arising out of or relating to the Contract Documents or the breach thereof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 124, 695 A.2d 153 (alteration omitted). We explained, \u201cBy incorporating into the bond ... the contract that contains [the owner\u2019s] promise to arbitrate with [the contractor], [the surety] literally has incorporated as to [the owner] only [the owner\u2019s] promise to arbitrate with [the contractor.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 129, 695 A.2d 153. Accordingly, we held that the owner had not agreed to arbitrate with the surety. <em>Id. </em>at 130, 695 A.2d 153. This logic also applies here. By incorporating the arbitration clause by reference, Western has agreed to insure NCS\u2019s promise to arbitrate any dispute it has with Schneider. We should not alter the language of that promise to include Western.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">Recently, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia held that Western was not obliged to arbitrate its dispute with an owner under a similar arbitration clause incorporated in a performance bond by reference. In <em>Western Surety Co. v. U.S. Engineering Co., </em>211 F.Supp.3d 302 (D.D.C. 2016), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>court reasoned that because the subcontract mandated arbitration for \u201c[a]ny controversy or claim of Contractor against Subcontractor or Subcontractor against Contractor,\u201d \u201conly those two parties are bound by the arbitration agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 304, 309, The court explained that extending the arbitration clause to govern disputes with the surety \u201cwould render the phrase \u2018Contractor against Subcontractor or Subcontractor against Contractor\u2019 superfluous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 309. Likewise, holding that Western is bound by the NCS Subcontract\u2019s arbitration clause would impermissibly disregard its limiting language. <em>See Towson Univ. v. Conte </em>384 Md. 68, 81, 862 A.2d 941 (2004) (\u201ccourts do not interpret contracts in a manner that would render provisions superfluous or as having no effect\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Furthermore, a clause within the Bond providing for legal remedy demonstrates the parties\u2019 intent to litigate disputes arising under the Bond, not arbitrate them. The Bond\u2019s court action clause provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-5\">Any proceeding, legal or equitable, under this Bond may be instituted in any court of competent jurisdiction in the location in which the work or part of the work is located and shall be instituted within two years after the Contractor ceased working or within two years after the Surety refuses or fails to perform its obligations under this Bond, whichever occurs first.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">(Emphasis added.) Schneider claims that we can read this clause in harmony with the arbitration clause. It contends that the Bond, with the arbitration clause incorporated, gives Schneider the option of bringing claims through arbitration or through the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">But the language of the arbitration clause belies Schneider\u2019s claim. It states that if \u201cthe parties\u201d are unable to resolve their dispute through negotiations, \u201cthe dispute shall be submitted to binding arbitration within thirty (30) days after demand for arbitration ... unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Western was a surety, not a party. If the arbitration clause binds Western, as Schneider contends, neither Western nor Schneider could unilaterally decide to liti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>gate a dispute between them\u2014they would be forced to arbitrate. Such interpretation would flatly contradict the Bond\u2019s court action clause, which expressly permits litigation. We decline to construe the Bond in a manner that nullifies one of its provisions. <em>See Walker v. Dep\u2019t of Human Res., </em>379 Md. 407, 421, 842 A.2d 53 (2004) (citations omitted) (explaining that we interpret a contract so that, if possible, all of its provisions \u201cmay be given effect\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">We find support for our holding in <em>Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. v. Mandaree Public School District </em># <em>36, </em>503 F.3d 709 (8th Cir. 2007), in which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that a surety was not bound by an arbitration clause that governed disputes between the School District and its contractor.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 711. Like the case at hand, the arbitration clause \u201cprovided that disputes between [the School District] and ... [the] contractor would be resolved by arbitration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 710. The surety\u2019s performance bond \u201cincorporated the construction contract by reference\u201d and included a court action clause identical to the one at issue here. <em>Id. </em>The Eighth Circuit reasoned that the court action clause \u201ccontemp-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>lat[ed] that disputes [would] be resolved in court\u201d and held that \u201cthe incorporation clause in the performance bond at issue in this dispute does not mandate the surety to arbitrate.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 711 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">We hold that the arbitration clause, as' incorporated by reference into the Bond, does not compel Western to arbitrate its dispute with Schneider. Thus, the trial court properly granted partial summary judgment as to this issue.

It points to a <em>Scarlett Harbor </em>footnote, in which the Court stated, \u201cBy drafting the bond to incorporate, and not simply refer to, the [subcontract], [the surety\u2019s] conduct might be construed as a continuing offer to the obligee to arbitrate claims on the bond.

Schneider urges us to look to federal case law holding that a surety is bound by an arbitration clause in a subcontract incorporated by reference, But many of those cases are factually distinguishable from the case at hand. In some, the arbitration clause at issue did not refer to the particular parties to the subcontract. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Gilbane Bldg. Co., 992 </em>F.2d 386, 388 (1st Cir. 1993); <em>Tower Ins. Co. of New York v. Davis/Gilford, 967 </em>F.Supp.2d 72, 75 (D.D.C. 2013); <em>Cianbro Corp. v. Empresa Nacional de Ingenieria y Technologia, </em>697 F.Supp, 15, 16 (D.

Insofar as the remaining case Schneider points to is factually analogous, we disagree with the reasoning therein. <em>See Hoffman v.

Resurrection Baptist Church, </em>759 F.Supp.2d 665 (D. Md. 2010), the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland contrasted the court action clause in <em>Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. v. Mandaree Public School District </em># <em>36, </em>503 F.3d 709 (8th Cir. 2007), with the language used in the <em>Developers Surety </em>bond. <em>Id. </em>at 672. The <em>Developers Surety </em>bond provided that \"any suit under this bond <em>must </em>be instituted before the expiration of two (2) years from the date on which final payment under the Contract falls due.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original) (alteration omitted). The court explained that unlike the <em>Mandaree </em>court action clause, which used the term \"may,\u201d the provision at issue \"expresses a limitation on the right to bring suit under the bond, not an affirmation of a party\u2019s right to sue.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
