A potential defendant has an interest in repose and finality as to whether it will be necessary to mount a defense. The public has an interest in the efficient use of public resources\u2014what, in this context, is sometimes called judicial economy. The Legislature, as the primary policy-making branch of government, weighs those competing interests and establishes statutory limitations periods for bringing claims in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">Maryland law, nevertheless, allows parties, in some circumstances, to further restrict access to the courts by shortening limitations periods by contract. When will the courts recognize such clauses as superseding the legislative policy determination as to an appropriate period of limitations? Given the wide variety of contracts, the creativity of lawyers in devising contract clauses, and the disparity in bargaining power that sometimes exists, there is no simple answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-10\">This case concerns the standard \u201cGeneral Terms and Conditions\u201d of a residential furnace maintenance agreement offered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>by Respondent Carroll Home Services, LLC (\u201cCHS\u201d)-<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> One of those terms reduced the period for a consumer to bring a tort or contract claim against CHS from the statutory three years to one year, although it did not limit the time period for CHS to make a claim against a consumer. Petitioners Richard and Daphne Ceccone, who had entered into a maintenance agreement with CHS, asserted tort and contract claims against CHS for damage to their residence that they attributed to the company. They filed their complaint well before the expiration of three years, but arguably more than a year after their claims accrued. The Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County dismissed their complaint on the basis of the shortened limitations provision in the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"Acj\">We adopt the approach previously articulated by the Court of Special Appeals and hold that contractually-shortened limitations periods, like the one at issue here, are valid only if (1) there is no statute to the contrary; (2) the provision is not the result of fraud, duress, misrepresentation, or the like; and (3) the provision is reasonable in light of all pertinent circumstances. Because the Circuit Court did not consider potential contract defenses or make an explicit finding on reasonableness, we remand the case to that court so that it may decide how those factors affect the validity of the limitations-shortening provision in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"Aps\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"A7d\">\n<em>A. Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A1pg\">\n<em>The Maintenance Agreement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A6S\">At the time of the events underlying this case, the Ceccones heated their home in Anne Arundel County by means of an oil-fueled furnace.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They entered into a maintenance agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>ment for that furnace with CHS. CHS offered the maintenance agreement\u2014titled \u201cCarroll Home Services Ultra Oil Plan\u201d\u2014to customers to whom it supplied oil.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">Under the maintenance agreement, CHS agreed to provide 24-hour-a-day service for no-heat emergencies, to repair specified boiler parts if they became defective due to normal wear and tear, and to conduct a yearly \u201ctune-up\u201d of the heating system. The customer agreed to properly vent the heating system, to maintain clean air filters, and to replace batteries as needed, among other things.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The \u201cGeneral Terms and Conditions\u201d of the agreement appear in 18 numbered paragraphs on the back of the pre-printed form that comprises the agreement. Among the items set forth in those paragraphs are the duration of the agreement, procedures for cancellation, conditions for coverage under the agreement, exclusions from coverage, disclaimers of warranties, notices of costs a customer will incur for late payment or non-payment, and limitations of CHS\u2019s liability, among other things. Pertinent to this case, Paragraphs 9 and 10 provide as follows<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-6\">9. IRREGULAR PAYMENT AND DELAY IN ENFORCEMENT\u2014We can accept late payments, partial payments or payments marked \u201cpayment in full\u201d without losing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>any of our rights under this Agreement, <em>We can also delay enforcing any of our rights under this Agreement without losing any of our rights under this Agreement.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Afg\">10. LIMITS OF LIABILITY\u2014We will not be responsible for loss or damages due to or resulting from: changes in oil consumption; improper operation of an attic fan or alternate fuel device; your failure to schedule service and or tune-ups; acts of God; terrorism; strikes; riots; material or labor shortages; fire; flood; hurricane; power interruption or loss; accidents; governmental acts; abuse or misuse of equipment; spontaneous part failure; insufficient water; frozen or jelled oil lines; or any other conditions beyond our reasonable control, including a vacant, unattended or unoccupied premises (in this Agreement, the term \u201cvacant or unattended premises\u201d shall mean premises at which no adult occupant is present for at least twenty-four (24) consecutive hours). TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, we will have no liability for direct or indirect, special or consequential damages of any kind. We are not responsible for secondary damage as a result of a delay in rendering service. To the extent any warranty exists, our liability for any warranty claim will be limited, as permitted by law, to the repair or replacement of defective parts or service provided under this Agreement. <em>Any and all actions, whether based in contract or tort, whether for personal injury or property damage, and whether brought by Buyer or Buyer\u2019s insurance company, must be commenced within one year of the cause of action or shall be barred as a matter of law. </em>IN NO EVENT SHALL OUR LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE EXCEED $1,000, INCLUDING ANY LIABIILTY UNDER SECTION 11.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-U\">(capitalized emphasis in original; italicized emphasis added). As is evident, Paragraph 10 provides that any actions brought by the <em>Buyer\u2014i.e., </em>the Ceccones\u2014-including tort or contract claims must be brought within one year of accrual of the cause of action. This provision was apparently intended to shorten the three-year period of limitations that would otherwise apply to such claims pursuant to Maryland Code, Courts <em>&amp; </em>Judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>Proceedings Article (\u201cCJ\u201d), \u00a7 5-101. There is no corresponding provision that shortens the period of limitations for CHS or that requires it to bring a claim within one year. Rather, Paragraph 9 purported to permit CHS to delay enforcing its rights under the agreement \u201cwithout losing any of [its] rights under the agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">\n<em>An Incident with the Furnace</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">During April 2014, there was an incident involving the Ceccones\u2019 furnace that caused some damage to their home. For purposes of this opinion, the details of that incident and the damages are not important. It suffices to say that the Ceccones suspected that faulty maintenance by CHS was responsible. According to the Ceccones, they consulted with an engineer and insurance adjuster, as well as another furnace maintenance company, all of which confirmed their belief that CHS was at fault. After conducting that investigation, they asked CHS to pay the cost of remedying the damage. Some negotiations ensued during 2015, but the parties ultimately did not agree on a resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">B. <em>Legal Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">\n<em>Proceedings in the District Court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">On December 24, 2015, the Ceccones filed a <em>pro se </em>small claims action in the District Court of Maryland sitting in Anne Arundel County. <em>See </em>CJ \u00a7 4-405; Maryland Rule 3-701. The Ceccones sought damages in the amount of $3,694.39, as well as costs. The complaint alleged that CHS had improperly maintained their heating system, and that this improper maintenance was both fraudulent and a breach of the parties\u2019 contract. CHS filed a Notice of Intend to Defend on January 19, 2016. On January 29, 2016, the Ceccones filed an amended complaint that added documentation concerning the requested damages and increased the amount requested by about $70. The amended complaint also added an allegation that CHS had not complied with certain licensing requirements.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>On March 17, 2016, the District Court dismissed the case, apparently on the basis of the shortened limitations period set forth in the maintenance agreement, and entered judgment in favor of CHS. The Ceccones then pursued a <em>de novo </em>appeal in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. <em>See </em>CJ \u00a7 12-401(f) (providing for <em>de novo </em>appeal in a circuit court when the amount in controversy does not exceed $5,000); Maryland Rule 7-102.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">\n<em>Proceedings in the Circuit Court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The Circuit Court conducted a brief hearing on the matter on July 8, 2016, At the outset, counsel for CHS noted that CHS denied liability, but advised the court that he wished to raise a limitations defense as a \u201cpreliminary matter.\u201d He directed the court\u2019s attention to the limitations-shortening provision in the maintenance agreement and asserted that the Ceccones were \u201con notice\u201d of a potential claim as of October 2014,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> more than a year before they filed suit in December 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">The Circuit Court then turned to Mr. Ceccone, who argued that the shortened limitations period should not be enforced and proceeded to relate some of the reasons why the Ceccones believed that CHS had made misrepresentations that affected the enforceability of the contract. After hearing briefly from counsel for CHS concerning some of those allegations, the Circuit Court engaged in the following discussion with Mr. Ceccone concerning whether the shortened limitations provision should supersede the statutory three-year period for tort and contract claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>THE COURT: Well, sir, I don\u2019t think I can get around the language of the contract. The contract is very-clear that the action must be filed within one year. And that\u2019s clear. You contracted that way and that\u2019s part of the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-4\">MR. CECCONE: But I entered into the contract, Your Honor, as a result of believing that they were properly licensed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-5\">THE COURT: Well, you\u2014but you may have some action with the\u2014whoever regulates that company, bringing it to their attention. But so far as the Court is concerned you entered into a contract. You know what a contract is because you\u2019re in the real estate business. The terms are very clear. It says it must be filed within one year regardless of all of the background.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-6\">MR. CECCONE: Well, Your Honor, I discovered on January of this year that, in fact, they did not provide\u2014 they were not properly insured to perform that work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-7\">THE COURT: Well, and maybe that\u2019s something you can take up with the regulatory agency. But that\u2019s not anything I can do\u2014handle. I\u2019m only here on the contract. The contract is clear that you must file the action within one year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-8\">And so I have no other\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-9\">MR. CECCONE: But the statute of limitations is three years. That\u2019s the statutory\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-10\">THE COURT: That\u2019s the general. But you can contract it out. You can contract and make it six months, three\u2014 30 days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-11\">MR. CECCONE: But who\u2019s\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-12\">THE COURT: That\u2019s between you and [CHS].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-13\">MR. CECCONE: Yeah. But would a reasonable person determine that that\u2019s a reasonable amount of one year?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-14\">THE COURT: Well, I\u2019ve seen it before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>MR. CECCONE: Well, that\u2019s\u2014I understand that\u2019s the case. You\u2019ve seen it before. But what\u2019s basically happened is, is the contractor is setting an arbitrary amount of time for someone\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-4\">THE COURT: Well, you could have, when you entered into the contract, said, look, I\u2019m not going to agree to one year. It\u2019s got to be three years. You could have said that and then put that in the agreement. But you know what a contract is being in the real estate business. Whatever it\u2019s contracted for, you\u2019re stuck with.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">After further discussion with Mr. Ceccone about whether the allegedly false representations by CHS could be a basis for rescinding the contract, including the one-year limitations period, the Circuit Court rendered judgment in favor of CHS based on limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">After judgment was entered in CHS\u2019s favor, the Ceccones appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. Because any further appellate review in this case properly belongs in this Court,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the Court of Special Appeals transferred the appeal to this Court pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-132. We treated the Notice of Appeal as a petition for a writ of certiorari, which we granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">There is a single issue presented for our review:<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In dismissing the complaint, did the Circuit Court properly determine that the shortened one-year period of limitations set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>forth in the maintenance agreement superseded the three-year statutory period of limitations?</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">\n<em>A. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">When deciding whether to grant a motion to dismiss a complaint as a matter of law, a trial court is to assume the truth of factual allegations made in the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences from those allegations in favor of the plaintiff. When an appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss, the appellate court applies the same standard to assess whether the trial court\u2019s decision was legally correct. <em>Heavenly Days Crematorium, LLC v. Harris, Smariga and Associates, Inc., </em>433 Md. 558, 568, 72 A.3d 199 (2013). Because this review concerns resolution of a question of law, an appellate court does not accord any special deference to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">\n<em>B. Enforcement of Contractual Limitations Clauses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Statutes of limitations are designed to balance the competing interests of plaintiffs, defendants, and the public. A statutory period of limitations represents a policy judgment by the Legislature that serves the interest of a plaintiff in having adequate time to investigate a cause of action and file suit, the interest of a defendant in having certainty that there will not be a need to respond to a potential claim that has been unreasonably delayed, and the general interest of society in judicial economy. <em>Pennwalt Corp. v. Nasios, </em>314 Md. 433, 437-38, 550 A.2d 1155 (1988); <em>Pierce v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., </em>296 Md. 656, 665, 464 A.2d 1020 (1983). In enacting the three-year statute of limitations that governs most tort and contract actions, the General Assembly thus made a policy decision as to an appropriate deadline for the filing of such a claim by a reasonably diligent plaintiff. <em>See </em>CJ \u00a7 5-101.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>This is not to say that a period of limitations is immutable. Statutes of limitation are not ordinarily jurisdictional, and parties may essentially lengthen them by waiving limitations<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or by agreeing to toll the period of limitations for a particular claim that might otherwise become barred.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Similarly, parties may, in some circumstances, agree to shorten the period of limitations in a way that the courts will recognize.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">States have taken different approaches as to whether, and the extent to which, parties to a contract may agree in advance to shorten a statutory limitations period. Among the states that prohibit such provisions, some have enacted laws containing such a prohibition,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> while others have imposed that prohibition judicially on the basis of public policy.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In other states, courts appear to allow for contractually-shortened limitations periods, absent a defense to contract formation,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>courts have assessed such provisions according to a criterion of reasonableness.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In any event, it seems safe to say that \u201cwhere a limitations period is imposed by a contract rather than by a statute, the public policy considerations that typically weigh in favor of strict enforcement of the limitations period do not apply.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">Maryland law has combined these approaches. There are some provisions in the Maryland Code that explicitly bar any effort to shorten a statute of limitations. <em>See, e.g., </em>Maryland Code, Insurance Article (\u201cIN\u201d), \u00a7 12-104 (provision in insurance or surety contract that purports to shorten period of limitations is \u201cagainst State public policy, illegal, and void\u201d);<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>see also St. Paul Travelers v. Millstone, </em>412 Md. 424, 987 A.2d 116 (2010) (applying IN \u00a7 12-104 to hold a contractually-shortened limitations period void). Otherwise, the validity of a contractual provision that purports to shorten a statutory limitations period is measured by its reasonableness and by whether certain defenses to contract formation can be established. The Court of Special Appeals aptly summarized the Maryland approach: \u201c[Pjarties may agree to a provision that modifies the limitations result that would otherwise pertain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>provided (1) there is no controlling statute to the contrary, (2) it is reasonable, and (3) it is not subject to other defenses such as fraud, duress, or misrepresentation.\u201d <em>College of Notre Dame of Maryland, Inc. v. Morabito Consultants, Inc., </em>132 Md.App. 158, 174, 752 A.2d 265 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">The requirement of a showing of reasonableness is consistent with this Court\u2019s general approach to contractual provisions that purport to override otherwise governing law. In particular, in assessing provisions concerning liquidated damages,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> forum selection,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and choice of law,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> this Court has held that the validity of the particular provision turned on its reasonableness. Among the factors to be considered in assessing reasonableness are the subject matter of the contract, the duration of the shortened limitations period compared to the period that would otherwise govern,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the relative bargaining power of the parties to the contract,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>the shortened limitations period is a one-sided provision that applies to one party but not the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">This Court has recognized that the principle of freedom of contract \u201cserves the public interest in having individuals exercise broad powers to structure their own affairs by making legally enforceable promises.\u201d <em>Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission v. Washington Nat. Arena, </em>282 Md. 588, 606, 386 A.2d 1216 (1978). On the other hand, the Court has also noted that the principle loses force and its public policy foundation when a contractual provision that purports to supersede existing law is exacted as a result of superior bargaining power. <em>Id. </em>at 612, 386 A.2d 1216 (\u201cIn such cases, a court might well elect to refuse implementation\u201d); <em>cf. Wolf v. Ford, </em>335 Md. 526, 531-32, 644 A.2d 522 (1994) (exculpatory clauses upheld unless, among other things, there is an \u201cobvious disadvantage in bargaining power\u201d between the parties or if they appear in \u201ctransactions affecting the public interest\u201d); <em>Walther v. Sovereign Bank, </em>386 Md. 412, 426, 872 A.2d 736 (2005) (arbitration clauses upheld unless unconscionable). Indeed, it is notable that many of the cases upholding shortened limitations periods involve sophisticated contracts between parties with roughly similar bargaining power. <em>See, e.g., College of Notre Dame of Maryland, Inc. v. Morabito Consultants, Inc., </em>132 Md.App. 158, 174, 752 A.2d 265 (2000) (construction contract between college and contractor); <em>Harbor Court Associates v. Leo A. Daly Co., </em>179 F.3d 147 (4th Cir. 1999) (contract between developer and architectural firm described as \u201csophisticated business actors\u201d).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>\n<em>C. Application to this Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">In this case we must assess whether the Circuit Court considered the relevant criteria to decide whether to enforce the provision in Paragraph 10 of the General Terms and Conditions that purported to shorten the statute of limitations for the Ceccones to file a tort or contract claim. As outlined by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Morabito, </em>the relevant questions are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-5\">(1) Is there a controlling statute to the contrary?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-6\">(2) Is the provision subject to defenses such as fraud, duress, or misrepresentation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-7\">(3) Is the provision reasonable?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">In this case, no statute has been cited to us\u2014or to the Circuit Court\u2014that, like IN \u00a7 12-104, would categorically bar a home services maintenance agreement from including a provision that shortens the period of limitations. Nor are we aware of one.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">With respect to the second question, the Ceccones have not asserted duress. They have alleged, however, that CHS made misrepresentations that they felt were material and that amounted to fraud and complained about an alleged failure of CHS to respond to discovery on the subject. No evidence was taken on the issue. It appears from the record in this case that the Circuit Court did not evaluate those allegations in assessing the limitations provision in the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">Nor did the Circuit Court assess the reasonableness of the limitations shortening provision. Instead, the court initially stated that Ceccones were bound by the one-year period in the agreement \u201cregardless of all of the <em>background\u201d\u2014ie., </em>the particular circumstances of the case that Mr. Ceccone had been attempting to recite. When Mr. Ceccone pointed to the three year statutory period of limitations, the court opined that the three-year period in CJ \u00a7 5-101 is \u201cgeneral\u201d and that parties may \u201ccontract it out ... and make it six months, 30 days.\u201d When Mr. Ceccone raised the issue of reasonableness of shortening the limitations period to one year in this context, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>the Circuit Court responded only that it had \u201cseen it before\u201d and did not consider the reasonableness of the provision in relation to the agreement before it.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">On remand, the Circuit Court should consider whatever evidence that the Ceccones may produce concerning misrepresentation and fraud by CHS and determine whether it undermines the validity of the shortened limitations period in the agreement.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The Circuit Court should also explicitly determine whether the shortened limitations period is reasonable. In doing so, the court should consider the totality of the circumstances, including, for example, the length of the shortened limitations period (here, 1 year), its relation to the statutory period (one-third), the relative bargaining power of the parties,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> the subject matter of the contract (an agreement to service an oil-based home heating system), whether the shortened limitations period applies only to claims brought by one of the parties or runs in both directions,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and other facets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>of the limitations <em>provision\u2014e.g., </em>it appears to apply equally to claims of negligence and intentional torts.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-1\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b724-2\">We hold that a contractual provision that purports to shorten the statutorily-prescribed time for bringing a civil action is enforceable only if: (1) there is no statute to the contrary; (2) the provision is not the product of fraud, duress, misrepresentation, or the like; and (3) the provision is reasonable in light of all the circumstances. In this case, the trial court must assess, in the first instance, whether the criteria for enforcement of the provision are met and, in particular, whether the provision is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-3\">Judgment of the Circuit court for Anne Arundel County Vacated and Case Remanded to that Court for further Proceedings Consistent with this Opinion.

In any event, there does not appear to be any dispute concerning the terms of the maintenance agreement, which is the operative legal document pertaining to the issue before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b711-8\">. The record does not disclose how much the Ceccones paid CHS for the agreement, but the pre-printed terms indicate that a customer would \"receive an invoice ... with [the] Agreement,\u201d which must be paid \"in full upon receipt\u201d or be subject to late fees and collection costs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b711-9\">. The agreement defines the pronouns \"we,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d \"our,\u201d and \u201cours\u201d to refer to the <em>Seller\u2014i.e., </em>CHS. The pronouns \"you,\u201d \"your,\u201d and \"yours\u201d are defined to refer to the <em>Buyer\u2014i.e., </em>the Ceccones. It is perhaps also notable that the quoted paragraphs, as well as the other terms and conditions, appear in a considerably smaller font than they do in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b713-9\">. In that regard, the Ceccones asserted that CHS did not employ a heating, ventilation, air-conditioning, and refrigeration (\"HVAC-R\u201d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>master technician as required by law, that CHS had falsely represented that it <em>did </em>properly employ an HVAC-R technician at the time the parties entered into the contract, and that this allegedly false representation was fraudulent. Although not entirely clear from the complaint, it appears that the Ceccones asserted that the alleged fraud was both (1) an independent tort and therefore a basis of recovery and (2) a basis on which to rescind the contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b714-10\">. It is not entirely clear from the record why CHS believed that the claim accrued in October 2014. In its filings and argument in this Court, CHS appears to argue that any claim accrued in April 2014.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b716-10\">. CJ \u00a7 12-305.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b716-11\">, The Ceccones initially attempted to raise a number of other issues pertaining to the proceedings in the District Court and the Circuit Court, but have properly focused their brief in this Court on the basis of the Circuit Court's dismissal of their action. That is the issue that we address.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b717-8\">.

An amicus brief filed by the Public Justice Center argues that such a provision in a \"contract of adhesion\u201d\u2014essentially a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d contract provided to a consumer without the opportunity to negotiate a modification\u2014should not be enforced. While this suggestion has some force, it is important for a court to focus on the underlying issues\u2014e.g., inequality of bargaining power, one-sidedness of a provision\u2014as opposed to the label that might be attached to the contract,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b723-5\">. Before us, CHS argues that the court \"implicitly\u201d found the provision to be reasonable. However, it is difficult to credit this argument when the court explicitly declined to analyze the reasonableness of the provision when that issue was raised by Mr. Ceccone and stated that it believed that the Ceccones were, in its words, \"stuck with\u201d whatever shortened limitation period was set forth in the pre-printed form, even if the period had been as brief as 30 days. It does not appear that the court believed that it had discretion to evaluate the reasonableness of that provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b723-6\">. We express no opinion on the merits of those allegations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b723-7\">. In this regard, the Ceccones have claimed that the parent company of CHS controls a number of the providers of these services in Anne Arundel County, suggesting that this allows CHS to impose one-sided terms. The Circuit Court did not accept any evidence on this allegation\u2014or any other issue related to the limitations period\u2014and we cannot assess it on appellate review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b723-8\">. As noted earlier, Paragraph 10 of the General Terms and Conditions of the maintenance agreement purports to shorten the period of time for a buyer like the Ceccones (or their insurer) to bring a contract or tort action against CHS, but does not restrict the time for CHS to file suit, while Paragraph 9 of the agreement purports to excuse CHS from delay in enforcing its rights. In this regard the General Terms and Conditions are forgiving as to CHS in that any delay in enforcement is excused while it is unforgiving with respect to the Ceccones even where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>they attributed the filing of their claim beyond one year to their effort to investigate and satisfy themselves that CHS was actually responsible for the damage to their home.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
