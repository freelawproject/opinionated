In response to the petition, the State asserted that Mr. Rich\u2019s claims were without merit and should be denied without a hearing. The <em>coram nobis </em>court agreed with the State, and denied Mr. Rich\u2019s petition without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-13\">When Mr. Rich appealed the decision to the Court of Special Appeals, the State asserted for a second time that the record of the 2001 plea hearing was sufficient to establish that the guilty plea was knowing and voluntary. Moreover, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>State\u2019s primary argument on appeal was that Mr. Rich waived the right to seek <em>coram nobis </em>relief by failing to file an application for leave to appeal his 2001 guilty plea. Thus, the State urged the intermediate appellate court to affirm the <em>coram nobis </em>court\u2019s denial of Mr. Rich\u2019s petition without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Mr. Rich\u2019s appeal was then delayed for five years, during which time this Court decided <em>State v. Smith, </em>443 Md. 572, 117 A.3d 1093 (2015). In <em>Smith, </em>we held that a defendant does not waive the right to seek <em>coram nobis </em>relief by failing to file an application for leave to appeal a guilty plea. <em>Id. </em>at 595, 117 A.3d 1093. Following our decision in <em>Smith, </em>the Court of Special Appeals lifted the stay on Mr. Rich\u2019s appeal, and set the case for consideration in March 2016. At no point after our decision in <em>Smith, </em>or after the Court of Special Appeals lifted the stay on Mr. Rich\u2019s appeal, did the State supplement or amend its earlier arguments in its brief to account for the evolution in <em>coram nobis </em>jurisprudence that had occurred in the intervening five years since the State filed its initial brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The Court of Special Appeals decided Mr. Rich\u2019s appeal in August 2016. The intermediate appellate court held, pursuant to <em>Smith, </em>that Mr. Rich had not waived his <em>coram nobis </em>claim by failing to file an application for leave to appeal his 2001 guilty plea. On the merits of his claim, the Court of Special Appeals determined, based on the record of the 2001 plea hearing, that Mr. Rich\u2019s guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary, and therefore the <em>coram nobis </em>court erred by denying him relief based on this ground. The Court of Special Appeals then remanded the case for the <em>coram nobis </em>court to consider whether Mr. Rich was suffering significant collateral consequences as a resiilt of his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Following the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decision, the State filed a motion for reconsideration in that court. In its motion, the State argued, for the first time, that the record of the 2001 plea hearing was inadequate for the intermediate appellate court to determine whether Mr. Rich\u2019s guilty plea was knowing and voluntary. Thus, the State requested, midstream, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>the Court of Special Appeals order a remand for the <em>comm nobis </em>court to conduct an evidentiary hearing on the merits of Mr. Rich\u2019s claim. The Court of Special Appeals denied the motion for reconsideration, and reissued its opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Before this Court, the State asks us to determine whether the Court of Special Appeals erred by denying its motion for reconsideration requesting a remand on the merits of Mr. Rich\u2019s claim. For the reasons that follow, we hold that the Court of Special Appeals did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion, and therefore we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">\n<em>A. The Guilty Pleas</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">On December 29, 1993, Mr. Rich pleaded guilty in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City to possession with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance. The circuit court sentenced Mr. Rich to five years of incarceration, all suspended, and eighteen months of supervised probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">On October 23, 2001, Mr. Rich pleaded guilty in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City to possession with intent to distribute marijuana and conspiracy to distribute marijuana. The plea hearing took place simultaneously with the plea hearing of another, wholly unrelated defendant named Michael Thomas.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the hearing, Mr. Thomas\u2019 defense attorney, Tom Kane, qualified both his client and Mr. Rich prior to the circuit court accepting the guilty pleas. Mr. Rich\u2019s defense attorney, John Denholm, said very little at the hearing. After explaining to both defendants the rights they were giving up by choosing to plead guilty, Mr, Kane addressed the four potential grounds for appellate review of a guilty plea:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-10\">MR. KANE: The fourth ground has a couple parts. One is whether or not you understand the charge. Mr. Thomas and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>Mr. Rich, you\u2019re both pleading guilty to possession kind of offenses and possession can be either actual possession, meaning it\u2019s on a part of you\u2014in your pockets, holding it in your hand like a pen\u2014or constructive possession, meaning that\u2019s in the vicinity of where you are, and you are exercising dominion, meaning ownership, and control over it, meaning that if somebody tried to take it, you could stop them, such as my briefcase over on one of the chairs. I\u2019m not touching it in any way, but I\u2019m in constructive possession of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">Possessing it with the intent to distribute it means you\u2019re having the intent to transfer that possession from you to somebody else. That could be giving it away, it could be selling it, as long as the possession transfers. There doesn\u2019t have to be any money involved. A gift is a transfer of possession. So that\u2019s the possessing it with the intent to give it to somebody else, as opposed to use it all for yourself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-7\">And, Mr. Rich, you understand you\u2019re charged with marijuana and that\u2019s another one of those substances that the Legislature says you can\u2019t have?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">MR. RICH: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-9\">MR. KANE: Is there anything about the charge of possessing it with the intent to distribute it that you don\u2019t understand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-10\">MR. RICH: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">Neither Mr. Kane nor Mr. Denholm explained to Mr. Rich, at the plea hearing, the nature of the charge of conspiracy to distribute marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-12\">After the circuit court found that Mr. Rich\u2019s guilty plea was knowing and voluntary, the prosecutor read into the record the statement of facts supporting his plea:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-13\">During the course of their observations, the officers observed approximately eight times where persons would hand United States currency to both Mr, Cook and Mr. Rich. The money would be collected on every occasion, and on every occasion, Mr. Cook and Mr. Rich would respond northbound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>from their location to a house which was later found to be 825 North Collington Avenue, a vacant house. Both were observed to reach into the front window of the house and respond back to the location of the person who would surrender currency to them. Mr. Cook and Mr. Rich were observed to hand unknown objects to these persons, who would accept the objects and walk out of the area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">During the course of those observations, Mr. Armistead was observed to be standing with both Mr. Cook and Mr. Rich, and was observed to approach a late-model black Ford pickup truck, who pulled to the side of the street,... Through the information that was received, the observations made, and the actions of Mr. Cook, Mr. Rich, and Mr. Armistead, the officers believed that all three were working together to sell narcotics in the block and were keeping the narcotics in the vacant house at 825 North Collington Avenue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Based on this statement of facts, the circuit court found Mr. Rich guilty of possession with intent to distribute marijuana and conspiracy to distribute marijuana. The court sentenced Mr. Rich to three years of incarceration, all suspended, and three years of supervised probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">On April 19, 2002, Mr. Rich pleaded guilty in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City to second-degree assault. The circuit court sentenced Mr. Rich to ten months of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">On January 9, 2009, Mr. Rich pleaded guilty in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland to conspiracy to distribute cocaine and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. As part of his plea agreement, Mr. Rich \u201cagreed\u201d that he was a \u201ccareer offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The federal court sentenced Mr. Rich to 188 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>months (15 years and 8 months) of incarceration. Mr. Rich is currently serving this sentence at a federal penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">\n<em>B. Coram Nobis Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">On June 29, 2009, Mr. Rich, acting <em>pro se, </em>filed three petitions for writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, challenging each of his three guilty pleas in the circuit court, respectively.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, and of particular relevance to this appeal, Mr. Rich argued, with respect to his 2001 guilty plea to conspiracy to distribute marijuana, that he was never informed of the elements of the conspiracy charge. Therefore, Mr. Rich asserted, his guilty plea to this charge was not knowing and voluntary, in violation of Maryland Rule 4-242(c).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Mr. Rich submitted an affidavit and a transcript of the 2001 plea hearing in support of his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">On August 10, 2009, the State filed answers to each of Mr. Rich\u2019s petitions, requesting that the <em>coram nobis </em>court deny each petition without a hearing. On September 1, 2009, Mr. Rich filed responses to the State\u2019s answer in each of the three cases, each one requesting that the <em>coram nobis </em>court vacate his conviction \u201cor in the alternative, conduct an evidentiary hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">On February 5, 2010, the <em>coram nobis </em>court entered orders in each of the three cases denying Mr. Rich\u2019s petitions without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>a hearing. In each of the orders, the court \u201cassume[d], without deciding,\u201d that Mr. Rich was suffering collateral consequences as a result of his guilty plea in the circuit court. In each case, the <em>coram nobis </em>court found that Mr. Rich had failed to meet his burden to show that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary. Regarding the 2001 guilty plea to conspiracy to distribute marijuana, the <em>coram nobis </em>court rejected Mr. Rich\u2019s contention that his plea was not knowing and voluntary because he was not informed of the elements of the conspiracy charge. The <em>coram nobis </em>court acknowledged that Mr. Rich \u201cwas not dictated the elements of conspiracy,\u201d but noted that \u201cit is not necessary to disclose the specific elements of each charge on the record for a crime.\u201d The <em>coram nobis </em>court concluded that \u201c[t]he statement of facts [read at the plea hearing] clearly indicated that two or more persons were combining to commit a criminal or unlawful act, which satisfies the requirement! ] of <em>State v. </em>Priet,\u201d 289 Md. 267, 424 A.2d 849 (1981) that the defendant must be aware of the nature of the charge to which he is pleading guilty. Mr. Rich appealed from the denials of his petitions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">\n<em>C. Proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AbR\">On November 18, 2010, Mr. Rich, acting <em>pro se, </em>filed a brief in the Court of Special Appeals. On April 1, 2011, Mr. Rich filed a corrected brief. On August 9, 2011, Benjamin C. Sutley entered his appearance on behalf of Mr. Rich. In October 2011, Mr. Sutley filed a second corrected brief on behalf of Mr. Rich.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In his briefs, Mr. Rich argued that the <em>coram nobis </em>court erred in denying his petitions because, <em>inter alia, </em>his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>guilty pleas in the circuit court were not knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">The State filed its brief in the Court of Special Appeals on December 9, 2011. In its brief, the State argued that Mr, Rich was not entitled to <em>coram nobis </em>relief for five reasons: 1) Mr. Rich waived any claim of error regarding his guilty pleas by failing to seek leave to appeal from each of them; 2) Mr. Rich\u2019s claims of error are barred by laches; 3) Mr. Rich is not suffering any collateral consequences from his convictions in the circuit court; 4) Mr. Rich\u2019s pleas in each case were knowing and voluntary; and 5) Mr. Rich\u2019s trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to file a motion for modification of sentence in each case. Specifically, regarding the fourth argument, the State asserted, \u201cThe records of the 2001 and 2002 plea hearings are sufficient to permit this Court to find that the totality of the circumstances compel the conclusion that both pleas were entered knowingly and voluntarily.\u201d Therefore, the State requested that the Court of Special Appeals affirm the <em>coram nobis </em>court\u2019s denials of Mr. Rich\u2019s petitions without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">On October 27, 2014, the Court of Special Appeals ordered that Mr. Rich\u2019s appeal be stayed pending a decision by this Court in <em>State v. Graves, </em>437 Md. 637, 89 A.3d 1104 (2014) (granting certiorari). This Court granted certiorari in <em>Graves </em>on April 18, 2014 to determine whether \u00a7 8-401 of the Criminal Procedure Article (\u201cCP\u201d) applies retrospectively. CP \u00a7 8-401, enacted in 2012, provides that \u201c[t]he failure to seek an appeal in a criminal case may not be construed as a waiver of the right to file a petition for writ of error coram nobis.\u201d On December 5, 2014, this Court dismissed <em>Graves </em>as moot prior to oral argument. <em>State v. Graves, </em>441 Md. 61, 105 A.3d 489 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Meanwhile, on July 18, 2014, this Court granted certiorari in <em>State v. Smith </em>to determine whether the <em>coram nobis </em>petitioner in that case had waived her right to seek <em>coram nobis </em>relief by failing to file an application for leave to appeal her conviction, and whether the petitioner had satisfied her burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>proving that her guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary. 443 Md. at 576, 117 A.3d 1093. We heard oral arguments in <em>Smith </em>on December 10, 2014. On' December 12, 2014, the Court of Special Appeals ordered that Mr. Rich\u2019s appeal remain stayed pending a decision by this Court in <em>Smith.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">This Court issued its opinion in <em>Smith </em>on July 13, 2015. On December 8, 2015, the Court of Special Appeals issued an order lifting the stay in Mr. Rich\u2019s appeal, requesting that the Appellee\u2019s (State\u2019s) Brief be filed on or before January 15, 2016, and scheduling the case for consideration in March 2016. In response to this order, the State informed the Court of Special Appeals that it had already filed its Appellee\u2019s Brief in December 2011, and did not request to amend or supplement that previously filed brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">On August 30, 2016, the Court of Special Appeals issued its decision in Mr. Rich\u2019s appeal. In a reported opinion, the intermediate appellate court held, pursuant to <em>Smith, </em>that Mr. Rich\u2019s claims for <em>coram nobis </em>relief were not waived or barred by laches. Addressing the merits of his claims, the court held that Mr. Rich\u2019s 1993 and 2002 guilty pleas were knowing and voluntary. However, reviewing the 2001 guilty plea for conspiracy to distribute marijuana, the intermediate appellate court held that the plea colloquy was insufficient to ensure that Mr. Rich understood the nature of the conspiracy charge. The Court of Special Appeals noted that the <em>coram nobis </em>\u201ccourt decided Mr. Rich\u2019s <em>coram nobis </em>petitions without a hearing, so there is no testimony apart from the plea hearing itself from which we can evaluate Mr. Rich\u2019s understanding of the charges.\u201d Therefore, the intermediate appellate court concluded that Mr. Rich\u2019s 2001 guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary. Finally, the Court of Special Appeals noted that the <em>coram nobis </em>court did not address whether Mr, Rich is suffering significant collateral consequences from his convictions, which Mr. Rich would have to show in order to receive <em>coram nobis </em>relief. The intermediate appellate court noted that this issue is one that the <em>coram nobis </em>\u201ccourt should resolve in the first instance.\u201d Accordingly, the Court of Special Appeals vacated the judgment of the <em>coram nobis </em>court with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>respect to the 2001 guilty plea, and remanded to the <em>coram nobis </em>court to consider the issue of collateral consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">On September 16, 2016, the State filed a motion for reconsideration of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 opinion. In its motion, the State requested, for the first time, that the Court of Special Appeals</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">remand this matter to the <em>[coram </em>nobis] court for a hearing on [Mr.] Rich\u2019s petition where [Mr.] Rich and the State have an opportunity to present evidence relevant to the <em>coram nobis </em>court\u2019s consideration of whether, in fact, [Mr.] Rich was unaware of the nature of the conspiracy charge prior to pleading guilty to it in 2001.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">Contrary to the State\u2019s previous assertions in the <em>coram nobis </em>court and in its brief to the Court of Special Appeals, the State now asserted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-8\">Because the <em>[coram </em>nobis] court did not hold a hearing on [Mr.] Rich\u2019s <em>coram nobis </em>petitions, the record before [the Court of Special Appeals] was inadequate to permit the Court to resolve [Mr.] Rich\u2019s <em>coram nobis </em>claim that he was unaware of the nature of the conspiracy charge that he pled guilty to in 2001.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">The State did not seek reconsideration of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 holdings that Mr. Rich\u2019s claims were not waived or barred by laches, or that a remand was required on the issue of whether Mr. Rich was facing collateral consequences from his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">On November 1, 2016, the Court of Special Appeals denied the State\u2019s motion for reconsideration, withdrew its original opinion, and filed a new reported opinion. In the new opinion, the Court of Special Appeals added a footnote responding to the State\u2019s belated request for a remand on whether Mr. Rich\u2019s 2001 plea was knowing and voluntary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-11\">The State did not ask for a remand on this point or proffer evidence it would have put on at a hearing, had there been one, but argued in its brief that we should infer Mr. Rich\u2019s understanding of the charges from his acknowledgement that counsel \u201chelp[ed] him understand what the trial would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>be all about and guid[ed] [him] in coming to th[e] decision\u201d to plead guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-4\"><em>Rich v. State, </em>230 Md.App. 537, 559 n.6, 148 A.3d 377 (2016) (alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">On November 15, 2016, the State petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, which this Court granted on January 9, 2017. <em>State v. Rich, </em>451 Md. 251, 152 A.3d 754 (2017). The State presents one question for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">Where the circuit court denied [Mr.] Rich\u2019s <em>coram nobis </em>petition challenging his 2001 conviction without a hearing, in light of <em>Smith v. State, </em>443 Md. 572, 117 A.3d 1093 (2015) (Part II), did the Court of Special Appeals err in not remanding this matter to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City for a hearing to determine whether [Mr.] Rich, in fact, was unaware of the nature of a conspiracy charge at the time of his plea?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">In reviewing the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 denial of the State\u2019s motion for reconsideration, \u201cour standard for review is whether the Court of Special Appeals abused its discretion in denying the motion.\u201d <em>Byrum v. Horning, </em>360 Md. 23, 33, 756 A.2d 560 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">A writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>\u201cis an \u2018extraordinary remedy\u2019 justified \u2018only under circumstances <em>compelling such action to achieve justice.\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>Smith, </em>443 Md. at 597, 117 A.3d 1093 (quoting <em>Skok v. State, </em>361 Md. 52, 72, 760 A.2d 647 (2000)). \u201c[C]oram nobis should be available to raise fundamental errors in attempting to show that a criminal conviction was invalid under circumstances where no other remedy is presently available and where there were sound reasons for the failure to seek relief earlier.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Skok, </em>361 Md. at 72-73, 760 A.2d 647).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>In <em>Skok, </em>this Court outlined five requirements for obtaining <em>coram nobis </em>relief: First, \u201cthe grounds for challenging the criminal conviction must be of a constitutional, jurisdictional or fundamental character.\u201d <em>Skok, </em>361 Md. at 78, 760 A.2d 647 (citing <em>United States v. Morgan, </em>346 U.S. 602, 612, 74 S.Ct. 247, 98 L.Ed. 248 (1954)). Second, \u201ca presumption of regularity attaches to the criminal case, and the burden of proof is on the coram nobis petitioner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Morgan, </em>346 U.S. at 512, 74 S.Ct. 247). Third, \u201cthe coram nobis petitioner must be suffering or facing significant collateral consequences from the conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 79, 760 A.2d 647. Fourth, \u201c[b]asic principles of waiver are applicable to issues raised in coram nobis proceedings. Similarly, where an issue has been finally litigated in a prior proceeding, and there are no intervening changes in the applicable law or controlling case law, the issue may not be relitigated in a coram nobis action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted) (citing <em>Morgan, </em>346 U.S. at 512, 74 S.Ct. 247). Fifth, \u201cone is not entitled to challenge a criminal conviction by a coram nobis proceeding if another statutory or common law remedy is then available.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 80, 760 A.2d 647.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">In <em>Smith, </em>this Court considered whether CP \u00a7 8-401 applies retrospectively to petitions for <em>coram nobis </em>relief filed prior to the statute\u2019s effective date of October 1, 2012. <em>Smith, </em>443 Md. at 588, 117 A.3d 1093. CP \u00a7 8-401 provides that \u201c[t]he failure to seek an appeal in a criminal case may not be construed as a waiver of the right to file a petition for writ of error coram nobis.\u201d After examining the statute, its legislative history, and this Court\u2019s caselaw on the nature of <em>coram nobis </em>relief, the <em>Smith </em>Court held that the statute does apply retrospectively to all cases that were pending in court when the statute became effective. <em>Smith, </em>443 Md. at 595, 117 A.3d 1093. In this case, the Court of Special Appeals applied this holding to Mr. Rich\u2019s petitions, which were pending in that court on the statute\u2019s effective date, and held that his claims for <em>coram nobis </em>relief were not waived. <em>Rich, </em>230 Md.App. at 549, 148 A.3d 377. The State does not contest this portion of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>The second issue in <em>Smith </em>was whether the <em>coram nobis </em>petitioner in that case had satisfied her burden to show that her guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary. <em>Smith, </em>443 Md. at 649, 117 A.3d 1093. To address this issue, the <em>Smith </em>Court clarified the distinction between challenging a guilty plea on direct appeal versus doing so through the \u201cextraordinary remedy\u201d of <em>coram nobis </em>relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\"><em>Daughtry </em>was an appeal of a conviction after a plea, not an appeal of a ruling on coram nobis. Thus, as this Court expressly framed it, the issue in <em>Daughtry </em>was not just whether the defendant understood the nature of the charges, but also whether the trial court was correct \u201cin determining whether [the] defendant understood the nature of the charges[.]\u201d This distinction is vital, as, in a coram nobis case such as this one, the only issue is whether the defendant understood the nature of the charges\u2014regardless of whether the trial court could determine as much. By contrast, in an appeal of a conviction after a plea such as the one in <em>Daughtry, </em>the ultimate issue depends on what the trial court could find, and that issue is necessarily limited to what happened at the plea hearing, which includes the entirety of what the trial court could find. Simply put, here, it does not matter what the trial court could find; what matters is whether Smith\u2019s lawyer told Smith about the nature of the charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-6\"><em>Id, </em>at 653, 117 A.3d 1093 (alterations in original) (distinguishing <em>State v. Daughtry, </em>419 Md. 35, 18 A.3d 60 (2011)). In other words, a defendant can successfully challenge a guilty plea on direct appeal by showing that the trial court did not follow the procedural requirements of Maryland Rule 4-242(c), which includes finding, on the record, that \u201cthe defendant is pleading voluntarily, with understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea.\u201d However, when challenging a guilty plea through a petition for writ of error <em>coram nobis, </em>the defendant is only entitled to relief if he or she can establish that, at the time of the plea, he or she was not, <em>in fact, </em>\u201cpleading voluntarily, with understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea,\u201d regardless of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>whether the trial court satisfied the procedural requirements of the Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Because of this distinction between what a defendant must show to successfully challenge a guilty plea on direct appeal versus through a <em>coram nobis </em>petition, the <em>Smith </em>Court noted a parallel distinction regarding the evidence that may be considered in each circumstance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">Based on the analysis above, we hold that a lawyer\u2019s testimony at a coram nobis hearing concerning having advised a defendant prior to the guilty plea of the nature of the charges against him or her is admissible. Such testimony may be considered in a coram nobis proceeding in determining whether a defendant pled \u201cvoluntarily, with understanding of the nature of the charge\u201d within the meaning of Maryland Rule 4-242(c).... Matters beyond the scope of the record of the guilty plea hearing are already, by nature of the proceeding, relevant to the trial court at a coram nobis proceeding. And, most importantly, a coram nobis proceeding\u2019s purpose is not to determine based on the record whether the trial court erred at the time of a guilty plea, but instead to determine whether a petitioner indeed knowingly and voluntarily pled guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 654, 117 A.3d 1093. Thus, when challenging a guilty plea on direct appeal, the reviewing court is limited to the record of the plea hearing itself. But, when challenging a guilty plea through a petition for writ of error <em>coram nobis, </em>the <em>coram nobis </em>court may consider additional evidence, such as the trial lawyer\u2019s testimony regarding his or her conversations with the defendant explaining the terms of the plea, in addition to the record of the plea hearing itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">The State draws upon our holding in <em>Smith </em>to argue that the Court of Special Appeals abused its discretion in this case when it denied the State\u2019s motion for reconsideration. The State contends that, based on our holding in <em>Smith, </em>\u201cthe Court of Special Appeals erred when it limited its review\u201d of Mr. Rich\u2019s <em>coram nobis </em>claims \u201cto the transcript of the plea hearings.\u201d The State also argues that the Court of Special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Appeals incorrectly undertook a <em>de novo </em>review of the <em>coram nobis </em>court\u2019s ruling, when the correct standard of review for the equitable remedy of <em>coram nobis </em>relief is abuse of discretion. Moreover, the State asserts that it \u201ccan hardly be faulted for failing to anticipate\u201d changes in the law of <em>coram nobis </em>while Mr. Rich\u2019s case sat dormant in the Court of Special Appeals for five years, and for failing to request a remand on the merits in the event that the court rejected its arguments concerning waiver and laches. Finally, the State contends that, by noting that the State did not \u201cproffer evidence it would have put on at a hearing, had there been one,\u201d <em>see Rich, </em>230 Md.App. at 559 n.6,148 A.3d 377, the Court of Special Appeals \u201cimproperly shifted the burden to the State to disprove [Mr.] Rich\u2019s claim that he was unaware of the nature of the conspiracy charge when he entered his plea.\u201d Therefore, the State requests that we vacate the decision of the Court of Special Appeals and remand Mr. Rich\u2019s petition to the <em>coram nobis </em>court for a hearing on his claim that his 2001 guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">Mr. Rich responds that the Court of Special Appeals properly reviewed his <em>coram nobis </em>claims based on the record before it, correctly determined that his 2001 guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary, and rightfully denied the State\u2019s motion for reconsideration requesting a remand on this point. Mr. Rich argues that the standard of review for <em>coram nobis </em>claims should be the same standard that is applied to other postconviction proceedings: factual findings are upheld unless clearly erroneous, while legal conclusions are reviewed <em>de novo. See, e.g., Arrington v. State, </em>411 Md. 524, 551, 983 A.2d 1071 (2009) (\u201cAlthough reviewing factual determinations of the post-conviction court under a clearly erroneous standard, we make an independent determination of relevant law and its application to the facts.\u201d (quoting <em>State v. Adams, </em>406 Md. 240, 255, 958 A.2d 295 (2008))). Mr. Rich contends that the Court of Special Appeals properly applied this standard to his claims, and correctly held that Mr. Rich \u201cmet his burdens to show a constitutional deficiency in his 2001 guilty plea, and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>rebut the presumption of regularity with regard to that guilty plea.\u201d <em>See Rich, </em>230 Md.App. at 559, 148 A.3d 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Furthermore, Mr. Rich notes that the State, which was a party to <em>Smith, </em>had over a year\u2014between when this Court decided <em>Smith </em>and when the Court of Special Appeals issued its original opinion in this case\u2014in which it could have amended or supplemented its original brief filed in 2011. Additionally, the State had eight months to supplement its argument from the time the Court of Special Appeals lifted the stay, and five months from the time it set this case for consideration. Because the State failed to request a remand on whether Mr. Rich\u2019s 2001 guilty plea was knowing and voluntary at any point <em>before </em>the Court of Special Appeals issued its original opinion in this case, Mr. Rich asserts that the State cannot make such a request for the first time in a motion for reconsideration. Therefore, Mr. Rich concludes that the Court of Special Appeals did not abuse its discretion in denying the State\u2019s motion for reconsideration and belated request for a remand,</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The State misinterprets our holding in <em>Smith. </em>To reiterate, <em>Smith </em>held</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\">that a lawyer\u2019s testimony at a coram nobis hearing concerning having advised a defendant prior to the guilty plea of the nature of the charges against him or her is admissible. Such testimony may be considered in a coram nobis proceeding in determining whether a defendant pled \u201cvoluntarily, with understanding of the nature of the charge\u201d within the meaning of Maryland Rule 4-242(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-8\"><em>Smith, </em>443 Md. at 654, 117 A.3d 1093 (emphasis added). As Mr. Rich notes, \u201cThe State misconstrues this holding to <em>require, </em>rather than <em>allow, </em>a lawyer\u2019s testimony at a <em>coram nobis </em>hearing.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">This Court made clear in <em>Smith </em>that a <em>coram nobis </em>challenge to a guilty plea is fundamentally different from a challenge on direct appeal, and therefore the evidence that may be considered in each circumstance is correspondingly different as well. Specifically, while a challenge on direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>appeal is limited to the record of the plea hearing itself, a <em>coram nobis </em>challenge can also include testimony from the defendant\u2019s trial counsel concerning whether counsel discussed the nature of the charges and the terms of the plea with the defendant. However, the <em>Smith </em>Court did not state, nor imply, that such testimony <em>must </em>be considered in a <em>coram nobis </em>proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">In this case, the State requested that the <em>coram nobis </em>court deny Mr. Rich\u2019s petitions without a hearing. In the Court of Special Appeals, the State insisted that the record of Mr. Rich\u2019s 2001 guilty plea was sufficient for the court to decide that the plea was knowing and voluntary, and requested that the court make such a decision based on that record. Unlike in <em>Smith, </em>there was no testimony from Mr. Rich\u2019s trial counsel concerning his discussions with Mr. Rich regarding the 2001 guilty plea, because there was no <em>coram nobis </em>hearing at which counsel could have testified. And, there was no <em>coram nobis </em>hearing on the 2001 guilty plea because the <em>coram nobis </em>court acceded to the State\u2019s request to deny Mr. Rich\u2019s petitions <em>without a hearing. </em>Under these circumstances, where the State repeatedly asserted that the record of the 2001 plea hearing itself was sufficient to make a determination on whether the guilty plea was knowing and voluntary, and the <em>coram nobis </em>court made such a determination without holding an evidentiary hearing, and the State did not request a remand for an evidentiary hearing on this point while the case was on appeal, the Court of Special Appeals did not err in limiting its review of Mr. Rich\u2019s claims to the record of the 2001 plea hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Furthermore, we disagree with the State\u2019s contention that the Court of Special Appeals \u201cimproperly shifted the burden to the State to disprove [Mr.] Rich\u2019s claim that he was unaware of the nature of the conspiracy charge when he entered his plea.\u201d To the contrary, the intermediate appellate court expressly stated in its opinion that Mr. Rich \u201cmet his burdens to show a constitutional deficiency in his 2001 guilty plea, and to rebut the presumption of regularity with regard to that guilty plea.\u201d <em>Rich, </em>230 Md.App. at 559, 148 A.3d 377 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>(emphasis added). Thus, we read the reference in the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 footnote to the State\u2019s failure to \u201cproffer evidence it would have put on at a hearing, had there been one,\u201d <em>see id. </em>at 559 n.6, 148 A.3d 377, as merely providing an additional reason, beyond those we have already discussed, why that court did not exercise its discretion to order a remand on that point when none had been previously requested by the parties. While the State was not required to make such a proffer in order to receive a remand on the merits of Mr. Rich\u2019s challenge to the 2001 guilty plea, doing so may have given the intermediate appellate court a reason to order a remand when it previously had no reason to do so. Pointing out the State\u2019s failure to provide any basis for why a remand was suddenly necessary, when the State had consistently maintained the contrary position, does not equate to \u201cimproperly shifting] the burden to the State to disprove\u201d Mr. Rich\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Next, we address the parties\u2019 contentions regarding the proper standard of review for the denial of a petition for writ of error <em>coram nobis. </em>We note that, although neither party sought certiorari on whether the Court of Special Appeals applied the proper standard of review, this issue was briefed by both parties and is properly before us because it must be resolved in order to determine whether the intermediate appellate court abused its discretion in denying the State\u2019s motion for reconsideration. In other words, in order to determine whether the Court of Special Appeals properly reviewed the <em>coram nobis </em>court\u2019s denial of Mr. Rich\u2019s petition, we must determine what standard of review the intermediate appellate court should have applied, and whether it applied that standard correctly. The State argues that the standard of review should be abuse of discretion, primarily because <em>coram nobis </em>relief is an equitable remedy. Mr. Rich argues that the standard of review is the same as in other postconviction proceedings: findings of fact are upheld unless clearly erroneous, while legal determinations are reviewed <em>de novo. </em>In short, they are both right.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>No reported opinion in Maryland has ever defined the standard of review to be applied to <em>coram nobis </em>proceedings. Several recent unreported opinions in the Court of Special Appeals have borrowed the standard of review from postcon-viction proceedings under the Maryland Postconviction Procedure Act. <em>See, e.g., Crawley v. State, </em>No. 1634, Sept. Term, 2014, 2017 WL 475843, at *3 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. Feb. 6, 2017) (quoting <em>Arrington, </em>411 Md. at 551-52, 983 A.2d 1071); <em>Collins v. State, </em>No. 0503, Sept. Term, 2015, 2017 WL 35491, at *3 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. Jan. 4, 2017) (same); <em>Navarro v. State, </em>No. 0613, Sept. Term, 2015, 2016 WL 3460228, at *4 (Md. Ct. Spec.

Other recent unreported opinions from that court opted to apply the abuse of discretion standard instead. <em>See, e.g., Lombardos v. State, </em>No. 1338, Sept. Term, 2012, 2015 WL 7356491, at *5 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. Nov. 19, 2015); <em>Carter v. State, </em>No. 1165, Sept. Term, 2013, 2016 WL 856854, at *3 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. Mar. 3, 2016) (quoting Lombardos).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">Courts in other states are similarly divided on the proper standard of review for <em>coram nobis </em>proceedings. Tennessee applies an abuse of discretion standard. <em>See State v. Workman, </em>111 S.W.3d 10, 18 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2002). In Arkansas, \u201c[t]he standard of review of an order entered by the trial court on a petition for writ of error coram nobis is whether the trial court abused its discretion in granting or denying the writ.\u201d <em>Watson v. State, </em>510 S.W.3d 248, 251 (Ark. 2017). But, \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s findings of fact, on which it bases its decision to grant or deny the petition for writ of error coram nobis, will not be reversed on appeal unless they are clearly erroneous or clearly against the preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In New Hampshire, the reviewing court will \u201caccept the trial court\u2019s factual findings unless they lack support in the record or are clearly erroneous, but review the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo.\u201d State v. Santamaria, </em>169 N.H. 722, 157 A.3d 409, 411 (2017) (borrowing standard of review from <em>habeas corpus </em>proceedings). West Virginia employs a mixed standard of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>review for <em>coram nobis </em>proceedings: \u201cWe review the final order and the ultimate disposition under an abuse of discretion standard, and we review the circuit court\u2019s underlying factual findings under a clearly erroneous standard. Questions of law are subject to a <em>de novo </em>review.\u201d <em>State v. Hutton, </em>235 W.Va. 724, 776 S.E,2d 621, 624 (2015) (quoting <em>State v. Allen, </em>208 W.Va. 144, 539 S.E.2d 87, 93 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Turning to the federal courts for guidance, we find more division. The First, Third, Sixth, and Ninth Circuits \u201cafford de novo review to the district court\u2019s legal conclusions and dear-error review to its findings of fact.\u201d <em>United States v. George, </em>676 F.3d 249, 256 (1st Cir. 2012); <em>see United States v. Orocio, </em>645 F.3d 630, 635 (3d Cir. 2011); <em>United States v.

The Fourth and Eleventh Circuits, on the other hand, \u201creview the district court\u2019s ultimate decision to deny the writ for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v, Akinsade, </em>686 F.3d 248, 252 (4th Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see Alikhani v. United States, </em>200 F.3d 732, 734 (11th Cir, 2000), And, in the Second and Fifth Circuits, a mixed standard of review (similar to that used in West Virginia) applies: \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the issue of whether the district court applied the proper legal standard, but we review the district court\u2019s ultimate decision to deny the writ for \u2018abuse of discretion,\u2019 \u201d <em>Fleming v. United States, </em>146 F.3d 88, 90 (2d Cir. 1998); <em>see Santos-Sanchez v. United States, </em>548 F.3d 327, 330 (5th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Seeing as our survey of other jurisdictions on this issue yields inconclusive results, we return to this Court\u2019s pronouncement in <em>Skok </em>that <em>coram nobis </em>relief is an \u201cextraordinary remedy\u201d that should be allowed \u201conly under circumstances compelling such action to achieve justice.\u201d <em>Skok, </em>361 Md. at 72, 760 A.2d 647 (quoting Morgan, 346 U.S. at 511, 74 S.Ct. 247). Because of the \u201cextraordinary\u201d nature of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>remedy, we deem it appropriate for appellate courts to review the <em>coram nobis </em>court\u2019s decision to grant or deny the petition for abuse of discretion. However, in determining whether the ultimate disposition of the <em>coram nobis </em>court constitutes an abuse of discretion, appellate courts should not disturb the <em>coram nobis </em>court\u2019s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous, while legal determinations shall be reviewed <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Now we must determine whether the Court of Special Appeals, in reviewing the <em>coram nobis </em>court\u2019s denials of Mr. Rich\u2019s petitions, properly employed the standard we have just articulated. The intermediate appellate court (understandably, based on the lack of uniformity addressing the standard of review in <em>coram nobis </em>cases) did not articulate precisely this standard when reviewing Mr. Rich\u2019s claims. Instead, the Court of Special Appeals purported to utilize the standard of review generally applicable to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel: \u201cwe will not disturb the circuit court\u2019s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. We will, however, exercise our own independent judgment as to the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s conduct and any prejudice that resulted.\u201d <em>Rich, </em>230 Md.App. at 553, 148 A.3d 377 (citing <em>State v. Prado, </em>448 Md. 664, 678-80, 141 A.3d 99 (2016)). The Court of Special Appeals did not state that the ultimate decision of the <em>coram nobis </em>court in granting or denying the requested relief is reviewed for abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">But, in evaluating Mr. Rich\u2019s 2001 guilty plea, the intermediate appellate court deferred to the factual findings of the <em>coram nobis </em>court, and reviewed its legal conclusions <em>de novo. </em>The Court of Special Appeals determined, based on this Court\u2019s case law, that the <em>coram nobis </em>court erred in ruling that the 2001 plea colloquy was sufficient to ensure that Mr. Rich understood the nature of the conspiracy charge to which he was pleading guilty. <em>Id. </em>at 558, 148 A.3d 377. Next, the Court of Special Appeals concluded that Mr. Rich had \u201cmet his burdens to show a constitutional deficiency in his 2001 guilty plea, and to rebut the presumption of regularity with regard to that guilty plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 559, 148 A.3d 377. Based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>this conclusion, the intermediate appellate court ordered a limited remand for the <em>coram nobis </em>court to consider whether Mr. Rich was suffering significant collateral consequences from his convictions, which the <em>coram nobis </em>court had \u201cassumed, without deciding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 559-60, 148 A.3d 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Although the Court of Special Appeals did not indicate that the <em>coram nobis </em>court\u2019s denial of Mr. Rich\u2019s petition challenging his 2001 guilty plea constituted an abuse of discretion, the intermediate appellate court concluded that the lower court committed an error of law in ruling that the 2001 plea colloquy was sufficient to ensure that Mr. Rich understood the nature of the conspiracy charge. As such, the Court of Special Appeals held that Mr. Rich\u2019s 2001 guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary. The involuntariness of a guilty plea is an error \u201cof a constitutional, jurisdictional or fundamental character\u201d that qualifies for <em>coram nobis </em>relief. <em>Skok, </em>361 Md. at 78, 760 A.2d 647; <em>see also id. </em>at 80-81, 760 A.2d 647 (\u201c[T]he courts have consistently held that the scope of a coram nobis proceeding encompasses issues concerning the voluntariness of a guilty or nolo contendere plea, and whether the record shows that such plea was understandingly and voluntarily made[.]\u201d). Thus, the <em>coram nobis </em>court necessarily abused its discretion by denying Mr. Rich\u2019s petition on this ground. Therefore, even if the Court of Special Appeals did not articulate the proper standard of review in reaching its conclusion, its denial of the State\u2019s motion for reconsideration requesting a remand on this point was proper, and thus was not an abuse of discretion by the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Finally, we address the State\u2019s contention that it \u201ccan hardly be faulted for failing to anticipate\u201d changes in the law of <em>coram nobis </em>while Mr. Rich\u2019s case \u201csat dormant\u201d in the Court of Special Appeals for five years, and for failing to request a remand on the merits of his claim in the event that the court rejected the State\u2019s arguments concerning waiver and laches. In short, we disagree. As Mr. Rich notes, the State, which was a party to <em>Smith, </em>had over a year\u2014between when this Court decided <em>Smith </em>and when the Court of Special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>Appeals issued its original opinion in this ease\u2014in which it could have amended or supplemented its original brief filed in 2011. Additionally, the State had eight months to supplement its argument from the time the Court of Special Appeals lifted the stay, and five months from the time it set this case for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Furthermore, when the Court of Special Appeals requested that the State file its brief on or before January 15, 2016, so that the case could be set for consideration in March 2016, the State responded by informing the court that it had already filed its brief in December 2011. In its Reply Brief to this Court, the State informs us that it did not request additional briefing when the Court of Special Appeals lifted the stay because, at the time, Mr. Rich \u201cwas unrepresented by counsel and\u201d his appeal \u201chad already been delayed for four years.\u201d Additionally, the State argues that, at the time it filed its brief in December 2011, Mr. \u201cRich\u2019s <em>coram nobis </em>claims were waived as a matter of law and a hearing was unnecessary.\u201d However, when this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Smith </em>made clear that Mr. Rich\u2019s <em>coram nobis </em>claims were not \u201cwaived as a matter of law,\u201d the State made no effort to supplement or amend its earlier argument in order to reflect this holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">We conclude that, by failing to request a remand on the merits of Mr. Rich\u2019s claim in either the <em>coram nobis </em>court or the Court of Special Appeals, even after this Court decided <em>Smith, </em>and by consistently asserting that a remand on the merits was <em>not </em>necessary to resolve Mr. Rich\u2019s claims, the State effectively waived any argument that a remand on the merits was, in fact, necessary. <em>See Hobby v. State, </em>436 Md. 526, 542, 83 A.3d 794 (2014) (\u201c[A] question not presented or argued in an appellant\u2019s brief is waived or abandoned and is, therefore, not properly preserved for review.\u201d (quoting <em>State v. Jones, </em>138 Md.App. 178, 230, 771 A.2d 407 (2001) (alteration in original), <em>aff'd, </em>379 Md. 704, 843 A.2d 778 (2004))). Therefore, where the State first presented its argument that a remand was necessary in a motion for reconsideration in the Court of Special Appeals, we hold that the intermediate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>appellate court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">We hold that the Court of Special Appeals did not abuse its discretion in denying the State\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b479-12\">. In the opinion below, the Court of Special Appeals referred to Mr. Thomas\u2019 defense attorney as \"Co-Defendant\u2019s Counsel.\u201d <em>Rich </em>v. <em>State, </em>230 Md.App. 537, 556-57, 148 A.3d 377 (2016). In fact, Mr. Thomas\u2019 case was wholly unrelated to Mr. Rich\u2019s case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b481-9\">. Pursuant to the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual, \u00a7 4331.1(a),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-10\">A defendant is a career offender if (1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction; (2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b482-10\">. Previously, on April 30, 2009, Mr. Rich filed a petition for writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>that improperly combined his challenges to both the 1993 guilty plea and the 2002 guilty plea in a single petition. On June 15, 2009, the <em>coram nobis </em>court dismissed without prejudice the improperly filed petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b482-11\">. At the time of Mr. Rich's 2001 guilty plea, Rule 4-242(c) provided, in pertinent part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-12\">The court may accept a plea of guilty only after it determines, upon an examination of the defendant on the record in open court conducted by the court, the State's Attorney, the attorney for the defendant, or any combination thereof, that (1) the defendant is pleading voluntarily, with understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea; and (2) there is a factual basis for the plea.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b483-6\">. On August 2, 2010, the <em>coram </em>nobis. court issued an order declaring that Mr. Rich\u2019s appeals from the court's denials of his petitions were timely filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b483-7\">. On October 15, 2013, by order of this Court, Mr. Sutley agreed to an indefinite suspension of his license to practice law in Maryland. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Sutley, </em>435 Md. 149, 77 A.3d 488 (2013). Mr. Rich did not retain a new lawyer after Mr. Sutley's suspension, so he was unrepresented when the Court of Special Appeals later lifted the stay on his appeal and issued its opinion. Before this Court, Mr. Rich was represented by counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
