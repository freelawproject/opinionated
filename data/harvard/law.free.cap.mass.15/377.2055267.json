The question, at the trial before <em>Parker, </em>C. J., was, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>whether the disease of which the horse died existed before the sale, or was acquired afterwards; and the Chief Justice stated that the fact was rendered very doubtful by the testimony. One <em>Richardson was offered as </em>a witness by the defendant, and testified in' the cause; which being so nicely balanced, the Chief Justice observed, his testimony was undoubtedly material.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-5\">No objection was made when he was offered ; but after the trial it appeared that he was one of the defendant\u2019s bail in this suit, which fact was not known to the plaintiff or his counsel, until after the trial. On this ground a motion was made by the plaintiff for a new trial, a verdict having been obtained by the defend ant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b341-6\">* &amp; <em>D. Parlcer, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARyp\">contended that the motion came too late, and he cited the case of <em>Turner &amp; Al. </em>vs. <em>Pearte, </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> that the objection should have been taken at the trial. The plaintiff had many means of coming at the knowledge that the witness was bail in the action. It will be establishing a dangerous precedent, to sustain this motion.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b341-7\"><em>Davis, </em>Solicitor-General, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Afg\">The case of <em>'Turner &amp; Al. </em>vs. <em>Pearte </em>is a solitary one, and, besides, is not like the present. In that case, there was no satisfactory evidence that the incompetency of the witnesses was not known to the party objecting to them, at the time of the trial. In the case of the <em>Commonwealth </em>vs. <em>Waite, </em><footnotemark><em>(2)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the motion was on the same ground with the present, and, although it did not obtain, because the incompetence of the witness was not well made out, the point is there taken for granted that, where the fact is discovered after the trial, it is good ground for setting aside the verdict. So it was also in the cases of <em>The King </em>vs. <em>Teal </em>&amp; <em>Al., </em><footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> and <em>Sutton </em>vs. <em>Mitchell. </em><footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark> The in competency of the witness must have been known to the defendant before he was offered for examination. They must have executed the bail bond together.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b341-8\">This motion stands on the same grounds with that which occurs in every day\u2019s practice, <em>viz., </em>a motion for a new trial on account of evidence discovered after the trial. <footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b341-9\"><em>Parlcer, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASB\">The defendant might have known that the witness was his bail; he had nevertheless a right to offer him ; and if the plaintiff had taken the objection, the bail might have surrendered the defendant, by which the ground of the objection would have been removed. The plaintiff must have known that bail was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>taken in the action; and a very little inquiry would have shown him who they were.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b341-10\"> 1 <em>D. &amp; E. </em>717.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b341-11\"> 5 <em>Mass.
