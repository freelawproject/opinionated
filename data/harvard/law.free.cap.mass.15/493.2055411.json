At the trial of these issues before Thatcher, J., the plaintiff was permitted to give evidence, not only of the trespasses specially charged in the declaration, but also of an assault upon his person by the defendant, when forcibly entering the dwelling-house, and of a detention of the house and * close for the space of four weeks; and the judge instructed the jury that they might lawfully take into consideration, and give exemplary damages for, the said assault, and also the full amount of all the injury the plaintiff had sustained by being kept out of the house and close during the said four weeks.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-12\">The defendant moved for a new trial, on account of the admission of the said evidence, and the instructions of the judge thereon.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number><em>Mellen, </em>in support of the motion.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Avml\">The plaintiff, under the general allegation of <em>alla enormia, </em>cannot show an injury which is of itself a substantial cause of action.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b440-5\">\n<em>Fessenden.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAm\">The evidence was not objected to at the time it was offered; but it was argued fully to the jury by the counsel for the defendant, as well as the counsel for the plaintiff. It is too late, after the verdict, to make this objection the ground of a motion for a new trial. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b440-9\"> 13 <em>Mass.

The reason is, that the defendant cannot be supposed to come prepared to defend against any cause of action of which he has no notice in the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Thus, under the allegation of breaking and entering the dwelling-house, evidence may be given of keeping the plaintiff out; because that is a consequence of the wrongful entry ; and the time need not be specially averred. But an assault and battery cannot be proved, for the reasons aforesaid, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">A new trial was granted, with leave to the plaintiff to amend his declaration upon terms.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b440-10\"><em> </em>1 <em>Chitty, Pl. </em>442, 5th <em>Land, </em>ed\u2014 2 <em>Phill.
