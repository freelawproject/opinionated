The reversion of all <em>but Habijah\u2019s </em>part of the land held by the widow as her dower came, by several deeds, in 1796, to the * plaintiff\u2019s husband, then tenant for years under the dowager, to which her estate was added in October, 1800.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b121-10\">The interruption complained of was by the erection of a wooden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>shop, in 1792, upon the soil where the way was before used. The dowager died before this action was brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b122-5\">A verdict was taken for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the Court whether, upon the foregoing facts, she had any right of action.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b122-6\"><em>Savage, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7a\">The interruption complained of existed twenty-four years before the action was brought. This adverse possession is sufficient foundation for a presumption of a release or extinguishment of the easement by the party entitled or claiming to enjoy it. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-7\">By the terms in which this right of way was created, it was personal to the widow, and not appurtenant to her estate. The heirs may reasonably be presumed willing to grant to their mother a privilege which they would not be disposed to extend to strangers. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-8\">But suppose this a part of the dowager\u2019s estate, and assignable with it, yet it expired with her particular estate. The accessory cannot exist without its principal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-9\">The unity of estate in the defendants has extinguished the way. After the death of tenant for life, the grantors of the way became tenants in common of the reversion, then converted into an estate in possession. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b122-10\"><em>W. Sullivan, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHy\">If the heirs had not changed the title during the life of the dowager, it might be yielded that this right of way would have ceased with the expiration of her estate. But they have assigned this right in fee to the alienee of the widow. This was a confirmation and enlargement of the particular easement.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b122-14\"> 3 <em>East, </em>294, <em>Campbell </em>vs. <em>Winslow. </em>\u2014 1 <em>B. &amp; P. </em>400, <em>Holcroft </em>vs. <em>Heel</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b122-15\"><em> </em>2 <em>Black.

The land over which the easement was established was assigned to the ancestor of the defendants, and the fee vested in him, subject to the easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-13\">The injury complained of was committed more than twenty years before the commencement of this suit; and it is to be taken for granted, from the facts in the case, that the adverse occupation has continued to the time of bringing the action. This would be presumptive evidence of an extinguishment or grant of the privilege to the tenant of the land. Of this, however, we are not to judge ; for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>it is matter foi the jury, and may be rebutted by testimony tending to destroy such presumption, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Upon the opinion of the Court being disclosed, the plaintiff became nonsuit.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b123-6\"> Vide <em>Levett </em>vs. Wilson, 3 <em>Bingh. </em>115. \u2014 Sed vide <em>Cooledge </em>vs. Learned, 8 <em>Pick. </em>509, 510.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
