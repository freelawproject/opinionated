In addition to the decree of divorce, a decree passed, ordering the defendant to pay to the plaintiff, for alimony, the sum of fifty dollars yearly, in quarter-payments of 12 dollars 50 cents; and the present action was brought to recover two years and three quarters of the said annuity \u2014 the plaintiff declaring in debt, as upon a judgment of the Court. The defendant demurred generally to the declaration, and the plaintiff joined in demurrer.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b183-12\"><em>Baylies </em>and <em>Eddy, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADTR\">contended that an action of debt would not lie for the plaintiff in the present case, there being no judgment according to the course of * the common law. A writ of error would not lie to reverse it; <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> and of course debt will not lie to enforce it. The proper mode of pursuing the plaintiff\u2019s right, if she has any, is shown in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>the case of <em>French </em>vs. <em>French. </em><footnotemark><em>(2)</em></footnotemark><em> A </em>rule to show cause was there issued, and execution might then be obtained, or an attachment for a contempt.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b184-5\"><em>Winslow </em>and <em>Brown </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b183-13\"> 13 <em>Mass.

The debt is certain, and it is proved by record ; and the decree is, in effect, as much a judgment, as if rendered on the common-law side of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">It was once doubted whether an execution could issue, to carry into effect such a decree, and whether the only remedy should not be an action of debt; but there seems no good reason why both the remedies may not exist, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">\n<em>Declaration adjudged good.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b184-10\"><em> Storer </em>vs. <em>Storer &amp; Al. </em>6 <em>Mass.
