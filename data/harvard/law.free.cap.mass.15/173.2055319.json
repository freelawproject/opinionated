It was agreed, in a case stated for the opinion of the Court, that the consideration of the note was a bond, given by the plaintiff to the defendant, conditioned for the conveyance to the defendant of a certain tract of land; and that the land had been mortgaged in fee to one <em>Lumbard </em>prior to the making of the said bond and note, and that a part of the money due by the mortgage remained unpaid at the commencement of this action.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b159-11\"><em>Boutelle, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ajuz\">argued that the contract, being in its nature executory, might be rescinded by the * defendant, on the ground of fraud in the plaintiff. He had undertaken to give the defendant a good title to land not his own. If the defendant were to pay the money claimed in this action, and the plaintiff were to tender him a deed, with all the necessary covenants, the defendant might refuse the deed, and have his action to recover back th money. But circuity of action is to be avoided. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b159-12\"><em>Rice, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AgG\">The plaintiff was seised of the land, and was able to pass the title in fee. The note was, then, made for a valuable and sufficient consideration. Here is no ground for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>charge of fraud. It is every day\u2019s practice to convey land already mortgaged by the grantor, either by a second mortgage, or unconditionally ; and this with the knowledge of the grantee, who may either rely on the grantor to dissolve the encumbrance, or may retain a sufficiency of the purchase money in his own hands for the purpose. And of this opinion was the Court, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b159-13\"> 11 <em>Johns. </em>525, <em>Judson </em>vs. <em>Wass. </em>\u2014 9 <em>Mass.
