The pauper was at times insane, and, being in necessitous circumstances, had paid but a very small part of the taxes so assessed upon him, and the portion unpaid was finally abated by the assessors.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b148-8\"><em>Hopkins </em>and <em>Fitch, </em>for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AbS\">argued that the abatement of the taxes, for the inability of the party to pay them, was tantamount to his having never been assessed ; and they cited an observation made by <em>Sewall, </em>J., in delivering the opinion of the Court in the case of <em>Billerica </em>vs. <em>Chelmsford: </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> \u201cAn abatement supposes the assessment not duly made. If the tax be wholly abated, it is as if no assessment had been made ; and if the tax be partially abated, and the residue paid, then all that was duly assessed has been paid.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AT3\">* <em>Longfellow </em>and <em>Adams, </em>for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AoV4\">contended that the payment of any part of the taxes assessed was not necessary to effect the settlement of the pauper. Under the fifth mode of acquiring a settlement, prescribed in the statute, <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> the possession of an estate of the value required, and being assessed for five years successively, <em>ipso facto, </em>conferred the settlement; and of this opinion was the Court.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b148-12\"> 5 <em>Mass.
