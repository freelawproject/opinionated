The * complaint was originally made to a justice of the peace, and process was issued by him within seven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>days after the first of the two days on which the misconduct was alleged to have been committed. An appeal was made to the Common Pleas, where the cause was tried by a jury, on the issue of not guilty; and a verdict being returned against the respondent, that court sentenced him to pay two fines, of five and ten dollars respectively, with the costs of prosecution.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b183-5\"><em>Eddy, </em>for the respondent,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqpJ\">argued that it was the province of the jury to assess the penalty, and not of the Court, the process being, in its nature, a civil action for the recovery of. a penalty; and for this he cited the cases of <em>Dyer </em>vs. <em>Hunnewell, </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> and <em>Stilson </em>vs. <em>Toby. </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> This must especially be proper, and even necessary, where the penalty demanded is by law uncertain in amount.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b183-8\"> 12 <em>Mass.
