Such, undoubtedly, is the law of <em>England. </em>\u201c Our law,\u201d says an <em>English </em>writer on evidence, of great authority, \u201c like that of most other civilized countries, requires a witness to believe that there is a God, and a future state of rewards and punishments.\u201d \u201c It may now be considered as an established rule,\u201d says the same writer, \u201c that infidels of any other country, who believe in a God, the avenger of falsehood, ought to be received here as witnesses; but infidels, who believe not that there is a God, or a future state of rewards and punishments, cannot be admitted in any ease.\u201d \u2014 1 <em>Phillips's Ev., </em>pp. 21, 22., 7th <em>Lond. </em>ed. \u2014 And see <em>Jackson </em>vs. <em>Gridley, </em>18 <em>Johns.
