Therefore, where a part of a town was about to be incorporated into a new town, and it was agreed that those who should afterwards become chargeable as paupers should be supported by the town from whose territory they derived their settlement, it was holden that the original town was still liable to others for the support of one whose settlement was derived from the territory composing the new town, but who was not an inhabitant at the time of its incorporation.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-13\">Assumpsit for the support of <em>Thomas Cook, </em>a pauper said by the plaintiffs to be legally settled in <em>Franklin. </em>At the trial before <em>Putnam, </em>J., it was in evidence that <em>Cornelius Cook, </em>the father of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>pauper, resided in that part of <em>Wrentham </em>which is now <em>Franklin </em>more than a year before April, 1767, having removed thither in the year 1755. There was no legal evidence of his having been warned out of <em>Wrentham; </em>nor was there any evidence that the pauper had gained a settlement in his own right. He was thirty-nine years of age when the town of <em>Franklin </em>was incorporated, * <em>viz., </em>in the year 1778, and several years before had left his father\u2019s family, and continued absent at the time of the said incorporation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-7\">The plaintiffs contended that, by virtue of the act by which <em>Franklin </em>was incorporated from a part of <em>Wrentham, </em>the pauper became legally settled in <em>Franklin. </em>Tt is provided, by that act, that \u201c the said town of <em>Wrentham </em>and tow n of <em>Franklin </em>shall severally be held punctually to stand by, and perform to each other, the terms and proposals contained and expressed in a vote of the town of <em>Wrentham, </em>passed at a public town meeting on the sixteenth day of February, 1778, according to the plain and obvious meaning thereof.\u201d The said vote stated, among other things- \u201c that the poor of the town shall be divided as follows, <em>viz., </em>the widow <em>Mann, </em>&amp;c., to remain to <em>Wrentham; </em>and the widow <em>Wilson, &amp;c., </em>to be maintained by the petitioners, <em>(Franklin.) </em>But all the poor that shall arise to the town hereafter, from any settlement heretofore gained by coming into this town, shall be maintained by each precinct where they gained their settlement; and that each precinct maintain all their inhabitants, for the future, that shall be on either side at the time of iivision.\u201d \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-8\">The judge being of opinion that the said agreement did not affect the settlement of the pauper, but was an arrangement, or contract, which the towns of <em>Wrentham </em>and <em>Franklin </em>may enforce by action, he directed a nonsuit, subject to the opinion of the whole Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b235-9\"><em>Lincoln, </em>for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AxqA\">argued that the legislature have authority to fix the legal settlement of persons; <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> and that the effect of the agreement of the two corporations, evidenced by the vote .of <em>Wrtntham, </em>must be the same as if it had been inserted, <em>totidem verbis, </em>in the act of incorporation. Under this vote, the pauper, in the present case, was to be the charge of the defendants; and, of consequence, the plaintiffs have a right to recover.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b235-10\"><em>Sumner, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALm\">Admitting, for the purpose of this argument, that the father of the pauper acquired a * settlement in <em>Franklin, </em>by force of the act of incorporation and the vote of <em>Wrentham, </em>still, the pauper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>being then absent, his settlement could not be affected. He still retained his settlement in <em>Wrentham. </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-5\">This vote was passed before the incorporation, when there were no contracting parties ; of course no one was bound by it as an agreement. So the legislature must have considered, or they would not have thought it necessary to sanction it. But the agreement of towns cannot determine the settlement of individuals. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> In this case, the pauper has his legal settlement in <em>Wrentham. </em>That town therefore, if any, is answerable to the plaintiffs; and whether the defendants are liable to indemnify <em>Wrentham, </em>is a question not to oe determined in the present action. In the act incorporating <em>West Boylston, </em>upon which the question arose in the case of <em>Great Barrington </em>vs. <em>Lancaster, </em>the provision was enacted by the legislature ; but in this case it was no more than an agreement or contract of the parties; if, indeed, it amounted to so much.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b236-6\">The cause stood over for advisement; and, at the following April term, the opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b235-12\"> 10 <em>Mass.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AzYF\">The piauper\u2019s settlement is in <em>Wrentham, </em>unless, by the act incorporating <em>Franklin, </em>it has been transferred to the latter town. The act makes no specific provision; and, according to the principle settled in the case of <em>Windham </em>vs. <em>Portland, </em>cited in the argument, none become settled in the newly incorporated town, <em>ex vigore statuti, </em>but those who were within its limits, or had their home there, when the act passed, unless there were some provision upon the subject in the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">The pauper, in the case at bar, was not a member of his father\u2019s family when this act of incorporation passed; he was upwards of twenty-one years of age; and he was absent at the time, and had been absent several years before the incorporation. He did not, therefore, gain a settlement in <em>Franklin </em>by virtue of its incorporation.</p>\n<p id=\"Ax6J\">* It is contended, however, that, as there was an agreement, at the time of the division of the town, that such paupers as should become chargeable should be supported by the town within whose limits they had their settlement, which agreement was sanctioned by the legislature, \u2014-and as the pauper had his settlement in the part which has become <em>Franklin, </em>\u2014 this is to be considered as the town of his lawful settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">But the agreement of the two towns cannot alter the law, and the legislative provision merely sanctions that agreement \u2014 the only-legal effect of which is, to oblige <em>Franklin </em>to reimburse Wrentham, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>in case the latter is called upon to pay other towns for the support of paupers legally chargeable to <em>Wrentham, </em>but for which <em>Franklin </em>is liable by the agreement..
