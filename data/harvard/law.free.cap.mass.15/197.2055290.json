The first arose on the construction of the act of incorporation respecting the limits of the parish; <em>viz., </em>whether any part of the town of <em>Abington </em>was included therein. The second was, if a part of <em>Abington </em>was considered as included, \u2014as had, in fact, for a greater part of the time since the incorporation, been the practical construction of the act, \u2014whether the legislature had the power to transfer a portion of a parish in one town, with its inhabitants, to a parish in another town, without notice to such parish and inhabitants, and giving them an opportunity to be heard on the question.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-6\">\n<em>Wirnlow,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGP\">for the plaintiff in error, argued that although, by a literal construction of the act of incorporation, that part of <em>Abington </em>in which the domicile of the plaintiff was situated would be included within the limits, yet, taking into view the petition and the proceedings thereon, which were all to be considered as parts of one and the same transaction, another construction should be given.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-7\">On the second point, <em>Winslow </em>relied on the principles of <em>Magna Charta, </em>and of the declaration of rights attached to the constitution of the commonwealth ; and he contended that no act or judgment of the legislative, executive, or judiciary branches of our government, affecting the rights of individual citizens, could be binding, without giving them an opportunity to be heard in their defence. As it respect? judgments recovered in our courts of judicature tVy are * erroneous if obtained without actual i&gt;o*&gt;e: and the same reasons apply to the doings <em>',f </em>the other branches of the government. If it be said that this transaction was prior to the existence of our constitution, it is answered that the declaration of rights is merely in affirmance of the rights and privileges enjoyed by the inhabitants of the country from its first settlement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-8\">In conformity to these views, it has ever been the practice of the legislature, both before and since the revolution, to notify all persons supposed to be interested, before they passed any private or local acts affecting the rights of citizens ; and the only reason why the inhabitants of <em>Abington </em>were not notified of the application in this case was, that tnere was nothing in the petition by which the legislature could be led to suppose that any part of that town was to be included in the new town or parish.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>In the case of <em>Ellis </em>vs. <em>Marshall, </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> this Court decided that an individual cannot be made a member of a corporation without his assent, express or implied. The present case is stronger than that, for there public notice was given, but in this case the inhabitants of <em>Abington </em>had no notice whatever.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b186-5\"><em>W. Baylie.s </em>and <em>Eddy </em>for the defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b186-9\"> <em>2 Mass. Rep. </em>277.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b186-6\">\n<em>Curia.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"ATB\">We are all satisfied that, by a just construction of the act in question, the land on which the plaintiff in error dwells was included in the new parish created by that act. How a part of <em>Abington </em>came to be included within a parish of <em>Bridgewater, </em>cannot, at this late day, be explained. It might have been by mistake, or it might have been by design. It is enough, however, to justify the defendants, that it has been acquiesced in for so long a period as nearly eighty years ; and that the north parish of <em>Bridgewater </em>has claimed and exercised parochial jurisdiction over the same, with little interruption, for nearly sixty years. Now, giving all due weight to the ingenious and able argument of the counsel for the plaintiff in error, on the constitutional points, the want of notice to <em>Abington, </em>and the want *of power in the legislature to transfer the parochial jurisdiction without their consent, it is right to presume that all this was originally right; or, if not, that it was afterwards ratified by the acquiescence of Abington, or of the individuals who may have been especially interested.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">If there is any inconvenience in the present relation, it is too late Sor any but the legislature to remedy the mischief.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
