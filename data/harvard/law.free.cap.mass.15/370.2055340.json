About the 1st of September, 1817, <em>Marshall, </em>without obtaining the defendant\u2019s consent, or consulting with him, proceeded with the schooner to the southward, and there went from port to port. In January, 1818, he was in <em>Philadelphia </em>with the schooner, and offered to take freight for <em>New York. </em>The plaintiff put on board one hundred barrels of flour, and took <em>Marshall\u2019s </em>bill of lading therefor in the common form, promising, for a certain agreed freight, to deliver the same at <em>New York. Marshall </em>sailed with the schooner for <em>New York, </em>but was driven by stress of weather to <em>St. Bartholomeiv\u2019s, </em>where he sold the whole of the said flour, and, having repaired the vessel, returned with her to <em>Massachusetts. </em>The defendant never expressed his dissent or disapprobation of <em>Marshall\u2019s </em>conduct in thus employing the vessel, nor did he reclaim the same, until after this action was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>commenced. The plaintiff has never received any compensation for the flour, or any part thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b335-5\">If the defendant was answerable, in the opinion of the Court, the cause was to be sent to auditors, to ascertain the amount of the damages, and judgment be rendered on their report; otherwise, the plaintiff was to become nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b335-6\">* <em>W. Sullivan, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Apm\">relied on the general principle that the owner of a vessel was liable for the undertakings of the master, in contracts of this nature. The register or enrolment of the vessel showed the defendant to be the owner, and the plaintiff was not bound to know, and had no means of knowing, the particular agreement between the defendant and <em>Marshall </em>in this case; nor, if he had, would it at all have varied his rights, as against the defendant. Besides, in this case, the owner and master were joint partners in the employment of the vessel, and were to divide the profits which were expected to arise out of the carriage of the plaintiff\u2019s merchandise, for the non-delivery of which this action is brought.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b335-7\"><em>Gorham </em>and <em>Peabody </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b335-8\">Putnam, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"APml\">delivered the opinion of the Court. The plaintiff, having produced a regular bill of lading, signed by the master of the vessel, relies upon the general rule that the owner is answerable for the faithful performance of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">This rule must be taken with its qualifications. It is not enough to prove that the vessel was owned by the defendant. It must appear, also, that she was in his employment. It must likewise be proved that the master was appointed by the owner, and acted within the scope of his authority ; for no one is answerable for the unauthorized acts and doings of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">It is true that the title to this vessel was in the defendant; but, by the agreement between him and <em>Marshall, </em>the latter became the owner <em>pro hac vice. </em>She was in the employment of <em>Marshall, </em>and he directed when and where she should go. He had a right to act as master himself, or to appoint any other master. He also employed and paid the mariners, and the expenses of navigating the vessel. The defendant, for a season, had parted with his right to govern and manage the vessel; and <em>Marshall </em>cannot be considered as the defendant\u2019s agent, or servant.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">* It would be otherwise, if the owner had directed the voyage, appointed the master, employed the seamen, and had become answerable for their conduct. Such was the case of <em>Parish </em>vs. <em>Crawford, </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> and of <em>M\u2019Intire </em>vs. <em>Bowne. </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>in the case at bar, <em>Marshall, </em>who chartered the vessel, must be considered as the owner, according to the principles settled in the cases of <em>James </em>vs. <em>Jones &amp; Al., </em><footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> <em>Vallejo </em>vs. <em>Wheeler, </em><footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark> <em>Oliver </em>vs. <em>Green, </em><footnotemark>(5)</footnotemark> and <em>Frazer </em>vs. <em>Marsh. </em><footnotemark>(6)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The defendant may also contend, in this case, not only that <em>Marshall </em>was not the master of his appointment, but that he never employed the vessel to carry goods for hire. She was to be used in the coasting trade, in the transportation of such cargoes as <em>Marshall </em>should <em>purchase </em>and lade on board her. But <em>Marshall, </em>without any authority from the defendant, instead of buying cargoes, had taken them on freight. In the case of <em>Boucher </em>vs. <em>Lawson, </em><footnotemark>(7)</footnotemark> Lord <em>Hardwicke </em>observed, that \u201cit must appear that the ship was employed in that voyage to carry goods for hire. For any thing that appears, this ship might have been sent to <em>Lisbon </em>for a special purpose; and if so, no one could say that the master, by taking goods of his own head, could make the owners liable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Suppose an owner should send his ship from <em>Boston </em>to <em>Charleston, S. C., </em>to take a cargo there belonging to him, to carry to <em>London; </em>and the master, instead of going to <em>Charleston, </em>should proceed to <em>New Orleans, </em>and take a cargo on freight; could it be supposed that the owner would, in this case, be answerable to the freighter or shipper of the goods ? In such a case, notwithstanding the master was appointed by the owner, yet the latter could clearly defend himself, on the ground that he never had employed, or authorized the master to employ, his ship to carry goods for hire.</p>\n<p id=\"AK45\">From the facts in the case at bar, we are of opinion with the -defendant on both grounds; that <em>Marshall, pro hac </em>* <em>vice, </em>is to be considered owner; and that the vessel has been employed for a different purpose than the defendant directed, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">\n<em>Plaintiff nonsuit.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b335-13\"> <em>Abbott on Shipping, </em>part 1, c. 1. \u2014 <em>Strange, </em>1251, S.
