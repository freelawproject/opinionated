The defendant appeared at the term for which the said process was commenced, and there disclosed the sum of 200 dollars, received by him of the plaintiff, and also the pendency of this action. The said sum of 200 dollars included the 120 dollars above mentioned. The defendant was adjudged the trustee of the plaintiff upon that process, and on the 13th of February last paid to <em>Howe, </em>the judgment creditor, the sum of 265 dollars, which was endorsed on the execution issued upon that process ; and the said execution has been duly returned.

The judgment on that process ought not to be binding; because <em>Jones, </em>in his disclosure, omitted to disclose the amount of costs which had arisen in the present action \u2014 which was as much due as the debt itself. * The money was not a deposit, within the meaning of the statute, since the plaintiff was then using his diligence to recover it. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> The payment of the money, against the will of the plaintiff, can place the defendant on no better ground than bringing money into court would do; and this, to be effectual, must always be accompanied with the payment of costs, if the money be received; and, hence, sufficient damages to carry costs, at least, ought to be recovered by the plaintiff in the present suit.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b173-7\"><em>Deane, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWfE\">insisted that there was no ground for disturbing the judgment rendered on the foreign attachment; and that it could not be done, in this indirect way, without subverting established principles. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> If the facts appearing in the case were pleaded in bar, or given in evidence under the general issue, a ver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>diet must, by the provisions of the Trustee Act, be returned for the defendant; and he is entitled, as the party prevailing, to judgment for his costs.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b173-8\"> 3 <em>Mass.

The defendant, having been adjudged trustee under process of foreign attachment, and having paid the plaintiff\u2019s demand on execution, is discharged therefrom by the express words of the statute. The validity and propriety of the judgment in the trustee process, supposing it to have been erroneous, cannot be questioned in the present action.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Then, the only question is as to costs; in respect to which it has been urged that the plaintiff ought to recover, since it is admitted that he had good cause of action at the commencement of the pres-: ent suit. But, by suffering the trustee process to proceed to judgment and execution, he has defeated his own action, and has no cause of complaint, although he may suffer some loss. He has now no remaining claim to the recovery of damages; and cannot, therefore, as the prevailing party, be entitled to costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">Neither can the defendant recover costs. He has admitted the plaintiff\u2019s demand, and has paid it. Until recently, he has had no legal ground of defence; and all he * can ask for, with any appearance of plausibility, is the trifling costs of the present term. For, while the action stood continued, to abide the event of the trustee process, no costs were allowable to either party. <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">Payment, in this cas\u00e9, is similar to direct payment to the plaintiff; and the rule in such case is, that each party must bear his own costs, unless there be some agreement to the contrary. This seems to be a reasonable rule, and must be adopted in the present case. <footnotemark>(4) (a)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(3)\">\n<p id=\"b174-9\"> 8 <em>Mass.
