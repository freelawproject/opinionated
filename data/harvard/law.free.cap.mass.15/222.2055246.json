One dated June 28, 1809, for 150 dollars, payable to <em>Marvin </em>Jewell, or order, in sixty-one days, with grace, at the <em>Northampton </em>Bank, endorsed to <em>John Stevenson, </em>or order, and by him to the plaintiff on the 15th of March, 1813. The other note was for 210 dollars, dated May 10, 1810, by <em>Damon </em>to the said <em>Stevenson, </em>or order, payable in one year, and on the 15th of March, 1813, endorsed to the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b206-13\">At the trial before <em>Putnam, </em>J., at the last May term in this county, there was evidence that the plaintiff had said that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>not interested in the notes, and that he liad not purchased them of Stevenson,' but that they were left with him as collateral security for 50 or 60 dollars, due from <em>Stevenson </em>to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-5\">The defendant then offered a witness to prove the confession of <em>Stevenson, </em>to which the plaintiff objected; but * the witness was admitted, on the ground that, as the suit was for the benefit of <em>Stevenson </em>as well as <em>Butler, </em>as appeared from <em>Butler's </em>confession, the confession of <em>Stevenson </em>was admissible. The witness testified that, in August or September, 1816, <em>Stevenson </em>had said that the notes were not given for any value, but were accommodation notes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-6\">A verdict being returned for the defendant, a new trial was moved for by the plaintiff, on account of the admission of evidence of the confessions of <em>Stevenson, </em>as aforesaid.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b207-7\"><em>Mills, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AKb\">The plaintiff, as pledgee of the notes, may maintain an action, although he is not interested to the whole amount of them. As between him and the maker, lie has the same rights as if he had paid the whole sum due upon the notes, <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> subject to any defence which the defendant could have against the payee. The confessions of the endorser, made after the assignment to the plaintiff, cannot affect the rights of the endorsee. His release would have no operation upon the plaintiff\u2019s rights. <em>Stevenson </em>is not to be viewed as a party to the action; and if he were, it could only affect the suit as respects the surplus beyond what is due to <em>Butler. </em><footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> The admission of such evidence would be extremely mischievous, and injurious to the rights of assignees of choses in action not negotiable, as well as to endorsees of negotiable securities. Stevenson could not have been a witness, to prove the want of a consideration; <footnotemark>(3)</footnotemark> his confessions, then, were wholly inadmissible in evidence.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b207-8\"><em>Howe, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWt\">After the proof of the plaintiff\u2019s confession, <em>Stevenson </em>became the real plaintiff in interest, and thus his confessions became legal evidence. His interest in the action is far the greatest. Indeed, he is interested to the whole amount, for he is still responsible to <em>Butler </em>for the demand for which the notes were pledged.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b207-9\">They are, at least, joint owners of the notes in suit, and the confession of one of several copartners is sufficient to defeat their action. In this case, an objection to the * confessions of <em>Butler </em>would have more force, as his interest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>in the action is less than <em>Stevenson\u2019s. </em>In the case of <em>Bauerman &amp; Al. </em>vs. <em>Radenius, </em><footnotemark>(4)</footnotemark> it was determined that the defendant may give in evidence the declarations or admissions of the plaintiff on the record, to defeat the action, although such plaintiff appear to be only a trustee for a third person. <em>A fortiori, </em>may the declara lions of <em>cestui que trust </em>be admitted. In the case at bar, <em>Butler </em>is but the trustee of <em>Stevenson, </em>the <em>cestui que trust. </em>In actions against the sheriff for the default of his deputy, the admissions or confessions of the deputy are always received in support of the action.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b207-10\"> 1 <em>B. </em>&amp; P. 652, <em>Collins </em>vs. <em>Martin.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(2)\">\n<p id=\"b207-11\"> 14 <em>Mass.

He is not a party to the suit. The principle of the decision in <em>Churchill </em>vs. <em>Suter </em>is applicable here. A party to a negotiable security shall not be received to show facts, antecedent to the transfer, whereby the holder is to be defeated of his recovery, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> As it appears, from the evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s confessions, that he came lawfully to the possession of the notes, as a pledge, he has a right to recover the whole amount due upon them ; and he will be accountable to the pledgor for the surplus when received.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">\n<em>New trial ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b208-8\"><em> </em>Vide note to Manning, <em>Exr., </em>vs. <em>Wheatland, </em>10 <em>Mass.
