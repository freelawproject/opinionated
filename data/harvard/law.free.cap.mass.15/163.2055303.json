The jury having found the defendants guilty, a new trial was moved for, on account of the admission of the said evidence. And it was resolved <em>by the whole Court, </em>that the evidence was insufficient. It was not the best which the case admitted. If these persons were married, there must be better evidence of the fact. It could be proved by the record of the clergyman, or, at any rate, by the testimony of persons actually present. The verdict was accordingly set aside, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></summary>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n\n</footnote>\n<opinion><p id=\"b150-11\">Upon an indictment against two persons for lascivious cohabitation, one of <em>the </em>parties be'ing married, such marriage must be proved by the record of the clergyman, or by witnesses present at the ceremony.</p><p id=\"b151-5\"><em> Qu\u00e6re </em>whether, as the allegation was no otherwise material but as being ue scriptrve of the person intended, the proof of marriage was 'not sufficient. \u2014 Vide 3 <em>Starkie, Ev. </em>1580. \u2014 <em>Sull's </em>case, <em>Leach, </em>1005. \u2014 <em>Mary Graham\u2019s </em>case, <em>Leach, </em>619.\u2014 <em>State </em>vs. <em>France, Overt.
