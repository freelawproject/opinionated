Neither the length, breadth, nor <em>termini, </em>of the road are given; nor is it alleged that the way was laid out by any competent authority. It may have been a way, \"* by permission, over the land of the defendants. It is not averred that the citizens of the commonwealth had a right to pass and repass over this way.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b222-6\">The nuisance is not sufficiently set forth. \u201c A number of sheds \u201d is too indefinite. It should have been alleged how many there were, whether contiguous or detached, &amp;c. <footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b222-7\"><em>Morton, </em>(Attorney-General,) for the commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aap\">The indictment is conformed to the <em>English </em>precedents, as well as to our own. The ancient strictness has been much relaxed in modern times. In indictments for neglecting to sustain highways in repair, the <em>termini </em>of the way must be alleged, or the party charged cannot knew the extent of the charge. But in case of a positive nuisance, as is this now under consideration, the defendants must have known whea and where they had erected the sheds. <footnotemark>(2)</footnotemark> The fair construction of the indictment, as to the length of the buildings erected, is that their aggregate length is one hundred feet.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b222-11\"> <em>Hawk P.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Akne\">Several objections have been taken to the indictment in this case. First, it is said that the way in which the nuisance is averred to be erected is not described with sufficient particularity, it not being stated from or to what town in the county it led. But this objection cannot prevail. We think that, as the nuisance is averred to have been erected at <em>Sutton, </em>in the county of <em>Worcester, </em>and the highway is alleged to be there, the way is sufficiently described, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Another objection was, that the length and breadth of the high way said to be obstructed are not averred. But this objection, too must be overruled, it being sufficient to aver that the nuisance was in the highway; and whether such highway was longer or shorter, broader or narrower, is immaterial. <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">The third objection we think fatal, <em>viz., </em>that the indictment is too <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>loose, in averring that <em>a number of sheds, </em>one hundred feet in length, were erected, without stating what number. This may savor a little of nicety; but, unless * known rules are observed, there will soon be no certainty in indictments. The defendants ought to be able to know what they are called upon to defend against, <footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\n<em>Judgment arrested,.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b222-13\"><em>\u0430) </em>In pleading a highway it is unnecessary to set out the <em>termini </em>; it is sufficient to aver that it is a highway. \u2014 1 <em>Stark. </em>191, 192 \u2014 2 <em>Stark.
