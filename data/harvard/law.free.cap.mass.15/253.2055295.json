Upon this evidence the plaintiffs contended that a settlement was gained, in the fifth manner prescribed in the statute of 1793, c. 34. But the judge was of a different opinion, and directed a verdict for the defendants, subject to the opinion of the Court, on the said direction.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b233-11\"><em>Wallcer, </em>for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqP\">contended that an estate at sufferance was an estate known and defined in the law, and he cited and relied on the case of <em>Sudbury </em>vs. <em>Stow, </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> where this position was held by the Court in relation to the twelfth mode of gaining a settlement by the statute.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"b233-13\"> 13 <em>Mass.

It is obvious that, in the fifth mode of acquiring a settlement, the owning of an estate is the principal thing; and it is necessary that there be a title, to bring the pauper within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>that mode of gaining a settlement; and nothing less than an estate for years will answer the requisition of the law in this particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">The pauper, in the case before us, had an estate for four years only, and had no right to hold beyond that period; so that he cannot be considered as having an estate after the expiration of his lease.</p>\n<p id=\"ALrg\">*It is supposed, however, that a contrary doctrine was established in the case of <em>Sudbury </em>vs. <em>Stow. </em>In that case, the <em>twelfth </em>mode of acquiring a settlement was under the consideration of the Court, the principal ingredients of which are, the residence in any town for ten years, and the <em>paying </em>of all taxes duly assessed on the person\u2019s poll or estate for any five years within the said ten years. If he have no estate, but pays a poll tax for five years, he gains a settlement under this rule, provided he resides in the town ten years. By the <em>fifth </em>mode, if he have an estate of the prescribed value, and is assessed for it five years in succession, he gains a settlement whether he pays the taxes or not. <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>By the <em>twelfth </em>mode, if he pay the taxes assessed on him, it is immaterial whether he owns the estate or not, provided he be assessed for it <em>as his own. </em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>There is, therefore, no discrepancy between the case cited and the decision in the case before us; in which judgment must be rendered according to the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\"><em>Goodwin </em>for the defendants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b234-9\"><em> </em>Vide <em>Westbrook </em>vs. Gorham,, ante, 160.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b234-10\"><em> Sudbury </em>vs. Waltham,, 13 <em>Mass.
