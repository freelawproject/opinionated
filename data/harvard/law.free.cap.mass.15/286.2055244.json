They also proved that the said <em>Venus </em>was present at the said auction, and refused to go into the family of one of the bidders ; that, in consequence of said refusal, the auction was suspended for some time; that said <em>Watson, </em>after the auction, said he had undertaken to support said <em>Venus </em>during her life ; and that he did support her during his life. And the defendants contended that this evidence was sufficient to prove that the said <em>Watson </em>had undertaken to support the said <em>Venus; </em>that she had a right to recover the money, necessary for that purpose, of the administrator of the estate of said <em>Watson; </em>and so, that the said <em>Venus </em>was not a pauper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-6\">The plaintiff objected to the admission of the testimony produced by the defendants. And the judge instructed the *jury, that the paroi evidence, given as aforesaid, was admissible ; and that the evidence adduced by the defendants was not admissible to prove that the said <em>Venus </em>had any estate ; and that they were to consider her as a pauper, and to inquire as to the amount which the plaintiff ought to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-7\">The jury gave a verdict for the plaintiff, for 147 dollars. But if, in the opinion of the whole Court, the direction of the judge was wrong, the verdict was to be set aside, and the plaintiff to become nonsuit. Otherwise, judgment was to be rendered on the verdict.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b263-8\"><em>Hoar, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGH\">The notice to the overseers was deficient, in that it was not in writing; and having been given more than two years before the commencement of the suit, is not sufficient in law to support the action.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b263-9\">But the point in the case, principally relied upon by the defendants, is the rejection of <em>Watson\u2019s </em>bond, offered in evidence. It was suitable and proper evidence to prove that <em>Venus </em>was not a pauper whom the town was bound to support or relieve. It was proof of a promise by <em>Watson </em>to her to provide every thing necessary to her support and comfort during her life ; and it is submitted that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>might maintain an action upon such promise, in the same manner as the assignee of a bond can. In the case of <em>Marchington </em>vs. <em>Vernon &amp; Al., </em><footnotemark>(1)</footnotemark> it was ruled by <em>Buller, </em>J., that, \u201c if one person makes a promise to another for the benefit of a third, that third person may maintain an action upon it.\u201d In the present case, there was also other evidence of this undertaking on the part of <em>Watson </em>to support this woman. This promise was property, and being precisely com petent to her support, she was at no time a pauper. If the plain tiff recovers in this action, the defendants will, undoubtedly, have their remedy over against the representatives of <em>Watson ; </em>and thus an unnecessary and inconvenient circuity of action is produced.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b264-4\"><em>Fay </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(1)\">\n<p id=\"Al-\"> 1 <em>B. &amp; P. </em>101, note (c). \u2014 See also <em>Cowp. </em>443, <em>Martyn </em>vs Hind. 1 <em>Vent. </em>318, 332, <em>Dutton </em>vs. <em>Poole.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AmM\">* Parker, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AbK\">delivered the opinion of the Court. The plaintiff\u2019s action is founded upon the thirteenth section of the statute of 1793, c. 59, providing for the relief and support of the poor, &amp;c., which enacts, among other things, that <em>\u201c </em>every town and district shall be holden to pay any expense which shall be necessarily incurred for the relief of any pauper, by any inhabitant not liable by law for his or her support, after notice and request made to the overseers of the said town or district, and until provision shall be made by them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">The report finds that notice was given verbally to two of the overseers of Cambridge, by the plaintiff, more than two years before the commencement of the suit, that the negro woman had her lawful settlement in <em>Cambridge, </em>and that she had been supported by the plaintiff, according to her allegations in the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">But it is objected that the notice to the overseers was not in writing. The statute does not require the notice to be in writing ; nor is there the same reason for it that exists when one town calls upon another for the reimbursement of expenses for the support of a pauper. For, in this latter case, the pauper may be supported at a distance from the town which is called upon ; and it is reasonable that they have formal and specific notice of the demand, with such information respecting the pauper as may enable them to ascertain whether they are liable or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">In a case like the one before us, the pauper is supposed to be within the town against which the demand is made; for none but an inhabitant of the town can maintain the action, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The overseers may, therefore, upon general notice, satisfy themselves upon the points important for them to know, without any formal written communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Nor is it any objection to the action that more than two years elapsed, after the notice was given, before the action was brought; for there is no special limitation of this action, as there is of an action brought by one town against another, under the ninth section of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab9\">*The point most insisted on is that, as a bond was given by <em>William Watson, </em>to <em>Samuel Whittemore, </em>in the year 1793, to secure the maintenance of this negro woman, and indemnify the obligee and his heirs from any expense on that account, \u00bbhe is not a pauper within the meaning of the statute, and so the town is not liable for her support.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">If the bond had been made directly to the woman, she might nevertheless be a pauper; for the mere possession of a right to sue might not prevent her from falling into distress, or deprive her of the public charity provided by the laws. In this bond, however, she had no legal interest, nor could she maintain any action upon it; so that it is difficult to perceive how she can be less entitled to a support on account of its existence.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">The cases cited, by the counsel for the defendants, to prove that the negro woman might have resorted to the bond, do not establish the point. They are merely cases of promises to one, to do some act for the benefit of another ; in which cases it has been held, that the promise is made substantially to him who is to receive the benefit, and that he may maintain the action, <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> There is no instance of any one, not a party to a bond, or claiming a lawful title under it, maintaining an action upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">If the estate of <em>Watson </em>is legally liable to support the pauper, in virtue of the bond, no reason has been shown why the plaintiff, who does not represent the estate, should be deprived of the indemnity provided by law for those who afford relief to paupers, when the overseers of the town shall refuse to bestow it.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">Perhaps the town may be entitled to relief from the estate of <em>Watson, </em>if that is liable on the bond. But of this we give no opinion. <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b264-12\"><em> Mitchell </em>vs. Comville, 12 <em>Mass.
