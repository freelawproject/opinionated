This motion, is accompanied by copies of papers on file in the trial court and certified by the clerk to be correct, purporting to be instructions refused, notice of motion for new trial and order denying motion for new trial, respectively. The record upon this appeal was prepared under the provisions of section 953a et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure.  The papers specified in the motion, in order to be available to appellant for use upon this appeal, should have been included in reporter\u2019s transcript, settled by the judge of the trial court. Section 953a provides for the inclusion in the reporter\u2019s transcript of \u201call rulings, instructions, acts or statements of the court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>also all objections or exceptions of counsel, and all matters to which the same relate, ...\u201d The instructions are thus expressly provided for, and since the amendment of the code to provide for a review of an order denying a new trial upon appeal from the judgment, the order upon the motion therefor is in effect.a ruling of the court, and the notice of intention to move for a new trial is in the nature of a supporting paper and is a matter to which the ruling relates.  The only portions of the record which the clerk is competent to authenticate for the purpose of a record on appeal are the judgment-roll and the notice of appeal. Therefore, if the papers here involved should be inserted in the clerk.\u2019s transcript they could not be considered as a part of the record upon appeal <em>(Richmond </em>v. <em>Julian Consolidated Min. Co., </em>176 Cal. 600 [169 Pac. 356]; <em>Barnabee </em>v. <em>Hunstock, </em>42 Cal. App. 659 [183 Pac. 951]).  The only means by which these papers may properly he made a part of the reporter\u2019s transcript is by the action of the trial judge including them therein and certifying to their correctness <em>(Bell </em>v. <em>Brigance, </em>194 Cal. 445 [229 Pac. 27]). <em> </em>If these papers were omitted from the reporter\u2019s transcript as settled by the trial judge through mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, application for relief therefrom should be made in the first instance to the trial court. In the absence of action thereon by the trial court, or the trial judge, the insertion of these papers in the transcript would add nothing to the authentic record upon appeal. The motion is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
