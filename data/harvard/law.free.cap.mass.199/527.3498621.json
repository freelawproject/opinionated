L. c. 81, \u00a7 38, the words \u201cof this chapter\u201d were omitted, and among the \u201c preceding sections \u201d was Pub. Sts. c. 84, \u00a7 25, R. L. c. 81, \u00a7 29, providing for criminal prosecutions against the overseers themselves. <em>Held, </em>that it did not appear that by the last two revisions any lessening of the powers of the overseers to bring the ac'ions specified in the chapters named was intended by the Legislature.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b548-5\">Under R.

L. c. 81, \u00a7 11, to compel the defendant to contribute to the support of his grandchildren. The town, by vote under R. L. c. 25, \u00a7 12, had appointed its selectmen its agents to sue in its name. This suit was brought by the overseers of the poor of the town, without any authority from the selectmen or otherwise, except what may have arisen from their office as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>overseers of the poor; and the question is whether the action was rightly brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The general rule is that an officer of a town cannot merely as such officer bring an action in the name of the town. <em>Walpole </em>v. Gray, 11 Allen, 149, 150, and cases cited. But it is provided by R. L. c. 81, \u00a7 38, that \u201cin all actions and prosecutions founded on the provisions of the preceding sections, the overseers of the poor of any place . . . shall appear and prosecute or defend the same in behalf of such place.\u201d To \u201c prosecute \u201d an action includes the bringing as well as the carrying on of the action. This is the ordinary meaning of the word. <em>Clinton </em>v. <em>Heagney, </em>175 Mass. 134. And see the eases collected in 23 Am. &amp; Eng. Encyc. of Law (2d ed.) 268. And the words \u201c preceding sections,\u201d taken literally, include the section of the same chapter under which this bill was brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">But the defendant contends that the words \u201c preceding sections \u201d should be limited to the three sections which immediately precede \u00a7 38. The authority in question was given to the overseers of the poor by St. 1793, c. 59, \u00a7 14, and has existed since that time. It was successively codified into Rev. Sts, c. 46, \u00a7 26, and Gen. Sts. c. 70, \u00a7 22. In all these statutes, the authority of the overseers of the poor was in terms extended either to actions and prosecutions under all the provisions or under the preceding provisions of the respective chapters. This would include in each case actions like the one before us. But the language was changed in Pub. Sts. c. 84, \u00a7 33, by omitting the words \u201cof this chapter,\u201d so that the statute was cast in its present form. The defendants contend that this change in the phraseology of the statute indicated an intention of the Legislature to change the law and to restrict the authority given by R. L. c. 81, \u00a7 38, to the overseers of the poor, to actions and prosecutions brought under \u00a7\u00a7 35, 36 and 37. But it does not appear that any change in the law was intended in the revisions either of 1882 or 1902; and the general rule is well settled that mere verbal changes in the revision of a statute do not alter its meaning. <em>Savage </em>v. Shaw, 195 Mass. 571, and cases cited. <em>Tilton </em>v. Tilton, 196 Mass. 562, 564, and cases cited. A striking example of the application of this rule may be found in <em>Electric Welding Co. </em>v. <em>Prince, </em>195 Mass. 242, 259, <em>et seq. </em>This general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>rule cannot be overcome by the fact that in the two latest revisions there has been included among the \u201c preceding sections \u201d a provision (Pub. Sts. c. 84, \u00a7 25; B. L. c. 81, \u00a7 29) under which a criminal prosecution might be brought against the overseers of the poor themselves, and that they would not be held to be authorized either to prosecute or to defend such a prosecution in behalf of the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Accordingly, under the terms of the report, the case is to stand for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">\n<em>So ordered..</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
