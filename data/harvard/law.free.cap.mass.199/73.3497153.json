The conductor testified in cross-examination that he had made no report because he considered the affair insignificant and that, under the defendant\u2019s rules, whether or not a conductor should make a report was left to his discretion. Against the objeo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>tian and subject to exception by the defendant, he then was asked: \u201cDon\u2019t you understand there is a rule applying to conductors that they shall make a report of an accident, no matter how insignificant <em>1 </em>\u201d and answered \u201c Yes.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that the question was allowable in cross-examination as bearing on the conductor\u2019s real understanding of the rule, and thus to discredit his entire testimony.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b94-4\">If, after having discharged all its passengers at the end of its route, a street railway car has started without passengers to return to the car barn, there is, while it is in motion, no oiler to accept any one as a passenger, and one who persists in an attempt to enter the car, understanding that the conductor refuses to receive him as such, and takes hold of the \u201c grab irons \u201d by the entrance steps, is a trespasser, and the conductor has a right to use a reasonable degree of force to prevent him from entering the car or continuing his hold upon it.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-5\">Tort for personal injuries alleged to have been received by the plaintiff while a passenger on a street car of the defendant, by reason of an \u201c unwarranted and malicious assault \u201d upon him by the motorman and conductor of the car.

We cannot say that the court erred in allowing the plaintiff to cross-examine the defendant\u2019s conductor as to his understanding of the rules of the defendant relating to the duties of its conductors. The plaintiff did not seek to prove what the rule was, as in <em>Welch </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven, </em>&amp; <em>Hartford Railroad, </em>176 Mass. 393, and <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>184 Mass. 476. This was not, as in the cases just cited and in <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Worcester Consolidated Street Railway, </em>193 Mass. 63, a case in which negligence might have been found from the violation of a rule. The plaintiff\u2019s object was to discredit the story of the conductor by showing that, although he had not reported the occurrence in question, he yet understood that under the defendant\u2019s rules it was his duty to make such a report. That is, the plaintiff apparently desired to lay the foundation for an argument that the real reason for the conductor\u2019s failure to\" make a report was that the latter could not truthfully have done so without confessing his own misconduct, and so to contend that the conductor\u2019s story told at the trial ought not to be believed. For this purpose, it was not the rule itself, but the conductor\u2019s understanding of the rule, or rather, as the presiding justice correctly put it, his understanding of his duty under the rule, that was material. We find no error here.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">2. But we are of opinion that there was error in the ruling made that, while the conductor was not bound to stop the car for the purpose of allowing the plaintiff to get upon it, and would have had the right to interfere with the person of the plaintiff to prevent his being injured, yet he had not the right to do so for the purpose of preventing the plaintiff from getting upon the car; that the conductor had no right to do this, had no right to interfere with the person of the plaintiff to loose the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>hold upon the car for the purpose of keeping him from getting on board. This ruling' was given with reference to the contention of the defendant that the trouble with the plaintiff arose from his \u25a0attempt to board the car while it was in motion, and the effort of the conductor to prevent him from doing so. It was distinctly and plainly stated to the jury, and the defendant by its exception invited the attention of the judge to the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">In bur opinion the jury should have been instructed as to this part of the case that, if the car had started upon its return trip there was, while it was in motion, no offer to accept any one as a passenger, and the conductor had a right to refuse to accept any one who sought to board the car, and, after such refusal, to use a reasonable degree of force to prevent such a person from boarding and entering the car, and for that purpose to lay hands upon him and interfere with his person, using no more force than was reasonably necessary, though he would have no right to use any excessive or unreasonable force or to attack wantonly any such intending passenger. This is the necessary result of the doctrines laid down in <em>Webster </em>v. <em>Fitchburg </em>Railroad, 161 Mass. 298, and <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Eastern Railroad, </em>139 Mass. 238, and is the very point of the decision in <em>Hogner </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>198 Mass. 260. So in <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Manhattan Railway, </em>31 Hun, 5, 8. If the plaintiff against the resistance of the conductor persisted in his attempt to board the moving car, understanding that the conductor refused to receive him as a passenger, he was a <em>trespasser; Massell </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>191 Mass. 491; and the conductor had the right to prevent him from carrying out his wrongful purpose by the use of such force ais was reasonably necessary under the circumstances. If the car was not running for the transportation of passengers at all, but was merely being taken to the car barn to be put up for the night, the plaintiff\u2019s rights would be no greater than already has been stated. For any excessive force or for any wanton or reckless injury, there of course would be a liability. <em>McKeon </em>v. <em>New York, New Haven, &amp; Hartford Railroad, </em>183 Mass. 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
