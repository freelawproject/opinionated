The physician who attended the insured after the accident testified that in his opinion the accident was the sole cause of death. There was testimony of the plaintiff and others as to the appearance and condition of the insured before and after the accident which the jury could find tended to support the same conclusion. There was testimony as to whether the insured had been suffering from diabetes, and an attending physician testified that he was unable to tell whether the accident was tlie sole cause of death or not. There also was in evidence an application by the insured to the defendant for a weekly indemnity under the policy made at a time when he supposed that he had recovered from his injuries. <em>Held, </em>that the question whether the accident was the sole cause of the death of the insured was one eminently for the jury and that a finding by them that such was the case was warranted by the evidence.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b287-12\">In an action on a policy of accident insurance by the widow of the insured to recover the amount payable upon his death from injuries due to an accident of tlie kind covered by the policy, it appeared that the insured had applied to the defendant for a weekly indemnity for his loss of time resulting from the accident which caused his death, and in his application had agreed that the indemnity when paid should be in full discharge of any and all claims under his policy against the defendant on account of the injuries in question and should release and forever discharge the defendant from all liability under the policy on account of those injuries. There was evidence that a letter containing a check for the amount claimed by the insured as weekly indemnity, properly addressed to the insured with a return imprint on the envelope in which it was enclosed and witli postage prepaid, was mailed to the insured by the defendant\u2019s treasurer a few days before the death of the insured and that it never had been returned to the defendant. The defendant admitted that the check never had been used by the insured, and the plaintiff testified that she never had seen it, and that after the death of the insured she examined his clothes and pocket book and looked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>through his effects and found no check of the defendant. <em>Held, </em>that on this evidence the jury would be warranted in finding that the check never liad been received by the insured and consequently that the weekly indemnity to which he made claim never had been paid to him.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-4\">Contract by the widow of William T. Cheswell, the chief of the fire department of the city of Boston, upon a policy of accident insurance to recover $1,250 and interest alleged to be due under such policy upon the death of the plaintiff\u2019s husband on February 15, 1906, alleged to have been caused by his being thrown violently from his carriage while he was responding to an alarm of fire on December 20, 1905. Writ dated July 23,1906.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-5\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>White, </em>J. The findings warranted by the evidence are stated in the opinion. At the time the policy was issued the insured was a district chief of the fire department of the city of Boston and at the time of his death was the chief of that department as stated above. It appeared that on December 20, 1905, he was severely injured in the manner stated above and was removed on the same day to the Massachusetts General Hospital, where he was placed under the care of Dr. H. H. A. Beach, and was discharged therefrom, much relieved, on December 29, 1905. He thereupon returned to his home, and remained in his house until January 22, 1906, when he resumed his duties as chief of the fire department. These duties he continued to perform until February 15, 1906, when, in the early morning, while directing his subordinates at a fire on Commercial Street, Boston, he suddenly was taken ill, was removed immediately to the relief hospital in Haymarket Square, and died there in less than three minutes after his arrival. No post-mortem examination was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-6\">The policy sued upon, omitting the provisions immaterial to the case, was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-7\">\u201cNo. 19687</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AVF\">Age 49</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-8\">Fraternal Accident.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-9\">Association of America.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-10\">Located at Westfield, Massachusetts, Hampden Co.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AfV\">Accident Certificate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-11\">Amount $1250</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ANY\">Class 5</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-12\">\u201c In consideration of the warranties in the application, a copy of which is endorsed hereon, for this certificate and the agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>ment on the part of the certificate holder to accept the conditions contained in this certificate as the basis of this contract, and in consideration of five dollars paid by William T.

On February 10, 1906, a check of the defendant for $45.71 payable to the order of the insured was mailed to the insured at his address in Boston in a letter of the same date, signed by N. N. Kingsbury as secretary and treasurer of the defendant, saying, \u201cEnclosed find our draft No. 5603 in full payment of your claim No. 6726 against this association.\u201d The postage on this letter was prepaid and the envelope containing it had the defendant\u2019s business address in the upper left hand-corner. In the defendant\u2019s brief was the statement, \u201c This check was not used by Mr. Cheswell during his lifetime and had not been returned at the time of trial in the lower court.\u201d The plaintiff testified that she never had seen the check and that after her husband\u2019s death she examined his clothes and pocket book and looked through his effects and found no check of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-6\">At the close of the evidence the judge refused to rule that upon the whole evidence the plaintiff was riot entitled to recover and also refused to make other rulings requested by the defendant which have become immaterial because the exceptions founded on their refusal were not argued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-7\">The judge submitted to the jury the following questions, to which the jury returned the answers which are appended:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-8\">\u201c Did the death of William T. Cheswell, on February 15th, 1906, result, alone and independently of all other causes, from the injuries which he sustained in consequence of the accident which occurred to him on December 20th, 1905 ? \u201d \u201c Yes.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-9\">\u201c Did William T. Cheswell, in due course of the mail, and in due course of business, receive from the defendant its check for $45.71 in full discharge of any and all claims under the policy set out in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration ? \u201d \u201c No.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b292-10\">The jury returned a general verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $1,809.38; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b293-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number><em>A. E. Denison, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b293-4\"><em>R.

One was whether the death of the insured was due to the accident alone. The other was whether the insured had received payment of the weekly indemnity to which he made claim. If the death of the insured was not due to the accident alone, then, under the terms of the policy, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover. And if the insured had received payment of the weekly indemnity, then the conditions under which he received it operated to release the association from all further liability under the policy on account of the injuries received by him from the accident. Two questions embodying these issues were submitted by the presiding judge, without objection, to the jury who answered both in favor of the plaintiff, and returned a general verdict for her. The case is here on exceptions by the defendant to the refusal of the presiding judge to give certain instructions that were requested, of which the first, and the only one that has been argued, was, that upon all of the evidence the plaintiff was not entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">There clearly was evidence warranting the jury in finding that the accident was the sole cause of death. Dr. Beach, who attended the insured after the accident, testified that in his opinion the accident was the sole cause of death. There was also testimony from the widow and others as to the appearance and condition of the deceased before and after the accident which the jury could properly find tended in the same direction. It was for the jury to give such weight as they saw fit to the fact, if they found that it was a fact, that he had been and was suffering from diabetes, and to the testimony of Dr. Vickery, an attending physician, that he was unable to tell whether the accident was the sole cause of death or not, and to the statements made by the insured himself in his application for the weekly indemnity. The jury were told by the presiding judge, in instructions not otherwise excepted to, and which they could not have failed to understand, that they could not find for the plaintiff, or answer the question in the affirmative unless they were satisfied that the accident was the sole cause of death. The question, whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>it was the sole cause of death, was one eminently for them, and they have found, as there was evidence to warrant them in doing, in favor of the plaintiff, and we do not see how their finding can be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">In regard to the other question there was evidence tending to show that a check duly addressed to the insured and with a return imprint upon the envelope in which it was enclosed and prepaid was mailed to the insured by the treasurer of the defendant association a few days before the death of the insured and that it never had been returned to the defendant. It was admitted by the defendant that the check never had been used by the insured, and the widow testified that she had never seen it, and that after the death of the insured she examined his clothes and pocketbook and looked through his effects and found no check of the defendant. In this state of the evidence it was competent for the jury to find that the check never had been received by the insured and consequently that the weekly indemnity to which he made claim had never been paid to him. On this branch of the case also, the judge gave full instructions which we think correctly stated the law. None of the instructions requested by the defendant on this or the other branch of the case could have been properly given in the form in which they were presented. We discover no error in the manner in which the presiding judge dealt with the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
