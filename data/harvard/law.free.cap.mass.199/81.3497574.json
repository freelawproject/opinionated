This was in substance the whole of the paragraph and there was no provision in it for arbitration. In a paragraph in regard to alterations there was a provision for arbitration in case either party was dissatisfied with the decision of the architect. In a paragraph in regard to delay caused by the neglect or default of the owner or by other causes named which were not the fault of the contractor, there was a similar provision for arbitration. A like provision for arbitration was contained in still another paragraph in regard to the obligation of the owner to provide all labor and materials not included in the contract in such a manner as not to delay the progress of the work. In the paragraph in regard to the payments to be made by the owner to the contractor upon certificates of the architect that such payments had become due there was no provision for arbitration. It appeared that the building was not completed until sixty-five days after the day named for completion in the contract. The defendant claimed damages for the plaintiff\u2019s delay, and the plaintiff proposed that the matter should be submitted to arbitration in the manner provided in the paragraphs of the contract containing such provisions. The defendant refused to leave the question to arbitration. <em>Held, </em>that a provision for arbitration could not be imported into the paragraph providing for liquidated damages for the owner in case of delay on the part of the contractor, and that submission to arbitration was not a condition precedent to recoupment by the defendant of his damages for such delay.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b101-8\">In an action by a contractor on a contract in writing, with a count on an account annexed, to recover a balance alleged to be due for constructing a building on land of the defendant, if it appears that the plaintiff constructed the building but failed to complete it within the time required by the contract and that portions of the work were defective, the plaintiff can recover on his account annexed an amount not exceeding the agreed price diminished by the amount of payments and of all damages suffered by the defendant from the plaintiff\u2019s breaches of the stipulations of the contract.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b101-9\">In an action by a contractor to recover a balance alleged to be due for the construction of a factory building for the defendant under a contract in writing, it appeared that by the terms of the contract all payments were to be made <em>\u201c </em>upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>written certificates of the architect to the effect that such payments have become due,\u201d that the final payment should <em>\u201c </em>be made within thirty-five days after this contract is fulfilled,\u201d and \u201c that no certificate given or payment made under this contract, except the final certificate or final payment, shall be conclusive evidence of the performance of this contract, either wholly or in part, and that no payment shall be construed to be an acceptance of defective work or improper materials.\u201d The plaintiff completed the building but failed to complete it within the time required by the contract and some of the work was defective. After the completion of the building the plaintiff sent to the defendant a bill for $16,690. This bill was returned to the plaintiff by the architect with the following indorsement upon it signed by the architect: <em>\u201c </em>Approved for sixteen thousand six hundred nineteen dollars and ninety cents ($16,619.90) less the sum of allowance agreed upon.\u201d There were figures in pencil showing the deduction of $70.10. This bill was returned to the plaintiff enclosed with a letter from the architect, in which he referred to a letter from the plaintiff asking him to pass upon the questions at issue between the plaintiff and the defendant, the two main points of contention being in regard to defective concrete work and delay in the completion of the building, the architect in his letter naming $6,000 as his estimate of the amount of the allowance to be made for defective concrete work and $3,000 as his estimate of the amount to be allowed for delay, and stating at the conclusion of his letter, \u201c Your bills are returned approved with the exception of three small items.\u201d The plaintiff contended that the written approval of the architect upon the plaintiff\u2019s final bill was a final certificate approving the payment of $16,619.90 and was conclusive as to the right of the plaintiff to receive that amount, and further, that, if this was not so, the architect\u2019s approval of the bill, taken together with his letter, was a final certificate that the allowance on account of defects in the concrete work should not be more than $6,000. <em>Held, </em>that the qualified approval of the architect on the plaintiff\u2019s bill was not a final certificate within the meaning of the contract, to be treated as conclusive evidence of performance, but that, even if it were given effect as a certificate, the architect\u2019s approval did not bind the defendant to the acceptance of either work or material which was not in accordance with the contract or preclude him from the recoupment of damages.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b102-5\">In - an action by a contractor to recover a balance alleged to be due for the construction of a piano factory for the defendant under a contract in writing, where it appeared that the concrete floors of the building were defective and were not constructed in accordance with the specifications of the contract, and the defend ant sought to recoup damages on this account, it was <em>held, </em>that the measure of damages to which the defendant was entitled in recoupment on this account was the difference between what the value of the floors would have been if they had been constructed in accordance with the specifications and their value as built and left by the plaintiff.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b102-6\">In an action by a contractor to recover a balance alleged to be due for the construction of a piano factory for the defendant under a contract in writing, where it appeared that the concrete floors of the building were defective and were not constructed in accordance with the specifications, and the defendant sought to recoup damages on this account, the jury were taken to view the concrete floors and had an opportunity to see the condition of the surface and the general character of the work. The judge in his charge to the jury directed their attention to the defendant\u2019s contention that the only way in which the floors could be rendered serviceable was to reconstruct the surface by putting on the finish called for by the contract. He then instructed the jury that, if they found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>resurfacing was not only a reasonable but a practical method of repairing the damage, their estimate of the cost of such resurfacing would be the measure of damages, but, if they deemed such repairs inexpedient or the evidence was insufficient to enable them to estimate the probable expense, they were to give the matter no further consideration. <em>Held, </em>that these instructions gave the plaintiff no cause' for complaint. o</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-5\">Contract to recover a balance of $17,994.14 alleged to be due under a contract in writing for the construction of a six story brick factory building on land of the defendant on Massachusetts Avenue at the corner of Magazine Street in Boston, with a second count upon an account annexed for the same sum of money.

As the plaintiff was not satisfied with the finding of the architect as to the amount to be allowed the defendant for delay in the construction of the building, and as it requested a reference of the matter to arbitration in accordance with the provisions of the contract, the submission of this matter to arbitration by the terms of the contract was a condition precedent to the defendant\u2019s right to receive or recover any deduction or allowance for such delay. As the defendant entirely refused to comply with this provision in the contract as to arbitration, though such arbitration was requested and demanded by the plaintiff, he cannot, as a matter of law, receive or recover any deduction or allowance whatsoever on account of the delay.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-7\">2. The written approval of the architect upon the plaintiff\u2019s final bill is a final certificate of the architect within the meaning and requirement of the contract for the sum of $16,619.90.

The auditor to whom the case was referred having reported, that with the exception of the item for drafting plans, the plaintiff was entitled to the amount shown by the declaration, less certain deductions for defective work and materials and for failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>finish the building within the time named in the contract, it relied unreservedly upon the report, and, not having introduced evidence to control or vary the findings, they must be deemed to have been regarded as the basis upon which the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover finally rested. The allowance for. changes in the foundations, caused by a departure from the original plans, having been conceded, the declination of the defendant to accept the amounts allowed for delay and imperfect construction of the concrete floors narrowed the controversy before the jury to these issues, respectively raised in the first item of the declaration in set-off and by the claim for recoupment. R. L. c. 174, \u00a7 1. <em>Blacker </em>v. Boott, 114 Mass. 24, 27. <em>Ford </em>v. Burchard, 130 Mass. 424. <em>Blood </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>141 Mass. 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">If the evidence introduced in support of the counterclaim was competent, the jury were warranted in returning a verdict in favor of the defendant, as they could find the entire damages suffered from a failure to comply with the contract more than exceeded the entire amount demanded. The plaintiff, while taking no exception to the admission of this evidence, and offering no rebuttal, then requested the justice to rule, by the terms of the contract, the plaintiff having been dissatisfied with the decision of the architect as to the number of days chargeable to it for delay in the construction of the building and having requested arbitration of the dispute, which the defendant refused, the defendant could not recover damages from the plaintiff, as an award was a condition precedent to the right to bring suit. It also asked for a further ruling, that as the architect, under the authority conferred upon him to approve payments, had given a final certificate for the full amount demanded, the claim in recoupment could not be maintained, or, if this ruling was refused, then the defendant was bound by the allowance for defective work made by the architect, and the plaintiff was entitled to recover this balance without further deductions. We are of opinion that the denial of these requests was right. It may be assumed from the reference in the closing sentences of articles seven and eight, that the parties intended to incorporate the provisions as to arbitration found in article three, and make them applicable in the same manner to this part of the contract. If the entire contract is examined, it is seen that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>was not the purpose of the parties, except as to the requirements of article five, to make the action taken by the architect upon the various details of construction as the work progressed final, and in this respect the contract differs from those construed in <em>National Contracting Co. </em>v. Commonwealth, 183 Mass. 89, 92, <em>Norcross </em>v. <em>Wyman, </em>187 Mass. 25, and <em>White </em>v. <em>Abbott, </em>188 Mass. 99, where the determination of the architect or supervising engineer upon such matters was held to be conclusive. See <em>Hebert </em>v. <em>Dewey, </em>191 Mass. 403, 408. Instead, when called upon to act, his decision, if unsatisfactory to either party, was to be referred to arbitration for final settlement. But article six, upon which the set-off rests, contains no reference to either mode of adjustment. It stipulated that, if the completion of the building should be delayed beyond the time named, liquidated damages at the rate of $50 a day should be paid by the plaintiff, \u201c until the whole of said work is fully completed.\u201d <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Crowley, </em>5 Allen, 304. If not conceded, it was undisputed that the limit had been exceeded by sixty-five days, before the building was finished. While the auditor\u2019s decision exonerated the defendant from any breach of article eight, the plaintiff has constantly asserted that much of this delay was caused by the defendant\u2019s neglect, and default in performance, for which under the provisions of article seven he should be held liable. By construing articles six, seven and eight as dependent, and providing for a settlement without litigation of all questions of amount and value, it seeks to read into article six the arbitration clause. But if under article seven the defense of the loss of time attributable to the defendant\u2019s failure in providing materials and labor to be furnished by him was fully available under the auditor\u2019s finding, that the limitation within which the demand must be presented had been waived, the plaintiff had expressly agreed to pay a fixed amount for each day\u2019s delay, from which it had not been released. This provision was not made dependent upon the agreement for an extension of time, but is distinct. It is not a promise to pay whatever sum either the architect or arbitrators might determine, but to pay at the rate named for a definite period, even if that period might be shortened, if the plaintiff found it necessary, in avoidance, to resort to the provisions for its protection contained in article seven. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>principal agreement to erect and finish the building for the consideration the defendant agreed to pay, and the agreement to pay liquidated damages under article six if the defendant claimed them, were independent provisions to neither of which was attached a stipulation that until the amount due had been settled by arbitration no suit for either the price or the damages should be maintained. An award not having been made a condition precedent to the right to sue, each was at liberty to resort to the courts for a settlement of their differences. <em>Nute </em>v. <em>Hamilton Ins.

While this bill was held by the architect, to whom it had been submitted, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>architect received a letter from the plaintiff setting forth the grounds of the defendant\u2019s dissatisfaction, with a statement in reply, and requesting, that their differences might be reviewed, and decided. Having received full instructions as to the particulars of their dispute, the qualified indorsement of approval which appears upon the bill should be read in connection with the reply to the plaintiff\u2019s request. It is evident that, with these papers before him, he reached the conclusion that upon both grounds a very substantial sum should be deducted, and, after having audited and approved the items with certain minor ex-* ceptions, owing to the radical disagreement between them, left the final amount to be adjusted by the parties, if they settled according to his recommendations. Manifestly, this restricted indorsement could not have been intended, nor can it fairly be construed within the meaning of the contract, as a final certificate, which should be treated as conclusive evidence of a full performance. But, if given effect as a certificate, the architect\u2019s approval did not bind the defendant to the acceptance of either work or material not in accordance with the contract or preclude him from the recoupment of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">The instructions given as to the measure of damages also are said to have been in part erroneous, and misleading. The finding of the auditor that the concrete floors were not constructed in accordance with the specifications was unquestioned. Not only was the alignment imperfect and the workmanship poor, but the material used for topping, instead of being composed of the ingredients specified, showed the presence of foreign substances, which not only detracted from the appearance of the floors but being imbedded in their surface became loose as the floors were used, leaving small cavities, which as a source of dust seriously depreciated the value of the building for use as a piano factory. The plaintiff having failed to comply with the contract, and the defective work not having been accepted, the defendant could recoup as damages the difference between the value of the floors if they had been built as designed, and their value as built and left by the plaintiff. <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Coyne, </em>188 Mass. 401, 405, and cases cited. <em>Eastern Expanded Metal Co. </em>v. <em>Webb Granite &amp; Construction Co. </em>195 Mass. 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">This general rule was given and fully explained. The jury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>however., had viewed the premises, and what they had seen as to the condition of the surface and general character of the work being evidence of its value to be considered with other testimony, the judge directed their attention to the defendant\u2019s position, that the only feasible way in which the floors could be rendered serviceable was to reconstruct the surface by putting on the finish called for by the contract. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>148 Mass. 407, 409, 410. They then were instructed, if they found that, instead of using the floors as they had been left, resurfacing was not only a reasonable but a practical method of repairing the defects, their estimate of the cost would measure the extent of the damages. But if they deemed such repairs to have been inexpedient, or the evidence was insufficient to enable them to estimate the probable expense, they were to givey the matter no further consideration. These instructions being the equivalent of saying that, the plaintiff having broken the contract, the damages suffered by the defendant were measured by the difference between the value of the floors when finished in accordance with the specifications and their value in the condition in which the plaintiff left them, the plaintiff has no just cause for complaint. <em>Veazie </em>v. <em>Hosmer, </em>11 Gray, 396. <em>Olds </em>v. <em>Mapes-Reeve Construction Co. </em>177 Mass. 41, 43. <em>Hebb </em>v. <em>Welsh, </em>185 Mass. 335, 337.
