He filed a report in which he found that the defendants Hamblin and Russell owed the plaintiff $11,534.65.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-13\">In the Superior Court the case was heard upon the defendants\u2019 exceptions to the master\u2019s report by <em>Fox, </em>J., who filed the following memorandum of decision:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b173-14\">\u201c Oct. 31, 1887, the plaintiff, an inventor, made an agreement with the defendants who are manufacturers, under which the defendants were to manufacture and sell the plaintiff\u2019s patented articles and give him half the profits arising from the manufac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>turc and sale. The clause relating to the division of profits is as follows: 6 Fourth. The parties of the second part agree to pay to the party of the first part one-half of the net profits realized from the manufacture and sale of said improved wardrobe and other hooks made under this agreement; said profits to be computed and paid quarterly during the months of January, April, July and October of each year.\u2019 This agreement remained in force from 1887 to 1900. During all this time the plaintiff was in the defendants\u2019 employ, drawing $20 a week as wages, but there was never any estimation or division of the profits, the defendants contending that none were earned. The master on page 12 of his report says that it is impossible for him to determine whether for the entire period the business was run at a loss or not. In spite of this declaration he awards to the plaintiff $11,534.65 as his share of the profits with interest earned during this period. I am unable to accept this conclusion for several reasons.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-5\">\u201c 1. The master apparently proceeds upon the assumption that if the business for any single quarter was profitable, the plaintiff was entitled to a share of the profit of that quarter, even though that profit did not make good the losses of the preceding quarters. For example, if the business lost $500 in each of the first three quarters of the year and gained $500 in the last quarter, the plaintiff was entitled to have $250 as his share of the profit for that quarter, and leave the defendants to bear the entire loss of $1,500. I am of the opinion that the plaintiff was not entitled to any share of the profit until the business showed a profit, and that it could not show a profit until it showed a surplus above the investment. It may be true that the plaintiff\u2019s 'right to a profit once earned could not be cut down by subsequent losses, but it does not appear that there was any time during the entire thirteen years when the receipts and stock and machinery on hand exceeded the outlay.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-6\">\u201c 2. The master finds that there was a profit in sixteen quarters, scattered through the thirteen years, and he rests this finding upon an account submitted by the defendants\u2019 experts and annexed to his report, \u2018 Exhibit A.\u2019 This has a column of expenses by quarters and a column of sales by quarters. In any quarter in which the sales exceed the expenses that excess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>is put down in a third column marked \u2018 Surplus,\u2019 and whenever the expenses exceed the sales, that excess is put in a column headed \u2018 Deficit.\u2019 The account, therefore, simply shows that during certain quarters the receipts exceeded the expenses, and during other quarters the expenses exceeded the receipts. For example, for the quarter ending Jan. 1, 1889, the receipts were $1,229.37 and were $549 less than the expenditures. For the quarter ending April 1, 1889, the receipts were $2,536.04 and exceeded the expenditures by $216.53. The only natural inference from these figures is that goods were manufactured in one quarter and sold in the next. It would clearly be impossible from this account to infer either that the concern lost money in one quarter or made it in the next quarter. No estimate of profits could be made without at least a stock-taking, and the report shows there was no stock-taking from the beginning to the end of the business.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-5\">\u201c3. The master finds that there was on hand at the close of the business machinery, tools and stock to the value of $8,994.95. From this sum he deducts $3,000 as capital advanced by the defendants, and finds that the plaintiff is entitled to one-half the remainder or $2,997.47, and this sum he includes in his award in the plaintiff\u2019s favor. There is no evidence that the plaintiff ever put any money into the business, and there is no theory upon which the plaintiff can be entitled to a division of the property on hand at the close of the business unless that property represents undivided profits. In view of the statement of the master already referred to, that he is unable to say whether the business was run at a loss or not, even when the inventory is taken into account, it is difficult to see on what ground this award was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-6\">\u201c The master, however, is right in holding that the defendants are not entitled to charge interest upon the capital advanced by them in carrying on the business. See <em>Rishton </em>v. <em>Grissell, </em>L. R. 5 Eq. 326. Apparently, even upon the account submitted by the defendants and annexed to the master\u2019s report, if interest be deducted and if the inventory be taken into account (as it should be) a surplus would be shown, and although the exceptions to the master\u2019s report, so far as they are covered by the foregoing memorandum, must be sustained, the case will be retained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>order that the plaintiff may if he desires file a motion for the reopening of the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-3\">\u201c The question whether the plaintiff is entitled to interest on profits need not be considered until it appears that there was a profit. The plaintiff, however, made no demand for an account until 1899. He had access to the books and knew that there had never been any stock-taking; that the books contained simply an account of moneys received and expended and no sufficient data for estimating the profit, if there was any. If upon recasting the account a profit is shown, it seems that interest upon that profit should be computed from 1900. <em>Rishton </em>v. <em>Grissell, </em>L. R. 10 Eq. 393.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-4\">\u201cThe fourth, sixth and eleventh of the defendants\u2019 exceptions are sustained. The rest are overruled except as above indicated.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-5\">The judge made a final decree that the master\u2019s report be confirmed except as appeared by the memorandum filed in the case; that upon the facts found by the master it did not appear that the plaintiff was entitled to recover any sum of money from the defendants, and, since the plaintiff had filed no motion for a reopening of the case pursuant to leave granted, that the bill be dismissed. From this decree the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-6\">The defendants\u2019 fourth, sixth and eleventh exceptions to the master\u2019s report sustained by the judge were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-7\">\u201c 4. (Based on objection numbered 4.) The defendants except to the ruling, because under the contract there could be no \u2018 net profits \u2019 in any quarter until the expenses of that quarter and the unpaid debts of the business fat previous quarters were paid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-8\">[\u201c Fourth: The defendants object to the last paragraph . . . as it is an erroneous construction of clause 4 of the contract, if the master intended to rule that the business of each quarter should be considered apart and distinct from the business of every other quarter and that \u2018 at the expiration of each quarter when there was a profit the plaintiff became immediately entitled to one half thereof, and that his right thereto would not be divested by reason of any losses accruing in any \u2019 quarter or quarters immediately preceding that particular quarter, because \u2018 net profits \u2019 mean the clear gains of the business as a whole up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>to that time when a computation is made to ascertain its condi- \u25a0 tian, that is, there could be no * net profits \u2019 until the debts of the business had been paid or the deficit of the immediate preceding quarter or quarters had been wiped out.\u201d]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-5\">\u201c 6. (Based on objection numbered 7.) The defendants except to the finding, as erroneous, because the old ledger does not show a single instance of a quarterly accounting such as adopted by the master, but it does show that in every quarter where a balance was struck, there was also taken into consideration the balance whether debit or credit, of the immediately preceding period.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-6\">[\u201c Seventh: The defendants object to the first sentence of the last paragraph on page 5, \u2018 I find that there was no such abandonment of quarterly accounting in the books of the company as to justify the finding that the parties adopted another or annual scheme in lieu thereof,\u2019 as plainly wrong, if the master meant by the words \u2018 quarterly accounting \u2019 such a method of accounting as he has adopted, for no such quarterly accountings are shown of the books, but on the other hand they do show that whatever quarterly balances were struck, that balance was carried forward into the next succeeding period and taken into account therein.\u201d]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-7\">\u201c11. (Based on objection numbered 12.) The defendants except to the statement that \u2018 the tabulation of the defendants\u2019 expert shows profits in certain quarters,\u2019 because the tabulation does not show any profits but only that the sales of goods made during certain quarters, regardless of when they were manufactured, exceeded the expenses of those quarters, thereby resulting in surpluses which were applied to the cancellation of the due and unpaid debts of the business.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b177-8\">[\u201cTwelfth: The defendants object to the finding, \u2018In said account rendered by defendants\u2019 expert profits are shown in sixteen of the quarters accruing during the period from November 1,1887 to January 1st, 1900. These profits aggregated $7,879.73,\u201d as the account rendered by the defendants\u2019 expert does not show any \u2018 net profits \u2019 in any quarter, but simply that the sales of goods made during that quarter, regardless of when they were manufactured, exceeded the expenses of that quarter, thereby resulting in surpluses in certain quarters.\u201d]</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>C. <em>C. Mellen, (H. E. Fales </em>with him,) for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b178-5\"><em>M. H. </em>Browne, <em>(J. M. Browne </em>with him,) for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b178-6\">Sheldon, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ap5\">The first question in this case is raised upon the plaintiff\u2019s claim that he was entitled to one half of the profits that might be made in any one quarter regardless of whatever losses might have been sustained in previous quarters. The result of this contention, if sustained, would be that if, after an unbroken series of losses sustained throughout many successive quarters, some profits finally should be realized in any one quarter considered by itself, he would become at once entitled to receive one half of such profits as a net gain, while the defendants would have to apply their share in the profits of such special quarter towards reimbursing themselves for their previous losses. The manifest result of this construction under any probable state of affairs would be to give to the plaintiff a much larger share of the profits than would be received by the defendants, and in the events that have happened might give the plaintiff a large profit and leave the defendants to bear a large loss. The agreement cannot be so construed. The words \u201c net profits \u201d in the fourth clause of the agreement relied on, \u201c to be computed and paid quarterly ... in each year,\u201d must be taken in the ordinary acceptation of those words, to mean whatever net profits have then accrued from the business since its beginning, or since the last division of such net profits. These net profits would be substantially represented at any one time by the amount of the receipts from the business, the sums due for goods sold, and the value of stock, materials, tools and plant on hand, less the amount of the investment, of payments made or liabilities incurred for expenses, and any losses sustained by reason of bad debts or otherwise. In other words, they would be what should remain as the clear gain of the venture, after deducting from the net value of all assets on hand the capital invested in the business and all outstanding liabilities. <em>Park </em>v. <em>Grant Locomotive Works, </em>13 Stew. (N. J.) 114, 121. It is to one half of these net profits computed at the end of each successive quarter that the plaintiff is entitled. And as the plaintiff\u2019s right to this amount would become vested at the end of each quarter when, so reckoned, there were any net profits to be divided, and the amount so due to him should have been paid to him at once, it follows that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>share of any net profits once realized, is hot to be cut down or diminished by the amount of any subsequent losses. This was the doctrine of <em>Hitchings </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>12 Gray, 449. Accordingly the defendants\u2019 fourth and sixth exceptions to the master\u2019s report were properly sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">But it may be that the defendants\u2019 eleventh exception should not have been sustained. It is true that the defendants\u2019 tabulation did not show actual profits in any quarter, or anything more than that the sales of goods in certain quarters exceeded the expenses of those quarters. But the defendants\u2019 books had tieen ill kept, and were found to be erroneous and not wholly trustworthy, and did not furnish sufficient data for ascertaining the true state of the accounts. They do not appear to have indicated the value of the stock or plant on hand at the end of the respective quarters. It may be that they included, at any rate the master might have found that they included, in the column headed \u201cExpenses\u201d the amounts ($3,000 in all) advanced by the defendants as capital of the business. But this table, incomplete and somewhat inaccurate as it was, was presented by the defendants as a statement of the whole result of the business. It was the evidence upon which they largely relied to sustain their contention that the expenses of the business had exceeded its receipts, and so that there were no net profits. <em>Wisconsin Sulphite Fibre Co. </em>v. <em>D. K. Jeffris Lumber Co. </em>132 Wis. 1. As against them, and in view of the fact that the table which they put in evidence did not purport to measure the success of the business. and to determine the time when, if ever, it should be considered that net profits had been realized or to ascertain the amount of such net profits in any other way than by comparing expenses with receipts, we are of opinion that the master was warranted in finding that the tabulation of the defendants\u2019 expert did show profits in certain quarters, if, after correcting the statement of the expenses by making proper deductions for interest erroneously charged, he found that there were any quarters in which the receipts were greater than the amount of the expenses of that month and the deficits of the preceding months. Whether this should be found, depended upon a calculation which we have not, upon the master\u2019s report, the means of making.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>We agree with the ruling of the Superior Court that the defendants were not entitled to charge interest upon the amount advanced by them in carrying on the business. <em>Rishton </em>v. <em>Grissell, </em>L. R. 5 Eq. 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">We are inclined to the opinion, upon the facts which are stated in the master\u2019s report and the tables which are annexed to it, that a full statement of the account as rendered by the defendants, with proper corrections for the charges of interest made by them and with the correction that would be further required if it should turn out upon fuller investigation that the sum of $3,000 advanced by the defendants for capital of the business had been included in the tabulation of expenses put in by them and so should not again be charged in the final statement of the account, might show a small balance in favor of the plaintiff. We have not however before us sufficient data for determining these questions. Ordinarily, under such circumstances the case would be recommitted to the master to state'the proper account. But the defendants do not desire this; and as the plaintiff has failed to avail himself of the permission given to him by the Superior Court to ask to have this course adopted, we must infer that' he also does not desire it. It cannot be said to appear now that the plaintiff is entitled to recover anything from the defendants; and the decree of the Superior Court must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
