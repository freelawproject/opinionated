The plaintiff testified and the agent denied that the agent stated that he was willing to take the plaintiff\u2019s check in lieu of cash. There was no evidence of any authority of the agent to make any agreement as to the new deed or to make any agreement as to the acceptance of a check instead of cash, nor was there any evidence of a defect in the deed presented by the defendant\u2019s agent. The judge found that there was no evidence of any tender by the plaintiff either of a check or cash, and that there was no evidence of a breach of the contract by the defendant. <em>Held, </em>that the findings were warranted by the evidence.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-11\">Contract by the assignee of a contract in writing for the conveyance of land by the defendant to Alfred A.

The terms of the contract required that Marcus and Son should pay to the defendant $1,000 on or before February 1, 1903. Other facts are stated in the opinion. The judge found- that the contract was duly executed and was sufficient, but, in response to a request for a ruling, which was the fifth request, that, \u201c if H. A. Howard agreed to accept a check for $1,000 as compliance on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>the part of the plaintiff to the terms of the contract upon the return of the deed, it is not necessary for the plaintiff to show a further tender of $1,000 before February 1, 1903, to enable him to recover in this action,\u201d he ruled, \u201c There is no evidence of any tender either of check or cash \u201d; and refused to rule that, \u201c (7) upon all the evidence in the case there was evidence sufficient to warrant the court in finding that a valid contract was entered into between the defendant with Marcus; that such contract had been violated and that the plaintiff was entitled to recover damages for the breach of the contoact,\u201d or that, \u201c (8) upon all the evidence in the case the finding should be for the plaintiff.\u201d There was a finding for the defendant and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b92-5\"><em>W.

The plaintiff testified that the agent at this time said that he was willing to take the plaintiff\u2019s check for the amount due ; but this was denied. The plaintiff however objected to the acknowledgment of the deed offered him; and it was arranged between the plaintiff and the defendant\u2019s agent that a new deed should be drawn running to a different grantee, and sent to the defendant in Georgia for execution by herself and her husband. There was no evidence of the agent\u2019s authority to bind her by this new arrangement. The plaintiff prepared such a deed, and it was sent to the defendant by her agent, but was not returned. , The plaintiff asked the agent about the deed, and the agent said that he expected it and that there was no reason why he should not receive it the next day or very soon. Nothing further appears to have been done by the plaintiff until he brought this writ, six days after the date limited by the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">It is too plain for discussion that on these facts the judge was warranted in finding for the defendant on the ground that there had been no tender by the plaintiff and nothing in the conduct of the defendant to excuse a tender. Although there was evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>dence that after the first deed had been offered to the plaintiff a larger offer for the property had been made to the defendant, there was no evidence and apparently no claim that she had accepted such an offer, or even that the offer was made before the date of the plaintiff\u2019s writ. Plainly this bare offer, unaccepted and in no way acted upon, could not have excused the plaintiff from making a tender or offer of performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-3\">And the plaintiff\u2019s requests for rulings were properly refused. As to the fifth request, the judge found that there was no evidence of any tender of either check or cash; and this finding was manifestly correct. Nor did it appear that the defendant\u2019s agent had any authority to make any such agreement as was stated in that request. As to the seventh request, the judge was not bound to find, in the absence of any offer of performance on the part of the plaintiff and of any refusal or disability to perform on the part of the defendant, that she had violated the contract. It did not appear that the deed which she had offered to the plaintiff, of the contents of which we have not been informed, was not a sufficient offer of performance by her. And we have already seen that a finding for the defendant was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
