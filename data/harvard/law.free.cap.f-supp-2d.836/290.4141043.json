PRATTER, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">Plaintiffs have moved for the remand of this action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c). For the reasons that follow, the Court grants the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-12\">\n<em>I. Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b333-13\">Plaintiffs are six direct purchasers of eggs and egg products who originally filed their Complaint in the Twenty-Ninth Judicial District, the District Court of Wyandotte County, Kansas. As the basis for their single claim, Plaintiffs exclusively rely on Kansas state law in asserting that various egg and egg product producers and trade groups conspired to fix prices and restrict the supply of shell egg and egg products in violation of the Kansas Restraint of Trade Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 50-101 and 50-112.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-16\">After Plaintiffs initiated suit, this \u201cKansas action\u201d has navigated several procedural stopovers before ultimately coming to roost before this Court. Defendants filed a notice of removal of the action before the U.S. District Court of Kansas, following which Plaintiffs filed the motion <em>sub judice. </em>While the motion was pending before the Kansas federal court, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation conditionally transferred this action to the Processed Egg Products Antitrust Litigation (MDL No. 2002), then pending in this Court. <em>See </em>J.P.M.L. Transfer Order (Doc. No. 515). The cases coordinated or consolidated in the multidistrict litigation concern allegations of a conspiracy in violation of the Sherman Act among egg producers and trade groups to manipulate the supply of eggs and egg products and thereby affect the domestic prices of those goods. <em>See In re Processed Egg Prods. Antitrust Litig., </em>588 F.Supp.2d 1366, 1367 (J.P.M.L.2008). Some of those cases also include various state law claims against the Defendants. Because this Kansas action has been conditionally transferred to the multidistrict litigation, the pending motion for remand is before this Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>\n<em>II. Subject Matter Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">A defendant may properly remove to federal district court a civil action originally brought in state court, so long as the federal district court would have original jurisdiction over the matter. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(a); <em>Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Constr. Laborers Vacation Trust for S. Cal., </em>463 U.S. 1, 7-8, 103 S.Ct. 2841, 77 L.Ed.2d 420 (1983). In doing so, the removing defendant bears the burden of establishing that jurisdiction exists. <em>Dukes v. U.S. Healthcare, Inc., </em>57 F.3d 350, 359 (3d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Here, as the parties agree, because the named parties are not diverse, the Court\u2019s jurisdiction cannot be based upon diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a). \u201cWhere the parties are not diverse, removal is appropriate only if the case falls within the district court\u2019s original \u2018federal question\u2019 jurisdiction .... \u201d <em>U.S. Express Lines Ltd. v. Higgins, </em>281 F.3d 383, 389 (3d Cir.2002). In their removal papers Defendants invoked both 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1337 as bases for federal question jurisdiction. <em>See </em>Defs.\u2019 Notice of Removal at \u00b6 4. These provisions respectively provide for the district court\u2019s original jurisdiction in \u201call civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, and \u201cany civil action or proceeding arising under any Act of Congress regulating commerce or protecting trade and commerce against restraints and monopolies,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1337. The term \u201carising under\u201d is construed consistently across these provisions. <em>Franchise Tax Bd., </em>463 U.S. at 8 n. 7, 103 S.Ct. 2841 (\u201c[W]e have not distinguished between the \u2018arising under\u2019 standards of \u00a7 1337 and \u00a7 1331.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">Defendants argue that the Kansas action raises federal question jurisdiction sufficient for removal: \u201c(1) because Plaintiffs allege claims that arise in interstate commerce that arise solely under federal law; (2) because at least two Plaintiffs allege claims that have no connection at all to Kansas and, therefore, at least those claims cannot arise under Kansas law and must arise under federal law; (3) because the federal law of agricultural cooperatives completely preempts state law; and (4) because Plaintiffs\u2019 claims (even if properly pled under the Kansas Act) on their face raise substantial federal questions.\u201d Defs.\u2019 Resp. at 1. However, the Court determines that the federal issues identified by Defendants, to the extent that the Complaint\u2019s lone state claim implicates any, are insufficient to establish federal question jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">\n<em>A. Well-Pleaded Complaint Rule and Artful Pleading Doctrine</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b334-10\">\u201cOrdinarily, determining whether a particular case arises under federal law turns on the \u2018well-pleaded complaint\u2019 rule.\u201d <em>Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila, </em>542 U.S. 200, 207, 124 S.Ct. 2488, 159 L.Ed.2d 312 (2004) (internal quotations omitted) (citing <em>Franchise Tax Bd., </em>463 U.S. at 9-10, 103 S.Ct. 2841). Under the rule, \u201cfederal jurisdiction exists only when a federal question is presented on the face of the plaintiffs properly pleaded complaint.\u201d <em>Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams, </em>482 U.S. 386, 392, 107 S.Ct. 2425, 96 L.Ed.2d 318 (1987) (citing <em>Gully v. First Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>299 U.S. 109, 112-13, 57 S.Ct. 96, 81 L.Ed. 70 (1936)); <em>see also Gully, </em>299 U.S. at 115, 57 S.Ct. 96 (\u201cNot every question of federal law emerg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>ing in a suit is proof that a federal law is the basis of the suit.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">Accordingly, a petition for removal and an answer to a complaint are irrelevant in determining the presence <em>vel non </em>of a federal question, and \u201c[i]t is not enough that a federal question is or may be raised as a defense.\u201d <em>U.S. Express, </em>281 F.3d at 389 (citation omitted). Likewise, counterclaims are inadequate to confer federal jurisdiction. <em>Holmes Grp., Inc. v. Vornado Air Circulation Sys., Inc., </em>535 U.S. 826, 831, 122 S.Ct. 1889, 153 L.Ed.2d 13 (2002). In essence, the \u201crule makes the plaintiff the master of the claim; he or she may avoid federal jurisdiction by exclusive reliance on state law.\u201d <em>Caterpillar, </em>482 U.S. at 392, 107 S.Ct. 2425.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">\u201c[T]he vast majority of cases brought under the general federal-question jurisdiction of the federal courts are those in which federal law creates the cause of action.\u201d <em>Merrell Dow Pharm. Inc. v. Thompson, </em>478 U.S. 804, 808, 106 S.Ct. 3229, 92 L.Ed.2d 650 (1986). However, a \u201cstate suit need not invoke a federal law in order to \u2018arise under\u2019 it for removal purposes.\u201d <em>U.S. Express, </em>281 F.3d at 389. Consequently, for purposes of federal question jurisdiction, either a \u201cfederal law creates the cause of action or ... the plaintiff\u2019s right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal law.\u201d <em>Empire Healthchoice Assurance Inc. v. McVeigh, </em>547 U.S. 677, 690, 126 S.Ct. 2121, 165 L.Ed.2d 131 (2006) (citing <em>Franchise Tax Bd., </em>463 U.S. at 27-28, 103 S.Ct. 2841).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">A familiar, if cynical, corollary to the well-pleaded complaint rule is the \u201cartful pleading\u201d doctrine. <em>See Rivet v. Regions Bank of La., </em>522 U.S. 470, 475, 118 S.Ct. 921, 139 L.Ed.2d 912 (1998); <em>Franchise Tax Bd., </em>463 U.S. at 22, 103 S.Ct. 2841 (1983). \u201cIf a court concludes that a plaintiff has \u2018artfully pleaded\u2019 claims in this fashion, it may uphold removal even though no federal question appears on the face of the plaintiffs complaint.\u201d <em>Rivet, </em>522 U.S. at 475, 118 S.Ct. 921. As such, this doctrine \u201crequires a court to peer through what are ostensibly wholly state claims to discern the federal question lurking in the verbiage.\u201d <em>U.S. Express, </em>281 F.3d at 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">In doing so, it is important to recognize that the term \u201cfederal issue\u201d is not merely \u201ca password opening federal courts to any state action embracing a point of federal law,\u201d and that a cause of action simply \u201cappearfing] in state raiment\u201d is not necessarily cause for exclusion from federal courts. <em>Grable &amp; Sons Metal Prods., Inc. v. Darue Eng\u2019g &amp; Mfg., </em>545 U.S. 308, 314, 125 S.Ct. 2363, 162 L.Ed.2d 257 (2005).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Court must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>ask \u201cdoes a state-law claim necessarily raise a stated federal issue, actually disputed and substantial, which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities\u201d? <em>Id. </em>at 314, .125 S.Ct. 2363.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">In their Complaint, Plaintiffs present a cause of action under state law, the Kansas Restraint of Trade Act (\u201cKRTA\u201d), for violations of Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 50-101 and 50-112. <em>See </em>Compl. \u00b6\u00b6227, 234-35, 37 (articulating that Defendants\u2019 alleged conduct was \u201cin violation of the Kansas Restraint of Trade Act, K.S.A. 50-101 and 50-112\u201d and seeking relief pursuant to Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 50-115, 50-108, and 50-161). This \u201cKansas law is similar in some respects to the Sherman Act, but it is not identical.\u201d <em>Bergstrom v. Noah, </em>266 Kan. 829, 974 P.2d 520, 531 (1999). The Act \u201cdenies any person the right to form a trust or to be \u2018in any manner interested\u2019 in a trust, \u2018either directly or directly,\u2019 as defined in the [Act,] K.S.A. 50-102. In addition, all arrangements, contracts, agreements or trusts \u2018which tend to prevent full and free competition in the importation, transportation or sale of articles imported into this state\u2019 are \u2018against public policy, unlawful and void.\u2019 \u201d <em>Van Hoecke Contracting, Inc. v. Lennox Indus., Inc., </em>No. 05-02343, 2005 WL 2575271, at *3 (D.Kan. Oct. 12, 2005) (quoting Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 50-112). The Supreme Court of Kansas has summarized the KRTA as \u201cvery</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">sweeping in its provisions. It defines and denounces five kinds of combinations, which it denominates trusts. The definitions are couched in general terms, but cover almost every conceivable device by which freedom of commerce might be hampered, competition restricted, or the price of commodities controlled.\u201d <em>Bergstrom, </em>974 P.2d at 530 (quoting <em>Kansas v. Wilson, </em>73 Kan. 334, 80 P. 639, 640 (1906) in reference to Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 50-101 to 50-110); <em>see also Van Hoecke, </em>2005 WL 2575271, at *4 (quoting same).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">None of the Defendants\u2019 arguments against remand are premised upon the contention that the Complaint is deficient in alleging a prima facie claim under the KRTA. <em>Cf. United Jersey Banks v. Parell, </em>783 F.2d 360, 368 (3d Cir.1986) (commenting that \u201cfederal jurisdiction will not be found when the complaint states a prima facie claim under state law\u201d); <em>see also Jackson v. Prime Motors, Inc., No. </em>11-2360, 2011 WL 1883806, at *3 (E.D.Pa. May 18, 2011). Instead, Defendants attempt to recast the Plaintiffs claim as one arising under the Sherman Act because \u201c[e]ither in whole or in part, Plaintiffs allege interstate conspiracy claims that can only arise under the Sherman Act.\u201d Defs.\u2019 Resp. at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">Defendants argue that Plaintiffs assert factual allegations that involve \u201cthe same nationwide conspiracy, in interstate commerce, to fix prices of eggs and egg products,\u201d and which are \u201cvirtually identi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>cal\u201d to those allegations giving rise to the federal claims existing in the multidistrict litigation. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>However, even if the same factual allegations and same theory of conspiracy could give rise to both federal and state claims, the fact that Plaintiffs could have also brought a Sherman Act claim is not a factor in applying the well-pleaded complaint rule. <em>See Delta Dental of R.I. v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of R.I., </em>942 F.Supp. 740, 747 (D.R.I.1996) (\u201c... [T]he present dispute could have been brought as a federal antitrust claim under the Sherman Act. [Plaintiff] has chosen to forego its rights under federal law, however, instead relying exclusively on state law in asserting its claims against [Defendant] .... [Plaintiff], as the master of the claim, has chosen to rely exclusively on state law and to litigate in state court \u2014 a choice that [Defendant] cannot defeat, notwithstanding that the case could have been brought under the Sherman Act or that federal defenses might be available.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">Defendants also contend that Plaintiffs are impermissibly seeking to recover for claims based upon sales of goods outside of Kansas, and that Plaintiffs \u201ccan only seek recovery [for those claims] pursuant to federal law.\u201d Defs.\u2019 Resp. at 8. Namely, according to Defendants, Kansas courts generally do not recognize the enforcement of state law on extraterritorial acts and that the KRTA cannot apply to out-of-state transactions because to do so would conflict with the federal dormant commerce clause. <em>Id. </em>Additionally, Defendants claim that some of these six Plaintiffs may not be able to recover at all under the KRTA because those Plaintiffs\u2019 claims do not involve sales made in or into Kansas. <em>Id. </em>at 7-8. Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>the validity of these arguments, Defendants are merely highlighting that Plaintiffs may not be able to recover under the KRTA for the full scope of the activities and damages alleged in the Complaint for various reasons, including because of at least one reason premised upon a federal legal issue.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nonetheless, these arguments are not occasion for a Chicken Little panic. Instead, they simply constitute defenses to the state claim, and defenses do not provide appropriate grounds for removal on the basis of federal question jurisdiction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">Defendants are equally unpersuasive in their argument that \u201cthe Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint raises the substantial federal question of the agricultural cooperative\u2019s immunity on its face.\u201d Defs.\u2019 Resp. at 20. All <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>parties appear to agree that the CapperVolstead Act and the other statutes, \u201callow[ ] certain agricultural producers to form cooperatives without incurring antitrust liability.\u201d <em>In re Mushroom Direct Purchaser Antitrust Litig., </em>655 F.3d 158, 158 (3d Cir.2011). However, according to Defendants, the Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations \u201care designed to establish that Defendants have not complied with the terms of the federal cooperative acts [such as the Capper-Volstead Act, the Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Act, and Section 6 of the Clayton Act]. Otherwise, Defendants\u2019 alleged actions would be legally justified and Plaintiffs could not prove that Defendants engaged in anticompetitive conduct.\u201d Defs.\u2019 Suppl. at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">However, there are no allegations in the Complaint that refer to any federal statute, let alone any allegations that Defendants do not qualify for immunity under the Capper-Volstead Act or a similar federal statute. Furthermore, Defendant Sparboe Farms, Inc.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> acknowledges that \u201ccompliance or non-compliance\u201d with those statutes \u201cis not an element of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims,\u201d and thus \u201cPlaintiffs are not required to make any affirmative pleading with respect to federal statutes.\u201d Sparboe Resp. at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">As previously discussed, although the Complaint contains <em>factual </em>allegations that <em>could </em>give rise to a federal antitrust claim, or factual allegations that ostensibly appear to anticipate a federal defense, the existence of these possibilities do not provide grounds for federal question jurisdiction when Plaintiffs do not actually assert a federal antitrust claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Likewise, no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>grounds for federal question jurisdiction exist because Plaintiffs do not have to prove (or disprove) a substantial question of federal law to make out all necessary elements of their KRTA claim. <em>See Grable, </em>545 U.S. at 314-15, 125 S.Ct. 2363 (recognizing that federal question jurisdiction exists when the meaning of a federal statute both is disputed and is an essential element of the plaintiffs state law cause of action).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As such, the Defendants\u2019 arguments on this score do not implicate any of the previously discussed principles concerning federal question jurisdiction, the well-pleaded complaint rule, and the artful pleading doctrine that would warrant denying the remand request.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">\n<em>B. Complete Preemption</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Another way in which the artful pleading doctrine permits removal is \u201cwhere federal law completely pre-empts a plaintiffs state-law claim.\u201d <em>Rivet, </em>522 U.S. at 475, 118 S.Ct. 921. That is, when the preemptive force of a statute is so \u201cextraordinary\u201d that it \u201cconverts an ordinary state common-law complaint into one stating a federal claim for purposes of the well-pleaded complaint rule.\u201d <em>Caterpillar, </em>482 U.S. at 393, 107 S.Ct. 2425 (quoting <em>Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, </em>481 U.S. 58, 65, 107 S.Ct. 1542, 95 L.Ed.2d 55 (1987)); <em>see also </em>13D Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 3566 (\u201cIt is based on the theory that some federal statutes have such an overwhelming preemptive effect that they do more than merely provide a defense to a state-law claim.\u201d).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This occurs \u201cwhen a federal statute wholly displaces the state-law cause of action.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>539 U.S. at 6, 8, 123 S.Ct. 2058; <em>see also In re Cmty. Bank of N. Va., </em>418 F.3d 277, 294 (3d Cir.2005). \u201cOnce an area of state law has been completely pre-empted, any claim purportedly based on that pre-empted state law is considered, from its inception, a federal claim, and therefore arises under federal law.\u201d <em>Caterpillar, </em>482 U.S. at 393, 107 S.Ct. 2425.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has determined that complete preemption exists only when (1) the federal statute that ostensibly serves as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>the basis for removal \u201ccontains civil enforcement provisions within the scope of which the plaintiffs claim falls,\u201d and (2) there is \u201ca clear indication of a Congressional intention to permit removal.\u201d <em>Goepel v. Nat\u2019l Postal Mail Handlers Union, </em>36 F.3d 306, 311 (3d Cir.1994) (quoting <em>Ry. Labor, </em>858 F.2d at 942); <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. 65 Sec. Plan, </em>879 F.2d 90, 93 (3d Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Although our Court of Appeals has not revisited the test in recent years, the second-part of this inquiry may have been modified by a subsequent Supreme Court decision to \u201cfocus[ ] on whether Congress intended the federal cause of action to be exclusive rather than on whether Congress intended that the cause of action be removable.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>539 U.S. at 9 n. 5, 123 S.Ct. 2058. Under either formulation of the test, \u201cCongressional intent remains the touchstone, however.\u201d 14B Wright <em>&amp; </em>Miller, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 3722.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">In one case illustrative of complete preemption, the Supreme Court \u201cfound complete pre-emption\u201d when \u201cthe federal statutes at issue provided the exclusive cause of action for the claim asserted and also set forth procedures and remedies governing that cause of action.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>539 U.S. at 8, 123 S.Ct. 2058. However, the Supreme Court has recognized that \u201cthe absence of a federal private right of action as evidence [is] relevant to, but not dispositive of, the \u2018sensitive judgments about congressional intent\u2019 that [28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1331 requires.\u201d <em>Grable, </em>545 U.S. at 318, 125 S.Ct. 2363. Indeed, \u201cthe combination of no federal cause of action and no preemption of state remedies ... [is] an important clue to Congress\u2019s conception of the scope of jurisdiction to be exercised under \u00a7 1331. [Thus, a] missing cause of action [is] not ... a missing federal door key, always required, but [is] a missing welcome mat, required in the circumstances, when exercising federal jurisdiction over a state ... action would have attracted a horde of original filings and removal cases raising other state claims with embedded federal issues.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Courts often emphasize that complete preemption, which addresses federal subject matter jurisdiction, is \u201ca distinct concept from ordinary preemption.\u201d <em>Ry. Labor, </em>858 F.2d at 941 (citing <em>Caterpillar, </em>482 U.S. at 398, 107 S.Ct. 2425). In contrast, \u201c[o]rdinary preemption governs what substantive law \u2014 federal or state \u2014 ought to control a claim styled under state law.\u201d <em>Krashna v. Oliver Realty, Inc., </em>895 F.2d 111, 114 n. 3 (3d Cir.1990); <em>see also Guckin v.

Ordinary defensive preemption is embodied in the three categories of express preemption, conflict preemption, and field preemption. <em>See Farina v. Nokia Inc., </em>625 F.3d 97, 115 (3d Cir.2010) (citing <em>Hillsborough Cnty. v. Automated Med. Labs., Inc., </em>471 U.S. 707, 713, 105 S.Ct. 2371, 85 L.Ed.2d 714 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>However, \u201c[t]he fact that a defendant might ultimately prove that a plaintiffs claims are pre-empted ... does not establish that they are removable to federal court.\u201d <em>Ry. Labor, </em>858 F.2d at 941 (quoting <em>Caterpillar, </em>482 U.S. at 398, 107 S.Ct. 2425). As such, \u201cit is now settled law that a case may <em>not </em>be removed to federal court on the basis of a federal defense, including the defense of pre-emption, even if the defense is anticipated in the plaintiffs complaint, and even if both parties concede that the federal defense is the only question truly at issue.\u201d <em>Caterpillar, </em>482 U.S. at 393, 107 S.Ct. 2425 (citing <em>Franchise Tax Bd., </em>463 U.S. at 12, 103 S.Ct. 2841).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">Defendants contend that the principles of complete preemption apply to the KRTA claim by arguing that federal law regulating the economic activities of agricultural cooperatives completely preempts state law. According to Defendants, the \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 claims against [a trade group] and the individual Defendants arise in an area that is completely preempted by federal law\u201d because the Capper-Volstead Act, the Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Act, and Section of the Clayton Act \u201ccomprehensively regulate[ ] the joint economic activities of agricultural cooperatives.\u201d Defs.\u2019 Resp. at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">As Plaintiffs correctly contend in rejoinder, however, Defendants have not sustained their burden in demonstrating that removal is appropriate on the basis that the Plaintiffs\u2019 claim is completely preempted by the Capper-Volstead Act and the like. For example, Defendants have not pointed to any authority that suggests that any of the federal statutes that purportedly regulate the economic activities or competition of agricultural cooperatives create an exclusive cause of action or set forth procedures and remedies governing such actions. Moreover, the Defendants do not take the position that the Capper-Volstead Act, or the other statutes in combination or separately, create any sort of cause of action \u2014 and certainly not an exclusive cause of action \u2014 but rather provide for a kind of \u201cimmunity\u201d to antitrust claims. Indeed, Defendants argue that those statutes \u201cpermit joint actions that might otherwise be illegal\u201d and that \u201cshould cooperatives engage in anticompetitive behavior beyond that allowed by these statutes, then federal law provides a remedy through the Sherman Act.\u201d Defs.\u2019 Suppl. at 5-6; <em>see also </em>Defs.\u2019 Resp. at 12-13. In other words, Defendants appear to recognize that any federal cause of action in antitrust cases involving agricultural producers arises under the Sherman Act, not the Capper-Volstead Act or similar federal law.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">Defendants also have failed to demonstrate that those statutes manifest the Congressional intent that Defendants attempt to assign them. Defendants claim that the statutes \u201creflect a sustained congressional intent that agricultural cooperatives affirmatively be permitted to act jointly with and on behalf of their members,\u201d Defs.\u2019 Resp. at 12-13, and as such the statutes \u201cevince an intent to occupy the field and preempt state law.\u201d Defs.\u2019 Suppl. at 5. Defendants cite excerpts of the plain language of the Capper-Volstead Act, the Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Act, and Section 6 of the Clayton Act, as well as quotations from case law and commentators that discuss those statutes in a summary manner. <em>See </em>Defs.\u2019 Resp. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>13-17.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> However, a close review of those authorities reveals that while there may be considerable Congressional interest in the economic activities of agricultural cooperatives, those authorities do not go so far as to serve as evidence that Congress intended to create a cause of action that is exclusively federal and could serve as the basis for removal, or that Congress intended these statutes to completely preempt state remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Furthermore, the quintessence of the Defendants\u2019 argument as to complete preemption reveals that Defendants are scrambling the principles of complete preemption with the defense of federal preemption.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Indeed, this is evident in the Defendant\u2019s invocation of \u201cfield preemption\u201d and \u201cconflict preemption,\u201d which, as previously discussed, are defenses to the merits of a state claim. Given that in the removal context the Court\u2019s federal question jurisdiction cannot rest on federal defenses of preemption, the Defendants\u2019 reliance on ordinary preemption concepts cannot win the day. In sum, Defendants have not met their burden of demonstrating that removal on the grounds of complete preemption is appropriate.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">\n<em>III. Request for Fees and Costs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">Plaintiffs have requested pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c) the recovery of costs and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>expenses they have incurred due to the Defendants\u2019 removal of the Kansas action. However, the Court concludes that denial of this request is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c) provides that an \u201corder remanding the case may require payment of just costs and any actual expenses, including attorney fees, incurred as a result of the removal.\u201d There is no requirement \u201cthat fees under \u00a7 1447(c) should either usually be granted or usually be denied.\u201d <em>Martin v. Franklin Capital Corp., </em>546 U.S. 132, 139, 126 S.Ct. 704, 163 L.Ed.2d 547 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Instead, the Court is guided by the standard that, \u201cabsent unusual circumstances, attorney\u2019s fees should not be awarded when the removing party has an objectively reasonable basis for removal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 136, 126 S.Ct. 704. Additionally, the Court has \u201cdiscretion to consider whether unusual circumstances warrant a departure from the rule in a given case. For instance, a plaintiffs delay in seeking remand or failure to disclose facts necessary to determine jurisdiction may affect the decision to award attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 141, 126 S.Ct. 704. This standard serves to \u201crecognize the desire to deter removals sought for the purpose of prolonging litigation and imposing costs on the opposing party, while not undermining Congress\u2019 basic decision to afford defendants a right to remove as a general matter, when the statutory criteria are satisfied,\u201d and likewise, not \u201cdiscouraging [the] exercise [of removal] in all but obvious cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 140, 126 S.Ct. 704. In exercising this discretion, the Court must ensure its rationale is \u201c \u2018faithful to the purposes\u2019 of awarding fees under \u00a7 1447(c).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 141, 126 S.Ct. 704.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Plaintiffs claim that fees and costs are warranted because Defendants did not have an objectively reasonable basis for removal. In support, they cite a case from another district in this Circuit that found that \u201cno reasonable basis for removal\u201d was presented when the Defendants\u2019 arguments for removal were previously rejected by the Supreme Court and other courts. <em>See Gilbert v. Synagro, LLC, </em>No. 1:CV-08-1460, 2008 WL 5146506, at *1 (M.D.Pa. Dec. 8, 2008). Plaintiffs also argue that \u201cDefendants failed to cite to any case from anywhere in the country that supported this argument.\u201d Pis.\u2019 Suppl. at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">However, this line of argument verges on the pot calling the kettle black. Plaintiffs likewise did not raise any legal authority that directly considered (and rejected) the Defendants\u2019 arguments. It may be that no court has had occasion to consider arguments like those raised by Defendants, or that the parties\u2019 research simply did not uncover such authority. Regardless, no single, dispositive conclusion can be drawn from the parties\u2019 mutual failure to raise legal authority that directly addressed Defendants\u2019 arguments \u2014 albeit, given the high quality of advocacy that the parties\u2019 counsel respectively exhibited, this result suggests by implication that there was no obvious authority contravening removal. Furthermore, based upon the circumstances of removal and the parties\u2019 briefing, it could be fairly said that Defendants were attempting to extend this area of law based upon certain legal authority, and that although the Court ultimately disagreed with their interpretation of that authority, the legal authority cited provided an objectively comprehensible and non-frivolous basis for removal. <em>Cf. Vandeventer v. Guimond, </em>494 F.Supp.2d 1255, 1269 (D.Kan.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">Additionally, Plaintiffs imply that the Defendants\u2019 removal efforts are an intentional attempt to delay the litigation and impose unnecessary costs on Plaintiffs because the Defendants also sought to \u201cstay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>the District of Kansas from timely ruling on Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Remand and by transferring this lawsuit across the country.\u201d Pis.\u2019 Suppl. at 10. However, this other alleged conduct, even if true, does not demonstrate intent to extensively prolong the litigation and impose costs upon Plaintiffs, particularly when considering this removal in the framework of the pending multidistrict litigation, which involves many of the same defendants and shares common factual allegations with the Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint. Furthermore, the Court does not find other evidence of intentional delay here.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">In sum, Plaintiffs do not cite to any legal authority or underlying facts in this case, nor does the Court find any such circumstances, that would justify an award for fees and costs under \u00a7 1447(c). Furthermore, the Court determines that none of the purposes underlying \u00a7 1447(c) compel the award of fees and costs in the present circumstances. Accordingly, the Court denies the Plaintiffs\u2019 request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">\n<em>IV. Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Although Defendants have mustered a series of arguments to support their removal of the Kansas action, these arguments must be considered unavailing. The Defendants\u2019 arguments essentially invoke defenses to the Complaint as the basis for the Court\u2019s federal question jurisdiction. However, defenses, even those that conjure federal issues and preemption defenses, simply are insufficient to support removal on the basis that the Plaintiffs\u2019 claim arises under federal law. Furthermore, Defendants have failed to satisfy their burden of demonstrating that the Plaintiffs KRTA claim establishes federal question jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Court grants the Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for Remand, and the action will be remanded for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">An Order consistent with this Memorandum follows.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b333-14\">.

The Court does not address in this decision whether the Capper-Volstead Act or the other statutes create a recognized defense to the KRTA. However, the Court observes that Defendants, in recounting the development of the Capper-Volstead Act in light of the history of \"prosecutions of [agricultural] cooperatives under state antitrust laws,\u201d quote the Supreme Court for the contention that \"[s]ome state courts had sustained antitrust charges against agricultural cooperatives, and as a result eventually <em>all the States passed Acts authorizing their existence.\u201d </em>Defs.'

Seemingly, the Cooperative Marketing Act, Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 17-1601 to 17-1636, which provides, \"[n]o association, contract, method or act which [under Kansas law qualifies as, or is conduct attributed to, an agricultural cooperative association] shall be deemed a conspiracy or combination in restraint of trade or as creating an illegal monopoly,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 17-1634, may qualify as one such state statute. <em>See Kan.

Contrary to the Defendants\u2019 contention otherwise, they have not demonstrated that the Plaintiffs' KRTA claim is like the state law quiet title claim in <em>Grable &amp; Sons Metal Products, Inc. v.

The issue involving notice under the federal statute was thus \"an essential element of [the] quiet title claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 315, 125 S.Ct. 2363. Here, the purported federal issue of an agricultural cooperative\u2019s immunity <em>might </em>arise as an affirmative <em>defense to the </em>Plaintiff\u2019s KRTA claim, but not as an element of the cause of action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b339-7\">. \"Very few statutes have a complete preemption effect.\u201d Wright &amp; Miller, <em>supra </em>\u00a7 3566.

But no Supreme Court case has ever held the two forms of preemption to be equivalent. It is true that the defense of field preemption and the doctrine of complete preemption both rest on the breadth, in some crude sense, of a federal statute\u2019s preemptive force.
