He claimed that he was denied the right to a safe working environment and further that he was denied access to medical treatment. The district court certified that Wilson\u2019s appeal was not taken in good faith and therefore denied his motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal. We are now presented with Wilson\u2019s request to proceed IFP on appeal and challenge to the district court\u2019s certification decision. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). In arguing that the district court erred in determining that his appeal was not taken in good faith, Wilson essentially restates the allegations he made in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">We review a dismissal for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) de novo, the standard used for dismissals pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 734 (5th Cir.1998). Although we accept the plaintiffs allegations as true, to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, \u201cthe plaintiff must plead enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litigation, </em>495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201c[W]here the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged-but it has not \u2018show[n]\u2019-\u2018that the pleader is entitled to i-elief.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 </em>U.S. 662, 679, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">In regard to his claims against Milam County and the City of Cameron, Wilson failed to specifically identify any official policy or custom that was the moving force behind the alleged violation of his constitutional rights. <em>See Forgan v. Howard Cnty., </em>494 F.3d 518, 522 (5th Cir.2007); <em>Piotrowski v. City of Houston, </em>237 F.3d 567, 578-79 (5th Cir.2001). Thus, he did not sufficiently allege any claim for relief against the County or the City that is plausible on its face. <em>See In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litigation, </em>495 F.3d at 205. Additionally, Wilson\u2019s factual allegations are insufficient to demonstrate that James Magee acted with deliberate indifference with respect to Wilson\u2019s safety and his medical needs; he therefore has not stated a claim for relief against Magee under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 837, 847, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994); <em>Daniels v. Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 332-36, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986). Finally, Wilson\u2019s allegations fail to establish any personal connection between Sheriff David Green, Captain Katrina Douglas, and Doug Veeche and his kitchen assignment and alleged injuries. Moreover, he has made only con-clusory allegations that Green, Douglas, and Veeche implemented or oversaw a policy with respect to the safety and well-being of inmate trustees; \u201cconclusory allegations ... will not suffice to prevent a motion to dismiss.\u201d <em>Fernandez-Montes v. Allied Pilots Ass\u2019n, </em>987 F.2d 278, 284 (5th Cir.1993). Wilson\u2019s claims against these three defendants are based on no more than a respondeat superior theory and are thus frivolous. <em>See Thompkins v. Belt, </em>828 F.2d 298, 303 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">Because Wilson has not demonstrated that the district court erred in certifying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>that his appeal is not taken in good faith, we deny his IFP motion and dismiss his appeal as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). The district court\u2019s dismissal of Wilson\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint for failure to state a claim and this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal as frivolous count as two strikes for purposes of \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Wilson is warned that, if he accumulates three strikes pursuant to \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; IFP MOTION DENIED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b557-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
