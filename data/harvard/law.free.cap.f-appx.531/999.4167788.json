Maran contends that the district court erred by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>applying a five-level sentencing enhancement under \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines for distributing child pornography for the receipt, or expectation of receipt, of a thing of value. Specifically, he asserts that there was no evidence that he did more than gratuitously share images of child pornography with no expectation of receiving anything in return.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">We review a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its application of those facts to justify a sentencing enhancement <em>de novo. United States v. Spriggs, </em>666 F.3d 1284, 1286 (11th Cir.2012). Section 2G2.2(b)(3)(B) provides for a five-level sentencing enhancement where a defendant engages in the distribution of child pornography \u201cfor the receipt, or expectation of receipt, of a thing of value, but not for pecuniary gain.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(B). The provision applies to any type of \u201cbartering or other in-kind transaction\u201d for valuable consideration, such as the exchange of child pornography. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(B), comment, n. 1. Thus, \u201cwhen a defendant trades child pornography in exchange for other child pornography, the defendant has engaged in distribution for the receipt, or expectation of receipt, of a thing of value.\u201d <em>United States v. Bender, </em>290 F.3d 1279, 1286 (11th Cir.2002) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-6\">But simply making child pornography available to other individuals, without anticipating anything in return, is not sufficient to warrant application of the enhancement. In <em>United States v. Vadnais, </em>667 F.3d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.2012), which Maran heavily relies on, we held that the mere use of a peer-to-peer file-sharing network to download child pornography, which by default allows other users to access those same images, does not support the application of a \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(B) enhancement absent \u201csome other evidence, whether direct or circumstantial, that [the] defendant reasonably believed that he would receive something of value by making his child pornography files available for distribution.... \u201d Such evidence, we elaborated, \u201cmust show the connection between the defendant\u2019s distribution and the receipt or expectation of receipt of a thing of value.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In other words, the government must present some evidence that the defendant \u201cshared his child pornography to gain access to another [person\u2019s] pornography\u201d or conditioned his decision to make such images available \u201con a return promise to share files.\u201d <em>Spriggs, </em>666 F.3d at 1288.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-9\">There was such evidence in this case and, for that reason, the district court did not eiT in applying the five-level sentencing enhancement mandated by \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(3)(B). Unlike the circumstances in <em>Vadnais, </em>Maran engaged in a one-on-one email exchange of child pornography with another person and admitted on numerous occasions that he \u201ctraded\u201d child pornography online. Maran acknowledged at his plea hearing that, in response to an email request to trade child pornography, he directed his correspondent to \u201csend him [an] index sheet\u201d of illicit images in exchange for another set of images, which he later sent to the correspondent after receiving several images of child pornography. Maran also admitted to law enforcement agents, a probation officer, and in his written acceptance-of-responsibility statement that he amassed his collection of child pornography by trading images and videos with other people via email. Maran\u2019s conduct, his admissions, and his consistent use of the word \u201ctrade\u201d to describe his interactions with other child pornography collectors were sufficient to support a determination that he distributed child pornography with the reasonable expectation or belief of receiving child pornography in return, not sim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>ply that he gratuitously shared those illicit images with others. Accordingly, we affirm Maran\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
