He argues that the district court erred in characterizing his prior conviction for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana as a drug trafficking offense and increasing his offense level by 16 additional points pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">Sierra-Pesina concedes that his argument that his conspiracy conviction was not a drug trafficking offense because, unlike the Model Penal Code, the federal conspiracy statute, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, does not require an overt act, is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Escareno, </em>700 F.3d 751 (5th Cir.2012). In <em>Rodriguez-Escareno, </em>we concluded that a reasonable interpretation of the Guidelines provides that conspiring to commit a federal drug trafficking offense qualifies for the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) enhancement. <em>Id. </em>at 753-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s alterna-five motion for an extension of time to file a brief is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b549-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
