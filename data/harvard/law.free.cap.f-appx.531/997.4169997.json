Broughton claims his federal due process rights were violated because the trial evidence was insufficient to prove each element of his burglary offense. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-22\">I. DUE PROCESS CLAUSE</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-23\">The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires the state to prove each element of the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 315, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2787, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). Under <em>Jackson, </em>federal courts must look to state law for the substantive elements of the offense, but to federal law for the determination of whether the evidence was sufficient under the Due Process Clause. <em>Coleman v. Johnson, </em>566 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2060, 2064, 182 L.Ed.2d 978 (2012)</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-26\">Florida law defines the crime of burglary as \u201c[e]ntering a dwelling, structure, or a conveyance with the intent to commit an offense therein, unless the premises are at the time open to the public or the defendant is licensed or invited to enter.\u201d Fla. Stat. \u00a7 810.02(l)(b). Burglary constitutes a second degree felony when the defendant enters an unoccupied dwelling. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 810.02(3)(b). \u201cA state\u2019s interpretation of its own laws or rules provides no basis for federal habeas corpus relief, since no question of a constitutional nature is involved.\u201d <em>Carrizales v. Wainwright, </em>699 F.2d 1053, 1055 (11th Cir.1983); <em>see also Cabberiza v. Moore, </em>217 F.3d 1329, 1333 (11th Cir. 2000). For federal due process review, \u201cthe relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>443 U.S. at 319, 99 S.Ct. at 2789.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>II. BROUGHTON\u2019S CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">The district court did not err in denying Broughton\u2019s sufficiency of the evidence due process claim. Broughton was convicted of burglarizing an apartment while the owner was away. Broughton does not contest that a burglary occurred and that the apartment owner\u2019s testimony established that no one had permission to enter the apartment on the day in question. Broughton\u2019s claim turns on whether the state court\u2019s determination \u2014 that a rational trier of fact could have found that Broughton was the individual who committed the burglary \u2014 was \u201ccontrary to\u201d or \u201can unreasonable application of\u2019 <em>Jackson. See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">The evidence introduced at trial showed that police found Broughton\u2019s fingerprint on the outside of the broken window frame used as the point of entry for the burglary. When asked whether he had ever been to the apartment building or the surrounding area before, Broughton told investigators that he had not and stated that there was no reason his fingerprint would be at the crime scene. Based on this statement, a rational trier of fact could reasonably infer that Broughton\u2019s fingerprint was left there at the time of the burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-6\">Broughton argued to the state court, and asserts again on appeal, that the evidence established that the area behind the apartment building was a common parking lot accessible to the general public. However, in his trial testimony, the apartment owner stated that the parking lot was only for use by the apartment building\u2019s residents, specifically stating that even guests of residents were not permitted to use the parking lot. Viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the evidence showed that Broughton\u2019s fingerprint was found at the scene of the burglary in a private location where he told police that he had never been before.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1024-9\">Based on this evidence, the state court\u2019s conclusion \u2014 that a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Broughton committed the offense of burglary of an unoccupied dwelling \u2014 was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of <em>Jackson, </em>and the state court\u2019s determination of the facts in light of the state\u2019s evidence was not unreasonable. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1024-7\">. Under \u00a7 2254, as amended by the Antiter-rorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, a federal court may not grant habeas relief on a state prisoner's claim that was denied on the merits in state court unless the state court decision was (1) \"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d or (2) \"based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1024-12\">. Because Broughton\u2019s fingerprint was found in a private location, his case is materially distinguishable from the cases he cites in his appeal brief involving a fingerprint found in public location. Further, to the extent Broughton relies on Florida case law, relief under \u00a7 2254 is only appropriate where a violation of clearly established federal, not state, law is shown. <em>See Carrizales, </em>699 F.2d at 1055.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
