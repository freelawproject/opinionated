The parties disagree as to whether the proper remedy under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106 is remand for the district court to enter a modified judgment or for this court itself to modify and affirm the judgment. \u201cThe best reading of [\u00a7 2106] confers discretion either to reform the judgment or to remand for the district to do so.\u201d <em>United States v. Hermoso, </em>484 Fed.Appx. 970, 973 (5th Cir.2012) (unpublished but persuasive). The judgment is AFFIRMED as modified to reflect Paz-Lazo\u2019s conviction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(1) as an alien unlawfully found in the United States after deportation, having previously been convicted of a felony.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b482-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
