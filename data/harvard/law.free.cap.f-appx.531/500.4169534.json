Bain argues in its appellate brief that, even under the extremely narrow and limited grounds on which a court may reverse an arbitration award, the arbitrators \u201cfirst ignored Bain\u2019s repeated requests for discovery, and then summarily condemned Bain for failing to provide proof supporting its claims \u2014 proof that was out of Bain\u2019s control and that the [arbitrators] refused to discover.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-22\">This appeal presents a quintessential example of a principal distinction between arbitration and litigation, especially in the scope of review. Had this discovery dispute arisen in and been ruled on by the district court, it is not unlikely that the denial of Bain\u2019s pleas would have led to reversal; however, under the \u201cstrong fed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>eral policy favoring arbitration, judicial review of an arbitration award is extremely narrow.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 10 of the FAA, an arbitration award may be vacated only if the reviewing court finds that the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means; that there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators; that the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing on sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; or any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party are prejudiced, or the arbitrators exceeded their powers or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">Regardless whether the district court or this court \u2014 or both \u2014 might disagree with the arbitrators\u2019 handling of Bain\u2019s discovery requests, that handling does not rise to the level required for vacating under any of the FAA\u2019s narrow and exclusive grounds. Our review of the district court\u2019s extensively analyzed Order of October 17, 2012, from which Bain appeals satisfies us that its reasoning is sound and that none of the acts or rulings of the arbitrators are subject to reversal or the case subject to being reopened. Accordingly, for essentially the same reasons set forth by the district court in its Order, the court\u2019s denial of Bain\u2019s motion to reopen the case, vacate the arbitration award, and obtain additional discovery is</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b526-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
