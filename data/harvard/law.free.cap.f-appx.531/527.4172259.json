He contends that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence for a crime of violence under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on his Texas conviction under Texas Penal Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>\u00a7 22.021 for aggravated sexual assault of a child under 14. He also contends that the district court erred by refusing to award a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3El.l(b) based on the government\u2019s failure to move for the reduction because he refused to waive his right of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Ramos\u2019s contentions are foreclosed by our decisions in <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>711 F.3d 541, 562 n. 28 (5th Cir.2013) (en banc), and <em>United States v. Newson, </em>515 F.3d 374, 376-79 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b553-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
