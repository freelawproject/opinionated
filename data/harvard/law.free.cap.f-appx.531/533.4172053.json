He was sentenced to 30 months of imprisonment, to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release. On appeal, Arregote argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court did not give reasons for imposing a term of supervised release despite U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Dl.l(c)\u2019s instruction that supervised release ordinarily should not be imposed if the defendant is a deportable alien. He also argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court failed to consider \u00a7 5Dl.l(c)\u2019s instruction even though it was a factor that should have been given significant weight. Arregote did not raise his arguments or object to his sentence in the district court. Accordingly, we will review his arguments for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d 324, 328-29 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-23\">Arregote has not shown that the district court imposed a procedurally unreasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>sentence in his case. Although the district court did not give specific reasons for imposing a term of supervised release, the record reflects that, when imposing Arre-gote\u2019s sentence, the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and discussed the facts and circumstances of both Arregote\u2019s background and the offense of conviction and the need for the sentence to afford adequate deterrence to crime, specifically noting Arregote\u2019s criminal history, problem with alcohol, and likelihood to reoffend. The district court\u2019s statements at Arregote\u2019s sentencing sufficiently offered a \u201cparticularized explanation and concern [that] justified] imposition of a term of supervised release.\u201d <em>Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d at 330; <em>see also United States v. Becerrill-Pena, </em>714 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir.2013) (explaining that court need not find that case is extraordinary to impose supervised release on deportable alien).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Additionally, Arregote has not shown that the district court imposed a substantively unreasonable sentence. The three-year term of supervised release imposed in his case fell within the advisory sentencing guidelines range for his offense. He has not overcome the presumption that the district court, in imposing a term of supervised release, considered the relevant sentencing factors. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, he has not established that his sentence of supervised release is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b559-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
