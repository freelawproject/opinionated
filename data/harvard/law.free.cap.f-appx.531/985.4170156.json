On appeal, Simpson contends the district court wrong<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>ly concluded his complaint failed to establish the creation of a valid contract with the James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF). He claims he submitted a valid application for JREF\u2019s \u201cOne Million Dollar Challenge,\u201d which sought demonstrations of \u201cpsychic, supernatural, or paranormal abilities,\u201d and that the district court incorrectly found Simpson\u2019s application to be invalid because he failed to describe a sufficiently paranormal ability for JREF to test.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-4\">We review a district court ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion <em>de novo. Hill v. White, </em>321 F.3d 1334, 1335 (11th Cir.2003). Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a complaint must contain a \u201cshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d The complaint is viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and all of the plaintiffs well-pleaded facts are accepted as true. <em>Hill, </em>321 F.3d at 1335. Further, \u201c[i]n the case of a <em>pro se </em>action ... the court should construe the complaint more liberally than it would formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d <em>Powell v. Lennon, </em>914 F.2d 1459,1463 (11th Cir.1990). While a complaint does not need detailed factual allegations, \u201ca plaintiffs obligation to provide the \u2018grounds\u2019 of his \u2018entitlefment] to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964-65, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">The breach of contract claim was properly dismissed. The <em>pro se </em>complaint, even when construed liberally, does not plead enough facts to establish a valid contract. <em>See Vega v. T-Mobile USA, Inc., </em>564 F.3d 1256, 1272 (11th Cir.2009) (stating that to prove the existence of a valid contract under Florida law, a plaintiff must plead facts showing offer, acceptance, consideration, and sufficient specification of the essential terms). Simpson did not plead sufficient facts to establish acceptance of JREF\u2019s website advertisement for its One Million Dollar Challenge, which required Simpson to fully demonstrate his paranormal ability under \u201csatisfactory observation.\u201d <em>See United States v. Chandler, </em>376 F.3d 1303, 1312 (11th Cir.2004) (noting that the rules of a private contest represent an offer for a unilateral contract, and that such offer may be accepted by fully performing all the contest\u2019s terms and conditions). At most, Simpson\u2019s application referenced his prior acts of decryption, which were not performed under JREF\u2019s observation. Moreover, although Simpson refers to his application and his correspondence with JREF as \u201cacceptance,\u201d labeling them as such is merely conclusory and does not meet Rule 8\u2019s pleading standards. <em>Twombly, </em>127 S.Ct. at 1964-65. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the breach of contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
