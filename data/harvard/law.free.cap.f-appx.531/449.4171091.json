We review the magistrate judge\u2019s dismissal of Burke\u2019s claims against Dr. Leslie Bear pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2) and the magistrate judge\u2019s grant of the remaining defendants\u2019 summary judgment motions de novo. <em>See Nickell v. Beau View of Biloxi, L.L.C., </em>636 F.3d 752, 754 (5th Cir.2011); <em>Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c)(3). Summary judgment is appropriate if the record discloses \u201cthat there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.CivP. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-19\">Burke has abandoned any claims against Margaret Bingham, Ernest Lee, and Central Mississippi Medical Center as he fails to provide any argument regarding how those defendants violated his constitutional rights. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). His general claims against the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC) are not considered as MDOC is not a defendant to Burke\u2019s lawsuit. We also do not consider Burke\u2019s complaints of events relating to his medical care that were not presented to the district court and, thus, are raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-20\">Burke\u2019s claims against Dr. Bear regarding the cataract surgery she performed on Burke\u2019s left eye amount to no more than claims of negligence or medical malpractice and are not cognizable under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Gobert v. Caldwell, </em>463 F.3d 339, 346 (5th Cir.2006). Moreover, Burke has not shown that Dr. Bear, Christopher Epps, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Dr. Gloria Perry, or Wexford Health Services \u201crefused to treat him, ignored his complaints, intentionally treated him incorrectly, or engaged in any similar conduct that would clearly evince a wanton disregard for any serious medical needs.\u201d <em>See Domino v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, </em>239 F.3d 752, 756 (5th Cir.2001). The magistrate judge\u2019s judgment is therefore AFFIRMED. Burke\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is DENIED. <em>See Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212-13 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b475-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
