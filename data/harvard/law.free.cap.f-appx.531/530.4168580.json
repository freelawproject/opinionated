Cardenas\u2019 written plea agreement contained an appeal waiver. One of the two exceptions was for an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-17\">Cardenas contends his plea was unknowing because the district court violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure ll(b)(l)(M) when it failed to explain the concept of relevant conduct. This contention is permitted despite the appeal waiver, because such a waiver does not prevent defendant from contending on appeal that his plea agreement, including the waiver itself, was not entered into knowingly. See <em>United States v. Oliver, </em>630 F.3d 397, 411 (5th Cir.2011) (allowing unknowing-plea challenge despite existence of appeal waiver).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-22\">Because Cardenas did not present his unknowing-plea contention in district court, review is only for plain error. <em>United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 59, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002). For reversible plain error, Cardenas must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). To determine whether the claimed violation of Rule 11 affected Cardenas\u2019 substantial rights, our court considers whether there is a \u201creasonable probability\u201d he would not have pleaded guilty \u201cbut for the error\u201d. <em>United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 83, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-23\">The district court substantially complied with Rule 11. In particular, it explained to Cardenas that he faced a sentence which included: up to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment; a f\u00edne of up to $1 million; three years\u2019 to life supervised release; and a special assessment of $100. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. ll(b)(l)(H)-(L). Moreover, the court explained that it was obligated to: calculate the advisory Guidelines sentencing range; consider that range and other sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); and consider possible departures under the Guidelines. <em>See </em>Fed.R.CRIm.P. ll(b)(l)(M). Because Cardenas was aware <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>of the maximum sentence he faced, his alleged mistaken belief that his sentence would not be enhanced based on his relevant conduct did not render his plea involuntary. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>905 F.2d 867, 868-69 (5th Cir.1990) (where defendant understands maximum sentence, he is \u201cfully aware of his plea\u2019s consequences\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">To the extent Cardenas contends he is entitled to relief because he lacked close assistance of counsel and/or received ineffective assistance of counsel, he fails to adequately brief those contentions. He cites to neither the record nor legal authorities to support them; therefore, they are abandoned. <em>E.g., Davila v. United States, </em>713 F.3d 248, 261 (5th Cir.2013); Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9). In the alternative, the record is developed insufficiently to allow consideration of such contentions. They generally \u201ccannot be resolved on direct appeal when the claim has not been raised before the district court since no opportunity existed to develop the record on the merits of the allegations\u201d. <em>United States v. Cantwell, </em>470 F.3d 1087, 1091 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b556-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
