On appeal, Alcantara argues that his sentence was procedurally and substantively unreasonable under the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). As to procedural reasonableness, he argues that the district court failed to adequately explain its reasoning for denying his request for a downward variance and merely stated that it considered his mitigating arguments as to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. As to substantive reasonableness, he contends that the court did not properly weigh his arguments, particularly in assessing his cooperation with state authorities in a separate mortgage-fraud investigation. He argues that the court simply \u201cassumed\u201d that his state sentence of probation for his role in that offense was the result of his cooperation, and, therefore, failed to give him credit against his current federal sentence for his work as an informant. He also claims that the court did not adequately consider his age and health in imposing a sentence, as he was 66 years\u2019 old at sentencing and recently suffered a massive heart attack. Finally, he argues that a lesser sentence would have achieved the purposes listed in \u00a7 3553(a), including reflecting the seriousness of the offense, promoting respect for the law, affording adequate deterrence, and protecting the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard of review. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Further, the party challenging a sentence bears the burden of showing that the sentence is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008). In reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we conduct a two-step inquiry. First, we ensure that the district court\u2019s sentence was procedurally reasonable, meaning that the court properly calculated the guideline range, treated the Guidelines as advisory, considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, did not select a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, and adequately explained the chosen sentence. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. Once the Court determines that a sentence is procedurally sound, it examines whether the sentence was substantively reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b986-8\">Substantively, the district court must impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), which include the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, to provide just punishment for the offense, to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, and to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A)-(C). In imposing a particular sentence, the court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-9\">In considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the sentencing court has broad discretion and may weigh one factor more heavily than others. <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir.2009). As the guideline range is one of many factors to be considered under \u00a7 3553(a), we have declined to hold that a within-range sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>is per se reasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>481 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). Nevertheless, the use of the Guidelines \u201cremains central to the sentencing process\u201d and we have an \u201cordinary expectation\u201d that a sentence within the guideline range will be reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 787-88. Whether a sentence is within the guideline range or not, we reverse a sentence as unreasonable only if \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3558(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191 (quoting <em>United States v. McBride, </em>511 F.3d 1293, 1297 (11th Cir.2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">We find Alcantara\u2019s sentence procedurally and substantively reasonable. The record shows that the court adequately explained its reasoning, finding two of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors particularly compelling: the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, given that Alcantara was removed from the United States twice and had re-entered without permission on both occasions, and also had several prior federal and state court convictions. The court took Alcantara\u2019s arguments regarding his age, health, and cooperation with state authorities into consideration in giving him a sentence at the low end of the guideline range, but noted that those factors did not warrant a variance under \u00a7 3553(a). Further, the district court was within its discretion when it assigned a heavy weight to the nature of Alcantara\u2019s crime and his criminal history, and gave less weight to his age, health, and cooperation with the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
