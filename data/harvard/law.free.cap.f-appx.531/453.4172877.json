Despite filing this motion more than 90 days after the BIA\u2019s final order in the removal proceeding, Chen contends his motion was timely and not number barred, because it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>based on changed country conditions in China resulting from: his recently converting to Christianity; and his religious activities placing him in a disadvantageous position with the Chinese government.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">The BIA\u2019s denying a motion to reopen is reviewed under the deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>E.g., Manzano-Garda v. Gonzales, </em>413 F.3d 462, 469 (5th Cir.2005). A petitioner may file only one motion to reopen \u201cno later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered\u201d, unless the motion is \u201cbased on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality\u201d. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), (c)(3)(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The BIA found Chen\u2019s personal circumstances, not country conditions in China, had changed. Changed personal circumstances do not constitute changed country conditions for purposes of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) and (c)(3)(h). <em>E.g., Yang Xin Chun v. Holder, </em>335 Fed.Appx. 454, 455 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Keivani v. Gonzales, </em>214 Fed.Appx. 469, 470 (5th Cir.2007). Accordingly, Chen\u2019s motion to reopen was untimely and number barred, and the BIA\u2019s denying it on those bases was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Manzano-Garda, </em>413 F.3d at 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b479-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
