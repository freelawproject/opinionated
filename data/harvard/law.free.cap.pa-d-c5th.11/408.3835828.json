Boglin, was officially notified by the Bureau of Driver Licensing of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that it was suspending his privilege to operate a motor vehicle because of his conviction for \u201cdriving under the influence\u201d (DUI). In response to that action, Mr. Boglin appealed the suspension of his driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">That appeal to the Bureau of Driver Licensing by Mr. Boglin was dismissed by this court on January 13,2009, because of Mr. Boglin\u2019s failure to appear at the hearing. (N.O.T., appeal hearing, January 13, 2009, p. 2.) However, on that same date, this court reinstated Mr. Boglin\u2019s driver\u2019s license and rescheduled the appeal hearing, by agreement of all parties, to April 16, 2009. (N.O.T., appeal hearing, August 6,2009, p. 5.) The matter was continued again on April 16 to July 7, 2009 when the Honorable Sandra Mazer Moss reconsidered the original January 13 order, and vacated the dismissal of Mr. Boglin\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">On August 6,2009, the matter was again before Judge Moss who continued it to August 20, 2009, in order to rule on the appellant\u2019s motion to reinstate the original dismissal of the appeal. Judge Moss denied that motion on August 20, and ruled that because this court had already denied reconsideration of its reinstatement of the appeal by Mr. Boglin, she was also denying appellant\u2019s reconsideration motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Counsel for the appellant stated to Judge Moss at that hearing that he had become aware of the fact that this court had denied its motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">\u201cThe Court Crier: The next case is Boglin versus PennDOT.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">\u201cThe Court: Oh, there it is. Judge Rogers denied reconsideration, so this case is moving. This has been here like five times.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">\u201cMr. Werlinsky: I found that out this morning, your honor. Commonwealth does not intend at this point to proceed with the case. The matter is up \u2014 you know, whatever the court decides to do.\u201d (N.O.T., appeal hearing, August 20, 2009, p. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">PennDOT filed a timely notice of appeal on September 16,2009 from that order to the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">Appellant first argues that Judge Moss erred when vacating the January 13 order by way of her July 7 order, because the first order was a \u201cfinal order\u201d where the appeal period had expired and where there were no \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>Ainsworth v. </em>PennDOT, 807 A.2d 933 (Pa. Commw. 2002). Appellant also argues that Judge Moss erred in sustaining Mr. Boglin\u2019s appeal on August 20,2009, because the court lacked \u201csubject matter jurisdiction\u201d, and that it \u201cconstituted an improper modification or reconsideration of a final order.\u201d <em>Barbour </em>v. <em>PennDOT, </em>701 A.2d 990 (Pa. Commw. 1997), <em>reversed on other grounds, </em>557 Pa. 189, 732 A.2d 1157 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">None of the above case law is applicable to the instant case, because the appellant is contesting the rulings of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>Judge Moss who had no authority to overrule the orders of this court, because they are judges of concurrent jurisdiction. This point was conceded by counsel for appellant at the August 20 hearing, despite his present arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-3\">\u201cMr. Welinsky: Your honor, if I just may for for the record. Commonwealth does stand behind the averments made in its motion for reconsideration, and it is the Commonwealth\u2019s position, although I know this court cannot in any way undo Judge Rogers\u2019 order, that the court does not have subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">\u201cThe Court: As I said, Judge Rogers has undone Judge Rogers\u2019 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">\u201cMr. Werlinsky: Understood.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">\u201cThe Court: And he has denied reconsideration. So if the Commonwealth does appeal, it\u2019s really that order because at this point I am bound by his order.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">\u201cMr. Werlinksy: That is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">\u201cThe Court: And accordingly I am going forward with the case. So as I said, if you want to appeal, then you may appeal his order. I am going to sustain the appeal.\u201d (N.O.T., appeal hearing, August 20, 2009, p. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">This court had the authority to reconsider and vacate its January 13, 2009 order that dismissed Mr. Boglin\u2019s appeal. Once this court entered that subsequent order, Judge Moss had no subject matter jurisdiction, and appellant has no basis for appealing her judgment. Therefore, based upon all of the foregoing facts and applicable law, the appellant\u2019s appeal to the Commonwealth Court should be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
