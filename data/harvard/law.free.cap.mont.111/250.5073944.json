JUSTICE ARNOLD</author>\n<p id=\"As8b\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">This appeal involves four consolidated cases which were likewise consolidated for trial in the district court for Beaverhead county. The plaintiffs are the sons of William Montgomery, deceased, and were named in his will as beneficiaries. Montgomery died on October 24, 1919, and complaints were filed in these actions as follows: By George Hugh Montgomery on June <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>15, 1935, he having become 21 years old on February 26, 1931; by William George Montgomery on March 21, 1931, he having .become 21 years of age on September 25, 1918, before the death of his father; by James Kenneth Montgomery, on August 18, 1931, two actions, he having become 21 years of age on August 26, 1926. The actions involve alleged mismanagement of the estate by the executor, J. H. Gilbert, one of the defendants. The final account of the executor was allowed and approved on February 23, 1926. Inasmuch as the complaints to some extent question the actions of the executor as being without authority, it is necessary that such portions of the will as are relevant to the eases be set forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">The defendants Margaret Mary Montgomery Tucker and Helen Cecelia Montgomery Collins are daughters of the deceased, and Cecelia L. Montgomery is his widow. All of these defendants filed disclaimers prior to trial. The will of Montgomery was admitted to probate on November 25, 1919, at which time J. H. Gilbert was appointed executor under the will, and was discharged as such on final accounting February 23, 1926. The will of Montgomery was executed on June 6, 1916.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">For a number of years Montgomery operated a large ranch in Beaverhead county and bought and sold cattle on an extensive scale. The provisions of his will, so far as they relate to these actions, are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-6\">\u201cFirst: I direct that my executors, as soon as they conveniently can, pay all my just debts and funeral expenses. In this connection it is my will and I direct that if there be not sufficient funds on hand at my death to pay my said debts, that my executors, in their judgment, may sell such of my personal property as they deem best, either with or without an order of court, or if, in their judgment, so selling said property will hamper them in the conduct of said business as hereinafter directed, they are hereby authorized and directed to borrow such sums of money as may be necessary to pay said debts, and the payment of such loans is hereby made a charge against my estate, both real and personal, and the executors are authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>to execute all necessary mortgages or other instruments as may be required to secure the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-4\">\u201cSecond: I give, devise, and bequeath one-third (%) of all my property, real and personal, to my wife, Cecelia L. Montgomery, in lieu of dower and her rights by succession.

In the event the trust estate herein created shall end by the reason of the arrival of my youngest son at twenty-one (21) years of age and the said bequests, or any of them, in this paragraph provided, to my said daughters shall not have been paid as herein provided, I direct that my said trustees shall retain in their hands the amounts, in money, of the unpaid bequests to my said daughters as in this paragraph described and the said trustees shall invest said sums in such manner as they shall deem best, and the said bequests, together with the accumulations thereof shall be paid to my said daughters as herein provided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">\u201cSeventh: I give and bequeath all my bonds, stocks, money derived from insurance of my life and personal property, not herein otherwise disposed of or bequeathed, to my children, share and share alike.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">\u201cEighth: All the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, real and personal, of which I shall be seized and possessed or to which I shall be in any way entitled, at the time of my death,- and including all the foregoing legacies and devises that shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>lapse, or for any reason or cause fail to take effect under any of the provisions hereinbefore contained, I give, devise and bequeath to my children, share and share alike.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-4\">.\u201cNinth: I hereby make, nominate, constitute and appoint J. B. Poindexter and J. H. Gilbert, both of Dillon, Montana, to be executors of this my will and direct that they serve without bonds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-5\">\u2018 \u2018 Tenth: I direct that my estate shall be settled as rapidly as possible, with due regard to the interest of my heirs and upon distribution, the said J. B. Poindexter and J. H. Gilbert shall become trustees of the property remaining. I direct that they shall hold and operate the same as such trustees for the benefit of my said heirs respectively in the same manner as I have heretofore managed said property and until my youngest son shall arrive at the age of twenty-one (21) years, and I give them full power to sell any part of the property as they shall deem best, and to borrow money for the operation of the business and execute such necessary instruments to secure such loans as may be required or deemed essential.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-6\">\u201cIt is my will that my said sons, respectively, in so far as it does not interfere with their proper school work, be made foreman of the respective ranches left to them, and that they shall have such authority and direction thereof, and of the business connected therewith as my said trustees shall determine to be for their best interests, to the end that [sic] shall be familiar with his respective ranch and shall have had some experience in the handling of the property before he shall receive the same in his own right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-7\">\u201cI further direct that my said wife shall be consulted by said trustees in their conduct of the said business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-8\">\u201cIn the event that my youngest son living at my death shall die before reaching the age of twenty-one years, then the trust estate heretofore created shall determine and end upon the arrival at the age of twenty-one (21) years of the youngest of the remaining sons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-9\">\u2018 \u2018 Eleventh: It is my desire that my children shall be properly educated according to their station in life and to this end I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>direct that my executors, or in the event that they have been discharged, my trustees, shall spend such amount or amounts as they shall deem proper and just in securing for my said children a liberal education, the extent of said education to rest entirely in the discretion of my said executors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-4\">\u201cTwelfth: It is my Will and I hereby direct that my said executors and trustees shall provide for the support and maintenance of each of my said children out of the income from my property, in keeping with their station in life, until he or she shall receive the devise or bequest herein provided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-5\">\u201cThirteenth: My trustees are directed to borrow money whenever they deem it most beneficial or to the best interest of the estate, and the said loan or loans shall become a lien on the real estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">\u201cFourteenth: It is my Will and that the property shall be managed, operated and held in the same manner as it is now' managed, operated and held and that my boys, after receiving their education, shall return to the ranches and work the same under the direction of the trustees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">\u201cFifteenth: In the event of the death of any of my children herein named before final distribution by the court of [or?] final determination of the trust estate herein created, without children, the property devised or bequeathed to or owned by said child, shall be distributed share and share alike among the children surviving.

L. Ford, district judge, which trial began May 17, 1937. On March 28, 1938, the court made findings of fact and conclusions of law. In view of the fact that this court must determine whether or not the findings of fact are supported by the evidence, we shall set forth in detail the court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-9\">\u201cFindings of Fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-10\">\u201c1.

That by an order of the above-entitled court, reciting that notice had been duly given of the time appointed for proving said will and for hearing said petition, according to law, to all parties interested, duly given and made on November 25, 1919, the last will and testament of said William Montgomery, deceased, was duly admitted to probate, and defendant, J. H. Gilbert, who was named therein as such, was appointed executor thereof, and thereafter, on said 25th day of November, 1919, duly qualified as such executor and letters testamentary were duly issued to him, and that thereafter he continued to act as such executor until the date of his discharge, by order of the above-entitled court duly given and made on February 23, 1926.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">\u201c4. That pursuant to an order of the above-entitled court, duly given and made on November 25, 1919, said executor did cause to be published in The Dillon Examiner, a weekly newspaper published in Beaverhead County, Montana, a notice to the creditors of said decedent, requiring all persons having claims against him to exhibit them, with the necessary vouchers, to said executor at the law office of T.

That during the last year of decedent\u2019s life, the decedent sustained a loss in his business of $47,237.05, and owing to the depression and bad business conditions soon thereafter ensuing, the operations of the estate of said deceased were carried on at a loss, and money had to be and was borrowed, from time to time, by renewal of existing notes and the giving of additional notes, to enable said executor to carry on such operations as directed and required by the last will and testament of said deceased, which said moneys were borrowed from said defendant, The First National Bank of Dillon, Montana, in the course of its banking business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-6\">\u201c11. That by the terms of the last will and testament of said deceased, it was also provided that the sons of said deceased, after receiving their education, should return to the ranches of said deceased and said estate and work the same under the direction of said executor.

Montgomery, who had them in her possession at the time of the filing of said executor\u2019s first account of his administration of said estate on the 13th day of May, 1924, and which account was settled, allowed and approved by this court on the 24th day of May, 1924.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\">\u201c13. That within the time prescribed by said notice to creditors, duly verified claims against said estate were presented to said executor aggregating the sum of $169,914.64, and were thereafter allowed and approved by said executor and by the Judge of this court. That within the time so prescribed by said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>notice to creditors, claims for the purchase price of said cattle, purchased by said deceased just prior to his death, and claims and accounts against said decedent and his estate for labor, provisions, and supplies in the operation of his ranches, and for family, household, and other purposes, were likewise presented, to and were paid by, said executor without the affidavit of their correctness prescribed by statute; but all such claims and accounts, so paid by said executor, were justly due, were paid in good faith, and the amounts so paid were the true and correct amounts of such indebtedness over and above all payments or set-offs, and that at the time of the making of such payments the estate of said deceased was solvent. That all of the said claims and accounts so presented, without affidavits of their correctness, and allowed and so paid, appear and are set forth in said executor\u2019s said first account, and the payments so made by him were approved by this court by its order duly given and made on the 24th day of May, 1924, settling, allowing, and approving said account after due notice thereof having been given.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-4\">\u201c14. That on the 3rd day of April, 1920, said executor duly returned to the above-entitled court an inventory of all of the property of said estate, duly appraised by appraisers appointed by the above-entitled court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">\u201c15. That plaintiff is a son of said William Montgomery, deceased, and is named as a beneficiary in the will of said deceased, and this action is based upon the provisions of said will, prosecuted herein for the recovery of the property bequeathed and devised to him by the provisions of said will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-6\">\u201c16. That a true copy of the last will and testament of said William Montgomery, deceased, is attached to plaintiff\u2019s complaint marked Exhibit \u2018A\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-7\">\u2018 \u2018 17. That said executor took possession of all of the real and personal property of said deceased, including the sum of $40,-000.00, the proceeds of a policy of insurance on the life of said deceased, and in good faith managed and operated the same as directed by the terms of the last will and testament of said deceased, and in good faith disbursed the said $40,000 of life <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>insurance in payment of the debts of said deceased and his estate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-4\">\u201c18. That on May 13, 1924, said executor filed in the above-entitled court his first account of his administration of said estate, which said account was, after due notice thereof given, by an order of the above-entitled court duly given and made on May 24, 1924, settled, allowed and approved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\">\u201c19. That on May 27, 1924, said executor filed in the above-entitled court his petition for an order for permission and authority of said court to sell the lands of said estate, and, after due notice given, pursuant to law and the order of said court, by an order of said court duly given and made on July 5, 1924, said executor was authorized to sell, either in one parcel or subdivisions, as he should judge most beneficial to said estate, all of the real estate belonging to said estate, at private sale, to the highest bidder, for cash or on credit, whichever might be most beneficial to said estate, and which said real estate is particularly described in said order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-6\">\u201c20. That thereafter, and on April 20, 1925, said executor made to said court a return of his proceedings under said order of sale, and reported to said court that he had published and posted, in the manner provided by law and the order of said court, due and legal notice of the sale and call for bids for said property; that he had received only two bids therefor, which were attached to said return and marked Exhibits \u2018A\u2019 and \u00a3B\u2019 and made a part thereof; that Alfred N. Peterson had made the only bid for the real estate described in his said bid, and that George M. Clemow had made the only bid for the property in his bid described, and that said executor had accepted said bids.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\">\u201c21.

That with the exception of the part of the land sold by said Clemow to said Jules E. Wenger, the said Clemow executed and delivered to defendant, J. H. Gilbert, Trustee, a deed in which the grantee\u2019s name was omitted and left blank, for all of said lands so conveyed to him, other than the part thereof conveyed by said Clemow to said Wenger, subject to the mortgage executed by said Clemow to said defendant Federal Land Bank of Spokane, and that the said lands, so covered by and described in said deed delivered to said J.

That the said Peterson also executed and delivered to said defendant, J. H. Gilbert, Trustee, a deed in which the grantee\u2019s name was omitted and left blank for all of said lands so conveyed to him, subject to said mortgage so executed by said Peterson to defendant, Federal Land Bank of Spokane, and said lands so described in said deed, are held by said defendant, J. II. Gilbert, as such trustee, first, to secure the payment of the unpaid balance of said mortgage to defendant, Federal Land Bank of Spokane, and, second, to secure the payment of the indebtedness from said J. H. Gilbert, Trustee, to defendant, The First National Bank of Dillon, Montana, and Daly Bank and Trust Company of Anaconda, Montana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-4\">\u201c24. That Cecelia L. Montgomery, the surviving widow of said deceased, renounced the benefits of the legacies and devises made in her favor in the will of said deceased, and elected to take in lieu thereof her dower in the properties of said estate, and, at the time of the trial of this action, had disclaimed any and all right, title or interest in or to any part of the properties of said estate. That on the 17th day of July, 1923, she had received from the funds of said estate the sum of $22,709.40 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>for the support and maintenance of herself and her family, without any order having theretofore been made by the court for such family allowance. That on the said 17th day of July, 1923, the said J. IT. Gilbert, as such executor, and said Cecelia L. Montgomery, made an agreement providing that authority for the payment of such family allowance should be obtained from the court during the course of the administration of said estate, which was done, and the amount paid to and received by the said Cecelia L. Montgomery, by way of family allowance during the administration of said estate was the sum of $53,344.27.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-4\">\u201c25. That on the said 17th daj^ of July, 1923, the amount of the indebtedness of said estate to said defendant, The First National Bank of Dillon, Montana, was, as stated in said agreement, approximately the sum of $173,000.00 and in order to enable said executor to sell and dispose of such property of said estate as might become necessary to be sold for the purpose of obtaining funds to pay the indebtedness of said estate, the said Cecelia L. Montgomery agreed to convey and did convey to said defendant, J. H. Gilbert, as executor, in trust, her dower right in and to the properties of said estate, as collateral security, to secure the payment of said indebtedness, the same, however, not to be used for such purposes until all of the other property of said estate should have been so applied, and if not so applied to be reconveyed to said Cecelia L. Montgomery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\">\u201c26. That at the time of his death, the said deceased held contracts for the sale to him by the State of Montana of lands situate in Sections 4, 9, 15 and 16, in Township 3 South of Range 15 West, M. P. M., the purchase price .of which was payable in annual installments, but the purchase of said lands was not completed by the said executor and no title to said land was acquired, and the said contracts were permitted to lapse because the unpaid balance of the purchase price of said lands, then due and owing and thereafter to become due and owing to the State of Montana under said contracts was greatly in excess of the then value of said lands, for which reason no further payments were made on said contracts, and the same were cancelled and terminated, and were and had been so cancelled and terminated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>at the time of the conveyance of the properties of said estate to said Clemow and Peterson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-4\">\u201c27.

That neither the first nor the final account of said executor was accompanied by vouchers evidencing the payment of the amounts shown by said accounts to have been paid. That all of such vouchers relating to disbursements made by said executor prior and down to the 21st day of February, 1921, were then in the possession of said Cecelia L. Montgomery, the surviving widow of said deceased, but vouchers showing that all moneys and funds received by said executor, in the course of his administration of the estate of said deceased, from all sources in the course of the administration of said estate, were used and expended by said executor for the use and benefit of the estate of said deceased in payment of debts, the operating expenses of the properties of said estate, and for the support of the family, and all such vouchers were either produced at the trial of this cause, or conceded and admitted to be in existence and available.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\">\u201c30.

That under the rule of law laid down, by the Supreme Court of Montana in the case of <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>64 Mont. 386, 210 Pac. 93, adopted and followed by the United States Circuit Court of Appeals, of the Ninth Circuit, in the ease of <em>Montgomery </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>77 F. 2d 39, the plaintiff has failed to make a ease, either by his pleadings or proof, of which this court, as a court of equity, can or may take cognizance, or of or over which it has any jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-8\">\u201c2. Aside from the jurisdictional question, the complaint fails to state a cause of action and the evidence is insufficient to authorize the interposition of a court of equity and grant equitable relief upon the facts pleaded by the plaintiff and the evidence adduced in support thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-9\">\u201c3. That the order of this court admitting the last will and testament of said deceased to probate, reciting that notice had been duly given of the time appointed for proving said will and for hearing of the petition for its admission to probate, according to law, to all parties interested, and this action being based upon the terms and provisions of said will, and for the recovery by plaintiff of the property of said deceased therein bequeathed and devised to him, the plaintiff is estopped and precluded from saying or contending that the said will was not legally admitted to probate and the said defendant, J. H. Gilbert, legally and regularly appointed the executor thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-10\">\u201c4. That there was no conversion of any of the funds or property of the estate of said deceased by the said defendant, J. H. Gilbert, as executor of the last will and testament of said deceased, or by any of the other defendants in said cause, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>there was not actionable fraud in the administration of said estate by the defendant, J. H. Gilbert, as such executor, or by any of the other defendants therein, and no collusion between said defendant Gilbert and said defendant, The First National Bank of Dillon, Montana, or any of the defendants, to deprive the plaintiff of any of the property bequeathed or devised to him by the terms of his father\u2019s will.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-4\">\u201c5. That plaintiff\u2019s alleged cause of action is barred by the provisions of Sections 10042, 10048, 10245 and 10303, Revised Codes of Montana, 1935.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\">\u201c6. That plaintiff is not entitled to the relief prayed for or any relief herein.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">\u201cDated this 28th day of March, 1938.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-7\">\u201cWilliam L. Ford, \u201cJudge presiding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">Appropriate judgments were entered upon the foregoing findings and conclusions in the consolidated actions. On appeal the plaintiffs specified as errors the action of the court in entering judgment for the defendants and in refusing to adopt the proposed findings of the plaintiffs, and in making the findings heretofore set out.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">The actions sought to gain possession of property devised to plaintiffs under the will of William Montgomery, which, so far as relates to real property, has been since the decree of distribution, and now is, held in trust by J. H. Gilbert for the satisfaction of a mortgage debt to the defendant Federal Land Bank of Spokane and an indebtedness from Gilbert, as trustee, to the defendant First National Bank of Dillon, and a similar indebtedness to the Daly Bank &amp; Trust Company of Anaconda.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">The alleged fraud consists of acts of the executor Gilbert in the administration of the estate through having himself appointed executor without notice to the minor plaintiffs; without notice to the co-executor, Poindexter, who was then a resident and public officer of the Territory of Hawaii, and who at no time asserted his right to appointment as co-executor; borrowing money for the estate when it was not needed; selling property to pay debts which were not valid or proper claims against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>estate; failing to file a bond on qualifying as executor; failing to file accounts and inventory within the time prescribed by law; failing to get confirmation of the court of personal property sales; selling real estate to \u201cdummy\u201d purchasers for less than 90 per cent, of the appraised value, and thereafter causing the \u201cdummy\u201d purchasers to borrow money from the defendant Federal Land Bank secured by mortgage on the land sold to such purchasers, the money from the loan having been used to pay off debts of the estate; and otherwise employing dilatory and irregular tactics in the administration of the estate, resulting in losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">The action of the plaintiff George H. Montgomery was first tried before the United States District Court of Montana, which action was dismissed upon its merits. On appeal to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals the judgment was affirmed <em>(Montgomery </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>(9 Cir.) 77 Fed. (2d) 39), on the ground that the court below lacked jurisdiction, but the circuit court also found that the state courts have power to correct or set aside its decrees in probate. The Circuit Court of Appeals likewise found and held that a ease was not made out which showed fraud, cognizable in a court of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Nowhere in any of the complaints do we find allegations that were supported by evidence at the trial showing extrinsic or collateral fraud as defined in the Montana cases of <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>64 Mont. 386, 210 Pac. 93, and <em>Hoppin </em>v. <em>Long, </em>74 Mont. 558, 575, 241 Pac. 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">In view of the trial court\u2019s conclusions of law Nos. 1 and 5, which we hold to be correct, it would be needless and purposeless to set out in detail the evidence which we have reviewed. We do observe, however, that the widow and her children, the plaintiffs herein, continued to reside on the ranch property of the testator for more than five years after his death. The widow drew checks against estate funds for living expenses and other costs of ranch operations, receiving in all for such purposes over $50,000. She and the plaintiffs virtually operated the ranch business under the supervision of the defendant executor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>and were consulted by him frequently concerning the administration of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">The widow at the trial conceded that the executor did the best he could with the administration, and that she never objected to his administration and had no reason for objecting. William Montgomery, one of the plaintiffs and oldest son of the testator, testified that after his father\u2019s death he remained on the ranches for nearly five years, acting as manager under the direction of the executor; that he assisted in making the inventory and that it was correct; that he knew of a number of efforts of Gilbert, the executor, to sell the ranches, without success; that all cattle were sold at the best prices obtainable, the market price; that he made all deliveries of cattle sold; that Gilbert consulted with him and his mother frequently about the ranch business. The testator executed his will more than three years before his death while he was apparently in the full vigor of life and actively engaged in the affairs of his calling, and that he named J. IT. Gilbert executor to serve without bond. He reposed great faith and confidence in him, as the will gave him wide and discretionary powers to use in the administration of the estate similar to those which the testator himself had employed in carrying on his livestock business.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Under such conditions an executor is required to use reasonable diligence and act in entire good faith in performing the duties of his trust. He is, however, not an insurer of the safety of the estate; nor is he expected to be infallible. It has been held that it is the policy of the courts to sustain, if possible, irregular acts of executors or administrators where done in good faith and without detriment to the estate. <em>(Duffy </em>v. <em>McHale, </em>35 R. I. 16, 85 Atl. 36.) As was said by this court in <em>In re Astibia\u2019s Estate, </em>100 Mont. 224, 46 Pac. (2d) 712, 716: \u201cAn administrator is chargeable with the whole of an estate coming into his possession at the value of the appraisement thereof, but is not to suffer loss by reason of decrease in value or destruction, without his fault, of any part of the estate. He is not an insurer; therefore he is liable only for losses which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>are the consequence of bad faith or the want of due diligence in handling the estate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">In the instant case the executor had technical possession of the personal property, and the heirs had actual possession and use thereof under the terms of the will for nearly five years. In these circumstances would they be unacquainted with any loss or depreciation thereof? In the end they voluntarily departed from the ranches.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The record discloses a number of irregularities on the part of the executor, such as delays and omissions. Suitable penalties are provided for such lack of strict observance of the statutory requirements under the Montana Codes, which may, if warranted, result in removal of an executor. Here no such action was taken and, in the absence of a positive showing of detriment to the estate, or fraud upon those interested in the estate, there would be no liability on the part of the executor in an action such as we have here.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The plaintiffs were residents in Beaverhead county at the time the will was probated, living on the property involved in the estate. Their mother, who was the widow of the testator, was frequently consulted by the executor pursuant to the directions in the will. This court recognizes the fact that property values fluctuated greatly over a period of time embraced within  the administration of this estate. A recital in a petition for probate of a will as to value of property, not supported by subsequent changes, would not necessarily indicate fraud on the part of the executor. The accounts of the executor, though filed belatedly, were approved by the court approximately five years before the first of these actions was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">At the time the will was admitted to probate the court found  that the notices required to be given by the clerk, which invest the court with jurisdiction, had been given. There was no showing to overcome the effect of this order. The trial court rightly found that, though the sale by the executor of certain real estate was merely a simulated sale for the purpose of mortgaging the property through the purchasers to the Federal' Land Bank and thus obtaining money to pay debts of the estate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>yet the property had been reeonveyed to the executor in trust. We do not condone such practice. The Montana statutes provide methods for borrowing money on behalf of an estate and they should be rigidly followed. The Federal Land Bank acted in good faith in making the loan and relied upon the record. Here again, no damage resulted to those interested, despite the fact that the proceeding was highly irregular. These matters, however, appear of record and cannot be considered as extrinsic or collateral fraud which would entitle the plaintiffs to relief after the time fixed by the statute has expired for bringing actions for such relief. The plaintiffs knew, or could have known, of the things they here complain of within the time fixed by law for bringing action.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Under section 10303, Revised Codes, the settlement of an  executor\u2019s account is conclusive, but one laboring under disability may within sixty days after discovery of the facts constituting fraud, move to reopen or set aside the decree of settlement. The previous settlement is prima facie proof of the correctness of the account, the burden resting upon the one who alleged fraud to prove, not only that there was fraud and injury, but also that there was reason for his failure to discover the facts. <em>(In re Eakins\u2019 Estate, </em>64 Mont. 84, 208 Pac. 956; <em>Kerrigan </em>v. <em>O\u2019Meara, </em>71 Mont. 1, 227 Pac. 819.) Section 10246, Id., fixes the time for a minor to bring action for relief under section 10245, at any time within three years after removal of his disability. <em>(Lamont </em>v. <em>Vinger, </em>61 Mont. 530, 202 Pac. 769.)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Here the plaintiffs not only failed to prove but also did not allege facts sufficient to show that they used diligence to detect the alleged fraud, and why it was not discovered sooner. In such circumstances the plaintiffs are presumed to have known whatever with reasonable diligence they might have discovered. <em>(Lasby </em>v. <em>Burgess, </em>88 Mont. 49, 289 Pac. 1028.)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The trial court found that former executor Gilbert, as trustee, was holding the property involved in this action in trust for the creditors and the heirs. The will provided that the trusteeship should terminate as follows: \u201cI direct that they shall hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>and operate the same as such trustees for the benefit of my heirs respectively in the manner as I have heretofore managed said property and until my youngest son shall arrive at the age of 21 years, and I give them full power to sell any part of the property as they shall deem best, and to borrow money for the operation of the business and execute necessary instruments to secure such loans as may be required or deemed essential.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">At the conclusion of the several devises to the sons, plaintiffs herein, we find the following words: \u201cprovided, however, that the said [naming son] shall not have the enjoyment or possession of the said property until my youngest son shall become of lawful age and this devise is also subject to the several bequests hereinafter made to each of my daughters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The bequest to each of testator\u2019s daughters was $10,000 cash, payable when they became 21 years of age. The will provided that if there was not sufficient cash to pay the bequests, the balance should be raised by a sale of or loan upon and a lien against the real estate, and each of \u201cmy sons shall contribute equally to raise such sums as may be necessary to pay said bequests as they become due.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The sixth paragraph of the will recites, among other things: \u201cIn event the trust estate herein created shall and by reason of the arrival of my youngest son at 21 years of age and the said bequests, or any of them, in this paragraph provided, to my said daughters shall not have been paid as herein provided, I direct that my trustees shall retain in their hands the amounts of money of the unpaid bequests to, my said daughters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">The decree of settlement of final account in the probate proceedings, dated February 23, 1926, after directing application of the balance of cash on hand toward payment of the claims of the First National Bank of Dillon and Daly Bank &amp; Trust Company of Anaconda, and attorneys\u2019 fees, found that there was a balance due on the claims of the foregoing bank creditors of $53,411.64, with interest. Thereafter this debt was carried as a trusteeship account. The creditors were not parties to the petition for closing the <em>estate; </em>hence the contention of appellants that they waived the balance due on their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>claims is untenable. Both the statute and the will provide that claims are a charge against the estate. The daughters filed disclaimers as to their bequests under the will. The defendant Gilbert submitted on the trial an accounting of his trusteeship, but the court made no settlement of such account. Apparently such accounting was for the purpose of attempting to justify  the continuance of the trusteeship. The trustee must account to the district court sitting in probate, covering all his acts as trustee under the will; this being the exclusive method. (Sec. 10352, Rev. Codes; <em>Philbrick </em>v. <em>American Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>58 Mont. 376, 193 Pac. 59. See, also, <em>In re Harper\u2019s Estate, </em>98 Mont. 356, 40 Pac. (2d) 51.) The will governs the trusteeship and the time for termination thereof. The fact that there are debts, as above indicated, which are or may be secured by mortgage, under the terms of the will, is no ground for continuing the trusteeship. The trustee contends that the above mentioned debts to the banks are not secured by mortgage. The will empowers him to execute such mortgage, and the district court, at the time of the accounting, if it finds any other debts due arising out of the trusteeship, may require the execution of a mortgage securing them. The heirs are entitled to the several properties described in the will, subject to the Federal Land Bank mortgage, and the debts to the First National Bank of Dillon, and the Daly Bank &amp; Trust Company of Anaconda, above mentioned, and any other such debts that the court may find due and valid arising under the trusteeship, upon proper accounting as above outlined.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">As above pointed out, the plaintiffs not only lived on the premises involved herein, but had direct and constant participation in the administration of the affairs of the estate for approximately five years after the death of the testator. Action was not taken to set aside the decree of settlement of final account until the lapse of approximately five years. Not only did the plaintiffs fail to show that the executor concealed matters from them which they should have known, but the record definitely discloses admissions on the part of some of the plaintiffs that the executor co-operated with them to the fullest extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>and was always ready to discuss the affairs of the estate with them, and make any disclosures of his administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">The judgment of the trial court is modified in these respects only: The defendant J. H. Gilbert is ordered to render an accounting of his trusteeship, and after executing mortgage securing the debts due to the above mentioned banks, and such other debts, if any, due from the trusteeship, he shall turn the estate properties over to the devisees under the terms of the will. As thus modified, the judgment is affirmed. The parties shall pay their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b330-5\">Associate Justices Morris, Angstman, Erickson and Honorable H. H. Ewing, District Judge, sitting in place of Mr. Chief Justice Johnson, disqualified, concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b330-6\">On Motion for Rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">(Filed December 3, 1940.)</p>\n<author id=\"b330-8\">MR. JUSTICE ARNOLD</author>\n<p id=\"As7\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">Respondents in their petition for rehearing of the modified portion of the above opinion point out that the court directed the execution of a mortgage securing the claims of the creditor banks and object to such proceeding. We suggested this method, not as an exclusive procedure for getting the estate in shape for closing, but as being a method compatible with the terms of the will. It is true that the trustee or creditors have their remedy in applying to the probate court under the statute for sale of property to satisfy the debts, but that proceeding must be taken in the district court and not here.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">Respondents also contend that we were in error in stating in our opinion that at the settlement of the final account there was due the two banks the sum of $53,411.64. We based this statement upon the following paragraph in the decree of the probate court settling the account: \u201c * * * and that there is on hand at this time the sum of $130,700.36 in cash from which there is to be deducted the sum of $4,000 attorney\u2019s fees, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>leaving a balance in cash in the hands of the said executor of $126,700.36 to apply on the claims of the First National Bank of Dillon and Daly Bank and Trust Company of Anaconda, leaving a balance of $53,411.64, together with interest due upon said claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">Respondents point out that the final account of the executor filed on February 9, 1926, and settled, allowed, approved on February 23, 1926, shows an indebtedness to the two above named creditors of $180,112. There can be no dispute as to this. The confusion arises on account of the fact that in reporting assets on hand available for the payment of these claims, the executor treated as cash the property of the estate set out in his accounting. This appears in Finding No. 27 of the trial court, fully set out in the original opinion. It appears that after the settlement of the final account the executor applied $33,000 to the claim of the First National Bank of Dillon, and $15,000 on the claim of the Daly Bank and Trust Company, and otherwise the direction of the court in the final decree as to the payment of the bank claims was not carried out. These sums, aggregating $48,000, were obtained from the Federal Land Bank of Spokane on mortgages covering the land \u201csold\u201d by the executor to Peterson and Clemow, which sales we have declared invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The trial court\u2019s findings that the trustee was holding this  property as security for the payment of the claims against the estate is fully supported by the evidence. This doubtless was his reason for reporting the property in his final account as cash on hand. However, since we have held, as did the trial court, that the sales were invalid we must and do likewise hold that the property cannot be applied to the payment of claims except by the procedure outlined in the statutes. Both creditors and heirs have the right to insist that legal procedure in this regard be followed and that the property be converted to cash by probate sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The creditors, of course, cannot be prejudiced by the failure or inability of the executor to carry out the direction in the final decree as to payment of their claims. These claims can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>only be discharged by payment. Upon the accounting of the trustee, as ordered in. the foregoing opinion of this court, he may show what amounts he has paid upon the bank claims after settlement of the final account.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">As modified by this addendum, the original opinion will stand.</p>\n<judges id=\"b332-5\">Mr. Justice Morris and Honorable H.
