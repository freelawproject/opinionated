FREDERICK SHARER, Judge (Retired, Specially Assigned).</author>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Jehue Q. Johnson suffered a compensable injury and was awarded workers\u2019 compensation benefits by the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission. At issue in this appeal is whether those benefits are the obligation of the Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund (\u201cthe Fund\u201d), appellant, or the Injured Workers\u2019 Insurance Fund (\u201cIWIF\u201d), appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">Commensurate with its award of benefits to Johnson, the Commission ruled that Johnson\u2019s direct employer, Rose Industrial Services (\u201cRose\u201d), a subcontractor to W.M. Schlosser Co. (\u201cSchlosser\u201d), was uninsured for workers\u2019 compensation in Maryland. The Commission also ruled that Schlosser, insured for workers\u2019 compensation in Maryland, was Johnson\u2019s statutory employer, but not liable for payment of the award. Finally, the Commission ordered Rose to pay the awarded benefits. A default by Rose, or its inability to pay the benefits, would result in the Fund becoming liable for payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">On the Fund\u2019s petition for judicial review, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County considered the Fund\u2019s motion for summary judgment, in which Johnson joined, and cross-motions for summary judgment by IWIF, in which Schlosser joined. The circuit court granted the IWIF/Schlosser motion, and denied the Fund/Johnson motion, both without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">This appeal followed, in which the Fund poses one question, which we have slightly rephrased:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>Did the Commission and circuit court erroneously interpret [Maryland Code, Labor and Employment Article] \u00a7 9-508 to impose liability for a workers\u2019 compensation claim upon [the Fund], rather than upon [Schlosser], the insured statutory employer?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">For the reasons that follow, we shall reverse the judgment of the circuit court granting Schlosser\u2019s motion for summary judgment, with directions to grant the Fund\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">FACTS and PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">All parties concede that there is no dispute of material fact, and' that the litigation should be determined by summary judgment. Of course, each asserts that its motion for summary judgment ought to be granted. Although there is no dispute of fact, we shall set out the background of Johnson\u2019s claim in order to establish the relationship of the parties, <em>vis a vis </em>his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Johnson, the claimant, was injured on May 8, 2004, at the Blue Plains Wastewater Treatment Plant (\u201cBlue Plains\u201d) in the District of Columbia during the course of his employment as a hazardous waste removal technician. His immediate employer was Joanne H. Rose, trading as Rose Industrial Services (\u201cRose\u201d). Rose, based in Glen Burnie, Maryland, had contracts for various hazardous materials clean-up projects in Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. Rose\u2019s work at Blue Plains was being performed pursuant to a subcontract with Schlosser.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">Johnson, a Maryland resident, was hired by Rose on March 11, 2003, at a location in Pasadena, Maryland, where Rose stored its equipment. Johnson worked on several clean-up projects and also made repairs to Rose\u2019s trucks, which were kept in Glen Burnie. Johnson worked 12-hour shifts, but usually did not know at which site he would be working from one day to the next. He either reported to work at one of the Maryland clean-up sites to receive his assignments, or was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>picked up at his home by other Rose employees and taken to a work site.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">Johnson worked concurrently at three different clean-up sites in Maryland, one site in Virginia, and at Blue Plains in the District of Columbia. He characterized his presence at Blue Plains as \u201coff and on.\u201d In the week he was injured, Johnson worked 12 hours at Blue Plains.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Following his injury, Johnson filed a claim with the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission. Although Rose carried workers\u2019 compensation insurance in the District of Columbia, it did not carry such coverage in Maryland. Therefore, Rose was found to be an uninsured employer and the claim before the Commission was defended by the Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The Fund impleaded Schlosser, the principal contractor for the Blue Plains project, as Johnson\u2019s \u201cstatutory employer,\u201d pursuant to Md.Code (1991, 1999 Repl.Vol.) Labor &amp; Employment (\u201cLE\u201d) \u00a7 9-508.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Commission ruled that Schlosser was Johnson\u2019s statutory employer, but that Schlosser, nevertheless, was not liable for Johnson\u2019s claim. In its order, the Commission set forth its reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">Section 9-508 of the Labor Article states that [the statutory employer] is only liable to pay compensation they would have been liable to pay if they were the direct employer. There would be no jurisdiction over a claim against W.M. Schlosser Co., Inc. if it were the direct employer; therefore, W.M. Schlosser Co., Inc. cannot be held liable as a statutory employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">The Commission ordered Rose (and the Fund) to pay the ordered benefits to Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>The Fund sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, and requested a jury trial. The Fund later filed a motion for summary judgment and requested a hearing. Schlosser filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. Although the parties have not provided us with the motions, our review of the record reveals that the only issue presented to the circuit court was whether Schlosser was liable, as a statutory employer, to Johnson for workers\u2019 compensation benefits under the Maryland Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Although a hearing on the motions was scheduled, it was canceled for reasons that do not appear in the record, and the circuit court ruled on the motions without a hearing, as we have noted. The court denied the Fund\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted Schlosser\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment. The Fund\u2019s appeal to this Court followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">\n<em>Standard of Review\u2014Summary Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">\u201cThe standard of appellate review of a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment under Maryland Rule 2-501 is whether the lower court was legally correct.\u201d <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Harleysville Mut. Ins. Co., </em>110 Md.App. 45, 51, 675 A.2d 1059 (1996). Thus, the \u201cstandard of review in a workers\u2019 compensation claim disposed of on summary judgment by the circuit court is <em>de novo.\u201d Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund v. Danner, </em>388 Md. 649, 658-59, 882 A.2d 271 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">Before ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must determine whether there is a genuine dispute regarding any material fact that \u201cwould preclude the entry of summary judgment.\u201d <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>110 Md. App. at 51, 675 A.2d 1059. \u201cThe general rules pertaining to the entry of summary judgment apply with equal force on appeals from decisions of the Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51-52, 675 A.2d 1059; <em>See Baltimore County v. Kelly, </em>391 Md. 64, 891 A.2d 1103 (2006); <em>Inner Harbor Warehouse, Inc. v. Myers, </em>321 Md. 363, 367-68, 582 A.2d 1244 (1990). Here, we conclude, and the parties agree, that there was no dispute regard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>ing any material fact before the circuit court. Rather, the sole question was one of the application of the statute. Although we agree that this is a proper case for summary judgment, we do not agree with the circuit court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">At the outset, we point out that the court granted summary judgment without a hearing, when a hearing had been requested. To do so is contrary to Md. Rule 2\u2014311(f), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-5\">A party desiring a hearing on a motion, other than a motion filed pursuant to Rule 2-532, 2-533, or 2-534, shall request the hearing in the motion or response under the heading \u201cRequest for Hearing.\u201d Except when a rule expressly provides for a hearing, the court shall determine in each case whether a hearing will be held, but the court <em>may not render a decision that is dispositive of a claim </em>or defense without a hearing if one was requested as provided in this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">\u201cFor a decision to be deemed dispositive of a claim or defense within the contemplation of Rule 2\u2014311(f), it must actually and formally dispose of the claim or defense.\u201d <em>Shelton v. Kirson, </em>119 Md.App. 325, 330, 705 A.2d 25, <em>cert. denied, </em>349 Md. 236, 707 A.2d 1329 (1998). Summary judgment in this case resulted in the affirmance of the decision of the Commission; thus, the court formally disposed of the case by its ruling. Because the Fund requested a hearing, the parties were entitled to be heard on the motions, and it was error for the court to rule without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Notwithstanding that, in this Court, the Fund raised the issue of the circuit court\u2019s failure to hold a hearing on the motions for summary judgment, counsel for the Fund stated at oral argument that the Fund\u2019s preference was not to have this Court decide the case on that basis. We, therefore, deem the issue to have been waived, and will address the merits of the case. <em>Muse v. State, </em>146 Md.App. 395, 398, 807 A.2d 113 (2002) (appellate court does not address an issue withdrawn by the appellant after the brief is filed).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>\n<em>The Statutory Parties</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ArN\">The Injured Workers\u2019 Insurance Fund and The Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">\u201cMaryland was the first state in the nation to enact a workers\u2019 compensation statute.\u201d <em>Harris v. Board of Education of Howard County, </em>375 Md. 21, 28, 825 A.2d 365 (2003). The initial legislation, Chapter 139 of the Acts of 1902, created the \u201cEmployers and Employees Co-operative Insurance Fund.\u201d 1902 Md. Laws, Ch. 139, \u00a7 4. However, that Act was declared unconstitutional by the Court of Common Pleas of Baltimore City. <em>Franklin v. United Railways and Elec. Co., 2 </em>Balt. City Repts 309 (1904).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">\u201cThe current Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act was initially enacted by Chapter 800 of the Acts of 1914.\u201d <em>Harris, </em>375 Md. at 28-29, 825 A.2d 365. The stated purpose of the 1914 Act was to compensate employees for accidental injuries sustained in certain enumerated \u201cextra-hazardous employments.\u201d 1914 Md. Laws, Ch. 800, Preamble; <em>Harris, </em>375 Md. at 29, 825 A.2d 365. As to those enumerated employments, the Act eliminated the employers\u2019 fellow servant defense, as well as the defenses of contributory negligence and assumption of risk. 1914 Md. Laws, Ch. 800, \u00a7 14. The Act required employers to secure compensation for employees by making payments into a \u201cState Accident Fund,\u201d through either private insurance or self-insurance. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">The State Accident Fund, created by \u00a7 16 of the 1914 Act, and codified as former Article 101, \u00a7 16 of the Maryland Code,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> ultimately formed the basis for what is now IWIF.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While the applicability of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act is no longer limited to employees engaged in \u201cextra-hazardous\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>occupations, IWIF has been described as a \u201cstatutory insurer of last resort\u201d because it is a source of insurance for employers in ultra-hazardous occupations who might be otherwise unable to obtain insurance in the commercial market. Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Handbook \u00a7 2.0S[9] (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">The Uninsured Employers Fund (UEF), on the other hand, has been described as the <em>de facto </em>insurer of last result. 86 Op. Att\u2019y. Gen. 211, 212 (2001); <em>Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Handbook </em>\u00a7 2.03[4]. Created in 1967, the purpose of the Fund \u201cis to \u2018protect injured workers whose employers failed, either willfully or negligently, to carry workers\u2019 compensation insurance.\u2019 \u201d 86 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. at 212 (quoting <em>Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund v. Lutter, </em>342 Md. 334, 345, 676 A.2d 51 (1996)). <em>See </em>LE \u00a7 10-304. If an uninsured employer fails to pay an award of compensation, the injured employee may apply to the Fund for payment of the award. LE \u00a7 9-1002(e). When the Fund pays an award of compensation, it becomes subrogated to the rights of the injured employee against the uninsured employer to collect the amount paid, and it may, and often does, fully participate in the proceedings concerning the injured worker\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> LE \u00a7 9-1003. The Fund is further sustained by the imposition of assessments against uninsured employers (LE \u00a7 9-1005), insurers (LE \u00a7 9-1006), and against awards and settlements (LE \u00a7 9-1007).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">As described by one commentator, the Fund protects its interests in this regard, \u201cby pointing its finger at every possible insurer/self-insurer or statutory employer/employer connected with a claim.\u201d <em>Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Handbook </em>\u00a7 2.03[4], Stated otherwise, the Fund\u2019s litigation efforts are largely focused on pursuing any other entity that might be liable to pay an award, thereby reducing payments from the Fund. The result is that in cases where the \u201ccom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>pensability of an injury is clear[,] the claimant is assured that benefits shall be paid; the question is, by whom?\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">That, of course, is the issue presented in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">\n<em>Statutory Employer</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The question before us, then, is whether Schlosser, which was not Johnson\u2019s immediate employer, is liable, as a \u201cstatutory employer,\u201d to pay workers\u2019 compensation benefits to Johnson. Schlosser maintains, and the Commission ruled, that Schlosser is not liable in Maryland because the only Schlosser project on which Johnson worked was located wholly outside the state and, therefore, with respect to his work for Schlosser, Johnson was not a \u201ccovered employee\u201d under the Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">The Fund argues that the question whether Johnson is a covered employee under the Act is determined, in the first instance, by Johnson\u2019s relation to his immediate employer, Rose, and that Schlosser otherwise meets the statutory criteria for liability as Johnson\u2019s statutory employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">We have found no Maryland appellate opinion that has addressed this particular question. We shall conclude that the construction of the statute espoused by the Fund is the better view, and furthers the oft-stated public policy and purpose of the statute. Moreover, our result impresses the liability for similar claims upon a regulated insurer, rather than upon the Fund, which is sustained by assessments upon all employers, insurers, and benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">One of the first cases interpreting the provision at issue here, and discussing its purpose, was <em>State v. Bennett Bldg. Co., </em>154 Md. 159, 140 A. 52 (1928).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As explained by the Court of Appeals,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-10\">[i]t is common practice in certain trades for one pai\u2019ty to agree for a reward to complete a certain work or undertaking, and then to enter into subcontracts with various parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>providing for the execution by them respectively of specified parts of the whole work or undertaking, so that the whole or part thereof would be done by such subcontractors and their assistants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 161, 140 A. 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Under the Act, as originally enacted, by subcontracting out portions of the work \u201cthe principal contractor would avoid in part the responsibility for accidents happening in the carrying out of the work or undertaking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, when the responsibility for compensating injured workers was \u201cshifted upon parties too weak financially to meet it, and who had not secured compensation to their employees in one of the ways required by the statute,\u201d injured workers were often left without compensation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Because of this \u201cmajor loophole,\u201d whereby \u201can employer could, by entering into a subcontract for the performance of parts of an entire project, escape liability under the act,\u201d the Act was amended to impose, under certain circumstances, liability on a principal contractor for injuries sustained by employees of its subcontractor. <em>Honaker v. W.C. &amp; A.N. Miller Dev. Co., </em>285 Md. 216, 223, 401 A.2d 1013 (1979). This came to be known as \u201cstatutory employer\u201d liability. <em>See Bennett Bldg. Co., </em>154 Md. at 162, 140 A. 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">The provision imposing liability upon a statutory employer is now embodied in LE \u00a7 9-508, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-8\">A principal contractor is liable to pay to a covered employee or the dependents of the covered employee any compensation that the principal contractor would have been liable to pay had the covered employee been employed directly by the principal contractor if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-9\">(1) the principal contractor undertakes to perform any work that is part of the business, occupation, or trade of the principal contractor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-10\">(2) the principal contractor contracts with a subcontractor for the execution by or under the subcontractor of all or part of the work undertaken by the principal contractor; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>(3) the covered employee is employed in the execution of that work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">LE \u00a7 9-508(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">As we stated in <em>Cogley v. Schnaper &amp; Koren Constr. Co., </em>14 Md.App. 322, 332, 286 A.2d 819 (1972):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-6\">We think the legislative purpose in enacting [the statutory employer provision] was to further the benevolent concept of Workmen\u2019s Compensation and to achieve that result by providing an incentive to the principal contractor to see that his subcontractors carry Workmen\u2019s Compensation insurance upon their employees. If the principal fails or neglects to ascertain that the subcontractors\u2019 employees are protected by Workmen\u2019s Compensation insurance coverage, it is the principal contractor who must bear the cost of injuries to the subcontractors\u2019 employees, subject only to the principal contractor\u2019s right to recover such costs from the subcontractor in an appropriate action. The burden of recovering from the non-insured subcontractor is shifted from the innocent employee to the principal contractor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-7\"><em>See Matthews v. United States, </em>825 F.2d 35, 36 (4th Cir.1987) (\u201cThe statutory employer concept ... is designed to prevent the unfairness which would occur when a general contractor subcontracts a major portion of its work to various subcontractors who are financially irresponsible and who do not carry workers\u2019 compensation insurance.\u201d). The purpose of the provision creating statutory employer liability has remained unchanged since its enactment. <em>Honaker, </em>285 Md. at 223, 401 A.2d 1013.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">Maryland courts have repeatedly defined a statutory employer as: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number><em>Inner Harbor Warehouse, Inc. v. Myers, </em>321 Md. at 375, 582 A.2d 1244; <em>Lathroum v. Potomac Elec. Power Co., </em>309 Md. 445, 448-49, 524 A.2d 1228 (1987); <em>Brady v. Ralph Parsons Co., </em>308 Md. 486, 503, 520 A.2d 717 (1987); <em>Coffey v. Derby Steel Co., </em>291 Md. 241, 251, 434 A.2d 564 (1981); <em>Honaker, </em>285 Md. at 224, 401 A.2d 1013. Under this analysis, the question of whether an entity is a statutory employer turns on the existence of the principal contractor/subcontractor relationship. Where the statutory criteria are met, the effect \u201cis to impose the absolute liability of an employer upon the principal contractor, when he was not in law the employer of the injured workman.\u201d <em>Bennett Bldg. Co., </em>154 Md. at 162, 140 A. 52.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>1. a principal contractor</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-10\">2. who has contracted to perform work</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-11\">3. which is part of his trade, business or occupation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-12\">4. who has contracted -with another party as a subcontractor for the execution by or under the subcontractor of the whole or any part of such work.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>In the instant case, there is no doubt that a principal contractor/subcontractor relationship existed between Schlosser and Rose, and that the above-quoted criteria were met. Schlosser argues, however, that, under LE \u00a7 9-508, its liability is limited to the compensation it \u201cwould have been liable to pay had the covered employee been employed directly by [it].\u201d It argues that, had it employed Johnson directly to work at Blue Plains, Johnson would not have been a \u201ccovered employee\u201d under the Maryland Act because he would have been employed wholly in the District of Columbia. Thus, Schlosser concludes, it would have no liability to Johnson under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">We are not persuaded by Schlosser\u2019s interpretation of LE \u00a7 9-508. Moreover, to the extent, if any, that LE \u00a7 9-508 can be said to be ambiguous, the benevolent purpose of the Act requires that any ambiguities be liberally construed in favor of the injured employee. <em>Bowen v. Smith, </em>342 Md. 449, 454, 677 A.2d 81 (1996); <em>Ankney v. Franch, </em>103 Md.App. 83, 105, 652 A.2d 1138 (1995), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>341 Md. 350, 670 A.2d 951 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Where, as here, \u201cthe essential terms and manner of employment are undisputed, the issue as to the relation between the parties and the nature of the employment is one of law for the Court.\u201d <em>McElroy Truck Lines, Inc. v. Pohopek, </em>375 Md. 574, 585, 826 A.2d 474 (2003). In other words, the question of whether employment within Maryland amounts to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number><em>regular </em>employment within Maryland and, consequently, whether an employee is a covered employee within the meaning of LE \u00a7 9-203(a), is a question of law. <em>Clayburn v. Soueid, Inc., </em>239 Md. 331, 337, 211 A.2d 728 (1965); <em>Dixon v. Able Equip. Co., Inc., </em>107 Md.App. 541, 545-46, 668 A.2d 1009 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">As we noted above, \u201cstatutory employer\u201d is defined by reference to the principal contractor/subcontractor relationship, not upon the relationship between the injured employee and the principal contractor. In fact, LE \u00a7 9-508 presupposes a finding that the injured employee is a covered employee under the Act. The determination of whether an employee is a covered employee is made solely under LE \u00a7\u00a7 9-202 and 9-203, <em>Dixon, </em>107 Md.App. at 545\u201446, 668 A.2d 1009, and is based upon the relationship between the employee and the direct employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Section 9-202(a) provides that, \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided, an individual, including a minor, is a covered employee while in the service of an employer under an express or implied contract of apprenticeship or hire.\u201d Section 9-203(a) further narrows the definition of covered employee with respect to employment within and outside of Maryland. With respect to employment outside of Maryland, an individual is only a \u201ccovered employee while working for the employer of the individual ... outside of this State <em>on a casual, incidental, or occasional basis if the employer regularly employs the individual within this State.\u201d </em>LE \u00a7 9-203(a)(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">It is undisputed that, although Johnson performed a portion of his work for Rose in the District of Columbia, he was not employed wholly outside of Maryland; he concurrently worked for Rose on at least three other work sites in Maryland. Because Johnson was regularly employed by Rose in Maryland, his work in the District of Columbia must be said to be casual, incidental, or occasional. <em>Pohopek v. McElroy Truck Lines, Inc., </em>140 Md.App. 235, 242, 780 A.2d 383 (2001), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number><em>aff'd, </em>375 Md. 574, 826 A.2d 474 (2003). As a result, Johnson is a covered employee under LE \u00a7 9-203(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">Johnson\u2019s status as a covered employee under the Act is not undone by virtue of LE \u00a7 9-508. The concept of statutory employer liability was designed to provide an injured worker with an award of compensation from either the subcontractor or the principal contractor and, irrespective of which he chooses to pursue, the awards are to be \u201calike in every respect.\u201d <em>Bennett Bldg. Co., </em>154 Md. at 167, 140 A. 52. If the injured worker seeks compensation from the principal contractor, \u201cthe rights and obligations of the parties are identical with those of the parties, [as] if the election had been to claim compensation or to proceed against the subcontractor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 164, 140 A. 52. The statutory employer provision was aimed at \u201cmore certainly ... assuring] the workman his contemplated compensation\u201d and removing \u201cdifficult questions\u201d of fact and \u201ccontingencies\u201d that arose in attempting to determine when a principal contractor would be held responsible for compensating an injured employee of the subcontractor. <em>Id. </em>at 161-62, 140 A. 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Schlosser advances the argument that, even though Johnson is a covered employee under the Act, entitling him to compensation from his direct employer, he is not entitled to precisely the same compensation from Schlosser as the statutory employer because, if he worked directly for Schlosser, he would not have been a covered employee. That position, we believe, leads to the type of speculation and uncertainty the Act was designed to eliminate.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">We, therefore, hold that the Commission erred as a matter of law in concluding that Schlosser was not liable for compensation to Johnson under LE \u00a7 9-508; and further, that the circuit court erred as a matter of law in granting Schlosser\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO GRANT APPELLANT\u2019S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT, TO</p>\n<p id=\"b638-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>DENY APPELLEES\u2019 MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT, AND TO INSTRUCT THE WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION COMMISSION TO ENTER AN ORDER CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEES.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b627-9\">.
