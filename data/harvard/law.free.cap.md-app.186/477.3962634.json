At approximately 4:30 that afternoon, Connor drowned in the Country Club\u2019s swimming pool. The pool was managed at the time of the drowning by D.R.D. Pool Service, Inc. (\u201cthe pool company\u201d), appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Less than one month after his death, Connor\u2019s parents, Thomas Freed and Deborah Neagle-Webber, as the personal representatives of their son\u2019s estate, filed a survivorship action in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. Their complaint named, <em>inter alia, </em>the pool company as a defendant and asserted that Connor\u2019s death was caused by the negligence of the pool company. In the same lawsuit, Connor\u2019s parents also brought a wrongful death action against the pool company, in which they each sought recompense for their grief, mental anguish, etc. that they experienced as a result of the drowning.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Prior to trial, the pool company filed a motion for summary judgment in which it argued that the estate of Connor Freed was precluded from recovering damages based on the claim that Connor had experienced conscious pain and suffering prior to his death. According to the movant, that claim was barred because the estate could not produce evidence that would support such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">The pool company\u2019s motion was supported by deposition excerpts from various witnesses who had testified during the discovery phase of the case. The parents filed an opposition, supported by a copy of the autopsy report prepared by the Anne Arundel County Medical Examiner along with additional deposition excerpts. The issue was thoroughly briefed by all parties and, after a hearing in the circuit court, summary judgment was granted in favor of the pool company. This ruling removed from the case the issue of whether Connor had suffered conscious pain and suffering prior to his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>The jury returned a $4,006,442.00 verdict in favor of the parents in their wrongful death suit. Pursuant to a statutory \u201ccap\u201d imposed in Maryland on non-economic damages, the wrongful death award was reduced to $1,002,500.00. <em>See </em>Md.Code Ann. (2008 RepLVoL), Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Article, section 11-108 (hereinafter \u201cthe Cap Statute\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">Connor\u2019s parents filed a timely motion to alter or amend the judgment in which they challenged the constitutionality of the Cap Statute. The parents\u2019 motion was denied and this timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">On appeal, the parents, as they did below, argue that Maryland\u2019s Cap on non-economic damages violates the equal protection guarantee under the United States Constitution and the Maryland Declaration of Rights. The Court of Appeals has twice rejected this exact argument. <em>See Oaks v. Connors, </em>339 Md. 24, 37, 660 A.2d 423 (1995); <em>Murphy v. Edmonds, </em>325 Md. 342, 370, 374-75, 601 A.2d 102 (1992). As appellants recognize, this Court has no discretion but to follow the law as enunciated by the Court of Appeals. <em>See Runnels v. Newell, </em>179 Md.App. 168, 203, 944 A.2d 1183 (2008) <em>aff'd, in part rev\u2019d in part on other grounds. </em>407 Md. 578, 967 A.2d 729 (2009). In appellants\u2019 words, the issue concerning the constitutionality of the statutory cap on non-economic damages is raised in this Court simply \u201cto preserve it in the event the Court of Appeals reviews this case.\u201d Based on <em>Oaks </em>and <em>Murphy, </em>both <em>supra, </em>we shall reject appellants\u2019 argument that the Cap Statute is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The main issue presented in this appeal is whether the motions judge erred when she granted summary judgment in favor of the pool company as to the Estate\u2019s claim for recompense for Connor\u2019s conscious pain and suffering that immediately preceded his death by drowning. We shall hold that the court did err and remand the case to the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County for a new trial to determine what damages, if any, the Estate is entitled to recover for Connor\u2019s conscious pain and suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Sometime between 4:15 and 4:30 p.m. Connor approached Paul Carroll, the adult who had brought him to the pool. He asked Mr. Carroll to remove his life jacket so that he could go to the bathroom. Mr. Carroll did so and told the child to come back when he was done. Mr. Carroll saw Connor go into the restroom area and then turned his attention to Brice and Peyton Dameron, two children who were about Connor\u2019s age and who were then playing in the pool. These children had also been brought to the pool by Mr. Carroll. After a \u201ccouple of minutes,\u201d Mr. Carroll began to wonder about Connor\u2019s whereabouts. He was concerned because he thought that it was taking the child a little bit longer than usual to go to the bathroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">After a \u201ccouple of [more] minutes,\u201d Mr. Carroll asked Brice' Dameron to go to the restroom to . \u201ccheck on Connor.\u201d According to Mr. Carroll, there were thirty to forty people in the pool at that time, \u201cmostly kids.\u201d Mr. Carroll continued to watch Peyton who was \u201cjumping in and out\u201d of the pool. After an interlude, Peyton told Mr. Carroll that there was \u201csomebody floating\u201d in the pool. Mr. Carroll and another adult walked to the side of the pool and saw Connor, face down, with his arms hanging by his side. In Mr. Carroll\u2019s words, Connor was in \u201cthe dead man\u2019s float\u201d position. Emergency help was immediately summoned and lifesaving measures were commenced. But from the time his body was discovered, until he was pronounced dead, Connor never regained consciousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">In pretrial discovery, no eyewitnesses were found who saw Connor enter the pool after he left the bathroom. And no witnesses came forward who saw him struggle in the pool prior to his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">An autopsy report showed that Connor died of drowning. The medical examiner found \u201cno evidence of significant recent injury.\u201d A small (1/4 x 1/8) inch abrasion was found on the child\u2019s lower back. The manner of death was accidental.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">In preparation for trial, Connor\u2019s parents hired Dr. Jerome H. Modell to review the case and render an expert opinion as to whether Connor experienced conscious pain and suffering immediately prior to his death. Dr. Modell is a Florida physician specializing in anesthesiology and intensive-care medicine. In 1971, he was the author of a book titled \u201cThe Pathophysiology and Treatment of drowning and near-drowning.\u201d More recently, in 2002-2003, he was a consultant to the World Congress on drowning. He has treated more than 100 near-drowning victims in his clinical practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">During his deposition testimony, Dr. Modell said that he based his opinion concerning Connor\u2019s conscious pain and suffering, in part, on his personal experience as a doctor and on animal experiments. He also relied on a report that was prepared by a group of international experts who participated in the 2002 World Congress on drowning. The report by these experts was published in the Journal of Circulation in the United States and the Journal of Resuscitation in Europe. In his deposition, Dr. Modell explained the term \u201cpathophysiology of drowning\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">The pathophysiology of drowning begins when the mouth and nose first become submerged in the water. At that point in time, the first reaction is to voluntarily breath hold to avoid aspirating water. The carbon dioxide tension then builds up to a point where you can no longer voluntarily avoid the sensation to breathe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\">At that point in time you start to take a breath and when you get water in the oral pharynx, that water stimulates the larynx to go into laryngospasm to further protect the airway from aspiration of water. And as a result you try to breathe but you can\u2019t because you are totally obstructed. It\u2019s as though someone were suffocating you or you put a clamp on your trachea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-8\">As a result, you will build a tremendous negative pressure within your chest as your diaphragm tries to pull in air, which you can\u2019t, or water. And as a result the intercostal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>muscles will sink into the chest rather than rise. This causes a great deal of pain and discomfort of pain and suffering and this process lasts for a minute and a half to two minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-4\">At a minute and a half to two minutes, you no longer can sustain laryngospasm because of the level of cerebral hypoxia and your larynx will then relax and you will then start to actively inhale water.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Dr. Modell testified, to a reasonable degree of medical probability, that Connor experienced pain for about 2 minutes during the drowning process. His exact testimony in this regard was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-7\">As far as his consciousness is considered, he would have been conscious for approximately 2 minutes before he would lose consciousness. Secondary to cerebral hypoxia. And that would correspond not only to what\u2019s been reported in the literature, but also studies we\u2019ve done in experimental animals where we actually measured arterial oxygen tension with varying time periods simulating laryngospasm and drowning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">Dr. Modell also relied on an article by a Dr. Lowson, who had been shipwrecked in the early 1900\u2019s and had almost drowned. In an article written by Dr. Lowson and published in 1903, the doctor \u201cvividly\u201d described what happened to him physically during the time he was submerged.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">Dr. Modell admitted at his deposition that not all drownings are alike, because there are medical conditions that can cause a person to be unconscious before he or she takes in water. For instance, a person in a pool could be knocked unconscious by a blow or the person could intentionally hyperventilate, causing a blackout. Dr. Modell ruled out those possibilities because he thought it highly unlikely that a 5-year-old would intentionally hyperventilate to the extent necessary to cause a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>blackout, and there was no evidence in the autopsy report that he received a blow that would have rendered him unconscious.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The pool company retained Dr. H. Brandis Marsh, a clinical cardiologist, as an expert. He has an additional interest in what he termed \u201cinterventional cardiology,\u201d meaning that he performs cardiac catheterizations, angioplasties, and supervises exercise tests used to diagnose heart problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Dr. Marsh admitted at deposition, based on his review of the autopsy report and other records concerning Connor\u2019s drowning, that there was no evidence that Connor had \u201cany type of injury which would have rendered him unconscious prior to entering the pool.\u201d He conceded that there was no evidence that Connor \u201csuffered from some type of underlying etiology that predisposed him to unconsciousness.\u201d He also said that it was \u201cmore likely than not that [Connor] was conscious when he began to drown.\u201d Nevertheless, Dr. Marsh testified that it would be \u201cspeculative to assume\u201d that Connor \u201cexperienced conscious pain and suffering\u201d prior to his death. The basis for his \u201ctoo speculative\u201d opinion was that \u201cthere\u2019s no data to support that claim.\u201d He was then asked whether \u201ccommon sense dictates, ... that when a person is deprived of air, there is a period of pain.\u201d He responded that \u201ccommon sense dictates that someone in [that] situation will flail around and draw attention to themselves and yet that doesn\u2019t happen either, so I am not sure what the role of common sense is especially when you\u2019re talking about medical issues.\u201d His answer continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-7\">The only data that I\u2019ve seen anywhere here with respect to patients experiencing conscious pain and suffering when drowning is the report of this doctor who drowned in 1900[sic] and Dr. Modell\u2019s statement that some of the patients he\u2019s talked to who he has taken care of in his career reported similar things. We don\u2019t know how many he\u2019s talked to, much less what percentage of them said what, when and under what circumstance. To the best of my knowledge, none of that is published in the peer reviewed literature and at that point it\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Nevertheless,- Dr. Marsh testified that he did not disagree with the portion of Dr. Modell\u2019s deposition testimony in which he described the pathophysiology of drowning.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">In her oral opinion, granting summary judgment in favor of the pool company and against the personal representatives of the estate of Connor Freed, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">I believe that from what the parties have said that there was no material fact in dispute and I believe that there ... [is no] dispute that the child was conscious for some period of time and I do not think that there is ... any testimony, clearly no eye witness to say when that consciousness became an unconsciousness.... I understand that [plaintiffs\u2019 counsel believes] that [he] can distinguish <em>[UMMS v.] Malory </em>[143 Md.App. 327, 795 A.2d 107 (2001)] and I believe that <em>Malory </em>requires that there be some objective measure before there is an ability to take to the jury the conscious pain and suffering [issue].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">We have found no Maryland case dealing with the issue of whether the personal representative of a drowning victim can recover for the victim\u2019s conscious pain and suffering when, as here, there is no eyewitness testimony concerning the drowning. There are, however, cases from our sister states as well as federal decisions concerning this issue. <em>See </em>John P. Ludington, Annotation, <em>When is Death \u201cInstantaneous\u201d for Purposes of Wrongful Death or Survival Action, </em>75 A.L.R.4th 151, \u00a7 8 (1989). But before analyzing cases from other jurisdictions, it is useful to review some well established principles set forth in Maryland cases dealing with the issue of what must be proven in order to be awarded recompense for the conscious pain and suffering of a decedent. That exact issue was addressed about sixty years ago in the case of <em>Tri-State Poultry Coop. v. Carey, </em>190 Md. 116, 125, 57 A.2d 812 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>In the <em>Tri-State Poultry </em>case, the decedent, a bicyclist named Orrick Carey, was struck by a bus and suffered an injury to the base of his skull. <em>Id. </em>at 118, 57 A.2d 812. Immediately after the accident, Carey was bleeding. <em>Id. </em>Carey was promptly transported to the home of a Dr. Whaley, who lived nearby. <em>Id. </em>at 118-19, 57 A.2d 812. When Dr. Whaley first saw Carey, the latter moaned and groaned, and Dr. Whaley administered morphine. <em>Id. </em>at 119, 57 A.2d 812. Carey died about forty-five minutes after Dr. Whaley first examined him. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">Dr. Whaley was asked at trial if Carey \u201cwas conscious to such a degree that he was suffering pain?\u201d Dr. Whaley answered: \u201cI would say yes. I don\u2019t think he was totally conscious. He did not answer his name. But I do think he was conscious enough to elicit pain.\u201d He also said that he administered morphine \u201cfor pain and to prevent shock.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 119, 57 A.2d 812. On cross-examination, Dr. Whaley admitted that the fact that a man is groaning does not necessarily mean he is conscious. <em>Id. </em>at 120, 57 A.2d 812. He was asked: \u201cyou don\u2019t mean to tell the Jury definitely and positively that Mr. Carey was conscious at the time you saw him, do you?\u201d Dr. Whaley replied \u201cI felt that in the process of helping Mr. Carey up he gave out more groans and so forth, I thought probably he was conscious to more pain. That was my reason for saying he was conscious of some pain.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Another doctor testified that he examined Carey at the hospital. <em>Id. </em>at 126, 57 A.2d 812. That doctor opined that Carey did not suffer conscious pain from the time of his injury until his death. <em>Id. </em>Under such circumstances, the Court of Appeals said, <em>id.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">This case is a narrow one, but viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, we cannot say that the lower court was wrong in submitting the case to the jury .... on the question of whether or not the deceased suffered conscious pain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Prior to reaching the holding we have just quoted, the Court of Appeals reviewed authorities from numerous jurisdictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>concerning the sufficiency of conscious pain and suffering evidence. The Court then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">From these authorities we think, in order to recover in a case like this, three elements must concur:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-6\">1. that the defendant\u2019s negligence was the direct and proximate cause of the accident; 2. that the deceased lived after the accident; and 3. that between the time of the accident and the time of death he suffered conscious pain. If these elements are established the plaintiff is entitled to recover. <em>The period between the accident and death may be short, yet, if the evidence shows that the decedent lived after the accident was conscious and suffered pain, his representative is entitled to recover in an action like the one in this case. </em>The burden of proof is upon the plaintiff to show by a preponderance of evidence the elements necessary to establish the action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 125, 57 A.2d 812 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">Since <em>Tri-State Poultry </em>was decided, the aforementioned test has not changed. <em>See Beynon v. Montgomery Cablevision Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>351 Md. 460, 508-09, 718 A.2d 1161 (1998); <em>Univ. of Md. Medical Sys. v. Malory, </em>143 Md.App. 327, 346 (2001). The <em>Beynon </em>case dealt with the issue of whether preimpact fright or any other form of mental or emotional disturbance or distress suffered by an accident victim, who instantly dies upon impact, was legally compensable. <em>Id. </em>at 463, 718 A.2d 1161. The <em>Beynon </em>Court held that the estate of a decedent could recover such damages because, in the event the deceased had lived, he would have been able to recover them. <em>Id. </em>at 500, 718 A.2d 1161. In the course of its opinion, the Court said that \u201c[djirect evidence is not necessary. What is required is evidence from which a reasonable inference could be drawn that the decedent experienced fear or fright.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 508, 718 A.2d 1161.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">The teaching of the <em>Beynon </em>case, as applied to this case, is that Connor\u2019s parents were not required to produce eyewitnesses or other direct evidence that their son suffered conscious pain and suffering prior to his death. Instead, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>order to survive a motion for summary judgment, the personal representatives of Connor\u2019s estate were required to produce evidence from which a reasonable inference could be drawn that the decedent experienced fear or fright or conscious pain while he was in the process of drowning.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">The evidence, which we deem sufficient, showing conscious pain and suffering in this case was the following: 1) Connor, a healthy five-year-old, entered the pool without adult supervision and without a life preserver; 2) he received no blow to the head prior to drowning, nor did he have any physical problem that would have rendered him unconscious prior to going under water; 3) as the pool company\u2019s own expert admitted, it was more likely than not that when Connor started to drown he was conscious; and 4) once his head was under water he experienced the usual pain and suffering associated with drowning, as described by Dr. Modell when he explained the pathophysiology of drowning.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">As mentioned previously, the motions judge in this case granted summary judgment because she did not think that the <em>Malory </em>case was distinguishable from the one <em>sub judice. </em>Jamal Malory, age two, arrived at the Emergency Room of the University of Maryland Hospital in Baltimore at noon on March 15, 1996. 143 Md.App. at 334, 795 A.2d 107. The child was experiencing respiratory problems. <em>Id. </em>at 332, 795 A.2d 107. He was released from the hospital at 4:05 p.m. that same day. <em>Id. </em>at 334, 795 A.2d 107. At home on the evening of his discharge, Jamal\u2019s health improved and he was able to go about his usual activities. He was given a bath, Vapor rub was applied to his chest and nose, and he went to sleep in his mother\u2019s bed. <em>Id. </em>at 335, 795 A.2d 107. During the night, the child woke up frequently, coughing and crying. <em>Id. </em>The next morning, at 10:30 a.m., Jamal\u2019s mother awoke to find her son lying in bed unresponsive. <em>Id. </em>at 335, 795 A.2d 107. Although cardiopulmonary resuscitation (\u201cCPR\u201d) was administered, Jamal never regained consciousness, never moved or opened his eyes, and was otherwise non-responsive. <em>Id. </em>at 335, 795 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>A.2d 107. At 11:25 a.m. on the morning of March 16, Jamal was pronounced dead. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">In <em>Malory, </em>the plaintiffs contended that the defendant\u2019s hospital was guilty of medical malpractice by not keeping Jamal overnight for monitoring. <em>Id. </em>at 332, 795 A.2d 107. One of the issues presented in the <em>Malory </em>case was whether the trial judge committed reversible error in allowing the jury to consider the claim of Jamal\u2019s estate for the decedent\u2019s conscious pain and suffering. <em>Id. </em>at 333, 795 A.2d 107. We held that the court erred in allowing the jury to consider that issue. Judge Arrie Davis, speaking for this Court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AjE\">By the accounts of all witnesses at trial, Jamal was unconscious from 10:30 a.m. on March 16, 1996, until 11:25 a.m. that same morning, when he was pronounced dead. [Jamal\u2019s mother,] who first found Jamal, testified that he was unconscious when she awoke that morning; Janet, who performed CPR on her grandson, testified that he stayed unconscious despite her efforts; the paramedics and firemen, who answered appellees\u2019 \u201c911\u201d call, testified that he was unconscious at all times while they were present; and the health care providers at appellant\u2019s facility all maintained that Jamal was unconscious upon arrival at the ER. Appellees contend that the testimony of [Doctor] King and [Doctor] Carroll satisfies the evidentiary requirements set forth in <em>Ory; </em>however, this testimony is mere speculation and Maryland has long followed the general principle that, \u201cif compensatory damages are to be recovered, they must be proved with reasonable certainty, and may not be based on speculation or conjecture.\u201d <em>Beynon, </em>351 Md. at 513, 718 A.2d 1161 (Wilner, J., dissenting). It was, therefore, reversible error for the trial court to allow the issue of damages for conscious pain and suffering to go to the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 384, 795 A.2d 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">This case is distinguishable from <em>Malory </em>because in that case the decedent was unconscious at all relevant times. The same was not true for Connor. The experts for both sides were in agreement that Connor did not have any pre-existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>condition or pre-death injury that would have rendered him unconscious <em>prior to the time that he began to drown. </em>The medical experts for both the plaintiffs and the defendant also agreed that it was probable that Connor was conscious when he first entered the swimming pool. When, as here, a well qualified expert for the moving party admits that the victim was conscious when he began to drown and also admits that the pathophysiology of drowning was as described in the deposition testimony of an opposing expert, we fail to see how the evidence that the child experienced at least some pain can be characterized as too speculative. In reaching this conclusion, we are mindful of the fact that in any case where we are called upon to consider whether the motions judge should have entered summary judgment, we are required to \u201cconstrue the factual record in the light most favorable to the non-movants.\u201d <em>Newell, supra, </em>407 Md. at 607, 967 A.2d 729. Moreover, in such cases, it is not our job to resolve factual disputes; instead, we endeavor to \u201cmerely determine whether they exist and \u2018are sufficiently material to be tried.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Sadler v. Dimensions Healthcare Corp., </em>378 Md. 509, 534, 836 A.2d 655 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The personal representatives of Connor\u2019s estate take the straight-forward position in this appeal that it was for the jury to decide whether, and to what extent, Connor suffered conscious pain and suffering. In response, rather than addressing that issue head on, appellee address the issue obliquely by arguing that \u201cthe lower court was correct in excluding the testimony of appellants\u2019 expert, Dr. Jerome Modell, and therefore denying the claim in the survivorship action for conscious pain and suffering.\u201d The short answer to that contention is that the motions judge at no time indicated that she was excluding from her consideration the testimony of Dr. Model!.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>We now turn to the basis upon which the motions judge did grant summary judgment. As mentioned earlier, the circuit court said in its oral opinion granting summary judgment in favor of the pool company that <em>\u201c[UMMS v.] Malory </em>requires that there be some objective measure before there is an ability to take to the jury the conscious pain and suffering.\u201d The motions judge also emphasized that although there was no dispute that Connor was \u201cconscious\u201d for some period of time, there was \u201cno testimony, clearly no eyewitness testimony to say when the consciousness became ... unconsciousness.\u201d We interpret the court\u2019s \u201cobjective measure\u201d language, when read in conjunction with the motions court\u2019s observation that there was no eyewitness testimony as to how long the decedent was conscious, as imposing a requirement that the plaintiff present direct evidence concerning how long the victim consciously suffered pain. But as already mentioned, direct evidence was not necessary; circumstantial evidence is entirely sufficient. <em>Beynon, supra, </em>351 Md. at 508, 718 A.2d 1161. Moreover, the exact length of time fright or pain was experienced need not be shown. <em>Tri-State Poultry, supra, </em>190 Md. at 125, 57 A.2d 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">In support of the trial judge\u2019s ruling, the pool company focuses upon the expert testimony of Dr. Modell and attempts to denigrate it. Appellee argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">Dr. Modell based his opinion entirely on an article published by a shipwrecked doctor in 1902[sic] and conversations he had with several of his former patients who had experienced near drowning episodes. The opinion itself was non-specific to Connor Freed but was Dr. Modell\u2019s generic recital of \u201cthe drowning process.\u201d As Dr. Modell himself put it, \u201cI can\u2019t specifically tell you exactly how many seconds it takes anybody to drown. I can tell you within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>reasonable medical probability what the time course of the drowning process is.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">(Emphasis omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Dr. Modell testified that during his career as an anesthesiologist he had the opportunity of treating \u201cwell over 100 drowning victims,\u201d who had been successfully resuscitated. Those patients were treated \u201cin an intensive care environment\u201d where he obtained histories of his patients, including those of children, who had related experiences \u201cnot different\u201d from that related by Dr. Lowson. He also relied on animal experiments and, as already mentioned, Dr. Modell testified, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that Connor \u201cunderwent the drowning process\u201d as described by a group of international experts who presented a paper to the World Congress on drowning in 2002 and published it in the Journal of Circulation in the United States. A physician with Dr. Modell\u2019s specialty and experience was certainly qualified to testify as to the physical effect that ingestion of water would have on the lungs, heart and brain of a healthy five-year-old.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">It is true, as appellee points out, that Dr. Modell was unable to state, specifically, how many seconds it takes a particular person to drown. But Dr. Modell was able to testify to a reasonable degree of medical probability, that Connor would have been conscious \u201cfor approximately two minutes\u201d before he lost consciousness. Such testimony was far more exact than that of Dr. Whaley, which the <em>Tri-State Poultry </em>Court said was sufficient to create a jury issue as to the amount, if any, of conscious pain suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">It is also true, as appellee stresses, that Dr. Marsh disagreed with Dr. Modell\u2019s testimony. The defense expert said that Dr. Modell had engaged in \u201cpure speculation\u201d and opined that there was no \u201cobjective evidence\u201d as to how long Connor suffered. In our view, whether Dr. Modell\u2019s opinion or that of Dr. Marsh was to be credited was a jury issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">Appellee also argues that under Maryland law there must be \u201csome objective factual basis\u201d to support a conscious pain and suffering award. According to appellee, there was no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>such \u201cobjective\u201d evidence in this case because no witness saw Connor enter the pool, nor, as far as anyone has been able to determine, did anyone observe Connor in distress while in the water prior to being found unconscious. That argument was answered in <em>Beynon, supra, </em>when the Court said \u201c[djirect evidence is not necessary\u201d: the test is whether the plaintiff has presented \u201cevidence from which a reasonable inference could be drawn that the decedent experienced fear or fright.\u201d 351 Md. at 508, 718 A.2d 1161.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Appellee lastly argues that Connor \u201cmay have blacked out as soon as he entered the water or sometime after he was in the water but before he drowned. Everything is guess work because no one saw him or heard him.\u201d Whether Connor blacked out before the drowning process began was a subject that was appropriate for expert medical testimony based upon the autopsy report and evidence as to Connor\u2019s prior state of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>health. (The physicians retained by both parties determined the scenario that appellee suggests (starting to drown while already unconscious) was unlikely). We therefore disagree with appellee\u2019s characterization of this testimony as \u201cguesswork.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">Appellee cites five out-of-state cases in support of its position. The cases are <em>Phiri v. Joseph, </em>32 A.D.3d 922, 822 N.Y.S.2d 573, 574 (2006) (eye witnesses to an accident in which decedent was struck by a bus, testified, without contradiction, that they did not see the decedent move after the accident and did not know whether he had stopped breathing; evidence held insufficient to show conscious pain and suffering); <em>Cochrane v. Schneider Nat\u2019l Carriers, Inc., </em>968 F.Supp. 613, 617 (D.Kan.1997) (claim for conscious pain and suffering disallowed because plaintiff failed to show that decedent was conscious at some time after the impact); <em>Feldman v. Allegheny Airlines, Inc., </em>382 F.Supp. 1271 (D.Conn.1974) (representatives of the victim of an airplane crash denied recovery when no evidence was presented as to the location within the fuselage at which the decedent\u2019s body was found and no proof presented from which it could be inferred that she was conscious after the impact); <em>In re Sincere Navigation Corp., </em>329 F.Supp. 652 (E.D.La.1971) (representatives of seventeen of the crewman who were killed while aboard a coast guard vessel that collided with a freighter were held ineligible to receive recompense for the decedents\u2019 conscious pain and suffering when none of the bodies were ever recovered, no evidence was presented as to whether the decedents were asleep or awake at the time of the collision, and no evidence was presented that any individual crewman \u201csuffered a moment\u201d prior to death) <em>modified on other grounds, </em>529 F.2d 744 (5th Cir.1976)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>There are a number of cases from other jurisdictions in which the court held a jury question was presented as to whether the victim endured conscious pain and suffering when the evidence was less substantial than that presented by the appellants in this case. In <em>Clark v. Manchester, </em>64 N.H. 471, 13 A. 867 (1888), a three and one-half year old boy drowned in a stagnant, muddy, and slimy pool of water in what once had been a city reservoir. There were no eyewitnesses. <em>Id. </em>at 869. The New Hampshire Supreme Court said that accurately speaking, \u201cthere is no such thing in any case as death happening simultaneously with the injury causing it, and still less in cases of drowning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court went on to say that the condition of the water afforded competent evidence from which a jury might legitimately infer not only that the death was not instantaneous, but also that the child experienced both physical and mental pain and suffering, for which neither eyewitness nor expert witness testimony was necessary. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">In <em>Cook v. Ross Island Sand &amp; Gravel Co., </em>626 F.2d 746 (9th Cir.1980), a deckhand fell off a barge into the Columbia River. The fall was -witnessed by the ship\u2019s captain. When the captain later testified, he did not indicate whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>victim had been conscious either during the fall or immediately afterwards. The deckhand\u2019s body was found three months later and at trial the decedent\u2019s representatives presented expert testimony that the cause of death was asphyxia from drowning and that the deckhand had not sustained a skull fracture. Plaintiffs expert, a pathologist, testified that based on the absence of any evidence of a skull fracture, he concluded that the decedent had been conscious when he entered the Columbia River, and that he had remained conscious for up to 2 minutes after submersion. The Court held that taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, sufficient evidence was presented to raise a jury question as to whether the decedent had suffered conscious pain and suffering prior to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The Court of Appeals of Louisiana considered the claim of the survivors of a boat captain (Captain Wall) who fell between two barges moored together in a river. <em>Wall v. Progressive Barge Line, Inc., </em>703 So.2d 681 (La.Ct.App.1997). The <em>Wall </em>Court upheld a $50,000.00 award for the deceased\u2019s pain and suffering prior to death based on the fact that when the decedent\u2019s body was recovered there was no evidence of physical injury to the body, except for asphyxiation.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">The Court of Civil Appeals of Texas reached a result similar to that in <em>Wall </em>in <em>Mitchell v. Akers, </em>401 S.W.2d 907 (Tex.Civ. App.1966). In <em>Mitchell, </em>a boy, age three years and eight months, drowned in a private swimming pool located on the defendant\u2019s property. <em>Id. </em>at 908. The little boy had entered the pool area through an open gate. <em>Id. </em>No one witnessed the drowning, but a doctor who arrived on the scene shortly after the body was discovered examined the child and later opined \u201cthat the child died of drowning after struggling for 2 or 3 minutes before losing consciousness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 912. The doctor further testified that during the 2 or 3 minutes the child \u201cprobably endured physical pain and mental anguish.\u201d The basis of the doctor\u2019s opinion that the child was conscious when he entered the pool was based on the absence of any \u201cbruises or marks on the child\u201d that \u201cmight indicate that the child may have fallen against a hard object and become <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>unconscious before becoming immersed in the water.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Texas Court of Civil Appeals held that such evidence was sufficient to support an award in favor of the estate for the child\u2019s conscious pain and suffering. <em>Id. </em>To the same effect, see <em>Kline v. Maritrans CP, Inc., </em>791 F.Supp. 455, 466 (D.Del. 1992) (\u201cThere is testimony that indicates Kline did not experience a pre-mortem injury that would render him unconscious and there is testimony delineating the time a person of Kline\u2019s physical stature could be expected to survive and remain conscious under the conditions. Therefore, the Court concludes that defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the issue of damages for pain and suffering must be denied.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">For all the reasons stated above, we hold that the motions judge erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the pool company as to the claim made on behalf of Connor\u2019s estate for the child\u2019s pre-mortem conscious pain and suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF D.R.D. POOL SERVICE, INC. AS TO THE CLAIM BY THE ESTATE OF CONNOR FREED FOR RECOMPENSE DUE TO THE CHILD\u2019S CONSCIOUS PAIN AND SUFFERING, REVERSED; ALL OTHER JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID 50% BY APPELLEE AND 50% BY THOMAS FREED AND DEBORAH NEAGLE-WEBBER, JOINTLY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b513-6\">. Usually, we will not affirm the grant of summary judgment on any ground not relied upon by the motions judge. <em>See Johnson v. MacIntyre, </em>356 Md. 471, 480, 740 A.2d 599 (1999). There is an exception, however, to that rule. The exception, which is not here applicable, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>that an appellate court will affirm the grant of a summary judgment, on grounds not relied upon by the motions judge, if the latter had no discretion but to grant summary judgment. <em>See Stanley v.

Such evidence exists in this case, the <em>Il'k </em>feet long skid marks made by the decedent's vehicle immediately prior to the actual crash. A jury reasonably could have inferred from that evidence that the decedent was aware of the impending peril; that he was going to crash, and attempted an evasive maneuver to avoid it.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 508, 718 A.2d 1161 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">The <em>Beynon </em>Court went on to say <em>id. </em>at 508-09, 718A.2d 1161:</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">A jury reasonably could have inferred from the evidence that the decedent was aware of the impending peril, that he was going to crash, and attempted an evasive maneuver to avoid it. The jury equally reasonably could have concluded that the decedent suffered emotional distress or fright during that period before the crash, after he became aware of the imminent danger and began braking. This is not rank speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">The same type of inference as <em>Beynon </em>permitted could have been drawn in this case, except that the decedent, rather than expecting a terrible crash, expected death by drowning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b517-5\">. The appellee also cites the case of <em>Davis v. Parkhill-Goodloe Co., Inc., </em>302 F.2d 489 (5th Cir.1962), in which the trial judge granted judgment in favor of the defendant. On appeal to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, the Court was not presented with the issue whether the evidence was sufficient to show conscious pain and suffering on the part of the decedent. Nevertheless, when it remanded the case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Court instructed the trial court to determine whether sufficient evidence existed to allow the issue of conscious pain and suffering to go to the jury. In doing so, the Court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">Great ingenuity was exercised in putting forward a medical theory based upon expert testimony of the probable length of time it took for a person finally to expire in drowning. But there are so many unknowns in this unexplained slipping or falling of Davis into the water, that we should only say that substantial evidence will be required to sustain a finding of consciousness upon which to rest the permissible assumption of pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">302 F.2d at 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">The facts as set forth by the Fifth Circuit in the <em>Davis </em>case are sketchy. The case arose when a healthy, twenty-four-year-old seaman fell off a narrow ten foot plank and landed in the water. His body was found about twenty-four hours after the accident and the cause of death was determined to be drowning. <em>Id. </em>at 491. No one witnessed the accident. Until his body was found, the seaman's disappearance was unexplained. <em>Id. </em>Unlike the case <em>sub judice, </em>there was no evidence that, at the time the decedent entered the water, he was conscious.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
