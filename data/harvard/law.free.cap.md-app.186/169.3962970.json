EYLER, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">Johns Hopkins University (\u201cHopkins\u201d or \u201cthe University\u201d), the appellee, applied for a refund of admissions and amusement taxes it paid to Baltimore City, as collected by the Comptroller of the Treasury (\u201cthe Comptroller\u201d), the appellant, on gross receipts from ticket sales to intercollegiate men\u2019s lacrosse games in 2002, 2003, and 2004. When the Comptroller denied the refund request, Hopkins filed a challenge in the Maryland Tax Court. Ultimately, the Tax Court granted the refund. After that decision was affirmed on judicial review by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, the Comptroller noted this appeal, posing one question for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">Did the Maryland Tax Court commit legal error when it decided that the gross receipts from intercollegiate athletic events were used exclusively for an educational purpose?</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>For the reasons that follow, we uphold the decision of the Tax Court and therefore shall affirm the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">In an evidentiary hearing before the Tax Court, on September 13, 2006, Hopkins called witnesses Debra Sorandes, Senior Tax Accountant for the University, and Tom Calder, Director of Athletics and Recreation for Hopkins, and the Comptroller called witness Theresa Trentler, Refund Supervisor. The basic first-level facts were not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">On March 7, 2005, Hopkins filed a written refund application with the Comptroller, seeking to recover $40,672.40 in admissions and amusement taxes it had paid on ticket sales receipts from intercollegiate men\u2019s lacrosse games between February 2002 and June 2004. The authority to impose an admissions and amusement tax is granted by the State to counties and municipal corporations by Title 4 of the Tax-General Article (\u201cT-G\u201d) (1988, 2004 Repl.Vol.), specifically, TG sections 4-101(b)(1) and 4-102.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Any admissions and amusement tax imposed by a county or municipal corporation must be paid to the Comptroller, and filed with an admissions and amusement tax return. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 4-201, 4-301.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Hopkins sought its refund on the ground that Baltimore City\u2019s authority to impose the admissions and amusement tax in question was limited by T-G section 4\u2014103(b)(4)(i):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-4\">(b) <em>Counties and municipal </em>corporations.\u2014The admissions and amusement tax may not be imposed by a county or municipal corporation on gross receipts: ... (4) derived from any charge for admission or for merchandise, refreshments, or a service, if the gross receipts are used exclusively for: (i) a charitable, educational, or religious purpose ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Hopkins has a National College Athletic Association (\u201cNCAA\u201d) Division I lacrosse program. Men\u2019s and women\u2019s home lacrosse games are played at Homewood Field, which is located on Hopkins\u2019s campus, in Baltimore City. The field is surrounded by a rubberized jogging track. Seating is by bleachers.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Like crab cakes, the Orioles, Old Bay seasoning, and Berger Cookies, men\u2019s lacrosse is quintessential to Baltimore City\u2019s culture.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On average, about 1,000 students attend each home men\u2019s lacrosse game. NCAA rules allow Hopkins to charge non-students a price of admission to its Division I lacrosse games, and the Baltimore men\u2019s lacrosse fan base generates a market.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Every year, the gross receipts from Hopkins\u2019s men\u2019s lacrosse games total about $140,000. Of that sum, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>around $100,000 is spent to cover the costs of the games (such as security, public address announcers, ticket takers, stadium cleaning, and field lining and preparation), and the remaining approximately $40,000 is deposited with the Hopkins Athletic Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">At the end of a given year, that money is transferred to the account of \u201cHomewood Student Affairs.\u201d It is spent to make repairs to Homewood Field, repair and replace the jogging-track, and, every 8 to 10 years, replace the artificial turf. That turf was installed originally because it is a safer surface for the athletes than grass (or lesser grades of artificial turf). Turf replacement costs about $1.2 million dollars. Because the receipts in question only cover about 30% of that amount, the remainder is paid by the University. The rubberized jogging track also was installed for safety purposes, not only because it is easier on runners\u2019 legs but also because the University discourages its students from jogging in surrounding neighborhoods, where traffic and security are problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Homewood Field is Hopkins\u2019s primary athletic venue. In addition to lacrosse, it is used for intercollegiate football, field hockey, and soccer. It also is used for intramural athletics, club athletics, fraternity games, graduation and other recognition ceremonies, ROTC training, and homecoming activities. The field is lighted, and the jogging track is used by faculty and students about 20 hours a day. (The track can be used when the field is in use, although the track is not available during intercollegiate sporting events.)</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">According to Mr. Calder, athletics of all sorts, including intercollegiate sports, are an important part of the educational function of the University. The mission statement of the Department of Athletics and Recreation states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">The Department of Athletics and Recreation provides a broad program of sports and fitness activities for both men and women of all ability levels in order to enhance the quality of life of the Johns Hopkins community. Our programs develop the physical, social, educational, and emotional skills of the Johns Hopkins community at a level of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>excellence which compliments the high academic standard of the University.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Mr. Calder explained that, although Hopkins students are not required to participate in athletics, sports is used at the University as a vehicle for teaching leadership, good citizenship, discipline, action under pressure, teamwork, and perseverance, all important aspects of education.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">There also was evidence that the Comptroller had deemed Hopkins excluded from paying real property taxes on Home-wood Field, and from paying sales tax; that under 26 U.S.C. section 501(c)(3), Hopkins is classified as a non-profit educational organization exempt from federal taxes, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 501(a); and that Hopkins\u2019s athletic program is subject to the prohibitions against gender discrimination set forth in Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 373, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681-1688.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">In response to the University\u2019s refund request, field auditors employed by the Comptroller investigated and prepared a Field Audit Report. The auditors recommended granting the refund. Thereafter, by letter of April 23, 2005, Theresa Trentler denied the refund request. She did so, in her words, \u201cbecause the gross receipts taken in from intercollegiate athletic activities were not exclusively for educational purposes.\u201d Hopkins petitioned the Comptroller to reverse that decision. On January 9, 2006, a hearing on the matter was held before a hearing officer for the Comptroller. A month later, the hearing officer issued a written decision finding Hopkins\u2019s \u201cgross receipts from admissions to intercollegiate athletic events subject to the admissions and amusement tax ... in that the gross receipts are not used exclusively lor an educational purpose!,]\u201d and upholding the denial of the refund claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Before the Tax Court, Ms. Trentler testified that, in her 18 years as Refund Supervisor for the Comptroller, it had been the Comptroller\u2019s policy that \u201cintercollegiate athletics are not considered educational!,]\u201d regardless of what the receipts are spent on. Later she clarified that testimony somewhat, saying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>that it is the longstanding policy of the Comptroller that as long as the gross receipts from intercollegiate sporting events go to a college or university\u2019s athletic department, they are non-educational in purpose, no matter what they are spent on. She assumed, in so explaining, that the gross receipts from Hopkins\u2019s intercollegiate contests would be used to pay for the University\u2019s intercollegiate programs. She acknowledged that, under the Comptroller\u2019s longstanding policy, intramural college sports activities <em>do </em>serve an educational purpose. Thus, if the gross receipts in question had been paid for admissions to a Hopkins intramural lacrosse game, they would not have been taxable.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">The Tax Court judge ruled from the bench that Hopkins was entitled to the admissions and amusement tax refund. He explained that it was not necessary to decide whether the gross receipts from the men\u2019s intercollegiate lacrosse games were used exclusively for educational purposes, because Homewood Field is used not only for intercollegiate but also for intramural games and for other educational purposes, such as ROTC exercises and graduation ceremonies. Relying upon interpretations of the word \u201cexclusively\u201d in other Maryland taxing statutes as meaning \u201cprimarily,\u201d the Tax Court ruled that it was sufficient that the gross receipts at issue were used primarily for educational purposes, and granted the refund on that basis. <em>See, e.g., Friends School v. Supervisor of Assessments of Baltimore City, </em>314 Md. 194, 201 n. 3, 550 A.2d 657 (1988) (\u201cThe requirement of exclusive use may genei'ally be satisfied by a showing that the property is used \u2018primarily\u2019 for exemption purposes, with only incidental or occasional use for other purposes.\u201d). A written order was filed on October 30, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">The Comptroller filed an action for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. On May 23, 2007, the court entered an order reversing and remanding the case to the Tax Court with instructions to decide whether the \u201cexpenditures on intercollegiate athletics amount to an educational purpose.\u201d On remand, on July 25, 2007, the Tax Court judge issued a written order stating that \u201cthe gross receipts in question, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>which were used in part for intercollegiate athletics at the school, were used exclusively in furtherance of the education of the students.\u201d On March 28, 2008, in a second action for judicial review brought by the Comptroller, the circuit court affirmed the Tax Court\u2019s decision. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">We shall include additional facts as necessary to our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">(A)</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The Comptroller of the Treasury is a \u201ctax collector\u201d responsible for collecting most Maryland taxes, including the admissions and amusement tax. T-G \u00a7 13\u201410.1(c)(2)(f) (defining \u201ctax collector\u201d to include the Comptroller). The Comptroller also is a \u201ctax determining agency,\u201d that is, \u201ca governmental unit of the State that is authorized to make the final decision or issue the final order about a tax issue within the jurisdiction of the Tax Court, before the decision may be appealed to the Tax Court.\u201d T-G \u00a7 13\u2014501(c)(1). If an application for a refund of admissions and amusement taxes paid is timely filed with the Comptroller, the Comptroller or a designated employee promptly must hold an informal hearing, act on the application (which may include assessing additional tax, penalty, and interest), and mail notice of the final determination to the applicant. T-G \u00a7 13-508(c). An assessment of a tax under the Tax-General Article \u201cis prima facie correct.\u201d T-G \u00a7 13-411.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">The final decision of the Comptroller on, among other things, an application for refund of admissions and amusement taxes paid, may be appealed by an aggrieved party to the Tax Court. T-G \u00a7 13-510(a). The Tax Court is an independent statewide administrative agency, established by T-G section 3-102. Pursuant to T-G section 3-103(a),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-9\">[t]he Tax Court has jurisdiction to hear appeals from the final decision, final determination, or final order of a property tax assessment appeal board or any other unit of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>State government or of a political subdivision of the State that is authorized to make the final decision or determination or issue the final order about any tax issue, including: (1) the valuation, assessment, or classification of property; (2) the imposition of a tax; (3) the determination of a claim for refund; (4) the application for an abatement, reduction, or revision of any assessment or tax; or (5) the application for an exemption from any assessment or tax.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Appeals to the Tax Court proceed <em>de novo. </em>T-G \u00a7 13-523. Although the Tax Court is not actually a court, as it is an agency within the Executive Branch of State government, it acts in a quasi-judicial capacity, making factual findings and adjudicating disputes. <em>Foss NIRSystems, Inc. v. Comptroller of the </em>Treasury, 151 Md.App. 44, 51-53, 822 A.2d 1297 (2003). \u201cProceedings in the Tax Court are governed by [T-G sections] 13-514 to 13-529, which provide a party with the procedural rights to a prompt hearing, to appear before the Tax Court <em>pro se </em>or represented by counsel, to introduce evidence, subpoena witnesses, and conduct depositions, and to submit certain fact issues for resolution by a jury.\u201d <em>Knoche v. State, </em>171 Md.App. 209, 218, 908 A.2d 1247 (2006). The Tax Court\u2019s functions thus resemble court proceedings, even though they are not. <em>White v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>282 Md. 641, 658, 387 A.2d 260 (1978); <em>Shell Oil Co. v. Supervisor of Assessments of Prince George\u2019s County, </em>276 Md. 36, 47, 343 A.2d 521 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">The Tax Court \u201cmay reassess or reclassify, abate, modify, change or alter any valuation, assessment, classification, tax or final order\u201d appealed to it. T-G \u00a7 13-528(a)(2). However, \u201c[a]bsent affirmative evidence in support of the relief being sought or an error apparent on the face of the proceeding from which the appeal is taken, the decision, determination, or order from which the appeal [to the Tax Court] is taken shall be affirmed.\u201d T-G \u00a7 13-528(b). The Tax Court must issue a \u201cwritten order that sets forth its decision.\u201d T-G \u00a7 13-529(a). T-G section 13-532(a) makes a final decision of the Tax Court subject to judicial review in the circuit court pursuant to sections 10-222 and 10-223 of the State Government Article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>(\u201cSG\u201d); and that court\u2019s judgment is subject to appellate review in this Court. SG \u00a7 10~223(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">Because the Tax Court is an administrative agency, its decisions are reviewed under the same appellate standards generally applied to agency decisions. <em>SDAT v. Consolidation Coal Sales Co., </em>382 Md. 439, 453, 855 A.2d 1197 (2004). We review the decision of the Tax Court, not the ruling of the circuit court on judicial review. <em>Comptroller v. Clise Coal, Inc., </em>173 Md.App. 689, 696-97, 920 A.2d 561 (2007). The Tax Court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for substantial evidence in the record. <em>Id. </em>at 697, 920 A.2d 561; SG \u00a7 10-222(h)(3)(v). Under the substantial evidence test, a factual finding must be upheld if it is such that a reasoning mind reasonably could have found it from the agency record (here, the evidence before the Tax Court). <em>Dep\u2019t of Natural Res. v. Heller, </em>391 Md. 148, 166, 892 A.2d 497 (2006); <em>Md. Aviation Admin. v. Noland, </em>386 Md. 556, 571, 873 A.2d 1145 (2005). Even if the Tax Court does not state the reasons for its decision, reversal is not required \u201cif the record discloses substantial evidence supporting the decision.\u201d <em>Bethlehem Steel Corp. v. Supervisor of Assessments of Baltimore County, </em>38 Md.App. 543, 546, 381 A.2d 1185 (1978) (Wilner, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Likewise, we review the Tax Court\u2019s mixed findings of fact and law for substantial evidence in the agency record. \u201c[D]eterminations involving mixed questions of fact and law must be affirmed if, after deferring to the Tax Court\u2019s expertise and to the presumption that the decision is correct, \u2018a reasoning mind could have reached the Tax Court\u2019s conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>NCR Corp. v. Comptroller, </em>313 Md. 118, 133-34, 544 A.2d 764 (1988) (in turn quoting <em>Comptroller v. NCR, </em>71 Md.App. 116, 133, 524 A.2d 93 (1987)). We are not so constrained in our review of the Tax Court\u2019s decisions of law. <em>Ramsay, Scarlett &amp; Co. v. Comptroller, </em>302 Md. 825, 834, 490 A.2d 1296 (1985). Ordinarily, that review is <em>de novo. SDAT v. Consumer Programs, Inc., </em>331 Md. 68, 72, 626 A.2d 360 (1993). Yet, \u201c \u2018[e]ven with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>the administrative agency. Thus, an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Noland, supra, </em>386 Md. at 572, 873 A.2d 1145 (quoting <em>Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 69, 729 A.2d 376 (1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">(B)</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">In their arguments before the Tax Court, the parties both referred to two decades-old Maryland Executive Branch decisions about admissions and amusement taxes on gross receipts collected from intercollegiate sporting events. The parties devote much of their argument in this Court to those deci- ' sions, as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">In 1950, Attorney General Hall Hammond (later Associate Judge and then Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals) responded to a question posed by the Comptroller as to whether Western Maryland College (now McDaniel College) should be \u201cexempted\u201d \u201cfrom the necessity of collecting an admissions tax on the sale of tickets to College football games on the ground that the proceeds derived thereby are used exclusively for educational purposes,\u201d within the meaning of a predecessor statute to T-G section 4-103(b)(4)(i).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Attorney General answered that the College was not \u201cexempted\u201d from paying the admissions and amusement tax for gross receipts from intercollegiate football games:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-7\">When the word \u201ceducation,\u201d as used in [the statute] is considered with due regard to the canon of construction that tax exemptions are to be construed strictly against the taxpayer, we do not think that it can be said that the Legislature intended to exempt gross receipts derived from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>the sale of tickets to intercollegiate athletic contests from the admissions tax. While a program of physical education in modern educational thinking is as essential as training in purely academic and technical subjects, it seems to us that it would unduly strain the ordinary and usual meaning of the word \u201ceducational\u201d to include intercollegiate athletic contests. Our opinion might be otherwise were the proceeds derived from the sale of tickets to athletic contests used by Western Maryland to purchase equipment and to defray the other necessary expenses of a program of intermural [sic] athletic contests or physical education to individual students. We do not believe, however, that when these gross receipts are used to defray expenses of intercollegiate athletic contests that they may be properly said to be tax exempt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AaR\"><em>35 Op. Md. Atty. Gen. </em>304, 308 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">In so concluding, the Attorney General relied upon the dissenting opinion in <em>Page v. Regents, </em>93 F.2d 887 (5th Cir. 1937), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, sub. nom. Allen v. Regents, </em>304 U.S. 439, 58 S.Ct. 980, 82 L.Ed. 1448 (1938). The Fifth Circuit majority in <em>Page </em>held that receipts from intercollegiate football games were not subject to the federal admissions tax because the games were educational activities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-5\">Great judgment is necessary to prevent the stimulus of publicity from becoming too great, lest the athletic tail be found wagging the dog of mental culture in the schools, but in principal the public exhibition of the best in athletics is not different from the school exhibitions of our boyhood or from the honors and speakerships at commencements of most colleges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">93 F.2d at 892. The dissenter in <em>Page, </em>apparently a firm believer in the \u201civory tower\u201d model of higher education, complained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\">My associates, apparently to their own satisfaction, have rationalized themselves into the frame of mind to believe and to say that these modern gladiatorial spectacles, conducted in vast and costly amphitheatres, for the excitement and amusement of the American public, all present being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>keyed to a pitch and under a tension wholly foreign to that ordinarily associated with academic and educational pursuits, are an essential part of higher education in Georgia, and, as such, a governmental function of that State. They have not rationalized me into that frame of mind; I cannot rationalize myself into it. It seems to me that the mental processes by which the din and delight, the struggle and stress, the flying arms and legs, the alternate tangles and extrications, and all the heady actions of an intercollegiate football game, are envisioned as higher education, are a \u201creductio ad absurdum\u201d of even modern higher educational theory. They seem to me in the slangy but expressive vernacular common in the stadiums, to \u201ctake higher education for a ride.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 895. The Attorney General opined that his office \u201csubscribe[d] to the views of [the dissenting judge in <em>Page </em>] without, however, indicating that we believe that his colorful language describes the part which intercollegiate athletic contests play in the program of education of Western Maryland College.\u201d 35 <em>Op. Md. Atty. Gen. </em>at 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Twenty-five years after the 1950 Attorney General opinion, and 40 years after the precedents upon which it relied, the \u2022 Maryland Tax Court ruled, in <em>Naval Academy Athletic Association v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>1977 WL 1568 (Md.Tax 1977), that gross receipts derived from admissions to Navy men\u2019s intercollegiate football and lacrosse games are devoted exclusively to educational purposes, and therefore are \u201cexempt\u201d from the State admissions and amusement tax.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The facts adduced before the Tax Court showed that the gross receipts in question not only were used to pay the costs of the games but also were spent to \u201cloan money to various athletic coaches, pay the salaries of certain of the coaches of intercollegiate athletic teams, ... maintain a fund for entertaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>coaches, their spouses and visiting school officials [and on] travel, promotion, recruitment, entertainment, advertisement, hotel and meals, equipment and administration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *1.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">The Tax Court disagreed with the 1950 Attorney General opinion insofar as it used \u201cthe extent of financial support given to the [school] from the gross receipts derived [ ] from the contest\u201d as the sole gauge of whether those receipts were devoted exclusively to an educational purpose. <em>Id. </em>at *2. \u201c[I]t is equally important to consider the benefits derived by the participants and/or the spectators\u201d in deciding whether such gross receipts are devoted exclusively to an educational purpose. <em>Id. </em>The Tax Court emphasized that students at the Naval Academy are required to participate in either intramural or intercollegiate athletics; and that, unlike most colleges and universities, the Naval Academy \u201cis charged with the responsibility of educating men and women to create career oriented professional line officers,\u201d so the \u201cschool must concern itself with both the physical and mental development of its midshipmen.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">The Comptroller petitioned for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. That court affirmed the Tax Court\u2019s ruling. The Comptroller did not note an appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">(C)</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">In the case at bar, the Comptroller contends the Tax Court committed legal error by misinterpreting the meanings of \u201cexclusively\u201d and \u201ceducational purpose\u201d in T-G section 4-103(b)(4)(i), and that we should engage in a <em>de novo </em>review of that decision. It maintains that it, not the Tax Court, is the unit of government that administers the Maryland tax code, insofar as the admissions and amusement tax is concerned, and that its longstanding interpretation of \u201ceducational purpose\u201d as not encompassing intercollegiate athletic contests should be accorded deference by this Court. It also argues that, to the extent the Tax Court in the <em>Naval Academy </em>case recognized a limited situation in which intercollegiate sports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>serve an exclusively educational purpose\u2014that is, when courses in athletics are required by the school\u2014that circumstance does not apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Hopkins counters that the Tax Court\u2019s finding in this case that the gross receipts from ticket sales to the men\u2019s lacrosse games are used exclusively for an educational purpose was factual, and therefore is subject to review for substantial evidence in the record. It asserts that, from the facts in evidence before the Tax Court, in particular the testimony of Mr. Calder, and even taking into account the legal presumption that the Comptroller\u2019s decision to deny the claimed refund was correct, a reasoning mind reasonably could find that intercollegiate lacrosse serves an \u201ceducational purpose\u201d at Hopkins and that the gross receipts in question were used exclusively for that purpose.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Further, Hopkins implicitly takes the position that the Tax Court is the agency charged with interpreting the admissions and amusement tax statute, and that, to the extent this Court is to give weight to any administrative body\u2019s interpretation of that statute, weight should be accorded to the decision of the Tax Court, not to the longstanding policy of the Comptroller.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">In <em>Charles County Department of Social Services v. Vann, </em>382 Md. 286, 855 A.2d 313 (2004), in the course of holding that \u201cwhen, in the course of administering corporal punishment, the child disobeys the parent and consequently is injured is patently a mixed question of law and fact[,]\u201d <em>id. </em>at 297, 855 A.2d 313, the Court of Appeals clearly explained what a \u201cmixed question of law and fact\u201d is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-6\">[Some] agency decisions fall within categories that are neither legal conclusions nor factual findings, <em>see. e.g., Spencer [v. Board of Pharmacy], </em>380 Md. 515, 846 A.2d 341 [ (2004),] (explaining judicial review over discretionary functions of the agency), <em>and some fall within both. These </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number><em>latter sort commonly are knoivn as \u201cmixed questions of law and fact\u201d or application of law to facts: </em>The agency has correctly stated the law and its fact-finding is supported by the record, but the question is whether it has applied the law to the facts correctly. When the agency decision being judicially reviewed is a mixed question of law and fact, the reviewing court applies the substantial evidence test, that is, the same standard of review it would apply to an agency factual finding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">382 Md. at 296, 855 A.2d 313 (emphasis added). In so explaining, the <em>Vann </em>Court relied upon <em>Ramsay, Scarlett v. Comptroller, supra, </em>302 Md. 825, 490 A.2d 1296, a Tax Court review decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-6\">In <em>Ramsay </em>..., we addressed the standard of review of an administrative agency decision. The Court of Special Appeals had held that the taxing authority\u2019s determination on whether a particular corporation was unitary or binary was a conclusion of law, subject to <em>de novo </em>judicial review. We disagreed and held that the question was rather the application of the law to the \u201cestablished evidence\u201d in the record. Finding no disagreement between the court and the agency regarding the applicable law, we noted the distinction was really about the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-7\">\u201cproper application [of the governing law] to the established evidence of record.... Whether a business is unitary or separate and distinct for tax purposes ... is not solely a question of law; rather, the issue for purposes of appellate review ... is governed by whether, in light of substantial evidence appearing in the record, a reasoning mind could reasonably have reached the conclusion reached by the Tax Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">382 Md. at 297-98, 855 A.2d 313 (quoting <em>Ramsay, supra, </em>302 Md. at 837-38, 490 A.2d 1296). The <em>Vann </em>Court noted that deferential \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d review of an agency\u2019s decision on a mixed question of law and fact \u201cis appropriate in order for the agency to fulfill its mandate and exercise its expertise.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 298, 855 A.2d 313. <em>See also Thames Point </em>Assocs. <em>v. Supervisor of Assessments, </em>68 Md.App. 1, 509 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>1207 (1986) (holding that whether a condominium is substantially completed is a mixed question of law and fact subject to substantial evidence review).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">In the case at bar, the question before the Tax Court\u2014whether the gross receipts from ticket sales to Hopkins intercollegiate men\u2019s lacrosse games are used exclusively for an educational purpose\u2014likewise was a mixed question of law and fact. As we have observed, the first-level facts in this case were not in dispute. And, after the matter was remanded by the circuit court in the first action for judicial review, the Tax Court\u2019s decision was not a pure exercise in statutory interpretation of the word \u201cexclusively,\u201d which ordinarily would be subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>See, e.g., Comptroller v. Sci. Applications Int'l Corp., </em>405 Md. 185, 197-204, 950 A.2d 766 (2008) (applying <em>de novo </em>review to statutory interpretation in tax case); <em>United States v. Ambrose, </em>403 Md. 425, 942 A.2d 755 (2008) (statutory interpretation a question of law). Rather, the Tax Court was deciding the question before it by applying the law to the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">We disagree with the Comptroller that, on our review of the Tax Court\u2019s decision on this mixed question of law and fact, we should take into account and defer to the expertise of the Comptroller, which for decades has acted as the tax collector for Baltimore City (and other counties) for admissions and amusement taxes on the gross receipts from intercollegiate athletic contests. To be sure, and as noted, the Comptroller is a \u201ctax determining agency,\u201d that is, a \u201cgovernmental unit of the State that is authorized to make the final decision or issue the final order about a tax issue within the jurisdiction of the Tax Court, before the decision may be appealed to the Tax Court[,]\u201d T-G \u00a7 13-501(c); and the Tax Court, in deciding the case at bar, was bound to presume that the Comptroller\u2019s decision was correct. Nevertheless, on substantial evidence review of the Tax Court\u2019s decision on a mixed question of law and fact, we give deference to the Tax Court\u2019s application of T-G section 4-103(b)(4)(i), not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Comptroller\u2019s, as the Tax Court is the agency charged with interpreting and applying the Maryland tax code.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">As already mentioned, in the <em>Naval Academy </em>case, in deciding whether Navy\u2019s intercollegiate athletic contests furthered an educational purpose of the school, the Tax Court rejected the notion of a single-factor application of T-G section 4-103(b)(4)(i). Instead, the Tax Court considered not only the financial benefit to the school but also the non-financial benefits to the school and the benefits to the athletes and the spectators from the intercollegiate athletic contests. The court took into account that intercollegiate athletes at the Naval Academy could satisfy their physical education course requirements by playing on the intercollegiate teams; that the high level of student participation (50%) created an \u201cesprit de corps\u201d beneficial to all of the midshipmen; that athletic competition \u201cdevelops and fosters such desirable military qualities as perseverance, the ability to plan strategy, the ability to keep cool and think clearly under pressure, confidence, aggressiveness, determination, discipline, the will to win, and submission to the rules of the game\u201d; and that the IRS had granted the Naval Academy an exemption from income tax based on its educational status. 1977 WL 1568 at *2. The Tax Court also noted the weakness in the 1950 Attorney General opinion to the extent that it would recognize intramural athletics, but not intercollegiate athletics, as educational in purpose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\">Similar to providing more challenging academic courses to those with greater [aptitude], intercollegiate athletics offer gifted athletes a level of competition otherwise unavailable. Intercollegiate athletics is a natural and logical extension of the intramural program.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">The Tax Court thus engaged in a totality of the circumstances assessment of who and/or what was benefited from the gross receipts, and how the benefits were derived. Read in the context of what little Maryland law existed at the time, namely the 1950 Attorney General opinion, the Tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Court\u2019s decision in the <em>Naval Academy </em>case was not limiting-in nature; it was expansive. We disagree with the Comptroller\u2019s argument that the Tax Court ruled in the <em>Naval Academy </em>case that a university or college <em>must </em>require physical education as part of its curriculum for its intercollegiate athletic contests to be deemed \u201cexclusively for an educational purpose.\u201d The Tax Court took note of the Naval Academy\u2019s physical education requirement as one factor to be considered in deciding whether the gross receipts from Navy intercollegiate lacrosse games derived from activities exclusively for an educational purpose. Thus, the Tax Court\u2019s decision in the case at bar did not disregard or contradict its 1977 application of Article 81, section 406, containing the identical \u201ceducational purpose\u201d language as now appears in T-G section 4-103(b)(4)(i).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">There is substantial evidence in the record before the Tax Court in this case to support its conclusion that the gross receipts from the Hopkins men\u2019s intercollegiate lacrosse games were used exclusively for an educational purpose. The evidence showed that the gross receipts were used to benefit the University, the intercollegiate athletes, other non-participating students, and spectators of the sport. All of the net <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>proceeds, that is, about $40,000 per year for the three years in question, were spent directly on the cost of maintaining and repairing Homewood Field. The field is used by all students and their families for commencement exercises, which are plainly educational in nature, and is used by some of the students for ROTC and for intramural games. As noted above, intramural athletic contests always have been treated by the Maryland taxing authorities and the Tax Court as educational in purpose. The jogging track is used by students and faculty nearly 24 hours a day. No profits from the ticket sales were applied to more tangentially educational activities such as the entertainment, travel, and promotional costs the Tax Court considered educational in purpose in the <em>Naval Academy </em>case. Nor were any profits spent to pay for uniforms and equipment for the intercollegiate lacrosse athletes. Indeed, in the case at bar, the Comptroller effectively agreed that, to the extent the net profits from the intercollegiate lacrosse ticket sales were spent to maintain and repair Home-wood Field and the jogging track around it, that part of the gross receipts was used for educational purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The $100,000 remainder of the gross receipts was pre-profit, <em>i.e., </em>it was the money used to pay for the costs of the games themselves. The use of those receipts raises more directly the question whether, on the evidence here, the intercollegiate men\u2019s lacrosse contests further the educational purposes of Hopkins as an institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The evidence before the Tax Court showed that about 50% of the students at Hopkins are involved in athletics of some sort; as Mr. Calder put it, \u201canything from varsity athletics through recreation, club sports, intramurals, using the recreation center and taking ... recreational classes there.\u201d The University has 26 varsity sports teams, all Division III except for the two lacrosse teams, and about 20% of the students participate in these intercollegiate games. There are about 600 total intercollegiate athletes at Hopkins. Mr. Calder testified that athletics in general is an important component of the University\u2019s educational program, commenting that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>[p]art of the things that we try to teach our athletes are leadership, thinking under pressure, dealing with all kinds of adversarial things that can happen during games. And I think that\u2019s a major part of what we\u2019re trying to reach and teach our other students also.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">When asked whether intercollegiate sports, including lacrosse, serve an educational purpose at Hopkins, Mr. Calder replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-5\">Yes, they do. As a matter of fact, I was evaluating my lacrosse coach this morning.... He talked about a big part of his philosophy is leadership, which is a major push by the University\u2019s dealing with leadership too. They [the student athletes] learn all kinds of things during the games, especially being able to compete and handle situations where you have to think very quickly. It\u2019s something, again, that the University really, really wants all of our students, not only the athletes, to be able to do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Mr. Calder further testified that it is the stated goal of the President of the University to have athletic programs that are as highly ranked as the school\u2019s academic programs; that intercollegiate home men\u2019s lacrosse games in particular are very well attended by students, faculty, staff, and alumni so as to \u201ccreate a lot of school spirit on campus\u201d; that the Pep Band, which is part of the University\u2019s Music Department, plays at the games; and that students who participate in athletics, and intercollegiate sports in particular, develop qualities that make them desirable to hire and student athletes draw employers to campus for hiring. Mr. Calder stated that the student athletes have higher graduation rates and grade point averages than the overall student population and that \u201cquite a few\u201d are serving in the military post-graduation. He opined that the character traits the Tax Court had found to be important for the educational mission of the Naval Academy\u2014 such as determination, confidence, discipline, perseverance\u2014\u25a0 are important for success not only in athletics but also after graduation, in the world of competition, military or nonmilitary.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>The Tax Court judge reasonably could conclude from this evidence that all of the profits from the gross receipts in question are spent to support programs and events that even the Comptroller conceded are educational in purpose (in particular, to maintain and repair the field that is used for intramural sports and other educational activities); at Hopkins, the athletes who participate in intercollegiate sports, especially lacrosse, learn skills and behaviors that enable them to achieve academically, while in school, and in the world of competition, after school; the same educational purposes served by intramural sports are served by intercollegiate sports, in particular lacrosse, except that the level of play is higher and more competitive; men\u2019s intercollegiate lacrosse games are integral to Hopkins\u2019s school identity; and the federal government has recognized that intercollegiate athletics at Hopkins serve an educational purpose. The record thus contains substantial evidence to support the Tax Court\u2019s mixed finding of law and fact that the gross receipts generated from ticket sales to Hopkins\u2019s men\u2019s intercollegiate lacrosse games are used exclusively for an educational purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.
