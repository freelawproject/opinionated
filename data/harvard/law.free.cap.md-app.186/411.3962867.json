Cohn\u2014challenge the Maryland Tax Court\u2019s ruling that upheld the imposition of inheritance taxes upon several gifts made by Dr. Cohn during the two years preceding his death. The controlling question is whether the Tax Court correctly interpreted and applied the statute that extends the Maryland inheritance tax to inter vivos gifts which were \u201cmade in contemplation of death.\u201d We shall hold that there is substantial evidence in the record to support the Tax Court\u2019s finding that the gifts made by Dr. Cohn were made in contemplation of death. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, which affirmed the ruling of the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">Key Statutory Provisions</p>\n<p id=\"b435-12\">Section 7-202 of Md.Code (1988, 2004 Repl. Vol.), Tax-General Article (\u201cTG\u201d), establishes an inheritance tax, and provides that, subject to certain exemptions that have no application to the present case, \u201ca tax is imposed on the privilege of receiving property that passes from a decedent and has a taxable situs in the State.\u201d The phrase \u201cproperty that passes from a decedent\u201d is defined in TG \u00a7 7-201(d)(l)(iii) to include donative transfers \u201cmade in contemplation of death\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>(d) <em>Property that passes from a </em>decedent.\u2014(1) \u201cProperty that passes from a decedent\u201d includes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-5\">\u2756 \u2756 \u2756</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">(iii) except for a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money\u2019s worth, property that passes by an inter vivos transfer by a decedent, in trust or otherwise, if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-7\">1. the transfer is made in contemplation of death;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQq\">[or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-9\">2. the transfer of a material part of the property of the decedent in the nature of a final disposition or distribution is made by the decedent within 2 years before death and is not shown to not have been made in contemplation of death;....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">Facts and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b436-12\">Following the death of Dr. Cohn, the Register of Wills for Montgomery County concluded that certain gifts made by the doctor during the last two years of his life were subject to the inheritance tax because those gifts were within the ambit of TG \u00a7 7-201(d)(l)(iii). Following a de novo hearing, the Tax Court upheld the ruling of the register of wills.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-13\">The gifts that are the subject of this dispute were made on two separate dates. On August 1, 2002, at the age of 87, Dr. Cohn transferred to his two nephews \u00e1n ownership interest in a limited partnership that was an investment holding company that owned primarily municipal bonds. The total value of the interest given to the two nephews on the date of the transfer was $861,668, such that the value of each gift to a nephew was $430,834. On January 15, 2003, Dr. Cohn made a gift of $55,000 to each of his seven great-nieces and great-nephews by establishing tuition savings accounts known as \u201c529 Plans\u201d to fund the children\u2019s education. The total amount of these seven gifts was $385,000. .</p>\n<p id=\"b437-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Shortly after undergoing surgery for an incarcerated hernia in November 2003, Dr. Cohn suffered a heart attack and died on November 22, 2003, at the age of 88. His two nephews, David Siegel and Robert Siegel, were appointed co-personal representatives of Dr. Cohn\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">In connection with the administration of the estate, the nephews filed with the Register of Wills for Montgomery County an information report that required an answer to the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\">Except for a bona fide sale or transfer to a person exempted from inheritance tax pursuant to [Maryland] Code, Tax General Article, [Section] 7-203, within two years before death did the decedent make any transfer of any material part of the decedent\u2019s pr[o]perty in the nature of a final disposition or distribution, including any transfer that resulted in joint ownership of property?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The nephews answered \u201cYes\u201d to the question, and listed the two gifts of limited partnership interests made August 1, 2002, as well as the seven gifts made to establish the 529 Plans on January 15, 2003. But the co-personal representatives also attached to the information report a memorandum in which they argued to the register of wills that no inheritance tax should be assessed on account of these gifts. They pointed out that their uncle, the decedent, \u201cdespite being 87 at the time of the gifts (he was 88 at the time of death in November, 2003) was in good health. There was no suggestion that his time of death was approaching.\u201d Further, they noted that he did not need the assets he gave away; \u201cit is expected that the total value [of the estate] will exceed $2 million, more than sufficient to meet his personal financial obligations.\u201d Their argument continued: \u201cConsidering the decedent\u2019s overall net worth and taking each gift separately, none can be considered to be a gift of a material portion of the decedent\u2019s estate.\u201d Further, they pointed out, \u201c[e]ven if\u2019 any of the gifts could be \u201cconsidered \u2018material,\u2019 the inheritance tax can only be assessed against the transfers if they were made by the decedent in contemplation of his death.\u201d The establishment of the seven college savings plans was based upon a desire to enable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>the contributions to grow income tax free, they said, and \u201c[b]y taking advantage of this provision of the federal tax law, the decedent was able to set aside additional funds for the anticipated college education costs of his family members.\u201d And even though the two gifts to the decedent\u2019s nephews were more substantial in amount, \u201c[t]aken separately[,] each gift [of a limited partnership interest] represented a transfer of less than approximately 18% of the decedent\u2019s net worth at the time of the gift.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Moreover, the memorandum stated, \u201cit can be established that neither gift was made with any apprehension of an impending death. The decedent passed away from a sudden heart attack at the age of 88,\u201d but \u201c[p]rior to his death the decedent enjoyed an active life....\u201d There was a life purpose for Dr. Cohn to make the gifts, the nephews asserted: \u201cThe motivation of the gifts was to share with his family some of the financial success that the decedent had accumulated during his life. [Making t]he gifts during his lifetime allowed the decedent the opportunity to enjoy these family members\u2019 financial security provided in part by his generosity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">The register of wills rejected the arguments made by the co-personal representatives, and, pursuant to TG \u00a7 7-214, sent them an invoice for inheritance taxes due at the rate of 11.1111% of the value of the gifts that had been listed on the information report. On July 22, 2004, the estate paid $95,740.79 on account of the transfers of the limited partnership interests, and $42,777.74 on account of the transfers to the 529 Plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">The co-personal representatives then filed a claim for a refund of the $188,518.53 in taxes they claimed to have \u201cerroneously paid,\u201d arguing to the register of wills once again that the transfers were not subject to the inheritance tax. The register denied the refund claim, stating \u201cwe believe that the tax was properly assessed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">At that point, the co-personal representatives appealed to the Maryland Tax Court, seeking a reversal of the register\u2019s ruling. <em>See </em>TG \u00a7 13-510(a)(3) (an aggrieved party \u201cmay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>appeal to the Tax Court from ... an inheritance tax determination by a register\u201d). Despite its name, the Tax Court is not part of the Maryland judicial branch, but is an administrative agency that is part of the executive branch. <em>See </em>TG \u00a7\u00a7 3-101 <em>et seq. </em>In <em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. Johns Hopkins Univ., </em>186 Md.App. 169, 179-81, 973 A.2d 256 (2009), Judge Deborah S. Eyler outlined in detail the procedures governing appeals to the Tax Court and judicial review of that agency\u2019s decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">One distinctive aspect of appeals to the Tax Court is the limitation on its powers to alter the order that is the subject of its review, as set forth in TG \u00a7 13-528, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyB\">\u00a7 13-528. Disposition of cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">(a) Potvers.\u2014(1) The Tax Court shall have full power to hear, try, determine, or remand any matter before it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">(2) In exercising these powers, the Tax Court may reassess or reclassify, abate, modify, change or alter any valuation, assessment, classification, tax or final order appealed to the Tax Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-7\">(b) <em>Limitation on </em>potvers.\u2014Absent affirmative evidence in support of the relief being sought or an error apparent on the face of the proceeding from which the appeal is taken, the decision, determination, or order from which the appeal is taken shall be affirmed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">During the course of the de novo hearing before the Tax Court, the co-personal representatives offered evidence that Dr. Cohn was not contemplating his imminent death at the time he made either of the inter vivos transfers that had been taxed by the register. They offered testimony from his financial advisor and from his primary care physician. At the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing, the judge delivered an oral opinion affirming the ruling of the register that the gifts were taxable. The Tax Court judge explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-9\">[WJe\u2019ll start with the statute: It says, at least in terms of what I need to determine, was this a material gift? Was it done within two years of his passing? And was it done in contemplation of death? Well, some parts of that are easy. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>It was done within two years of his passing. That was the easy part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-4\">Was it material? Well, if you add all of the gifts to the great-nieces and nephews, together with the gift of the Partnership shares to the two nephews, we are looking at a total of approximately a Million Dollars. At the time that these gifts were put together, it appears that Doctor Cohn\u2019s estate\u2014well, I won\u2019t say estate\u2014his total assets, at that point, were something just over Two Million Dollars. So, yes, this is a material gift. By the time he passed away, his remaining assets seem to have been almost Two Million Dollars, I\u2019m assuming. Didn\u2019t have testimony at all that his remaining assets appreciated somewhat during those last two years of his life. But, yes, in my mind, that\u2019s more than sufficient for it to be a material gift.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-5\">The most significant issue, and what we talked about most of the time today, is whether or not this was done in contemplation of death. A very hard standard to try to deal \u2022with. Knowing what someone\u2019s motivations are when you can\u2019t talk to them is a difficult process. It certainly can be. The only way one can go to look at it is from circumstantial evidence from what the person was doing at the time, and what he had done in the past.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-6\">And then we\u2019ve had some discussion as to whether or not this was part of a lifetime of giving. Whether Doctor Cohn spent his entire life making donations or gifts to his family. And we had testimony that he made substantial\u2014though we didn\u2019t find exact amounts\u2014substantial gifts to both of his nephews for their college and graduate school educations. And we don\u2019t have a lot of gift giving happening, except for family events when people got married, until his eighties when there was some discussion about the donation of an interest in some sort of a Partnership that occurred more than two years prior to his death, so I don\u2019t get any information on it. But I am surmising that he was in his eighties at some point when that occurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">And then the gifts that were subject to today\u2019s hearing. I have a couple of things to say: The issue is contemplation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>death, not contemplation of imminent death. In spite of the fact that Doctor Cohn was in his eighties, I don\u2019t think he was contemplating imminent death. I don\u2019t believe that his doctors were contemplating imminent death, nor his family. That this heart attack was a bit of a surprise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-4\">And the other thing that I can say is that it appears that the\u2014well, clearly, there can be more than one motivation for any event. One of his motivations is that he wanted the education of his great-nieces and nephews assisted. I don\u2019t believe that Fifty-five Thousand Dollars will cover fully the cost of a four year education anymore, but at least he was doing his part to assist with this thing. Likewise, the donations of the Partnership shares to his nephews was because he wanted them to have the money. There\u2019s no other reason for making the donation, while the other reason, possibly. But that, clearly, was one of the reasons is he wanted them to have Four Hundred and Thirty Thousand Dollars worth of assets, more or less, for each of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-5\">Continuing, the statute puts the burden of proof on the Petitioners, if the gift is made within two years. Based on a couple of other facts about his life that I can tell, at the time these things occurred, he was more than eighty years old, he was suffering from increasing levels of dementia, but, according to the Doctor, he was able to function. In some ways, he was able to function quite well. He was highly interactive with members of the family and in the Assisted Care Facility. That he had a number of medical issues, but none of them were life threatening, and that family members had consulted with tax people and had determined that there were significant tax savings possibly made by making donations. That would, at least, prove to me that he knew that there was some possible tax savings to be made, not necessarily that was his prime motivation. And it also appears that he intended these dispositions to be final, that they were substituting in some part for doing it by way of a Will. That these were dispositions of funds that he did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>need. (INAUDIBLE) adequately took care of him financially through some other ways.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">But this appears to be not part of a longstanding regular program of gifts. That this was a fairly late arriving plan to dispose of his assets. And if there was any doubt in my mind, the burden of proof being on Petitioners would seal the deal that they had not met their burden of convincing me that these distributions were not part of\u2014were not in contemplation of death, at least as far as the statute\u2019s concerned. So I will be denying your request for a refund.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGL\">At this point in the proceedings, counsel for the nephews requested clarification on one issue, and the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: Your Honor, may I just ask you one thing for the record?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">[THE JUDGE]: Sure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: The request for refund dealt with two specific taxable events: one for the 529 Plans, and one for the Limited Partnership interest. I recognize that during the course of today, we talked about gifts in the aggregate, but there\u2019s certainly evidence of the distinction and the separation. Is your finding ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-9\">[THE JUDGE]: It\u2019s on both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-10\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: ... that the 529\u2014of materiality on the 529 Plans in their own right as to each of the seven children, that each individual gift is a material gift?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-11\">[THE JUDGE]: My determination is that the seven gifts to the seven great-nieces and nephews were to be considered as a group.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-12\">[APPELLANTS\u2019 COUNSEL]: And that that group is material, separate and ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-13\">[THE JUDGE]: And Three Hundred and Eighty-five Thousand Dollars in total for that group was material even for Doctor Cohn\u2019s financial status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-14\">The Tax Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion was that the gifts were transfers made in contemplation of death, even though that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>finding was stated in an indirect manner: the co-personal representatives had not succeeded in \u201cconvincing [the judge] that these distributions were not ... in contemplation of death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The co-personal representatives filed a petition for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. After that court affirmed the ruling of the Tax Court, the co-personal representatives appealed to this Court, as permitted by Md. Code (1984, 2004 Repl. Vol.), State Government Article, \u00a7 10-223(b). The standard of review applicable to such cases was described by Judge Eyler as follows in <em>Comptroller v. Johns Hopkins Univ., supra, </em>186 Md.App. at 181-82, 973 A.2d 256:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">Because the Tax Court is an administrative agency, its decisions are reviewed under the same appellate standards generally applied to agency decisions. <em>SDAT v. Consolidation Coal Sales Co., </em>382 Md. 439, 453 [855 A.2d 1197] (2004). We review the decision of the Tax Court, not the ruling of the circuit court on judicial review. <em>Comptroller v. Clise Coal, Inc., </em>173 Md.App. 689, 696-97 [920 A.2d 561] (2007). The Tax Court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for substantial evidence in the record. <em>Id. </em>at 697 [920 A.2d 561]; SG \u00a7 10-222(h)(v). Under the substantial evidence test, a factual finding must be upheld if it is such that a reasoning mind reasonably could have found it from the agency record (here, the evidence before the Tax Court). <em>Dep\u2019t of Natural Res. v. Heller, </em>391 Md. 148, 166 [892 A.2d 497] (2006); <em>Md. Aviation Admin. v. Noland, </em>386 Md. 556, 571 [873 A.2d 1145] (2005). Even if the Tax Court does not state the reasons for its decision, reversal is not required \u201cif the record discloses substantial evidence supporting the decision.\u201d <em>Bethlehem Steel Corp. v. Supervisor of Assessments of Baltimore County, </em>38 Md.App. 543, 546 [381 A.2d 1185] (1978) (Wilner, J.).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">Likewise, we review the Tax Court\u2019s mixed findings of fact and law for substantial evidence in the agency record. \u201c[D]eterminations involving mixed questions of fact and law must be affirmed if, after deferring to the Tax Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>expertise and to the presumption that the decision is correct, \u2018a reasoning mind could have reached the Tax Court\u2019s conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>NCR Corp. v. Comptroller, </em>313 Md. 118, 133-34 [544 A.2d 764] (1988) (in turn quoting <em>Comptroller v. NCR, </em>71 Md.App. 116, 133 [524 A.2d 93] (1987)). We are not so constrained in our review of the Tax Court\u2019s decisions of law. <em>Ramsey [Ramsay], Scarlett &amp; Co. v. Comptroller, </em>302 Md. 825, 834 [490 A.2d 1296] (1985). Ordinarily, that review is <em>de novo. SDAT v. Consumer Programs, Inc., </em>331 Md. 68, 72 [626 A.2d 360] (1993). Yet, \u201c \u2018[e]ven with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency. Thus, an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Noland, supra, </em>386 Md. at 572 [873 A.2d 1145] (quoting <em>Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 69 [729 A.2d 376] (1999)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">This Court further noted, <em>id. </em>at 188-89, 973 A.2d 256, that \u201con substantial evidence review of the Tax Court\u2019s decision on a mixed question of law and fact, we give deference to the Tax Court\u2019s application of [the pertinent section of the Tax-General Article], not the Comptroller\u2019s, as the Tax Court is the agency charged with interpreting and applying the Maryland tax code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">The co-personal representatives challenge the ruling of the Tax Court on two grounds. First, they argue that the Tax Court erred in finding that the nine separate inter vivos gifts were \u201cmade in contemplation of death.\u201d As we shall explain more fully below, we conclude that there was substantial evidence in the record to support that dispositive finding. The co-personal representatives, as the appellants before the Tax Court, had the burden of proving that the register\u2019s ruling was incorrect. That meant that they had the burden of persuading the Tax Court judge that the gifts were not made in contem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>plation of death, and the Tax Court judge found they did not convince him of that.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">Second, because the Tax Court judge made references to the presumption that applies to material gifts made during the two years before the donor\u2019s death, the appellants also contend that the Tax Court erred in concluding that the gifts were, in the language of TG \u00a7 7\u2014201 (d)(l)(iii)2, \u201cthe transfer of a material part of the property of the decedent.\u201d On this point, they argue that the Tax Court \u201cerroneously compared the <em>collective </em>amount of the Inter Vivos Gifts to the remainder of Dr. Cohn\u2019s assets.\u201d But the qualifying language about materiality in subsection (d)(l)(iii)2\u2014\u201ca material part of the property of the decedent\u201d\u2014comes into play only with respect to whether a rebuttable presumption applies. TG \u00a7 7-201(d)(l)(iii)l is not limited to a \u201cmaterial\u201d transfer, but rather sweeps within its operation any transfer that \u201cis made in contemplation of death.\u201d Because we conclude that there is substantial evidence in the record to support the Tax Court\u2019s finding that the gifts were made in contemplation of death, we need not reach the question of whether each gift was a material part of the property of the decedent to affirm the ruling of the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The Tax Court judge said during the course of explaining his ruling, \u201cif there was any doubt in my mind, the burden of proof being on Petitioners would seal the deal that they had not met their burden of convincing me that these distributions were ... not in contemplation of death.\u201d We note first that the judge did not say that there <em>was </em>any doubt in his mind, nor did he state that his mind was in equipoise on this question and he was ruling against the co-personal representatives solely because of the tie-breaking burden of proof. Second, as noted above, the co-personal representatives, as the parties challenging the register\u2019s determination, <em>did </em>have the burden of proof in the Tax Court proceeding pursuant to TG \u00a7 13-528(b) (\u201cAbsent affirmative evidence in support of the relief being sought ... the decision, determination, or order from which the appeal is taken shall be affirmed.\u201d). It was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>their burden to persuade the Tax Court that the register had erroneously concluded the gifts were made in contemplation of death regardless of whether the rebuttable presumption under TG \u00a7 7\u2014201(d)(1)(iii)2 was applicable. And, as we pointed out in <em>Comptroller v. Johns Hopkins Univ., supra, </em>186 Md.App. at 181, 973 A.2d 256, \u201cEven if the Tax Court does not state the reasons for its decision, reversal is not required \u2018if the record discloses substantial evidence supporting the decision.\u2019 <em>Bethlehem Steel Corp. v. Supervisor of Assessments of Baltimore County, </em>38 Md.App. 543, 546, 381 A.2d 1185 (1978).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Further, as an alternative reason for upholding the finding of the Tax Court, we are satisfied that the presumption of TG \u00a7 7\u2014201 (d)( 1 )(iii)2 was applicable to each of the gifts in this case because each gift was a \u201ctransfer of a material part of the property of the decedent in the nature of a final disposition ... within 2 years before [the decedent\u2019s] death.\u201d The co-personal representatives argue that the Tax Court erroneously aggregated all of the gifts, and they further contend that none of the gifts, if considered individually, constituted a \u201cmaterial part of the property of the decedent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">We agree with the co-personal representatives that each gift must be evaluated individually, and that, to the extent the Tax Court combined the value of the gifts when assessing the materiality of the transfers, that was an error (although a harmless error in this case). The plain language of the TG \u00a7 7\u2014201(d)(1)(iii) addresses \u201cproperty that passes by <em>an </em>inter vivos transfer ... if ... <em>the </em>transfer is made in contemplation of death.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Such use of singular articles indicates a legislative intent to impose the inheritance tax on individual gifts. Moreover, individual consideration of the donative transfers is consistent with the statutory scheme that imposes the tax \u201con the privilege of <em>receiving </em>property that passes from a decedent.\u201d TG \u00a7 7-202 (emphasis added). That privilege is enjoyed by the recipients on an individual basis. And an exemption set forth in TG \u00a7 7-203(g) applies to individual recipients: \u201cThe inheritance tax does not apply to the receipt of property that passes from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>decedent to any 1 person if the total value of the property does not exceed $1,000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Our interpretation of the statute is further supported by the fact that, prior to the adoption of the Tax-General Article in 1988 as part of the comprehensive revision of the Maryland <em>Code\u2014see </em>1988 Laws of Maryland, Chapter 2\u2014the predecessor code provision from which TG \u00a7 7\u2014201(d)(1) was \u201cderived without substantive change\u201d was Md. Code (1957), Article 81, \u00a7 151, and that statute used similar singular references with respect to <em>\u201c[a]ny </em>transfer of a material part of his property, in the nature of <em>a </em>final disposition.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Article 81, \u00a7 151 also included a safe harbor exemption for individual gifts to any one person, as follows: \u201cProvided, however, that when the total value of any property, or interest therein, passing to any one person shall be one hundred and fifty dollars or less, the same shall be exempt from the payment of any tax under the provisions of this subtitle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\"> Even when the nine inter vivos transfers that are the subject of this appeal are analyzed on an individual basis, however, we conclude that the gifts of $55,000 or more were within the scope of the inheritance tax. We reject the appellants\u2019 argument that the question of materiality must be answered solely by comparing the size of the specific gift to the overall net worth of the donor. If the inheritance tax were applicable only to transfers that constituted a large percentage of a wealthy person\u2019s estate, very large sums of money and other assets could pass tax-free from rich individuals to their collateral relatives whereas relatively paltry sums transferred by the not-so-rich would be subjected to the tax. It would not be rational for the legislature to adopt such a tax scheme, and we are obligated to construe the language in a statute in a manner that is rational and does not produce an absurd result.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Further, as noted above, the version of the inheritance tax statute in effect immediately before the comprehensive code revision in 1988 exempted only transfers with a total value of $150 or less, rather than exempting any specific percentage of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>the decedent\u2019s total wealth. And the current exemption of $1,000 per recipient, as set forth in TG \u00a7 7-203(g), is also some indication of what the legislature considered a material amount in this context. Further, the exemption in TG \u00a7 7-203(h) for property that passes under a \u201csmall estate\u201d\u2014 defined in Maryland Code (1974, 2001 Repl. VoL), Estates and Trusts Article, \u00a7 5-601, as an estate in which the property subject to administration has a value of $30,000 or less\u2014 reflects a legislative intent to impose the inheritance tax on collateral bequests in excess of $1,000 that are made in connection with estates exceeding $30,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Consequently, even though each $55,000 gift by Dr. Cohn may have been only two to three percent of his total net worth, any gift of that magnitude in 2002 or 2003 would constitute, in our view, a material part of a donor\u2019s estate for the purpose of determining whether the inheritance tax was applicable. The legislature has not provided any bright line test for determining how large a transfer must be in order to constitute a \u201cmaterial part of the property of the decedent,\u201d and we do not need to determine in this case where that line might lie. But we have no question that the $55,000 gifts were within the scope of transfers that the legislature intended to cover and tax when it used the term \u201cmaterial\u201d in TG \u00a7 7-201(d)(l)(iii)2. Clearly, the gifts would have been taxable if made pursuant to testamentary bequests. We do not need to remand this case for reconsideration of this point by the Tax Court because gifts of that magnitude in 2003 were clearly material for purposes of the inheritance tax. Accordingly, it was not error for the Tax Court to consider that the appellants had the burden of proving that the various gifts were not made in contemplation of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Although the appellants argue earnestly that Dr. Cohn was a vigorous man who had no thoughts of death when he made the gifts, the Tax Court judge was not obligated to accept such testimony as ruling out the possibility that the octogenarian was at a point in life when he was contemplating his ultimate demise. The fact that Dr. Cohn was 87 years old <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>when he began transferring substantial assets to his next of kin might alone constitute substantial evidence sufficient to support the Tax Court\u2019s finding that the gifts were made in contemplation of death. <em>See Comptroller v. Johns Hopkins Univ., supra, </em>186 Md.App. at 181, 973 A.2d 256 (\u201cUnder the substantial evidence test, a factual finding must be upheld if it is such that a reasoning mind reasonably could have found it from the agency record (here, the evidence before the Tax Court).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">But Dr. Cohn\u2019s medical records are also part of the record in this case, and they include the doctor\u2019s notes from his appointments with his internist, Dr. Ava Kaufman. The medical records, considered in a light most favorable to the appellee, would support a finding that Dr. Cohn\u2019s physical and mental health was rapidly declining by the time he made the gifts to his nephews. Dr. Cohn had congestive heart failure, which caused a swelling in his legs. Dr. Cohn also had prostate cancer, and the treatment for that condition caused unpleasant complications. He was taking medication for his blood pressure and depression, and was mildly anemic.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Dr. Cohn had progressive dementia, which Dr. Kaufman characterized as \u201cmoderate.\u201d His nephews admitted his dementia made that him \u201cfuzzy\u201d at times. In March of 2002, Dr. Kaufman noted that Dr. Cohn\u2019s memory was \u201cgetting worse\u201d and the impact of his prostate cancer was \u201cbad.\u201d In October 2002, Dr. Kaufman noted that his memory \u201ccontinues to decline,\u201d and he was \u201closing more + more function.\u201d She also admitted on cross-examination at the Tax Court hearing that Dr. Cohn was \u201cin a state of decline.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">In December 2002, Dr. Cohn fell in his apartment in the assisted living facility, and fractured his hip. As a result, he had hip surgery, but never fully recovered the ability to walk unassisted. Dr. Kaufman\u2019s discharge summary dated December 30, 2002, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-7\">[Dr. Cohn\u2019s] medical problems include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-8\">1. Coronary artery disease status post bypass graft surgery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>2. Prostate cancer which is being followed conservatively.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-4\">3. Congestive heart failure which is well compensated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\">4. Most significantly, Alzheimer-type dementia.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The discharge summary noted that the patient\u2019s physical and occupational therapy \u201chas been limited by his dementia.\u201d By May of 2003, Dr. Cohn had lost interest in rehabilitation. His physical therapist\u2019s discharge summary dated May 29, 2003, stated: \u201cThe patient quite simply lost interest in working to achieve his rehabilitation goals. He did not want to walk or to exercise or pursue any functional goal. Given this reality, there is little point in continuing physical therapy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">The medical evidence in the record, considered in a light most favorable to the appellee, supports the Tax Court\u2019s conclusion that the gifts were made in contemplation of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Further, the evidence regarding Dr. Cohn\u2019s history of gift-giving, when viewed in a light most favorable to the appellee, also provides substantial evidence that supports the Tax Court\u2019s finding that the gifts made on August 1, 2002, and January 15, 2003, were motivated by the doctor\u2019s contemplation of his death. Because Dr. Cohn never had children of his own, he had great affection for his two nephews. When the nephews were young, they lived with their parents in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and Dr. Cohn saw them frequently, giving them clothes and sports equipment and taking them to football and baseball games. Dr. Cohn gave his nephews gifts of stock worth a few thousand dollars when they were teenagers. When his nephews were older, Dr. Cohn helped them with college tuition, and then tuition for medical and law school. Dr. Cohn also paid for one nephew\u2019s rehearsal dinner when that nephew got married, and gave the other nephew\u2019s children one-time gifts of about $10,000 or $11,000 per child, plus additional smaller gifts in unspecified amounts. This evidence, when viewed in a light most favorable to the appellee, presented such a stark contrast to the million dollars worth of gifts Dr. Cohn distributed during a six month period when he was 87 years old, that the lifelong history of only modest gift-giving also provided substantial evidence to support the Tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Court\u2019s finding that the gifts made on August .1, 2002, and January 15, 2003, were motivated by the doctor\u2019s contemplation of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">Given that finding, it was not error for the Tax Court to uphold the imposition of inheritance taxes on the inter vivos gifts.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY IS AFFIRMED.
