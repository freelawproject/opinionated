The BCDSS moved to strike the late-filed objections and the court, after a hearing, granted the motion. It is that ruling that Kellie B. challenges in this appeal, contending that the juvenile court erred in ruling that statutory provisions of the Permanency for Families and Children Act of 2005, (\u201cthe Act\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> do not permit withdrawal of a consent to guardianship entered by operation of law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">We shall affirm for the reasons set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Kellie B. is the mother of Audrey, born on September 25, 1997; Adriana, born on November 2, 1999; and Eric, born on August 12, 2005. Birth certificates indicate that Jerome H. is the father of Adriana and Eric. Although Audrey\u2019s birth certificate does not indicate a father, Jerome H. is asserted to be Audrey\u2019s putative father in the TPR Petition filed by BCDSS in her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">On October 12, 2004, for reasons not apparent in the record, both Audrey and Adriana were placed in foster care, found to be children in need of assistance (\u201cCINA\u201d), and committed to the custody of BCDSS. Approximately ten months later, on August 15, 2005, and three days after he was born, Eric was also placed in foster care with BCDSS. Thereafter, on September 9, 2005, again for reasons not apparent in the record, Eric was found to be a CI\u00d1A and committed to BCDSS.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">On August 13, 2008, BCDSS filed TPR Petitions seeking guardianship of each of the children in case numbers T08204021, T08204022, and T0820423, respectively.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>same day, three Show Cause Orders were filed in the aforementioned cases: one addressed to Kellie B.; another to Jerome H.; and, the third addressed to the three children.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Each of the Show Cause Orders conspicuously warned the recipient that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">THIS IS A COURT ORDER. IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT THE ORDER SAYS, HAVE SOMEONE EXPLAIN IT TO YOU. YOUR RIGHT TO AN ATTORNEY IS EXPLAINED IN PARAGRAPH 8 OF THIS ORDER. IF YOU DO NOT MAKE SURE THAT THE COURT RECEIVES YOUR NOTICE OF OBJECTION ON OR BEFORE THE DEADLINE STATED IN PARAGRAPH 2 OF THIS ORDER, YOU HAVE AGREED TO A TERMINATION OF YOUR PARENTAL RIGHTS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Further, and pertinent to the instant appeal, the Show Cause Order advised Kellie B. as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">2. RIGHT TO OBJECT; TIME FOR OBJECTING.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">If this Order is served on you by October 27,2008, and if you wish to object to the guardianship, you must file a notice of objection with the Clerk of the Court at the Baltimore City Juvenile Justice Center, 300 North Gay Street, Room A3820, Baltimore, Maryland, 21202 within 80 days after this Order is served on you. For your convenience, a form notice of objection is attached to this Order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-9\">WHETHER THE PETITION REQUESTS ADOPTION OR GUARDIANSHIP, IF YOU DO NOT MAKE SURE THAT THE COURT RECEIVES YOUR NOTICE OF OBJECTION ON OR BEFORE THE DEADLINE STATED ABOVE, YOU HAVE AGREED TO A TERMINATION OF YOUR PARENTAL RIGHTS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">Similar language appears elsewhere in the Order, and these warnings conform to the requirements of Md. Rule 9-105(e) (setting forth the form of show cause order). Comparable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>orders also were issued to Jerome H., as well as to the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">On August 26, 2008, Kellie B. was personally served with a copy of the Petitions and the Show Cause Orders, as well as two Notice of Objection forms. Two days later, on August 28, 2008, Jerome H. was personally served with a copy of the Petitions and the Show Cause Orders at the Baltimore City Detention Center. That same day, Jerome H. filed an objection to the guardianship petitions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">On September 11, 2008, an attorney entered his appearance on behalf of Audrey, Adriana and Eric, and filed a Consent to Guardianship Petition. That consent expressly provides that the attorney, on behalf of the children, \u201chereby Consents to the Petition filed by the Baltimore City Department of Social Services requesting] Guardianship With the Right to Consent to Adoption or Long-Term Care Short of Adoption in the above-captioned case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">On September 30, 2008, 35 days after she was personally served, Kellie B. filed a Notice of Objection to the Petitions and also requested appointment of an attorney.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Kellie B. listed the following reasons in support of her Objection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-7\">I object because I feel as though there are no reasons my children shouldn\u2019t be in my care. When I have four of my other children. I want these children returned to me. I don\u2019t want my children placed anywhere then [sic] with me. This has been an ongoing battle against a case that holds no substationed [sic] evidence. I object to the termination of parental rights. Also the adoption.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>On October 14, 2008, BCDSS filed a Motion to Strike Late Objection, asking that the juvenile court strike Kellie B.\u2019s objection as untimely filed. In that motion, after informing the juvenile court that Kellie B. was served on August 26, 2008, and filed her objection on September 30, 2008, BCDSS contended:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-4\">Md. Rule 9-107 provides that a party has 30 days to file an objection if served in the [Sjtate of Maryland. [Ms. B.\u2019s] objection should have been filed by the close of business on September 25, 2008 to be considered timely.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">On November 19, 2008, Kellie B. filed an answer to the BCDSS\u2019s Motion to Strike Late Objection. In her answer, Kellie B. contended that a failure to file a timely Notice of Objection is a voluntary consent under \u00a7 5-320 of the Family Law Article, and that such a volitional consent may be revoked.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Therefore, Kellie B. continued, because a volitional consent may be revoked within thirty days, her Notice of Objection filed with the juvenile clerk \u201con September 30, 2008, more than thirty but less than sixty days after she was served with the Show Cause Order, is a timely revocation of consent and satisfies the requirements of\u201d Md. Rule 9-102 and \u00a7 5-321 of the Family Law Article. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 9-102 (addressing consents; revocation of consent); Md.Code (2006 Repl. Yol.), \u00a7 5-321 of the Family Law Article (consent).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">On December 9, 2008, the juvenile court held a hearing on BCDSS\u2019s motion, at which counsel for BCDSS contended that Kellie B.\u2019s Notice of Objection was untimely and should be stricken. Counsel for Kellie B. conceded that the Notice of Objection was late-filed. However, counsel suggested that, under the 2005 revisions to the Family Law Article, the failure to timely file an objection was not a \u201cdeemed consent,\u201d and that \u00a7 5-320 now \u201csets up this way of affirmatively and volitionally consenting to a termination of parental rights.\u201d In furtherance of her position, counsel for Kellie B. elaborated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Family Law Article [ ] 5-321(c) allows revocation by a parent of a consent to guardianship within 30 days except when that consent is entered into before a judge on the record. And that is the exact wording of 321, 5-321. By carving out this exception, the one way that you can not, that it is irrevocable, and only that way, bolsters my argument that the other ways of consenting, which are listed in 5-320, can be revoked within the 30 day period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Accordingly, counsel continued, \u201cby filing her revocation more than 30 but less than 60 days after service with the show cause order, that satisfies the requirement of Family Law Article 5-321 and Maryland Rule of Procedure 9-102. And we are asking that [the juvenile court] deny the Department\u2019s motion to strike the late objection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Counsel for BCDSS responded first, that Md. Rule 9-102 applies only to written consents. As for \u00a7 5-321, BCDSS\u2019s counsel stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-7\">That includes a waiver and the written [sic] as under 9-102, there\u2019s a 30 day period to reconsider and revoke the written consent. It doesn\u2019t speak, the statute doesn\u2019t speak at all to dealing with a default. I don\u2019t think the legislature intended to extend an objection period by 30 more days by considering a default a, some kind of consent. You know, it says 30 days. It\u2019s very clear it says 30 days and if, you know, the writing that was actually filed with the Court is an objection form that was served on the mother on the 26th of August. I don\u2019t think that that supports her argument that she was writing, she was filing a writing that was revoking her consent. I[t] basically said I object and it was filed late therefore its [sic] not valid and I\u2019d ask the Court to strike that objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">In response to the court\u2019s inquiry, counsel for Kellie B. stated that she was referring to \u00a7 5-321 (c) \u201cwhere it says a person may revoke consent any time within the later of 30 days after the person signs the consent or 30 days after the consent is filed as required.\u201d The court then stated, \u201c[o]kay, but doesn\u2019t that sort of indicate that something is done, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>there\u2019s either a signature of a consent or that something is filed, that there is an act?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Counsel for Kellie B. disagreed and suggested that \u00a7 5-321 should be read in conjunction with \u00a7 5-320, which provides three ways a parent may consent to guardianship. Counsel contended that only a \u00a7 5\u2014320(b) consent, \u201cknowingly and voluntarily on the record before the juvenile court,\u201d is irrevocable. Counsel suggested as an underlying purpose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">And the, you know, by doing that it, and the purpose, of course, is to protect, if you will, parents from making kind of rash or hasty decisions about such an important right to consent and so on. And that\u2019s why, only when it\u2019s done in the court, and I guess because the court would make inquiry and make sure and so on, all the things that you do, when the parent does this, consents on the record in front of a judge. That\u2019s the only way, the only thing that\u2019s irrevocable. And of course whenever you do that you tell them this is it, this is it if you change your mind. The two other ways that\u2019s not so because they haven\u2019t been, you don\u2019t have those safeguards to make sure that its volitional and make sure its exactly what the person wants to do. And one of those ways is this failure to file a timely notice of objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_DV\">The court disagreed and found good cause to grant BCDSS\u2019s motion to strike the late objection, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-7\">[Its] an interesting argument. Unfortunately I don\u2019t agree with it. I don\u2019t think that 5-321(c) is really relevant or relates to a situation which is basically a default situation so I\u2019m going to grant the Department\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AEt\">On December 11, 2008, Kellie B. filed a Notice of Appeal to this Court from the December 9, 2008, ruling granting BCDSS\u2019s motion to strike late objection.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Summarizing the contentions of the parties, appellant, Kellie B., first argues that the juvenile court erred in striking her Notice of Objection to the Petitions for Guardianship because, under the Act:</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">(1) her failure to file a timely Notice of Objection was a volitional consent and not a \u201cdeemed consent\u201d, <em>i.e., </em>a consent by operation of law; and,</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">(2) the Legislature has only provided that consents to guardianship entered before a judge are irrevocable.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">Appellee BCDSS responds that Kellie B. has conceded that she did not timely file a Notice of Objection to the Petitions, and that, under the reasoning of <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 93321055, </em>344 Md. 458, 687 A.2d 681 (construing the earlier statute), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Clemy P. v. Montgomery County DSS, </em>520 U.S. 1267, 117 S.Ct. 2439, 138 L.Ed.2d 199 (1997), as well as the legislative history of the 2005 Act, Kellie B.\u2019s deemed consent is irrevocable.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">Lastly, the children, by counsel, also assert that Kellie B.\u2019s deemed consent is irrevocable.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">We are, therefore, presented with an issue of statutory construction; thus, we begin our analysis with the following principles in mind:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-11\">Our predominant mission is to ascertain and implement the legislative intent, which is to be derived, if possible, from the language of the statute (or Rule) itself. If the language is clear and unambiguous, our search for legislative intent ends and we apply the language as written in a commonsense manner. We do not add words or ignore those that are there. If there is any ambiguity, we may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>then seek to fathom the legislative intent by looking at legislative history and applying the most relevant of the various canons that courts have created.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-5\"><em>Downes v. Downes, </em>388 Md. 561, 571-72, 880 A.2d 343 (2005); <em>see also Schisler v. State, </em>394 Md. 519, 535, 907 A.2d 175 (2006) (\u201cwhere an order [of the trial court] involves an interpretation and application of Maryland constitutional, statutory or case law, [the appellate court] must determine whether the trial court\u2019s conclusions are \u2018legally correct\u2019 under a <em>de novo </em>standard of review\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The procedures that govern guardianships are found in \u00a7\u00a7 5-313 to 5-528 of the Family Law Article and their implementing rules;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 93321055, </em>344 Md. at 477, 687 A.2d 681. Section 5-313(a) mandates that a petition for guardianship be filed prior to a petition for adoption. After such petition is filed, the juvenile court must issue promptly \u201ca show cause order that requires the party to whom it is issued to respond as required under the Maryland Rules.\u201d \u00a7 5-316(a). Maryland Rule 9-105(e) dictates the form that must be utilized for a show cause order, requiring the show cause order to advise the recipient, <em>inter alia, </em>that the consequence of the failure to file the objection with the court means that the recipient of the show cause order has \u201cagreed to a termination of [his or her] parental rights.\u201d Maryland Rule 9-107(b)(1) requires that, subject to exceptions not applicable in this case, notice of objection to an adoption or guardianship \u201cshall be filed within 30 days after the show cause order is served.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">There is no dispute that Kellie B. was properly and timely served, or that her notice of objection was not timely filed. The Petitions and Show Cause Orders were filed on August <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>13, 2008, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 5-313 and 5-316. The Show Cause Orders contained the warnings required by Md. Rule 9-105(e). Kellie B. was personally served on August 26, 2008. On September 30, 2008, five days beyond the deadline provided in Md. Rule 9\u2014107(b)(1), Kellie B. filed her Notice of Objection to the Petitions. Kellie B. conceded in the juvenile court that her objection was untimely, and makes a similar concession in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The question here presented concerns the viability of the untimely objection. The parties agree that the answer lies in the interpretation of Sections 5-320 and 5-321.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Section 5-320 provides the circumstances for the court\u2019s authority to grant a guardianship:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">(a) <em>Consent and acquiescence or best </em>interests.\u2014A juvenile court may grant guardianship of a child only if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-8\">(1) (i) the child does not object;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-9\">(ii) the local department:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-10\">1. filed the petition; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-11\">2. did not object to the other party filing the petition;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-12\">and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-13\">(iii) 1. each of the child\u2019s living parents consents:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-14\">A. in writing</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-15\">B. knowingly and voluntarily, on the record before the juvenile court; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-16\">C. by failure to file a timely notice of objection after being served with a show cause order in accordance with this subtitle [.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-17\">\u00a7 5-320(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-18\">Section 5-321 (c), in turn, provides the following with respect to revocation of consent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>(c) <em>Revocation period; </em>waiver.\u2014(1) Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, a person may revoke consent to guardianship any time within the later of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">(1) 30 days after the person signs the consent; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">(ii) 30 days after the consent is filed as required under this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">(2) Consent to guardianship under subsection (a)(2) of this section is irrevocable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">\u00a7 5-321(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">The plain language of \u00a7 5-320(a)(l)(iii)(c) instructs that failure to file a timely notice of objection in this case amounts to a consent to guardianship. Turning to \u00a7 5-321 (c), however, we cannot determine from the plain language whether a consent entered by operation of law is revocable. Subsection 5-321 (c)(1) permits revocation of a consent any time within the later of 30 days after a person \u201csigns the consent\u201d or after \u201cthe consent is filed as required under this section.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 5-321(c)(1). Subsection 5-321(c)(2), in contrast, provides that a consent to guardianship pursuant to \u00a7 5-321(a)(2), <em>i.e., </em>\u201cbefore a judge on the record,\u201d is irrevocable. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 5-321(a)(2),(c)(2); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 5-320(a)(l)(iii)(R) (providing that a party may consent on the record before the juvenile court).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">Neither of these provisions speak to a failure to act, and, as the court observed during the motions hearing, \u00a7 5-321(c) \u201csort of indicated] that something is done, that there\u2019s either a signature of a consent or that something is filed, that there is an act[.]\u201d Indeed, \u00a7 5-321 (c) simply does not address whether a \u201cdeemed consent\u201d is revocable. Even as counsel for BCDSS acknowledges, \u201c[t]he language of the statute, as a whole, makes no reference to deemed consents, and, consequently, the revocation portion of the statute makes no reference to deemed consents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">We conclude, therefore, that it is unclear whether \u00a7 5-321(c) applies by its plain language to a \u201cdeemed consent\u201d, i.e., a consent occurring by failure to timely file a notice of objection to a show cause order. When a statute is ambiguous, we must look beyond plain language to discern the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>legislative intent. <em>Melton v. State, </em>379 Md. 471, 477, 842 A.2d 743 (2004). \u201c[W]e resolve that ambiguity by looking to the statute\u2019s legislative history, case law, and statutory purpose.\u201d <em>Barbre v. Pope, </em>402 Md. 157, 173, 935 A.2d 699 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Accordingly, we continue our analysis as the parties have suggested, by considering the opinion of the Court of Appeals in <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 93321055, supra, (\u201cClemy P.\u201d) </em>concerning the prior consent and revocation of consent provisions of the Family Law Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">In <em>Clemy P., </em>the Court of Appeals granted certiorari in five separate cases to consider issues relating to untimely objections to show cause orders.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In the case of primary concern to the Court, <em>Clemy P., </em>the Department filed petitions for guardianship of Stephon and Alphonso P. in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County on April 21, 1993, to terminate the parental rights of Clemy P. and Sam L. <em>Id. </em>at 471, 687 A.2d 681. Sam L. consented to the petition. <em>Id. </em>A show cause order was served on Clemy P. on May 11, 1993. <em>Id. </em>No objection was filed, and on October 20,1993, the court granted the petition and entered a judgment of guardianship. <em>Id. </em>Clemy P. filed an appeal 32 days later, which was struck by the circuit court as untimely. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">Eight months later, on July 25,1994, the children requested a hearing alleging a number of problems after the judgment of guardianship was entered. <em>Id. </em>Three days later, Clemy P. moved to intervene. <em>Id. </em>at 472, 687 A.2d 681. The Department opposed both the childrens\u2019 motion and Clemy P.\u2019s attempt to intervene. <em>Id. </em>A status hearing convened on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>August 11, 1994, but the record did not indicate how these motions were resolved. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">On July 5, 1995, 21 months after the judgments of guardianship were entered, Clemy P. moved to vacate the judgments. <em>Id. </em>She raised a number of contentions: that she was not aware of the need to respond to the show cause order or petition; that she received no notice of any proceedings; and that \u201cthe judgments were defective because they were based on her presumed consent and she was never informed of her right to revoke that consent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 473, 687 A.2d 681. The circuit court granted Clemy P.\u2019s motion to vacate the judgments, ruling, as summarized by the Court of Appeals, that \u201calthough Clemy may be deemed to have consented to the guardianships by not filing a timely objection, she retained the right to revoke that deemed consent and to receive notice of all further proceedings, including service of all pleadings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After the circuit court denied the Department\u2019s motion to alter or amend the order vacating the guardianship, the Department appealed. <em>Id. </em>at 473-74, 687 A.2d 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The Court of Appeals began its analysis by summarizing the procedure generally followed in such cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">[A] child may not be adopted without the consent of his natural parents unless the parental rights of those parents have been terminated by a judicial proceeding. It is common for the State, when it concludes that a continuing relationship between a child and his natural parents is likely to be harmful to the welfare of the child, to seek to terminate parental rights as an intermediate measure. A judgment terminating those rights not only eliminates the need for parental consent to a subsequent adoption but also provides the State with flexibility in seeking out adoptive persons or families and in caring for the child in the interim. Most States authorize this intermediate procedure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-7\"><em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 93321055, </em>344 Md. at 477, 687 A.2d 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">In some cases, natural parents may consent to guardianship voluntarily and affirmatively; in other cases, they do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>affirmatively provide their consent. <em>Id. </em>at 477-79, 687 A.2d 681. In cases where the parent(s) affirmatively consents to guardianship, the Court observed that \u00a7 5-317(e), then in effect, permitted a consenting parent to revoke his or her consent. <em>See </em>Md.Code (2004 Repl.Vol), \u00a7 5-317(e) of the Family Law Article (repealed by 2005 Md. Laws, ch. 464, \u00a7 2, p. 2584). When the petition was originally filed in Clemy P.\u2019s case, \u00a7 5-317(e) allowed a consenting parent to revoke at any time within the earlier of 30 days after the consent was filed, or entry of the judgment of guardianship. <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 93321055, </em>344 Md. at 478, 687 A.2d 681.

The Task Force recommended that if a parent who was duly notified failed to file a timely objection to a petition, \u201cthe petition shall be treated as one in which consent has been granted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court explained that \u201c[t]he consequence of failing to file a timely objection was thus to be changed from a waiver of the requirement of consent to a <em>statutorily deemed consent.\u201d Id. </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>The Court observed that this recommendation was supported by the Maryland Department of Human Resources, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-5\">In its written statement to the General Assembly, the Department observed that many parents, though recognizing that adoption would be in their child\u2019s best interest, were nonetheless unable to bring themselves to sign a consent to a termination of their parental rights but chose instead \u201cto simply take no action when served with the show cause order\u2014in effect, to \u2018allow their child to be taken from them.\u2019 \u201d The Department expressed concern about continuing to treat such cases as contested, requiring full evidentiary hearings and delaying the termination process. The bill was also supported by several foster care review boards, which expressed similar concern over the delay in achieving permanence for children in foster care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 483, 687 A.2d 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">The Court then looked to subsequent amendments to FL \u00a7 5-317(e), which shortened, to 30 days, the time to revoke a written consent. <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 93321055, </em>344 Md. at 483-84, 687 A.2d 681. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\">In light of this history, it is evident that any construction of \u00a7 5-317(e) or \u00a7 5\u2014822(d) that would have the effect of engendering further delays or imposing additional impediments to achieving permanent and stable family settings for children placed in foster care, usually as the result of a CINA proceeding, would be flatly inconsistent with and antithetical to the clear legislative purpose, and is to be avoided unless absolutely required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-9\"><em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 93321055, </em>344 Md. at 484, 687 A.2d 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">The Court opined that the 30-day revocation period provided by then \u00a7 317(e) was \u201cclear, fixed, and easily ascertained.\u201d <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 93321055, </em>344 Md. at 485, 687 A.2d 681. \u201cThat certainty would not exist if a right to revoke is attached to the \u2018deemed\u2019 consent under \u00a7 5-322.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number><em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 93321055, </em>344 Md. at 485, 687 A.2d 681.

Revisions to the guardianship and adoption statutes began as a result of assessments by Maryland\u2019s Foster Care Court Improvement Project (\u201cFCCIP\u201d).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, Floor Report on Senate Bill 710 (2005) (\u201cFloor Report\u201d). In a letter from Hon. Pamela L. North, Chair, CINA Subcommittee, FCCIP, to Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee regarding Permanency for Families and Children Act of 2005 (Feb. 18, 2005) (\u201cCINA Subcommittee letter\u201d), the Bill was summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"ASBR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>This bill is intended to separate the statutes regarding termination of parental rights (TPR) and adoption into three discrete areas to clarify the substantive legal distinctions between involuntary termination and voluntary relinquishment of parental rights.

The areas are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-5\">\u2022 guardianship to and adoption though [sic] local departments of social services;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-6\">\u2022 private agency guardianship and adoption; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">\u2022 independent adoption.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">Floor Report p. 2-3</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-9\">The purpose of this separation was to \u201cafford judges, masters, practitioners, and others the ability to look in one section and chronologically follow the legal process for the type of proceeding in which they are involved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">CINA Subcommittee Letter, p. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-11\">Pertinent to the issue herein, the Floor Report addresses consents to guardianship as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-12\">The bill specifies the elements of a valid guardianship petition and clarifies that a petition for guardianship must be filed prior to a child\u2019s eighteenth birthday. The bill clarifies the responsibility for adequate notice of the filing of a petition for guardianship and establishes a 30-day time limit for a parent who has consented to guardianship to revoke his or her consent. The 30-day time period is altered to run after the parent signs the consent, or after the consent is filed as required, whichever is later. However, consent to guardianship that is entered into before a judge on the record must include a waiver of the revocation period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b494-13\">Floor Report, p. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-14\">The CINA Subcommittee letter supplements this general description with detailed discussion about the two statutes at issue in this case. With respect to FL \u00a7 5-320, Authority to Grant Guardianship, the letter states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>This section rewords the current section on Guardianship Requirements to clarify what is required to grant guardianship. It adds a new provision codifying what is currently practice in some jurisdictions, permitting parties to consent to a guardianship conditional on the child being adopted into a specific family, provided that the family is ultimately approved for adoptive placement. This practice has increased the timeliness of attaining permanency for children who have parents who are willing to consent if a particular family (often a relative) adopts the child. The ability to exercise this condition ends at the time of adoption which ensures that no adoptions will be disrupted by the addition of this provision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">CINA Subcommittee Letter, p. 5.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">With respect to FL \u00a7 5-321, Consent, the letter provides: This section defines the parameters surrounding consenting to the granting of a guardianship petition. A provision has been added to ensure that parents who consent are advised about the consent in a language understood by the parent. It provides for what is to occur if a parent consents prior to the filing of the petition, as well as what should occur if the parent consents after the filing of the petition. The local department is now required to file the consent with the court with copies to all parties. The revocation period provision is revised so that it begins to run based on the time of the filing of the consent with the court, instead of beginning to run at the time that the parent signs the consent, and provides for waiver of revocation if the consent to guardianship is made before a judge on the record. This section also addresses what is to occur if the condition of a conditional consent is not fulfilled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">CINA Subcommittee Letter, p. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">We have not discovered anything in the legislative history of the amended statute to suggest that the Legislature meant to undermine or alter the holding of <em>In re Adoption! Guardianship No. 93321055, </em>when it repealed \u00a7\u00a7 5-317(e) and 5-322(d), and enacted new provisions with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>to consent to guardianship and revocation of consent. Kellie B. asserts, however, that, \u201c[ajccording to the wording of the current statute, a non-response, a failure to file a timely Notice of Objection, is as much a voluntary consent as is a written consent or a knowing and voluntary consent on the record before the juvenile court.\u201d That contention is rebutted by the Committee Note to Section 5-320, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adh\">Subsection (a)(l)(iii)(l) of this section is derived from former FL \u00a7 5-317(c)(2), as it related to CINAs, and revised to delineate the methods by which consent may be given in addition to failure to make timely objection. <em>Subsection (a)(l)(ii)(l) is not meant to change the current meaning of \u201cdeemed consent </em>\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Committee Note, 2005 Md. Laws, ch. 464, \u00a7 3, p. 2617 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We cannot, therefore, find merit in Kellie B\u2019s proposition that her conceded failure to file a timely objection was \u201cvolitional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Kellie B. also asserts that, because the Legislature specifically provided in \u00a7 5-321(c) that: (1) consent may be revoked within the later of 30 days after the consent is signed or filed; but that, (2) consent entered into before a judge is irrevocable, according to the doctrine of <em>expressio unius est exclusio altenus, </em>the statute now provides the sole \u201cexception to the general rule\u201d permitting revocation of consent. <em>See WFS Financial, Inc. v. Mayor &amp; City Council, </em>402 Md. 1, 14, 935 A.2d 385 (2007) (\u201cthe expression of one thing is the exclusion of another\u201d); <em>accord Chow v.

Further, we observe that FL \u00a7 5\u2014321 (c)(2), providing that a consent entered before a judge, on the record, is irrevocable, complements FL \u00a7 5-321(a)(2), which provides that \u201c[cjonsent to guardianship before a judge on the record shall include a waiver of a revocation period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">We also disagree with the notion that, because FL \u00a7 5-321 (c) does refer to deemed consents that the General Assembly must have purposefully excluded such consents in order to cause them to be revocable. \u201cThe Legislature is presumed to be aware of [ ] prior [appellate] holdings when it enacts new legislation and, where it does not express a clear intention to abrogate the holdings of those decisions, to have acquiesced in those holdings.\u201d <em>Allen v.

Laws, ch. 464, p. 2581, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>changes to the specific statutes at issue here, concerning revocation of consent to guardianship, were a matter of recodification, rather than substantive revision. Moreover, the Committee Note for FL \u00a7 5\u2014320(a)(1)(iii)(1) carries the message that the revision was \u201cnot meant to change the current meaning of \u2018deemed consent\u2019 \u201d. <em>See </em>Committee Note, 2005 Md. Laws, ch. 464, \u00a7 3, p. 2617. Further, the Committee Note to FL \u00a7 5-321(c)(1) indicates that \u201cthis section is derived from former FL \u00a7 5-317(e) and revised to provide an alternative deadline based on the filing date of the consent.\u201d <em>See </em>2005 Md. Laws, ch. 464, \u00a7 3, p. 2620. These changes do not suggest that consents by operation of law may now be revoked, in contravention of the holding of <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 93321055, supra. </em>As the Court of Appeals has explained elsewhere:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-5\">[Rjecodification of statutes is presumed to be for the purpose of clarity rather than change the meaning and, thus, even a change in the phraseology of a statute by a codification will not ordinarily modify the law unless the change is so radical and material that the intention of the Legislature to modify the law appears unmistakably from the language of the Code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-6\"><em>Allen, </em>402 Md. at 71-72, 935 A.2d 421 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">In sum, we find nothing in the amended statute that causes us to believe that the rationale applied by the Court in <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 93321055, supra, </em>does not continue to apply with equal force to the 2005 revisions to Maryland\u2019s guardianship and adoption laws. We hold that, as a matter of statutory construction, there remains no right to revoke a statutorily deemed consent entered by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">Accordingly, we conclude that the juvenile court\u2019s construction of the 2005 revisions was legally correct, and that the court did not err in granting BCDSS\u2019s motion to strike Kellie B.\u2019s untimely Notice of Objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY, SITTING AS A JUVENILE COURT, AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b478-10\">. 2005 Md.
