Thus, we reverse and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">For more than 30 years, appellant was employed with the Montgomery County Fire and Rescue Services (MCFRS) as a firefighter<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and later, a lieutenant in the River Rescue and Tactical Services (RRATS).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In an affidavit filed in the circuit court, Bridgett described the employment conditions associated with service in RRATS:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-7\">All river rescue fire fighters must constantly hold a rope while under water in order to find their way back to the boat,... All river rescue fire fighters engage in undeiwater work which is mostly done with zero visibility and so the hands must be used to \u201cvisualize\u201d everything under water. The hands must constantly be used to find objects and manipulate those objects under water to determine what they are .... all fire fighters are also constantly using their hands on an extensive basis to perform tasks such as removing ceilings, pulling hoses, pulling oneself into fire trucks, grasping tools, and pulling on doors, pipes and other objects.... The overuse of the hands is a condition of employment that is common to all fire rescue fighters.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>Appellant described his working conditions in similar terms at a June 2007 hearing before a Workers\u2019 Compensation Commissioner.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At the same hearing, Bridgett said that eventually he \u201cgot a big lump in the palm of [his] hand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">In April 2007, appellant filed a claim with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission alleging: \u201cI developed Dupuytren\u2019s contracture as a result of many years (over 35) of use of hands grasping, pulling and hand manipulations as a firefighter.\u201d Appellee responded by indicating it would be contesting issues. Two and a half-months later, at a hearing before Commissioner Sfekas, medical evidence was offered by both sides.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Bridgett\u2019s orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Sunjay Berdia, said in a letter that appellant developed Dupuytren\u2019s contracture of his right hand. He observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>As you know Dupuytren\u2019s contracture is due to the disease myelo fibroblast. This in itself proliferates and causes fascial contractures which initially result in nodules and then subsequently can result in contractures of the fingers. Although there is a certain genetic predisposition of developing Dupuytren\u2019s contracture, we also believe that in the majority of patients, there is usually an inciting event such as either trauma or overuse of the palmar skin. Given the fact that Mr. Bridgett has been a firefighter for over 35 years in which he has been grasping and pulling ropes and in addition doing similar activities while he was on a rescue dive team for the last 16 years, I feel that Mr. Bridgett\u2019s development of Dupuytren\u2019s contracture, within a reasonable degree of medical probability is more likely than not (greater than 51%) due to his duties as a fire fighter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Appellee countered with a letter from a hand specialist, Dr. Peter Innis, who after examining Bridgett, noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-6\">I am forwarding for your review a pamphlet that the patient was reading in our office, which is put out by the American Society for Surgery of the Hand', which is our national organization. This pamphlet entitled: \u201cDupuytren\u2019s Disease\u201d states under the section \u201cWhat causes it?\u201d \u201cThere is no proven evidence that hand injuries or specific occupational exposure lead to a higher risk of developing Dupuytren\u2019s disease.\u201d I agree with this statement, and it is my opinion within a reasonable degree of medical certainty that this very pleasant gentleman had a right palmar nodule consistent with Dupuytren\u2019s disease, which was not related to his work as a fire and rescue lieutenant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">On June 20, 2007, Commissioner Sfekas issued an award of compensation to Bridgett. In ordering the payment of benefits, the Commission order said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-8\">The Commission finds on the issues presented that the claimant sustained an occupational disease arising out of and in the course of employment, that the first date of disablement was December 15, 2005, that the disability of the claimant (Dupuytren\u2019s contracture; right/wrist) is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>result of the occupational disease, and that as a result thereof the claimant was temporary totally disabled from December 15, 2005 to December 80, 2005 inclusive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">On July 11, 2007, Montgomery County filed a petition for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s decision and a request for jury trial. Appellant answered. Four months later, the County filed a motion for summary judgment. Appellee submitted no new evidence, but argued as a matter of law that Bridgett had not suffered a compensable injury as defined by \u00a7 9\u2014502(d)(1)(i) of the Labor and Employment (L &amp; E) Article of the Md.Code (1991, 2008 Repl. Vol.), and as interpreted by the Court of Appeals in <em>King v. Bd. of Ed. of Prince George\u2019s </em>County, 354 Md. 369, 731 A.2d 460 (1999); <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 2) that the claimant\u2019s Dupuytren\u2019s contracture did not amount to a compensable occupational disease. <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Specifically, appellee argued that \u201cthe issue is not whether . .. Bridgett excessively used his hands, but whether firefighterfs] as a class excessively use their hands during the course of their employment.\u201d The County added that to qualify as a compensable occupational disease, the condition \u201cmust not only be <em>inherent </em>in the nature of the claimant\u2019s job, but the disease also <em>cannot occur with equal frequency </em>in any other employment ...\u201d and that the appellant failed this test. The appellee also argued that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act was not meant to cover \u201cthe common perils of life\u201d and that the overuse of hands was just such an activity. Solely for purposes of the summary judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>ment motion, the County said it would \u201caccept Mr. Bridgett\u2019s contention that the [D]upuytren\u2019s contracture of his right hand/wrist was caused by use of [his] hands.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">Appellant opposed these contentions and submitted an affidavit of Bridgett, the award of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission, Montgomery County Class Specifications for Firefighter/Rescuer I, II, and III, the written evaluation of Dr. Berdia, and the transcript of testimony before Commissioner Sfekas. Specifically, appellant argued that under L &amp; E Article, \u00a7 9-745(b), as interpreted by the Court of Appeals in <em>Baltimore County v. Kelly, </em>391 Md. 64, 891 A.2d 1103 (2006), the Commission\u2019s award in Bridgett\u2019s favor was prima facie correct and sufficient to defeat appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He also contended that the evidence he had presented created material disputes of fact not resolvable by summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">On February 28, 2008, the circuit court heard argument on the motion and issued its ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-6\">All right. Okay. I think the <em>King </em>case is applicable here and I will grant the motion for summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">On March 12, 2008, an order was entered granting the summary judgment motion and remanding the case to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission \u201cfor the entry of an award affirming its decision to disallow the claim [sic ] filed here.... \u201d Two days later, Bridgett noted his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">QUESTIONS PRESENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">Appellant raises the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-10\">I. Whether in an appeal of a workers\u2019 compensation decision where the Claimant was successful before the Worker\u2019s Compensation Commission in a full evidentiary Hearing and the Employer/Self-Insurer appealed to the Circuit Court and presented no new evidence, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number><em>Baltimore County v. Kelly, </em>391 Md. 64, 891 A.2d 1103 (2006) and its progeny, which preclude summary judgment at such a stage, the Circuit Court\u2019s granting of summary judgment in favor of the appealing party (the Employer/Self-Insurer) was erroneous?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-4\">II. Whether in an appeal of a workers\u2019 compensation decision where the Claimant was successful before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission and the Employer/Self-Insurer appealed to the Circuit Court, granting summary judgment to the appealing employer was erroneous where there was a material dispute of fact as to whether the claimant\u2019s Dupuytren\u2019s contracture was due to the nature of the employment as a fire fighter given that there was evidence that the hazards of the occupational disease (overuse of the hands) exist in that occupation?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Appellee frames the issues in this fashion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">I. Did the circuit court correctly grant summary judgment to the County where Mr. Bridgett\u2019s Dupuytren\u2019s contracture was not due to the nature of an employment in which hazards of the occupational disease exist?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-7\">II. Did the circuit court properly grant summary judgment where the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission\u2019s decision was not supported by minimum evidence sufficient for a prima facie case? <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">Under Md. Rule 2-501(f), a court may not grant summary judgment unless there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In considering the motion, the court views the facts, including all inferences, in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Sadler v. Dimensions Healthcare Corp., </em>378 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>Md. 509, 536, 836 A.2d 655 (2003). In reviewing the granting of a motion for summary judgment, we must determine whether the decision was legally correct and our review is confined to the basis relied upon by the court below. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">In this case, by its exclusive reliance on <em>King, supra, </em>the circuit court appears to have based its summary judgment decision solely on Bridgett\u2019s asserted failure to show that his condition was compensable under L &amp; E Article, \u00a7 9-502(d)(1)(i), because it was not \u201cdue to the nature of an employment in which hazards of the occupational disease exist.\u201d Thus, the County\u2019s contentions that Dupuytren\u2019s contracture is not an occupational disease of Bridgett\u2019s job as determined by the Commission and that the Commission\u2019s award was not supported by sufficient evidence to warrant its acceptance as prima facie correct would seem, at first blush, not to be before us. However, because of appellant\u2019s undei*standable reliance on the Commission\u2019s award to survive summary judgment and its express rejection in the court\u2019s March 12, 2008 order, the County\u2019s contentions are necessarily entwined with the compensability issue. For these reasons, it is permissible for us to consider all of these questions. <em>See Conaway v. Deane, </em>401 Md. 219, 243-44, 932 A.2d 571 (2007). The logical place to begin our analysis is a consideration of the impact of the Commission\u2019s award in a summary judgment setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">1. Effect of the Commission\u2019s Award</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">Section 9-745(b) of the L <em>&amp; </em>E Article states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-7\">In each court proceeding under this title:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-8\">(1) the decision of the Commission is presumed to be prima facie correct; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-9\">(2) the party challenging the decision has the burden of proof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">As Maryland courts have interpreted this provision, when a claimant prevails before the Commission and the matter comes before the circuit court, the administrative decision is the claimant\u2019s prima facie case. <em>Kelly, </em>391 Md. at 75-76, 891 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>A.2d 1103; <em>Smith v. Howard County, </em>177 Md.App. 327, 338, 935 A.2d 450 (2007). As such, the claimant generally cannot suffer a summary judgment or a directed verdict against the employee on the grounds that he or she failed to produce a prima facie case. <em>Smith, </em>177 Md.App. at 338, 935 A.2d 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">There are some important exceptions to this rule. Prima facie correctness is denied to a Commission decision not based on its actual \u201cconsideration of conflicting evidence as to essential facts or the deduction of permissible but diverse inferences therefrom....\u201d <em>Moore v. Clarke, </em>171 Md. 39, 45, 187 A. 887 (1936). <em>See Kelly, </em>391 Md. at 75-77, 891 A.2d 1103; <em>Smith, </em>177 Md.App. at 338, 935 A.2d 450. In addition, the Commission\u2019s decision does not make the claimant\u2019s prima facie case if the agency did not have before it \u201cthe minimum evidence necessary to support an award.\u201d <em>Dove v. Montgomery County, </em>178 Md.App. 702, 724-25, 943 A.2d 662 <em>(2008)(quoting Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, </em>\u00a7 130.06[3][a](2006)). This burden is \u201cslight,\u201d <em>Smith, </em>177 Md.App. at 332, 935 A.2d 450, but means at least \u201cproving a case beyond speculation and conjecture.\u201d <em>Larson, supra </em>at \u00a7 130.06[l][a] and [3][a], Finally, a Commission decision would not be invulnerable from attack by summary judgment if the contention raised is a legal ground. <em>Kelly, </em>391 Md. at 78, 891 A.2d 1103; <em>Marshall v. Univ. of Md. Med. Sys. Corp., </em>161 Md.App. 379, 382, 869 A.2d 391 (2005). We find none of these exceptions applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">2. Conflicting Evidence/Legal Grounds</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">This was a contested case before the Commission. Medical evidence was offered by both sides, with sharp disagreement over whether Dupuytren\u2019s contracture was an occupational disease and whether the condition arose from Bridgett\u2019s employment as a firefighter/rescue diver. <em>See </em>pp. 3-4 <em>supra. </em>The claimant also testified on these matters. In addition, the issues of whether the appellant had an occupational disease under \u00a7 9-101(g) of the L &amp; E Article and of whether it was compensable under \u00a7 9-502(d)(l)(i) were primarily fact-driven and were not purely questions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>3. Minimum Evidence Before the Commission</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">To address the question of whether there was minimum evidence before the Commission to support its award, we first consider whether Dupuytren\u2019s contracture could ever be an occupational disease.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Although this issue' may be a novel one in Maryland, a cursory review of out-of-state cases discloses that the question was first litigated more than 75 years ago, <em>see John Reardon\u2019s Case, </em>275 Mass. 24, 175 N.E. 149 (1931), and continues to be contested today, <em>see Hollingsworth v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>183 N.C.App. 154, 643 S.E.2d 675, 2007 WL 1247050 (N.C.App.2007),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> with mixed results.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">In <em>John Reardon\u2019s Case, supra, </em>the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts rejected the workers\u2019 compensation claim of a moulder, noting that Dupuytren\u2019s contracture \u201cis not a condition peculiar to the trade of a moulder; it is occasioned by any. work continued over a period of years that requires the grasping of any article which causes a continuous pressure upon the palm of the hand.\u201d 175 N.E. at 150. In <em>Ehman v. Dept. of Labor &amp; Indus., 33 </em>Wash.2d 584, 206 P.2d 787 (1949), the Supreme Court of Washington upheld an administrative order denying compensation to an employee who claimed to have developed Dupuytren\u2019s contracture because, for more than 20 years, he lifted and carried bundles of wooden flooring. After summarizing evidence in the record that \u201cmany persons suffer from the disease who have not been engaged in occupations which would be likely to result in traumatic injury to the hands,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 791, the appellate court said that \u201c[t]he most that can be said is that respondent\u2019s unfortunate physical condition may be or possibly is an occupational disease. This is not sufficient ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 797. <em>See also Berlett v. State, </em>20 Ill. Ct. Cl. 238 (1951)(denying benefits to an employee who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>claimed to have developed Dupuytren\u2019s contracture from operating a jack hammer).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">On the other side of the ledger is <em>Walsh v. Kotler, </em>43 N.J.Super. 139, 127 A.2d 918 (Sup.Ct.1956), where a New Jersey court found that an employee\u2019s Dupuytren\u2019s contracture \u201cwas precipitated, and then aggravated and accelerated by his work as a roofer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 922. In <em>In re: Rogan v. Charles F. Noyes, Inc., </em>10 A.D.2d 765, 197 N.Y.S.2d 758 (1960), a New York court upheld a worker\u2019s compensation award to a porter who suffered from Dupuytren\u2019s contracture. And in <em>Hollingsworth, supra, </em>the Court of Appeals of North Carolina held that a decision of the North Carolina Industrial Commission that a first-stage tire builder developed Dupuytren\u2019s contracture from his occupation was supported by medical evidence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See also Larson\u2019s at </em>\u00a7 52.06[3],</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Perhaps the best explanation for this diversity of opinion is found in <em>In re: Hickey v. Ardale Bldg. Corp., </em>15 A.D.2d 837, 224 N.Y.S.2d 939, 940 (1962), when the court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-6\">It is obvious that all cases involving Dupuytren\u2019s contracture are not necessarily compensable. Nor does the fact that the claimant\u2019s actions involved the use of his hands necessarily dictate recovery. In each instance it is for the board <em>on the basis of the evidence before it </em>to determine if the necessary causal relationship has been established. (Emphasis added.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">In short, the authorities would seem to indicate that there is no <em>per se </em>exclusion of Dupuytren\u2019s contracture from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>category of occupational diseases and that whether it is a risk of a particular occupation turns on the facts of each case. This caselaw also suggests that it was not beyond speculation and conjecture for the Workers\u2019 Compensation Commission, after weighing the conflicting evidence before it\u2014much like that considered in the above cases\u2014to find that Bridgett had suffered from an occupational disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">4. Compensability of the Occupational Disease</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The key issue in this case is whether the Commission had before it minimum evidence that Bridgett\u2019s Dupuytren\u2019s contracture was due to the nature of an employment in which hazards of the occupational disease exist. Montgomery County suggests the issue is primarily one of statutory construction. However, whether an occupational disease is compensable under \u00a7 9\u2014502(d)(l)(i) of the L &amp; E Article is primarily controlled by the facts. This is no more evident than in <em>King, supra, </em>the case relied on by the circuit court in its summary judgment ruling and by the appellee here.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\"><em>King </em>involved an overworked transportation assistant for the county board of education performing the jobs of three people in scheduling the transportation of school children. She filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim, asserting that, as a result of her employment, she suffered a stress-induced mental condition. Her contention was rejected by the Commission, by the circuit court, by this Court, and the Court of Appeals. The claimant was held not to satisfy the standards of \u00a7 9-502(d)(l)(i) that her condition was \u201cdue to the nature of an employment in which hazards of the occupational disease exist.\u201d Specifically, the Court of Appeals noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">King can not satisfy this threshold requirement. Her evidence and arguments before both the Commission and the circuit court indicate that she was an overworked employee in a mismanaged position. She presented no direct evidence that the stress-related illnesses of somatization disorder and/or major depression were somehow inherent in the nature of the position of transportation assistant. Nor did she present' evidence that these illnesses would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>occur in equal frequency in any other occupation in which employees were overworked and/or mismanaged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-4\">Instead of presenting evidence of the hazards inherent in the occupation of transportation assistant, King presented evidence of the hazards in her specific job. Such evidence is consistent with her claim that when the Legislature used the phrase \u201cdue to the nature of an employment in which hazards of the occupational disease exist,\u201d it intended to equate \u201cemployment\u201d with a specific job. This argument is contrary to Maryland law. \u201cEmployment\u201d in the context of \u00a7 9\u2014502(d)(l)(i) does not mean the specific job in which the person is working; it means the profession or general occupation in which the person is engaged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-5\">Because King failed to present any evidence that somatization disorder and/or major depression may be reasonably characterized as due to the general character of her employment as a transportation assistant, the circuit court properly granted Respondent\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">354 Md. at 381-82, 731 A.2d 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">There is a critical difference between <em>King </em>and this case. The claimant in <em>King </em>did not have the evidentiary boost of a Commission award. That award can defeat summary judgment even if the evidence before the Commission was \u201cslight.\u201d <em>See </em>p. 10, <em>supra. </em>In <em>King, </em>without a favorable Commission decision, the claimant had to show more, because the mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiffs claim is insufficient to preclude the grant of summary judgment. <em>Beatty v. Trailmaster Prods., Inc., </em>330 Md. 726, 738, 625 A.2d 1005 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">There is also a dramatic variance between the two cases with respect to the nature and strength of the evidence. <em>King </em>was a case where the claimant\u2019s stress-related condition arose from a mismanaged position and her individual susceptibility, not from the performance of duties inherent in the occupation. In Bridgett\u2019s case, according to evidence before the Commission, the claimant was doing exactly what his position re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>quired. The claimant testified how he had to use his hands to hold ropes in river rescue operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">On the basis of <em>King, </em>the County argues that \u201coveruse of the hands\u201d is not a hazard of the general occupation of firefighters any more than it is of any other employment and that river rescue duty was Bridgett\u2019s \u201cspecific job,\u201d not his \u201cgeneral employment.\u201d However, although appellant attempted to connect Dupuytren\u2019s contracture with the duties of a firefighter, his stronger (and alternative) contention was that the condition stemmed from his rescue duties, a clearly legitimate subclass of the County\u2019s Fire <em>and </em>Rescue Services. <em>See </em>pp. 1-2, <em>supra. </em>And his medical evidence appeared to confirm that connection. Dr. Berdia stated that \u201cgrasping and pulling ropes\u201d resulted in \u201ceither trauma or overuse of the palmar skin\u201d and was an \u201cinciting event\u201d for the development of Dupuytren\u2019s contracture.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Nor can appellee draw solace from <em>King\u2019s </em>reference to the transportation assistant\u2019s failure to present evidence that her mental illness \u201cwould not occur in equal frequency in any other occupation.\u201d 354 Md. at 381, 731 A.2d 460. In context, this statement could be reasonably read as simply describing another way the claimant could have shown that the hazards of the condition were \u201cinherent\u201d in the position of transportation assistant\u2014an evidentiary gap that is not apparent in the Commission\u2019s decision here.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>In summary, there was at least a minimum amount of evidence before the Commission on the compensability of Bridgett\u2019s Dupuytren\u2019s contracture. It was not beyond speculation and conjecture for the agency to conclude that the hazard of developing this condition was inherent in the claimant\u2019s position as a rescue diver. Because there was nothing clearly deficient about the Commission\u2019s decision in Bridgett\u2019s case, the agency\u2019s award was prima facie correct and sufficient to defeat appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In so concluding, we express no view on the appropriate outcome of this litigation after a full trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY REVERSED.

As a firefighter over the last 35 years how did you use your right hand?</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">A. Multi-tasking: grabbing, removing ceilings, pulling hoses, pulling myself into the fire truck, grasping, pulling items.

Explain to Commissioner Sfekas what it means to be a public safety diver for Montgomery County Department of Fire and Rescue.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-12\">A. As a public safety diver for Montgomery County you recover victims' bodies, evidence for the police department. Anything that falls in the water dial needs to be recovered, the public safety diver would be trained to do that. We dive in zero visibility water. All of your items you find are visualized with your hands, so it\u2019s all hand manipulation under water. You can see nothing. You find things with your hands and determine what they are.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-13\">Q. Is there also rope involvement as a rescue diver?</p>\n<p id=\"b641-14\">A.
