Appellant\u2019s complaint further alleged breach of contract on the part of JIA and asserted claims of conversion, fraud, intentional misrepresentation and breach of contract against Paula Harrison and Steven Siegel. On November 13, 2006, the negligence claim against Chesapeake Bank was dismissed. On June 21, 2007, the circuit court entered default judgments against Harrison and Siegel, neither of whom are parties to this appeal. On October 4, 2007, the circuit court awarded summary judgment in favor of JIA on the breach of contract claim. In addition, on October 4, 2007, the circuit court stayed a cross claim filed by Chesapeake Bank against Middleburg Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">On October 31, 2007, the circuit court entered an order granting appellees\u2019 motions <em>in limine </em>and precluding appellant from introducing evidence at trial that appellant first disclosed after the discovery deadline. The circuit court subsequently denied appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">A bench trial on the conversion claims against appellees and the remaining negligence claim against Middleburg Bank commenced on May 6, 2008. At the close of appellant\u2019s case-in-chief, the circuit court granted judgment in favor of appellees on all counts and denied appellant\u2019s motion for judgment on the conversion claims. Appellant appeals from the judgments against it<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and presents four questions for our review, which we have rephrased, reordered and consolidated as follows:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>I. Did the circuit court abuse its discretion by precluding appellant from using evidence that it first disclosed after the court-ordered discovery deadline?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-5\">II. Did the circuit court erroneously conclude that appellant, one of multiple payees of a check, had the initial burden, under \u00a7 3-420(b) of the Commercial Law Article,[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] of proving its actual interest in the proceeds of the instrument?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">III. Did the circuit court err by granting appellee Middle-burg Bank\u2019s motion for judgment on appellant\u2019s negligence claim on the grounds that appellant failed to adduce expert testimony regarding banking industry standards?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">For the reasons that follow, we answer the first question in the negative and the second and third questions in the affirmative. Accordingly, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s judgment in relation to appellant\u2019s discovery violations but reverse the circuit court\u2019s judgments in favor of appellees on appellant\u2019s conversion and negligence claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">PROCEDURAL &amp; FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">This case involves claims of conversion and negligence brought by a payee against a depositary bank and a payor bank in relation to the payment of a check bearing a forged indorsement. An agreed stipulation of facts, which was jointly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>submitted at trial by appellant and appellees, provides the following factual background:</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">JIA provided insurance coverage on a property located at 123 Ninth Avenue in Brunswick, Maryland, pursuant to the terms of an insurance policy. Appellant was listed on the \u201cDeclarations Page\u201d of the insurance policy as the \u201cfirst mortgagee and/or loss payee.\u201d Harrison and Siegel were named as the insureds on the insurance policy. On the same \u201cDeclarations Page,\u201d the insurance policy also identified American General Financial Services (American General) as the \u201csecond mortgagee and/or loss payee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Following an April 27, 2005 fire on the property, Harrison and Siegel submitted an insurance claim to JIA in relation to the fire loss. After adjusting the claim, JIA determined that it would pay the $ 140,000 policy limit for damage to the property, pursuant to the terms of the insurance policy. Consequently, on May 13, 2005, JIA, the drawer,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> issued a check in the face amount of $140,000, made payable to the order of \u201cPAULA HARRISON and STEVEN SIEGEL and SAXON MORTGAGE SERVICE and AMERICAN GENERAL FINANCIAL SERVICES ITS SUCCESSORS, AND/OR ASSIGNS, ATIMA.\u201d JIA included appellant on the check because appellant was named as the first mortgagee and/or loss payee under the insurance policy. American General was also named by JIA as a co-payee because of its status as the second mortgagee and/or loss payee under the insurance policy. The parties stipulated that the term \u201cATIMA\u201d stood for the phrase, \u201cas their interests may appear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">JIA\u2019s adjuster, Joe Zynel, hand-delivered the check to Harrison. On May 19, 2005, the law firm of Dunlap Grubb Weaver and Whitbeck, P.C. (the Dunlap Firm) endorsed the check and presented it for deposit to Middleburg Bank in Leesburg, Virginia, thus casting Middleburg Bank in the role <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>of \u201cdepositary bank,\u201d as far as the subject check is concerned, from that point forward.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although the stipulation of facts does not explain why the Dunlap Firm, which has never been a party to this case, endorsed the check, appellant\u2019s opening statement at trial suggested that Harrison may have endorsed the check to an attorney at the Dunlap Firm. The Dunlap Firm also held an account at Middleburg Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Although appellant neither indorsed the check nor authorized any person to indorse the check on its behalf, the word \u201cSaxon\u201d was handwritten on the back of the check. Middle-burg Bank accepted the check for deposit, without contacting either appellant or JIA to confirm the validity of the purported indorsement. Middleburg Bank delivered the check to its intermediary bank. The check was ultimately transferred through the Federal Reserve Bank to Chesapeake Bank, where Chesapeake Bank electronically debited $140,000 from JIA\u2019s account. Chesapeake Bank thus became, for our purposes, the drawee, or payor, bank.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A sum of $140,000 was ultimately credited to the Dunlap Firm account at Middleburg Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Upon learning that the check was deposited and paid without appellant\u2019s indorsement, appellant contacted JIA and requested that JIA offer appellant a replacement payment for the check. Once JIA became aware that appellant neither indorsed nor authorized indorsement of the check and that appellant had never received any of the proceeds of the check, JIA contacted Chesapeake Bank, which informed JIA that Middleburg Bank had accepted the check as if it were fully indorsed. Chesapeake Bank refused JIA\u2019s demand to credit its account for $140,000. JIA, in turn, declined appellant\u2019s request for a replacement payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>After appellant filed its complaint in this case, Middleburg Bank instituted an action against Harrison, Siegel and the Dunlap Firm in the Circuit Court for Loudoun County, Virginia. That action was still pending at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">A series of pretrial proceedings disposed of various claims originally filed by appellant and the case proceeded to trial on (1) appellant\u2019s conversion claims against Middleburg Bank and Chesapeake Bank, under the Maryland Uniform Commercial Code, and (2) appellant\u2019s negligence claim against Middleburg Bank. Evidence was adduced establishing that, in September 2003, Harrison granted a deed of trust on the property to First Franklin Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation, which, in turn, loaned Harrison $153,000. Appellant\u2019s Senior Claims Representative, Paul McAllister, testified during his deposition that First Franklin Mortgage Loan Trust 2003-FF5 assigned the deed of trust and note<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to Wells Fargo Bank\u2019 National Association (Wells Fargo Bank), which then held the note and deed of trust in a \u201ctrust\u201d capacity. McAllister further testified at trial that appellant was the mortgage servicer for Wells Fargo Bank and was responsible for obtaining the insurance money paid by JIA on this insurance claim. Appellees disputed appellant\u2019s interest in the check and the amount of damages incurred by appellant as a result of the payment on the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Additional facts shall be discussed, as required, throughout the remainder of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">LEGAL ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"A28\">I</p>\n<p id=\"AoR\">Discovery Violations &amp; Exclusion of Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">Appellant assigns error to the circuit court\u2019s decision to grant appellees\u2019 motions <em>in limine, </em>precluding appellant from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>introducing, in any proceeding before the court, any reference to certain documents and information produced by appellant after July 20, 2007, the deadline by which discovery was to have been completed. Appellant further challenges the circuit court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration, which requested that the circuit court reconsider its ruling granting appellees\u2019 motions <em>in limine. </em>In order to address the merits of appellant\u2019s arguments, we first review the timeline of events forming the backdrop of the discovery dispute between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Discovery Deadlines</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Appellant\u2019s complaint was filed on July 27, 2006.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Throughout 2006, various pre-trial matters were submitted to and addressed by the court. On March 21, 2007, the circuit court entered a scheduling order requiring that discovery be completed at least seventy-five days prior to the August 21, 2007 trial date or by June 7, 2007. On May 14, 2007, the circuit court extended the discovery deadline to July 7, 2007. In a subsequent order, the circuit court extended the discovery deadline to July 20, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">Discovery Requests &amp; Motion for Protective Order</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">On June 6, 2007, Middleburg Bank propounded interrogatories and served a request for production of documents on appellant. On June 28, 2007, Middleburg Bank served a notice of deposition, expressing its intent to depose appellant\u2019s corporate designee. Through these combined discovery requests, Middleburg Bank sought the disclosure of information pertaining to the following topics:<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>1. The purported assignment of (a) the Adjustable Rate Note dated September 22, 2003, attached as Exhibit A to the Complaint (\u201cNote\u201d) and (ii) Deed of Trust dated September 22, 2003, attached as Exhibit B to the Complaint (\u201cDeed of Trust\u201d) to Wells Fargo Bank National Association, as Trustee (\u201cWells Fargo\u201d) for First Franklin Mortgage Loan Trust 2003-FF5 (\u201cFF Trust\u201d);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">2.

[Appellant\u2019s] purported status as the current \u201cholder of the Note;\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">5. All communications between [appellant], on the one hand, and defendants, Paula M. Harrison (\u201cHarrison\u201d) and/or Steven H. Siegel a/k/a Steven H. Seigel (\u201cSiegel\u201d), as well as their agents and representatives, on the other, concerning, (a) the Note, (b) the Deed of Trust, (c) any application by Harrison to refinance prior indebtedness secured by the Property (for the purported purpose of refinancing an existing Deed of Trust recorded in Liber 2110 folio 555), (d) insurance coverage for the Property, (c) the fire that occurred on or about April 27, 2005 (\u201cFire\u201d) at that property located at 123 Ninth Avenue, Brunswick, Maryland (\u201cProperty\u201d), (f) any proof of loss concerning the Fire, (g) that $140,000 JIA check dated May 13, 2005 (\u201cCheck\u201d), (h) restoration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>the Property and/or (i) breach of the Note and/or the Deed of Trust.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-5\">10. [Appellant\u2019s] relationship or arrangement with First Franklin or FF Trust regarding the Note, the Deed of Trust, and the Complaint; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">11. [Appellant\u2019s] purported damages, including any claim for attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">On July 6, 2007, appellant also filed a Motion for a Protective Order, pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-403, alleging that appellant was prohibited from providing Middleburg Bank with responses to its discovery requests. Specifically, appellant argued that Middleburg Bank sought the disclosure of \u201cprivate financial information about [appellant\u2019s] customer with third parties,\u201d information that was, according to appellant, protected under the \u201cGramm-Leach-Bliliey [sic] Act, 15 U.S.C. Section 6801 <em>et. al. </em>[sic]\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Appellant asked the court to enter an order \u201cstriking all discovery request [sic] for financial information related to [appellant\u2019s] customer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">On July 16, 2007, appellant filed \u201c[Appellant\u2019s] Responses to ... Middleburg Bank\u2019s First Set of Interrogatories,\u201d in which it raised a general objection to the interrogatories \u201cto the extent that they seek information [that] is protected by the Gramm-Leach-Bliliey Act, 15 U.S.C. Section 6801 <em>et </em>al.\u201d Additionally, appellant asserted that Middleburg Bank\u2019s interrogatory requests attempted to obtain irrelevant information \u201cwhich is not likely to lead to the discovery of any admissible evidence.\u201d Notwithstanding these objections, appellant indicated that \u201cvarious employees of [appellant] has [sic] information concerning the above listed topics\u201d and that, \u201c[m]ore specifically,\u201d Paul McAllister, appellant\u2019s Senior Claims Rep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>resentative, had information or knowledge concerning appellant\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Deposition of Appellant\u2019s Corporate Designee</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">On July 19, 2007, one day before the discovery deadline, appellees deposed McAllister, who testified at the deposition in his capacity as appellant\u2019s corporate designee. Appellant\u2019s counsel noted that the circuit court had yet to rule on the pending Motion for Protective Order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">Before\u2014before we start with [Chesapeake Bank\u2019s counsel and JIA\u2019s counsel], I\u2014the notice of deposition was only sent by Middleburg. I don\u2019t have any objection to you asking questions. Just so that you know that we did file a motion of protective order and so we are going to object to any line of questioning regarding any private financial information which relates to the borrower Paula Harrison. So refrain from asking those questions as long as\u2014and we also filed an objection as to any line of irrelevant questions, not that you would ask any, but just so that it would be limited to the allegations of the complaint and notice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">As forewarned, appellant\u2019s counsel objected to deposition questioning that she characterized as being subject to the pending Motion for Protective Order. Notably, appellant\u2019s counsel did not object when McAllister testified that (1) he was \u201cnever given a copy of the adjuster\u2019s report of damages to know what the total amount of the damages were,\u201d (2) he never tried to determine whether $140,000 could have rebuilt a house on the subject property and (3) he had no knowledge of any damages that his company claimed in the lawsuit. Similarly, appellant\u2019s counsel declined to object when McAllister testified that (1) appellant was not the holder of the note but rather a \u201cservicer\u201d to Wells Fargo Bank, who acted in its capacity as trustee for First Franklin Mortgage Loan Trust 2003-FF5 and (2) he did not know whether a power of attorney existed between Wells Fargo and appellant as it pertained to the Paula Harrison note.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>D</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Post-Discovery Deadline Disclosures</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">On August 7, 2007, approximately eighteen days after the July 20, 2007 discovery deadline, the circuit court denied appellant\u2019s pending Motion for Protective Order.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">On August 8, 2007, fourteen days after the close of discovery, but four days prior to the court\u2019s denial of the Motion for Protective Order, appellant served a copy of its Motion for Summary Judgment on the parties to this ease.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Appellant argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that summary judgment should be granted against appellees on the conversion claims and against Middle-burg Bank on the negligence claim. In support of its argument, appellant attached a notarized affidavit that was <em>dated </em>August 1, 2007 (twelve days after the close of discovery) and signed by Michael McCreary on behalf of appellant. In this affidavit, McCreary attested that the value of the property decreased from $215,000 before the fire to $50,000 after the fire. McCreary further asserted that Harrison was in default of her mortgage loan, which had a payoff amount, at the time of the affidavit, of $213,034.33. In addition, McCreary attested that (1) the note and deed of trust on the Property were held by First Franklin Corporation with a corporate assignment to Wells Fargo Bank National Association, First Franklin\u2019s trustee and (2) appellant was Wells Fargo\u2019s attorney-in-fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">On August 13, 2007, appellant filed its opposition to summary judgment motions submitted by appellees and JIA, attaching, as an exhibit, another affidavit signed by McCreary. This affidavit, however, was dated August 10, 2007, twenty-one days after the close of discovery and three days after the circuit court issued its order denying appellant\u2019s Motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Protective Order. This second McCreary affidavit repeated much of the same information initially presented in McCreary\u2019s first affidavit. However, rather than giving a specific figure as to the alleged debt owed on the property, the second affidavit provided that, \u201cat the time of the fire loss on April 27, 20\u00d35, the unpaid principal, interest and payments of taxes and assessments by the mortgagee as well as all foreclosure cost was over $140,000.\u201d In addition to this second affidavit, appellant attached a signed power of attorney. Notably, this power of attorney was created on July 20, 2007, the day after McAllister testified at his deposition that he did not know if a power of attorney existed between appellant and Wells Fargo. The power of attorney purportedly gave appellant the right to act on behalf of Wells Fargo in servicing mortgage loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">This phase of the discovery dispute timeline is critical to our analysis. In its appeal to this court, appellant repeatedly emphasizes that it waited to disclose the \u201csupplemental discovery\u201d until after the circuit court ruled on its pending Motion for Protective Order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">The discovery deadline, according to a consent order, was July 20, 2007. The [circuit court] did not rule upon the Motion for Protective Order until August 13, 2007, which was substantially after the deadline to serve responses to the Bank\u2019s requests. After the [circuit court\u2019s] denial of the Motion for Protective Order, [appellant] served supplemental discovery documents and [affidavits to the Banks which were responsive to the Bank\u2019s requests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Appellant\u2019s position is not supported by the record. To be sure, McCreary\u2019s second affidavit was first disclosed after the denial of appellant\u2019s Motion for Protective Order. However, appellant neglects to mention the existence of McCreary\u2019s first affidavit, which was created and filed <em>after </em>the discovery deadline but <em>before </em>the court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s Motion for Protective Order. McCreary\u2019s first affidavit disclosed information requested by Middleburg during discovery and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>nearly identical to his second affidavit.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Motions <em>in Limine</em></p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">On August 15, 2007, JIA filed a motion <em>in limine, </em>requesting that appellant be prevented from introducing evidence regarding the mortgage debt at the time of the fire loss, a fact first disclosed by appellant in McCreary\u2019s post-discovery deadline affidavit. On August 29, 2007, Chesapeake Bank filed a similar motion <em>in limine.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Middleburg Bank\u2019s motion <em>in limine, </em>filed on similar grounds, followed on October 15, 2007. Appellees repeated JIA\u2019s objections to appellant\u2019s post-discovery disclosure of the amount due on the mortgage and further emphasized that the power of attorney, which purportedly appointed appellant as Wells Fargo\u2019s attorney-in-fact, should also be excluded on the grounds that it was not timely disclosed by appellant despite Middleburg Bank\u2019s discovery requests. According to appellees, appellant was bound by the deposition testimony of McAllister, its corporate designee, and could not now remedy the deficiencies in his testimony, either as to damages or as to appellant\u2019s relationship to Wells Fargo, the noteholder, by producing documents subsequent to the discovery deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">Not surprisingly, appellant opposed these motions <em>in limine, </em>asserting, in part, that the \u201cdelayed disclosure by [appellant] related to any information regarding the debt amount <em>was completely due </em>to compliance with the GrammLeach-Bliliey Act.\u201d Appellant stressed that, once the court ruled on its Motion for Protective Order, appellant \u201c[was] now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>able to disclose such information without violating the federal statute.\u201d In its opposition to the motions <em>in limine </em>filed by JIA and Chesapeake Bank, appellant added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-5\">Nonetheless, [JIA &amp; Chesapeake Bank] fail to show how they are prejudiced by [appellant\u2019s] showing the amount owed on the mortgage debt after discovery. Contrary to [their] belief, the measure of [appellant\u2019s] damages does not relate to Defendant Harrison\u2019s debt amount under the mortgage loan. The Complaint is seeking damages against [appellees] based upon the value of the Check which is $140,000, not the amount due under the Note.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AE6\">According to appellant, McAllister\u2019s July 19, 2007 deposition testimony was not deficient. Appellant stressed that McAllister provided appellees with names of other employees who could answer specific questions and that appellees did not \u201cbother to schedule a deposition\u201d of those employees or file a motion to compel discovery. Appellant asserted that appellees were not prejudiced by the late disclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">On October 4, 2007, the circuit court granted JIA\u2019s motion for summary judgment against appellant, which disposed of appellant\u2019s breach of contract claim against JIA and denied all remaining summary judgment motions. The court also scheduled a hearing on October 25, 2007, to address the merits of the various pending motions <em>in limine. </em>On October 9, 2007, shortly after the October 4 hearing, appellant produced what appellees characterize as \u201c[seventy-six] pages of information concerning the account of Harrison.\u201d Although those documents are not clearly identified in the record, appellant does not dispute this fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">At the October 25, 2007 hearing on the pending motions <em>in limine, </em>the circuit court heard argument from counsel and granted appellees\u2019 motions <em>in limine: </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>I quite frankly don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with this case. When I look at all of the, that\u2019s happened, I am disturbed by the timing of things____ This suit was filed by [appellant] in July of 2006. The trial date was originally scheduled for August 21 st, 200[7], The original discovery cutoff date pursuant to the scheduling order would have been in June, some time in the very beginning of June 2007. [\u00b6]... ] Counsel working with each other knew that they weren\u2019t gonna be able to get things done by that time and issued a consent motion to extend the deadlines to July 20th, all of which is appropriate and is reasonable. What the Court is being asked to do today is to say, to grant a motion <em>in limine </em>to prevent [appellant] from introducing an affidavit of Michael McCleer\u2014McCreery (phonetic), dated August 10th, 2007 and the substance of those facts which apparently differ from his testimony given at deposition the day before the discovery [deadline].[<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>] The limited power of attorney dated July 20th, 2007, which could not have, if it was produced on July 20th, it must have been, since it was just created on July 20th it had to be created and then faxed or something over to the parties and then the documents produced October 9th, which includes the representations of counsel that that includes information regarding the attorney\u2019s fees and, and an additional loan, loan agreements, that documentation and including, I certainly agree that attorney\u2019s fees accrue up until the day of trial. However, [appellant] knew what they\u2019d spent so far. That should have been disclosed prior to the discovery cutoff date, and it is more the substance and the timing of the affidavit of Mr. McCreery (phonetic) and after being produced as the corporate designee that is troubling to the Court. [Appellant] had an obligation to produce people with the information that is legitimately requested. [\u00b6]... ] therefore, I\u2019m gonna grant the motion <em>in limine </em>filed by both [appellees].</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>The circuit court later clarified that its ruling extended only to the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-5\">[The] [affidavit of Michael McCreery (phonetic) including the substance of the facts contained in those documents, the limited power of attorney dated July 20th, and the 76 pages of documents produced on October 9th, 2007, any additional information or documents not disclosed by [appellant] prior to July 20th, 2007. <em>Anything that existed prior to that date, that all comes in. </em>Just granted the motion as to those items[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">(Emphasis added).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> An order was entered memorializing this ruling on October 31, 2007. The order reflected that, along with the aforementioned documents, appellant was barred from \u201c[introducing in any proceeding before this Court evidence contrary to the testimony of its corporate designee Paul McAllister.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">F</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">Motion for Reconsideration</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">Appellant subsequently filed a Motion for Reconsideration, on November 8, 2007, arguing that the court\u2019s order granting appellees\u2019 motions <em>in limine </em>penalized appellant for complying with a federal statute and was overbroad. As to the breadth of the order, appellant contended that, because the order excluded the substance of all facts contained in McCreary\u2019s August 10 affidavit, the court succeeded in also excluding facts that were, according to appellant, either timely disclosed, consistent with McAllister\u2019s deposition testimony or never requested by appellees. Specifically, as to the portion of McCreary\u2019s affidavit that stated that the foreclosure at the time of the fire loss was over $ 140,000, appellant asserted that this fact had never been requested by appellees.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>further asserted that under the holding of <em>Taliaferro v. State, </em>295 Md. 376, 456 A.2d 29 (1983), the discovery sanction of precluding McCreary\u2019s affidavit in its entirety was inappropriate, because, according to appellant, the delay in disclosure was due to the court\u2019s pending disposition of the Motion for Protective Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Subsequent to the filing of appellant\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration, but prior to any ruling on that motion, a Scheduling Order dated November 13, 2007 extended the discovery deadline in the case to March 22, 2008. Appellant filed an amended Motion for Reconsideration, in which it alleged that, in light of the new discovery deadline, appellant\u2019s disclosures were, in fact, timely; consequently, appellees suffered no prejudice. Appellees jointly filed a motion to strike all provisions of the scheduling order, other than the provision setting the May 6-7, 2008 trial date. On December 17, 2007, in two separate orders, the circuit court granted appellees\u2019 motion to strike the extended discovery deadline and denied appellant\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">G</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">McAllister testified on behalf of appellant at trial. During his direct examination, appellant\u2019s counsel attempted to elicit testimony regarding the extent of damages owed to appellant as a result of the fire. McAllister was permitted to testify, over the objections of opposing parties, that appellant, as the mortgage servicer for the first lienholder of the property, was responsible for obtaining insurance money paid by JIA on the insurance claim. However, the circuit court sustained objections to his testimony as to \u201chow\u201d appellant was injured by the facts of this case. The circuit court noted on the record that it sustained the objection to this testimony on the grounds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>provided by appellees\u2019 counsel, namely, that such testimony would be \u201cinconsistent with prior testimony\u201d and was excluded by the motion <em>in limine.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">McAllister subsequently testified that he recalled stating, during his deposition, that he did not know if there were any damages. When appellant\u2019s counsel asked, \u201cWhen you were answering that question at the time of the deposition ... did you mean to testify that [appellant] did not incur any damages?\u201d, the circuit court sustained objections to the question and ruled: \u201c[McAllister] said he didn\u2019t know [if appellant sustained any damages]. Not whether they had any [damages] or not. So and in light of my, my ruling on the <em>lim\u2014in limine </em>motion, sustain.\u201d McAllister was permitted, however, to testify that he had, at the deposition, identified the name of an individual working for appellant who had a \u201cbetter idea\u201d about the damages incurred in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">After further objections were lodged by appellees, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay. Your Honor, we have our opportunity to clarify his deposition testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq5\">[THE COURT]: As to what issue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: As to the issue as [sic] damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-9\">[THE COURT]: I\u2019d clarify, however I ruled <em>in limine </em>after the deposition that there would not be ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-10\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Any inconsistent testimony. However, what these, these questions\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-11\">[THE COURT]: And he said he didn\u2019N-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]:\u2014lead to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-12\">[THE COURT]:\u2014know of any damages at the time of deposition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-13\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Total damages. If I can have him review the, the actual question that was asked. This is not inconsistent with his testimony. He was, he did not know of any total damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-14\">[MIDDLEBURG\u2019S COUNSEL]: Well, now wait\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-15\">[THE COURT]: So wait\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>[MIDDLEBURG\u2019S COUNSEL]:\u2014this is unfair. I asked him the question do you have knowledge, Mr. McAllister, of the damages that your company claims in this lawsuit? Answer: Total damages? No sir. Question: Any damages? Answer: No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor, the following question is, the following testimony is that he identified someone at Saxon with the information. At that time he did not have personal knowledge of what the total damages of\u2014 [THE COURT]: [Appellant\u2019s counsel], I have already ruled on this issue. I will sustain that objection. I know you\u2019ve raised it again so you\u2019ve preserved it for the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">On redirect examination, appellant\u2019s counsel asked McAllister if he knew of any property damage from the fire or if any repairs were made on the property after the fire. Objections to both questions were sustained by the court on the grounds that any such knowledge would be either based on hearsay or beyond the scope of redirect.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">H</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">Propriety of Circuit Court\u2019s Ruling on Motions <em>in Limine &amp; </em>Motion for Reconsideration</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">Appellant discusses the holding of the Court of Appeals in <em>Taliaferro, supra, </em>and argues that the circuit court abused its discretion when it precluded the use of information disclosed by appellant subsequent to the discovery deadline. Appellant further argues that, even if the circuit court properly granted appellees\u2019 motions <em>in limine, </em>the scope of the <em>in limine </em>order was \u201cunjustifiably broad\u201d and prevented appellant from adducing evidence as to its damages in this case. We disagree with appellant on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">The circuit court granted appellees\u2019 motions <em>in limine </em>on the grounds that appellant\u2019s post-discovery disclosures should have been made available to appellees, in response to Middleburg Bank\u2019s discovery requests, prior to July 20, 2007, the discovery deadline that was agreed upon by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>parties and established by court order. We review the granting of a motion <em>in limine </em>for discovery violations under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Lowery v. Smithsburg Emergency Med. Serv., </em>173 Md.App. 662, 674, 920 A.2d 546 (2007) (citing <em>Heineman v. Bright, </em>124 Md.App. 1, 7, 720 A.2d 1182 (1998)). Trial judges are entrusted with a \u201clarge measure of discretion\u201d in applying sanctions for discovery violations. <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In exercising its discretion to apply discovery sanctions, a trial court must consider five factors outlined in <em>Taliaferro:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-5\">whether the disclosure violation was technical or substantial, the timing of the ultimate disclosure, the reason, if any, for the violation, the degree of prejudice to the parties respectively offering and opposing the evidence, whether any resulting prejudice might be cured by a postponement and, if so, the overall desirability of a continuance.[<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_\">295 Md. at 390-91, 456 A.2d 29. <em>See also Lowery, </em>173 Md.App. at 672, 920 A.2d 546; <em>Heineman, </em>124 Md.App. at 8, 720 A.2d 1182. While these factors frequently overlap and \u201cdo not lend themselves to a compartmental analysis,\u201d <em>Taliaferro, </em>295 Md. at 391, 456 A.2d 29, we shall use these factors as an analytical framework within which we shall address specific arguments raised by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>\n<em>i</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">Technical v. Substantial Violation</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Appellant concedes that the production of McCreary\u2019s affidavit and other \u201csupplemental discovery\u201d occurred after the July 20, 2007 discovery deadline. Appellant contends, however, that its post-deadline disclosures represent \u201ctechnical\u201d violations of the discovery rules, because the November 13, 2007 order, which \u201cextended\u201d the discovery deadline to March 22, 2008, rendered appellant\u2019s disclosures \u201ctechnically\u201d within the discovery period. The discovery provisions of that scheduling order, however, were stricken by the court in December 2007. Appellant\u2019s argument on this point is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">There can be little doubt that appellant\u2019s belated disclosures were material and relevant to appellees\u2019 ability to prepare a defense as to the amount of damages actually suffered by appellant. Middleburg\u2019s discovery requests asked appellant to disclose the type of information contained in McCreary\u2019s affidavits. Moreover, it was in McCreary\u2019s affidavits that appellant first disclosed any evidence regarding the current amount of debt owed on the property. Prior to the discovery deadline, however, appellant never identified McCreary as an individual with knowledge pertaining to Middleburg\u2019s discovery requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Apart from deposing McAllister, who was identified by appellant as its corporate designee and the person with knowledge and information pertaining to Middleburg\u2019s discovery requests, it is unclear how appellees would have been able to obtain such information prior to the discovery deadline. In light of the substance of these disclosures, appellant\u2019s violation of the discovery deadline cannot be said to be merely technical.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">\n<em>u</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">Reasons for Belated Discovery</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">Appellant stresses that its timely filed Motion for Protective Order was not ruled upon by the circuit court until August 7, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>2007. According to appellant, it believed that disclosure of financial information relative to Harrison, the mortgagor on the property, was prohibited by the federal borrower privacy statute. Appellant further contends that it \u201cserved its additional discovery responses and information to all [appellees] after the result of the [court\u2019s] ruling on [appellant\u2019s] Motion for Protective Order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">As the preceding timeline of events delineates, we cannot credit the reason proffered by appellant in its attempt to justify its discovery violations. McCreary\u2019s first affidavit was filed <em>before </em>the court ruled on the Motion for Protective Order. The contents of McCreary\u2019s second affidavit mirrored those of his first affidavit. Appellant, therefore, cannot be said to have waited until the court\u2019s disposition of its Motion for Protective Order before disclosing the substance of McCreary\u2019s second affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Appellant has provided us with no other reason explaining its motives in delaying disclosure of McCreary\u2019s affidavits. In light of the record in this case, we are constrained to reject appellant\u2019s argument on this point and conclude that appellant\u2019s delay in disclosure was unjustified. <em>See Hossainkhail v. Gebrehiwot, </em>143 Md.App.- 716, 726, 795 A.2d 816 (2002) (observing that the court may grant \u201clittle weight\u201d to an appellant\u2019s unsupported explanation for a discovery delay); <em>Lowery, </em>173 Md.App. at 676-77, 920 A.2d 546 (observing that, notwithstanding attempts to justify late disclosure, information was available to appellants before discovery deadline and could have been provided to appellees).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">We further observe that appellant\u2019s counsel represented to the circuit court, both in its opposition to Middleburg Bank\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>and at the October 25, 2007 hearing on the motions <em>in limine, </em>that appellant deliberately delayed disclosing seventy-six pages of financial documents pending a resolution of various summary judgment motions. Specifically, in its opposition to the motions <em>in limine, </em>appellant stated: \u201c[T]his court scheduled a dispositive motion hearing on Oct. 4, 2007, which possibly could have resolved all issues without trial <em>and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number><em>therefore, disclosure of additional information </em>(including updated attorney\u2019s fees and bills, tax statements and disclosure of borrower\u2019s social security number) <em>was delayed until the Court enforced a ruling on the dispositive motions.\u2019 </em>\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Appellant cannot deliberately disregard discovery orders because it anticipates the results of future summary judgment proceedings. This delay was unjustified and unreasonable. \u201cIf scheduling orders are to be permitted to be treated in such a casual fashion, why bother with them?\u201d <em>Naughton v. Bankier, </em>114 Md.App. 641, 653, 691 A.2d 712 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">\n<em>iii</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Timing of Disclosure, Degree of Prejudice &amp; Curative Postponement</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">The discovery period in this case was first extended, by court order, from June 7, 2007 to July 7, 2007. Another extension set the discovery deadline for July 20, 2007. Middleburg\u2019s discovery requests were served in June of 2007. McAllister\u2019s deposition was conducted on July 19, 2007. Appellees subsequently became apprised of the contents of McCreary\u2019s first affidavit on or around August 3, 2007, approximately fourteen days after the close of discovery. McCreary\u2019s second affidavit was filed along with appellant\u2019s oppositions to the summary judgment motions on August 13, 2007, approximately twenty-four days after the close of the discovery and six days following the circuit court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s Motion for Protective Order. The seventy-six pages of financial documents, disclosed by appellant on October 9, 2007, were made available to appellees over two months after the discovery deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] It was not until November 13, 2007 that trial in the matter was scheduled for May 2008. However, the absence of a set trial date, in and of itself, does not necessarily equate with lack of prejudice. <em>See Warehime v. Dell, </em>124 Md.App. 31, 49, 720 A.2d 1196 (1998). Indeed, the discovery deadline was scheduled by the court to precede the deadline for all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>dispositive summary judgment motions. By delaying the disclosure of information until appellant filed or responded to the summary judgment motions, appellant deprived appellees of information upon which they may have relied in support of their case for or against summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Moreover, Maryland Rule 2-412(d) provides that, upon notice and subpoena by a party seeking to depose a corporation, a corporate party shall designate one or more persons to testify on its behalf during depositions requested by an opposing party and that the \u201cpersons so designated shall testify as to matters known or reasonably available to the organization.\u201d Appellees both refer to the decision of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in <em>Rainey v. Am. Forest &amp; Paper Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>26 F.Supp.2d. 82, 94 (D.D.C.1998), wherein the Rainey Court held that, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(b)(6), the federal counterpart to Maryland Rule 2-412(d), \u201ca corporation cannot later proffer new or different allegations that could have been made at the time of the 30(b)(6) deposition\u201d of the corporation\u2019s designee, unless it can prove that the information was neither known nor accessible at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">We decline to address whether Maryland Rule 2-412 should be construed consistent with the reasoning in <em>Rainey </em>in all instances.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> However, we agree that appellant was on notice to prepare its designee to be able to give responsive answers on its behalf. <em>See Wilson v. Lakner, </em>228 F.R.D. 524, 528 (D.Md.2005) (\u201cThere can be no question that [Rule 30(b)(6)] imposes a \u2018duty to prepare the designee[ ] ... [that] goes beyond matters personally known to the designee or to matters in which that designee was personally involved.\u2019 \u201d) (citations omitted). McCreary\u2019s affidavits presented new informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>tion about the extent of the mortgage debt on the property, which was relevant in determining the extent of appellant\u2019s injury when it was prevented from recovering the insurance proceeds.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> There is an element of unfairness inherent in allowing appellant to disclose this information after the deposition of its corporate designee and the closure of discovery, when the opposing parties have justifiably relied on the corporate designee\u2019s deposition in developing their litigation strategies.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">Finally, in opposing appellees\u2019 motions <em>in limine, </em>appellant indicated that it would suffer little prejudice if the court excluded the contents of McCreary\u2019s affidavits. Specifically, appellant argued to the court that appellees \u201cfailed to show how they are prejudiced by [appellant\u2019s] showing the amount owed on the mortgage debt after discovery,\u201d because,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">[c]ontrary to [appellees\u2019] belief, the measure of [appellant\u2019s] damages <em>does not relate to Defendant Harrison\u2019s debt amount under the mortgage loan. </em>The Complaint is seeking damages against [appellees] based upon the value of the Check which is $140,000, not the amount due under the Note.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Notwithstanding the fact that this statement ignores that appellees may have chosen to present an alternative theory of damages in this case, appellant\u2019s statement further had the effect of informing the court that the content of McCreary\u2019s affidavit, at least as it pertained to the amount owed on the mortgage, was not relevant to appellant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Because the discovery violation was both unjustified and substantial in nature, and in light of the prejudice to appellees and lack of prejudice to appellant, we conclude that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in either granting appellees\u2019 motions <em>in limine </em>or denying appellant\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration. The circuit court was evidently troubled at the nature, substance and the timing of McCreary\u2019s August 10 affidavit and other subsequent disclosures, including the power of attorney produced one day after McAllister testified at his deposition that he was unaware of any power of attorney relationship between appellant and Wells Fargo as it pertained to the Harrison note.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The circuit court was clearly persuaded that appellant lacked a meritorious reason justifying its discovery violations. As we have explained, it cannot be credibly argued that appellant\u2019s disclosure was delayed because the court had yet to rule on its Motion for Protective Order. In light of the foregoing discussion, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Scope of <em>In Limine </em>Order</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Appellant next argues that, even if the circuit court properly exercised its discretion in granting appellees\u2019 motions <em>in limine, </em>the \u201clanguage of the <em>In Limine </em>Order was unjustifiably broad because it included facts not subject to any discovery violation.\u201d Specifically, appellant argues that the order \u201cprecluded [appellant] from introducing <em>any </em>facts indicated in the Affidavit of Michael McCreary....\u201d Appellant continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\">The Affidavit included a broad range of documents and facts which were not subject to even an arguable discovery violation, such as the following: 1) a statement that the subject mortgage loan amount was greater than the Check <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>amount of $140,000.00 (this fact was not requested by [appellees] through discovery); 2) a copy of the corporate assignment which was attached to the Complaint; 3) a statement that [appellant] has the right to collect all mortgage and insurance payments related to the subject mortgage (this fact was disclosed within the discovery deadline and consistent with deposition testimony); 4) evidence of the value of the Property before the fire loss in January 2005 ($215,000.00) and the value of the Property after the fire loss in January 2006 ($50,000.00) (also disclosed at the deposition prior to discovery deadline).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">Appellant contends that, as a result of the court\u2019s ruling, it was precluded from introducing any evidence relating to the above-mentioned matters, even though they were not, according to appellant, \u201csubject to any discovery violation [sanction].\u201d We see it otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Initially, we observe that the circuit court\u2019s order specifically precluded use of appellant\u2019s post-discovery disclosures and the substance of the facts contained therein, provided that those facts were not initially disclosed prior to the discovery date. The court further precluded introduction of evidence contrary to the testimony of appellant\u2019s corporate designee, Paul McAllister.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> As for any \u201cstatement that the subject mortgage loan amount was greater than the Check amount of $140,000.00,\u201d this fact was first disclosed in McCreary\u2019s post-deadline affidavits and we have held that the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in disallowing use of this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">Furthermore, in regard to appellant\u2019s allegation that it was unjustifiably precluded by the \u201coverbroad\u201d order from introducing evidence as to the decrease in the property\u2019s value after the fire, appellant does not address whether it attempted to introduce such evidence at trial and was prevented from doing so by the court. To be sure, the court did not permit appellant to explain \u201chow\u201d appellant was injured in this case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>This ruling, however, was consistent with the court\u2019s <em>in limine </em>order, in light of McAllister\u2019s deposition testimony reflecting that McAllister knew nothing about appellant\u2019s claimed damages in this case. More importantly, McAllister did offer testimony at his deposition regarding the alleged decrease in the value of the property after the fire.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Appellant, for its part, neglected to introduce that evidence at trial.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We further observe that appellant never proffered, in response to the court\u2019s rulings, that McAllister would testify to any of the matters that appellant now alleges the circuit court erroneously prevented appellant from addressing. <em>See, generally Smirlock v. Potomac Development Corp., </em>235 Md. 195, 203, 200 A.2d 922 (1964) (\u201c[A] proffer is the appropriate method by which to preserve for appellate review questions with regard to evidence which is not admitted and the nature of which is not apparent from the question to which an objection may be sustained.\u201d) (Citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">In addition, as Chesapeake Bank points out, a copy of the promissory note was, in fact, introduced as a trial exhibit by Chesapeake Bank, as an attachment to various excerpts from McAllister\u2019s deposition testimony. Furthermore, while the court sustained an objection to the introduction of a certified copy of the corporate assignment from First Franklin Mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>gage Loan Trust to Wells Fargo Bank, appellant has not explained how the court\u2019s error in precluding that document, if any, harmed appellant. The court ultimately allowed McAllister to testify as to the contents of that document and excerpts of McAllister\u2019s deposition testimony, in which he testified as to the contents of that document, were also admitted as a defendant\u2019s exhibit at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Finally, appellant\u2019s assertion that it was precluded from introducing \u201ca statement that [appellant] has the right to collect all mortgage and insurance payments related to the subject mortgage\u201d is not supported by the record. McAllister testified, over the opposing parties\u2019 objections, that appellant was the servicer for the first lienholder in this case and was responsible for obtaining insurance money paid by JIA on the insurance claim. The parties also stipulated to the fact that appellant was named as the loss payee and mortgagee under the insurance policy. Accordingly, we perceive no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Motions for Judgment\u2014Conversion</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">At the close of appellant\u2019s case-in-chief, the circuit court granted judgment in favor of appellees on appellant\u2019s conversion claims and denied appellant\u2019s motion for judgment on appellant\u2019s conversion claims. Additionally, the circuit court granted judgment in favor of Middleburg Bank on appellant\u2019s negligence claim. We address each of appellant\u2019s challenges to these judgments <em>seriatim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">Maryland Rule 2-519(a) provides that \u201c[a] party may move for judgment on any or all of the issues in any action at the close of the evidence offered by an opposing party, and in a jury trial at the close of all the evidence.\u201d Maryland Rule 2-519(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>When a defendant moves for judgment at the close of the evidence offered by the plaintiff in an action tried by the court, the court may proceed, as the trier of fact, to determine the facts and to render judgment against the plaintiff or may decline to render judgment until the close of all the evidence. When a motion for judgment is made under any other circumstances, the court shall consider all evidence and inferences in the light most favorable to the party against whom the motion is made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Unlike in a jury trial, a trial judge in a bench trial considering a Rule 2-519 motion for judgment \u201cis not compelled to make any evidentiary inferences in favor of the party against whom the motion for judgment is made.\u201d <em>Bricker v.

However, \u201c \u2018 \u201c[t]he clearly erroneous standard for appellate review in [Maryland Rule 8-131(c)] does not apply to a trial court\u2019s determinations of legal questions or conclusions of law based on findings of fact.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>L.W.

Gunter, </em>367 Md. 386, 392, 788 A.2d 609 (2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Appellees\u2019 Motions for Judgment on Conversion Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">At the close of appellant\u2019s case-in-chief, appellees moved for judgment on appellant\u2019s conversion claims, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that appellant had failed to prove damages on the conversion counts. Appellees stressed that appellant was only one of four payees named on the instrument of the check and emphatically maintained that appellant had adduced no evidence at trial proving the degree of its actual interest in the proceeds of the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Appellant countered that, under \u00a7 3-420(b) of the Maryland Uniform Commercial Code, the damages in a conversion claim are presumed to be the amount payable on the instrument. C.L. \u00a7 3-420 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-9\">(a) The law applicable to conversion of personal property applies to instruments. An instrument is also converted if it is taken by transfer, other than a negotiation, from a person not entitled to enforce the instrument or a bank makes or obtains payment with respect to the instrument for a person not entitled to enforce the instrument or receive payment. An action for conversion of an instrument may not be brought by (i) the issuer or acceptor of the instrument or (ii) a payee or indorsee who did not receive delivery of the instrument either directly or through delivery to an agent or a co-payee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-10\">(b) In an action under subsection (a), <em>the measure of liability is presumed to be the amount payable on the instrument, but recovery may not exceed the amount of the plaintiffs interest in the instrument</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>(Emphasis added). Appellant contended that, by producing the converted check, it was entitled to the presumption that the measure of damages was $140,000, or the amount payable on the check. Thus, appellees had the burden, according to appellant, of rebutting that presumption by establishing that appellant was entitled to less than that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The parties also made various alternative arguments. Chesapeake Bank, for example, asserted that, even if appellant correctly interpreted C.L. \u00a7 3-420(b), appellees had sufficiently rebutted the statutory presumption by highlighting the deposition testimony of McAllister, wherein he stated that he had no knowledge of any damages incurred by appellant. Appellant argued that the \u201cDeclarations Page\u201d in the insurance policy designated appellant as the first loss payee and American General as the second loss payee, evincing an intent to give appellant an interest in the policy senior to that of American General, another co-payee on the check. Appellant also argued that, because the three other co-payees validly endorsed the check, they \u201cendorsed away their interests and so as a practical matter the check was negotiable only upon the endorsement of [appellant],\u201d such that \u201cat the time that it was presented to Middleburg Bank for negotiation the interest was owned by [appellant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The circuit court granted appellees\u2019 motion for judgment on the conversion counts, rejecting appellant\u2019s interpretation of C.L. \u00a7 3^20(b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-7\">I have no evidence of damages. None. And 4, ah, 3-420(b) makes it clear, and I\u2019m gonna read from the comment that there does need, <em>there is a presumption that the amount of damages, that the amount of [sic] is the amount of the check, but it\u2019s different in the case of co-payees. </em>And I\u2019m reading right from the official comment. The but clause in subsection B, I will note it doesn\u2019t refer back to 3-420, but that is the section it\u2019s referring to, addresses the problem of conversion actions, which is what we have here against Middleburg and against Chesapeake in multiple payee checks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>(Emphasis added). The court quoted directly from the following paragraph in Official Comment 2 to C.L. \u00a7 3-420(b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Au-\">The \u201cbut\u201d clause in subsection (b) <em>addresses the problem of conversion actions in multiple payee checks. </em>Section 3-110(d) states that an instrument cannot be enforced unless all payees join in the action. But an action for conversion might be brought by a payee having no interest or a limited interest in the proceeds of the check. This clause prevents such a plaintiff from receiving a windfall. An example is a check payable to a building contractor and a supplier of building material. The check is not payable to the payees alternatively. Section 3-110(d). The check is delivered to the contractor by the owner of the building. Suppose the contractor forges supplier\u2019s signature as an indorsement of the check and receives the entire proceeds of the check. <em>The supplier should not, without qualification, be able to recover the entire amount of the check from the bank that converted the check. </em>Depending upon the contract between the contractor and the supplier, the amount of the check may be due [1] entirely to the contractor, in which case there should be no recovery, [2] entirely to the supplier, in which case recovery should be for the entire amount, or [3] part may be due to one and the rest to the other, in which case recovery should be limited to the amount due to the supplier.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Ultimately, the court compared the hypothetical scenario discussed in Official Comment 2 to the facts of this case and concluded that appellant, as a co-payee on the check, was required, at the outset, to prove its actual interest in the proceeds of the check:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-7\">Other than we have a few more parties than just the building contractor and the building supplier, that\u2019s the situation that we have here. <em>I have no idea what anybody\u2019s interest is in the proceeds </em>and I note that I did grant a motion in limine on the deposition responses of Mr. McAllister. There could have been other ways to try to prove what other people\u2019s interests were, but that was not done. I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>don\u2019t know in this instance what the damages were. <em>They might have been 100\u2014they probably were\u2014but the Court cannot guess or speculate as to the possible damages and that, I mean it\u2019s just word for word right out of the comment that there is no proof of what, what the interest is. </em>Therefore I don\u2019t find an [sic], damages are an essential part of any cause of action and the Defendant has no obligation to prove damages. <em>It\u2019s the Plaintiffs obligation to prove each and every element of, of an offense and there just\u2014of, of a charg\u2014of a count. And there\u2019s just no evidence of that.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">\n<em>i</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">C.L. \u00a7 3-420(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">The specific provision of C.L. \u00a7 3-420 that we are called upon by appellant to construe is subsection (b), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-9\">In an action under subsection (a), the measure of liability is presumed to be the amount payable on the instrument, but recovery may not exceed the amount of the plaintiffs interest in the instrument.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">Appellant asks us to hold that C.L. \u00a7 3-420(b) establishes a rebuttable presumption that the measure of liability is the amount payable on the check and that this rebuttable presumption applies equally in conversion cases involving single or multiple payees. This issue appears to be one of first impression in Maryland.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Accordingly, resolving appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>claim requires us to construe various provisions of the Maryland Uniform Commercial Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The Court of Appeals reiterated the principles that inform this process of statutory analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-6\">Although we are directed by the General Assembly to construe the Uniform Commercial Code in a manner which \u201cmakes uniform the law among the various [states]\u201d adopting it, Md.

These well settled principles require ascertainment of the legislative intent, and if, as is the case here, construction becomes necessary because the terminology chosen is not clear, then we must consider not only the significance of the literal language used, but the effect of our proposed reading in light of the legislative purpose sought to be accomplished. Unlike most state statutory enactments, the U.C.C. is accompanied by a useful aid for determining the purpose of its provisions'\u2014the official comments of the Code\u2019s draftsmen. While these comments are not controlling authority and may not be used to vary the plain language of the statute, they are an excellent place to begin a search for the legislature\u2019s intent when it adopted the Code. .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-7\"><em>Messing v.

Phillips, </em>384 Md. 583, 591, 865 A.2d 590 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The plain and unambiguous language of the first clause, or \u201cpresumption clause,\u201d of C.L. \u00a7 3-420(b) establishes that, in a conversion action brought under \u00a7 3-420(a), the measure of liability is presumed to be the amount payable on the instrument. C.L. \u00a7 1-201(31) defines the terms \u201cpresumption\u201d and \u201cpresumed\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-6\">Subject to additional definitions contained in the subsequent titles of this article which are applicable to specific titles or subtitles thereof, and unless the context otherwise requires, in Titles 1 through 10 of this article:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-7\">(31) \u201cPresumption\u201d or \u201cpresumed\u201d means that the trier of fact must find the existence of the fact presumed <em>unless and until evidence is introduced </em>which would support a finding of its nonexistence.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">(Emphasis added). The term \u201cpresumed\u201d in C.L. \u00a7 3-420(b) thus refers to a rebuttable presumption, which is \u201c[a]n inference drawn from certain facts that establish a <em>prima facie </em>case, which may be overcome by the introduction of contrary evidence.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1224 (8th Ed. 2004). Rebuttable presumptions shift the burden of proof to the opposing party, where it remains until that party produces the quantum of evidence required to sufficiently rebut the presumption. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 5-301(a) (establishing that, unless otherwise provided by statutes or the Maryland Rules, a presumption in all civil actions \u201cimposes on the party against whom it is directed the burden of producing evidence to rebut <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>the presumption\u201d until \u201cthe party introduces evidence tending to disprove the presumed fact\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Nothing in the language of the qualifying clause, or \u201cbut\u201d clause, of C.L. \u00a7 3-420(b) indicates that this rebuttable presumption only applies to conversion claims involving a single payee. Rather, the \u201cbut\u201d clause modifies or limits the preceding \u201cpresumption\u201d clause by providing that \u201crecovery may not exceed the amount of the plaintiffs interest in the instrument.\u201d Thus, the \u201cbut\u201d clause reinforces that the presumption established in the preceding clause is not a conclusive, or irrebuttable, presumption of law, but rather, one that may be rebutted by evidence that the plaintiff in a conversion claim is not entitled to the full amount payable on the instrument. Stated otherwise, the presumed fact that the plaintiffs damages equal the full amount payable on the instrument remains <em>unless and until </em>evidence is introduced by the party seeking to rebut the presumption that the plaintiffs actual interest in the check entitles the plaintiff to a lesser amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The party against whom the presumption is directed carries the burden of producing evidence to rebut the presumption. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 5-301(a). That party is not relieved of that burden merely because the plaintiff is a co-payee amongst multiple payees. Placing the burden on the plaintiff in a multiple payee conversion claim to prove, in the first instance, the amount of his or her exact interest in the check would obviate the need for an explicit statutory presumption as to the measure of liability. It would also require us to insert meaning into the statute that is not supported by the plain language of the statute.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Because the language of statute of is clear and unambiguous, we may choose to end our statutory analysis of C.L. \u00a7 3-420(b) at this point. <em>See Maryland Div. of Labor &amp; Indus. v.

Rather, as the official comments explain, the \u201cbut\u201d clause \u201caddresses,\u201d or speaks to, \u201cthe problem of conversion actions in multiple payee checks.\u201d When read in the light cast by the plain language of the statute, these official comments explain that, where the issue of a co-payee\u2019s limited interest in the instrument <em>has been generated </em>by the opposing party, <em>i.e., </em>where the presumption established in C.L. \u00a7 3-420(b) <em>has been successfully rebutted </em>by the opposing party, a co-payee cannot, under those circumstances, recover more than what the evidence demonstrates to be his or her interest in the instrument\u2019s proceeds, absent \u201cqualification,\u201d or evidence, adduced by the co-payee plaintiff establishing his or her entitlement to a larger portion of the proceeds. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>discussion in Official Comment 2 regarding the respective interests of a hypothetical building contractor and a supplier, as co-payees, in the amount of the check merely provides one scenario illustrative of C.L. \u00a7 3-420(b).

We have come across only a handful of reported opinions that are instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">Appellant asks us to consider two cases construing conversion claims under the predecessor statute to C.L. \u00a7 3-420, or its equivalent in a sister jurisdiction. One of these cases, <em>Cartwood Constr. Co., Inc. v. Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Co., N.A, </em>84 N.C.App. 245, 352 S.E.2d 241 (1987), <em>aff'd, </em>320 N.C. 164, 357 S.E.2d 373 (1987), is inapposite. In <em>CaHioood, </em>a plaintiff construction company sued a depositary bank and a drawee bank. <em>Id. </em>at 242. In reversing a trial court\u2019s award of summary judgment in favor of the drawee bank, the North Carolina Court of Appeals held that, once it was established, under North Carolina\u2019s counterpart to the former C.L. \u00a7 3-419, that a drawee paid on a forged instrument, <em>i.e., </em>that a conversion occurred, the drawee\u2019s liability was the face amount of the instrument. <em>Id. </em>at 250. The <em>CaHwood </em>Court concluded that the plaintiffs \u201cinterest in the proceeds of the check is irrelevant under this provision of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As we have observed, the official comments to C.L. \u00a7 3-420 explain that the predecessor to C.L. \u00a7 3^20 distinguished between drawees and other converters and created a conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>sive presumption that the measure of liability for drawees in conversion cases was the face amount of the instrument, which was later amended by the current version of the statute. <em>Cartivood, </em>therefore, is inapplicable to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">Appellant also asks us to consider the holding in <em>Northwestern Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co. v. Laurel Fed. Sav. Bank, </em>979 F.Supp. 354, 355 (D.Md.1996), <em>summary judgment granted, </em>979 F.Supp. 359 (D.Md.1997), <em>aff'd, </em>133 F.3d 916 (4th Cir.1997), a case heard by the United States District Court for the District of Maryland upon motion of the defendants for summary judgment against the plaintiff on conversion claims brought under C.L. \u00a7 3-419, the predecessor statute to C.L. \u00a7 3-420. <em>Id. </em>at 355. The <em>Northwestern </em>Court examined the liability of a depositary bank for conversion of an instrument deposited therein and focused, in particular, on C.L. \u00a7 3-419(3), which expressly provided an affirmative defense for a depositary bank, limiting its liability to the \u201camount of the proceeds left in its hands at the time of the suit,\u201d unless the bank \u201cfailed to comply with the requirements of good faith and reasonable commercial standards applicable to banks.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 358.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The <em>Northwestern </em>Court determined that the depositary bank had not complied with applicable commercial banking standards, resulting in the plaintiffs entitlement, as a matter of law, to recover the face amount of the checks. <em>Id. </em>The District Court continued, however, that the \u201cface amounts of the checks <em>only presumptively </em>establish the plaintiffs damages under \u00a7 3-419(2)\u201d and ordered that the parties brief the \u201cquestion of damages as to those checks,\u201d after which the District Court would decide if the issue of damages would need to be tried.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). This case demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>strates a useful analytical approach towards applying the rebuttable presumption of damages under the predecessor statute, but does not particularly afford us a better understanding of how other jurisdictions treat counterparts to C.L. \u00a7 3-420(b) under circumstances resembling those of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\"><em>Edwards v. Allied Home Mortg. Capital Corp., </em>962 So.2d 194, 205-06 (Ala.2007), a case involving a single payee, is more instructive. In <em>Edivards, </em>a trial court awarded partial summary judgment in favor of Allied Home Mortgage Capital Corporation (Allied), a mortgage brokerage company, and against Allied\u2019s former branch manager, Edwards, on, <em>inter alia, </em>a conversion claim. <em>Id. </em>at 202. The case proceeded to trial before a jury to determine the amount of compensatory damages to be awarded to Allied. <em>Id. </em>The jury ultimately awarded Allied damages for its conversion claim equaling the face value of various checks (plus prejudgment interest) that were made payable to Allied, but retained and deposited by Edwards into her personal accounts. <em>Id. </em>at 203. Edwards appealed this verdict, arguing that the trial court erred by prohibiting her from arguing to the jury that Allied\u2019s interest in the checks was less than the face value of the checks, in light of an agreement between the parties that permitted Allied to retain a small percentage of each closed loan that originated through the branch. <em>Id. </em>at 203-04. In fact, Allied\u2019s representative testified at trial that Allied would have retained only a percentage of the checks, instead of the full amount of the checks, if Edwards had forwarded them to Allied, as she was required to do. <em>Id. at </em>204.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The Supreme Court of Alabama construed Alabama\u2019s counterpart to C.L. \u00a7 3-420(b), along with the official comment upon which the circuit court placed heavy emphasis, and rejected Allied\u2019s argument that the official comment restricted the qualifying clause, or \u201cbut\u201d clause, to circumstances involving multiple payee checks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">Allied\u2019s arguments on the compensatory-damages issue are not well-founded. The trial court should not have prohibited Edwards from arguing to the jury that Allied\u2019s interest in the converted checks was less than their face <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>value. This Court is bound by rules of statutory construction \u201cto interpret the language of [a statute] to mean exactly what it says and to give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature.\u201d <em>IMED Corp. v. Systems Eng\u2019g, Assocs. Corp., </em>602 So.2d 344, 349 (Ala.1992). The first clause in \u00a7 7-3-420(b) states that the measure of liability is presumed to be the amount payable on the instrument. Although the statute creates that presumption, the plain language in the clause that immediately follows the first clause indicates that the measure of liability is not equal to the face amount if the \u201crecovery ... exceed[s] the amount of the plaintiff\u2019s interest in the instrument.\u201d The Official Comment to \u00a7 7-3-420(b) states that the purpose of that qualifying clause is to \u201cprevent ... a plaintiff [with no interest or little interest in the proceeds of the check] from receiving a windfall.\u201d That Comment concludes that the amount of recovery for conversion of a check could be \u201cdepend[ent] upon [a] contract\u201d between the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">Section 7-3-420(b), Ala.Code 1975, creates a rebuttable presumption that the amount of compensatory damages for conversion of a negotiable instrument is the face value of the instrument. Here, Allied presumptively established that Edwards\u2019s liability for her conversion of checks payable to Allied was $ 425,309 (ie., the face value of the converted checks). Edwards rebutted that presumption, however, when she presented testimony that, considering the rights of the parties in the agreement, Allied\u2019s \u201cinterest\u201d in those checks was $ 64,467\u2014the aggregate corporate fee Allied would have earned had Edwards delivered the closing checks she had retained to Allied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 205-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">Because Edwards rebutted the statutory presumption by presenting testimony regarding the extent of the plaintiffs interest in the checks, the Supreme Court of Alabama concluded that the trial court erroneously prohibited her from arguing to the jury that Allied was entitled to less than the full amount payable on the check. <em>Id. </em>at 206. In short, the <em>Edwards </em>Court expressly declined to give the \u201cbut\u201d clause any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>special significance with respect to multiple payees, ruling instead that the \u201cbut\u201d clause qualified the preceding presumption clause, such that the statute generally created a presumption of the measure of liability that could be rebutted by evidence of a plaintiffs actual interest in the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The opinion articulated <em>Am. State Bank v. Union Planters Bank, N.A., </em>332 F.3d 533, 534 (8th Cir.2003), is also instructive. In <em>Am. State Bank, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit addressed the statutory presumption in Arkansas\u2019s counterpart to Maryland\u2019s C.L. \u00a7 3-420(b), where an instrument was jointly payable to two payees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-6\">When one payee indorses a check that is payable jointly to two payees, and a bank pays the indorsing payee without the other\u2019s consent, Article 3 of the Arkansas Uniform Commercial Code provides that the bank is liable for conversion to the non-consenting payee. In this situation, \u201cthe measure of liability is <em>presumed </em>to be the amount payable on the instrument.\u201d ARK. CODE ANN. \u00a7 4-3-420(b) (emphasis added). The appeal in this diversity case raises the difficult question whether the bank\u2019s liability under Arkansas law is limited to the actual harm to the co-payee caused by the conversion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">American State Bank (ASB) of Arkansas granted a $425,000 revolving line of credit to a partnership, secured by liens on the partnership\u2019s crops and agricultural subsidy payments received by the partnership. <em>Id. </em>at 535. Between October 1999 and April 2000, a partner indorsed twenty-four checks totaling $262,330.76 and deposited the proceeds into the partnership\u2019s account at Union Planter\u2019s Bank (UPB) of Tennessee. <em>Id. </em>Although each check was jointly payable both to the partnership and ASB, reflecting ASB\u2019s liens, UPB paid the checks solely on the partner\u2019s indorsement. <em>Id. </em>The partner ultimately withdrew these proceeds from the partnership account and lost the money in his gambling ventures. <em>Id. </em>ASB subsequently sued UPB for conversion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>In response to ASB\u2019s motion for summary judgment, submitted in ASB\u2019s conversion action against UPB, UPB presented evidence that, notwithstanding the partner\u2019s misconduct, ASB extended the term of its secured loan to the partnership and was eventually repaid for a substantial amount of the loan. <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of ASB, awarding ASB damages totaling the face amount of the converted checks. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, UPB conceded its liability for conversion, but argued that the measure of its liability should be restricted to ASB\u2019s actual damages, adding that genuine issues of material fact on the damages issue rendered summary judgment inappropriate. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with UPB. Addressing the issue of whether \u201cUPB\u2019s evidence of reduced actual harm, if believed, [was] legally sufficient to rebut the presumption in \u00a7 3-420(b) that UPB is liable for the face amount of the checks,\u201d <em>id., </em>the Eighth Circuit reflected on the relevant statutory presumption:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">\u201cOrdinarily, the proper measure of damages for conversion of property is the market value of the property at the time and place of its conversion.\u201d <em>McQuillan v. Mercedes-Benz Credit Corp., </em>331 Ark. 242, 961 S.W.2d 729, 733 (Ark.l998).[<footnotemark>34</footnotemark>] su fpjluS) ft js sensible to create a statutory presumption that the value of a converted check or other negotiable instrument is its face amount. And it is apparent that the UCC drafters had this issue in mind in creating the presumption.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 535-36. The Eighth Circuit observed that the cases relied upon by both parties in support of their arguments construed the irrebuttable presumption that applied to actions against drawee banks under the predecessor statute and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>concluded that \u201cthere is no \u2018prevailing view\u2019 as to whether a bank\u2019s liability is limited to the plaintiffs actual loss, despite the presumption in \u00a7 3\u2014420(b).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 536-37. Rather, according to the Eighth Circuit, \u201ccourts applying the UCC have determined when and how the presumption may be rebutted in accordance with more general state law damage principles, which of course vary from State to State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Arkansas state law provided that, even under the former irrebuttable presumption, a drawee bank could not be liable to the extent that the money actually reached the intended payees. <em>Id. </em>at 537. Thus, the Eighth Circuit concluded that \u201cthe \u00a7 3-420(b) presumption may be rebutted by evidence that the proceeds of converted checks in fact found their way to the intended recipient(s).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 537. The Eighth Circuit made no distinction between cases involving a single payee or multiple payees. The inquiry, rather, focused on the ability of a defendant in a conversion claim to rebut the statutory presumption by producing evidence of the plaintiffs actual loss. The Eighth Circuit determined that it could not rule, as a matter of law, that the payments received by ASB from the partnership were from a source sufficiently collateral to the conversion warranting a \u201cdouble recovery\u201d by ASB.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 538. The judgment of the district court was thus reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The decisions discussed <em>supra </em>collectively reinforce our holding that the plain language of C.L. \u00a7 3-420(b) creates a presumption that the measure of liability in a conversion claim, whether that claim involves multiple payees or single payees, is the full amount payable on the instrument\u2014a presumption that may be rebutted by the introduction of evidence that the plaintiffs interest is, in fact, less- than that full amount. When the C.L. \u00a7 3\u2014420(b) presumption is so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>rebutted, a factual question is created as to the extent of the plaintiffs damages for conversion of the instrument, unless the court concludes that the evidence is legally insufficient or so conclusive that it rebuts the presumption as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-301(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Before ending our discussion of this issue, we must address various arguments that have been raised by the parties in anticipation of our interpretation of C.L. \u00a7 3-420(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Appellees argue that they have sufficiently rebutted the statutory presumption of damages by introducing the deposition testimony of appellant\u2019s corporate designee, McAllister, indicating that he had no knowledge of any damages claimed by the company in the lawsuit. Appellees place particular emphasis on the fact that JIA made the check payable to \u201cPaula Harrison and Steven Siegel and Saxon Mortgage Service and American General Financial Services, its successors, and/or assigns, AT1MA\u201d and that the parties stipulated that \u201cATIMA\u201d stands for \u201cas their interests may appear.\u201d According to appellees, appellant, as a mortgagee or mortgage servicer for the mortgagee, may not insure its interest in an amount greater than its actual debt.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Appellees maintain that appellant failed to produce any evidence as to the amount of its interest in the check, the interest of any other co-payee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>on the check, or the amount due on the promissory note and deed of trust held by Wells Fargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">\u25a0 Appellant asserts that, even if it was required to prove its interest in the amount payable on the check, it satisfied that burden by entering into the record, by stipulation, a copy of the insurance policy, which provided that any loss payable under the policy would be paid to the mortgagee and the insured, as their interests appear. The insurance policy further provided that, if more than one mortgagee is named, \u201cthe order of payment will be the same as the order of precedence of the mortgages.\u201d According to appellant, it had priority to the insurance proceeds over American General, the second named mortgagee and loss payee.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> In addition, McAllister testified that appellant was the servicer for the first lien holder and responsible for obtaining the insurance money paid by Joint Insurance on the insurance claim.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Appellant also insists that it had a superior right to the check proceeds over the insureds, who would only be able to recover any balance in excess. Because a default judgment was entered against Harrison and Siegel, appellant posits that they effectively waived their right to oppose appellant\u2019s right to recover the check proceeds. In addition, according to appellant, because it was the only payee that did not endorse the check, it \u201cretained the sole interest to indorse the Check and present it for payment.\u201d Finally, appellant contends that the \u201cproper resolution of any uncertainty as to the rights of the co-payees in this instance was through the procedural vehicle of an interpleader.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>Appellant is not required to prove the extent of its interest in the instrument unless appellees have sufficiently rebutted the C.L. \u00a7 3-420(b) presumption as to the measure of liability. We cannot determine whether appellees adduced evidence at trial sufficient to rebut this presumption and, if so, whether appellant has presented sufficient evidence demonstrating its interest in the check proceeds, without resolving certain factual disputes and weighing the evidence, particularly as it pertained to whether appellant was entitled to collect all, some or none of the insurance proceeds. In ruling on appellees\u2019 motions for judgment, the circuit court made no specific factual findings on these issues. The circuit court, having observed the presentation of appellant\u2019s case-in-chief, is in the best position to make these factual determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Accordingly, we shall reverse the judgment of the circuit court and remand for a new hearing on appellees\u2019 motions for judgment as to appellant\u2019s conversion claims. Appellant, in its case in chief, presented evidence that appellees \u201cmade or obtained payment\u201d of the $140,000 check issued by Joint Insurance Association, which appellant, as a co-payee, neither indorsed nor authorized to be indorsed on its behalf. In other words, appellant presented evidence that Middleburg Bank and Chesapeake Bank \u201cma[de] or obtainfed] payment with respect to the instrument for [co-payees] not entitled to enforce the instrument or receive[d] payment.\u201d C.L. \u00a7 3-420(a.) By virtue of appellant\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>showing of conversion pursuant to \u00a7 3-420(a), on remand, the circuit court shall, in the first instance, accord to appellant the statutory presumption set forth in C.L. \u00a7 3-420(b), <em>i.e., </em>that, as a matter of law, appellant\u2019s damages are presumed to be the face amount on that check. The burden then shifts to appellees to demonstrate that the evidence adduced during the presentation of appellant\u2019s case-in-chief establishes that appellant\u2019s interest in the instrument is less than the amount payable on the instrument. C.L. \u00a7 3-420(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">In the event that the circuit court, upon consideration of the evidence and argument of counsel, determines that the statutory presumption <em>has not been rebutted </em>by appellees, appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>lees\u2019 motions for judgment, based on the grounds that appellant did not prove its damages, must fail. The circuit court should then permit appellees, in their case, to present evidence of appellant\u2019s actual interest in the instrument. Consequently, in the event that the court denies appellees\u2019 motions for judgment because they have failed to rebut the presumption <em>that their liability is the amount payable on the instmment </em>pursuant to C.L. \u00a7 3-420(b), they would nevertheless be afforded the opportunity, during the presentation of their cases, to rebut the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Alternatively, assuming that the circuit court determines that appellees <em>have sufficiently rebutted </em>the statutory presumption, the burden then shifts to appellant to prove its actual interest in the instrument; the court, upon the failure on the part of appellant to prove its actual interest in the instrument, would be constrained to grant appellees\u2019 motion for judgment. Appellant, however, will only be permitted to premise its opposition to appellees\u2019 motion for judgment on the evidence it adduced in its case-in-chief. Should appellant be successful in establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case of its actual interest in the instrument, appellees cannot prevail on their motion for judgment. If, on the other hand, the court finds that the evidence adduced by appellant fails to establish its actual interest in the instrument, appellees\u2019 motion for judgment on appellant\u2019s conversion claim must be granted because of insufficient evidence of damages sustained pursuant to its claim of conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Appellant\u2019s Motion for Judgment on Conversion Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">After the circuit court granted appellees\u2019 motion for judgment, appellant asked the circuit court to grant judgment in favor of appellant on the conversion counts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-9\">Your Honor, with respect to the conversion claim, we were\u2014what we would request on [appellant\u2019s] behalf is the Court does have a, an equitable jurisdiction here and the Court made clear even from the, the, the justification for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>the, the Court\u2019s decision that it is quite possible if not probable that [appellant] would be entitled to something, some portion of this check. So what we were thinking would be the best idea would be if the Court could have a judgment entered on conversion that was in, was applicable to all four of the payees on this check and that the payees could then have a, an opportunity to discuss with each other exactly who had what interest. And the reason that I say that is that if the problem here, <em>if the only problem here is that there hasn\u2019t been enough evidence to show who has what interest in the check, </em>the Court has just provided a windfall to the party that converted the check to save somebody who may or may not also have an interest in the check and that can easily be resolved by just having the money paid into the registry of the court and then [appellant], American General, and the two individual payees can then have either an informal discussion or if necessary, ah, a show cause proceeding that could then divide up the interest accordingly. <em>Because we do believe that there is a conversion that occm~red here and the fact that Saxon has not shown in the Court\u2019s view the correct proportion of the total check proceeds is probably not a good result when it is clear that the check has been converted.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">(Emphasis added). The circuit court responded, \u201cI don\u2019t have any basis to amend on that basis. Note your request, but it\u2019s denied.\u201d Appellant argues that the circuit court erred by declining to grant judgment in favor of appellant as to its conversion claims against appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">C.L. \u00a7 8\u2014110(d) provides that an instrument made payable to two more persons, jointly and not alternatively, is payable to all of the named payees and may only be negotiated or enforced if the payees act jointly. Official Comment 4 to C.L. \u00a7 3-110 explains that \u201c[i]f an instrument is payable to X and Y, neither X nor Y acting alone is the person to whom the instrument is payable,\u201d such that neither X nor Y, acting alone, can be considered the holder or a person entitled to enforce or negotiate the instrument. In this instance, the check was made jointly payable to \u201cPaula Harrison <em>and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Steven Siegel <em>and </em>Saxon Mortgage Service and American General Financial Services, its Successors and/or Assigns, ATIMA.\u201d (Emphasis added). <em>See generally Dynalectron Corp. v. Equitable Trust Co., </em>704 F.2d 737, 738 (4th Cir.1983) (\u201cIf a check or other instrument is payable to \u2018A and B,\u2019 both payees must indorse.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">C.L. \u00a7 3-420(a) provides that an instrument is converted \u201cif ... a bank makes or obtains payment with respect to the instrument for a person not entitled to enforce the instrument or receive payment.\u201d Official Comment 1 explains that this \u201ccovers cases in which a depositary or payor bank takes an instrument bearing a forged indorsement,\u201d along with cases where a check is made jointly payable to more than one payee but is deposited or paid without the consent of a payee. As appellant indicates, the Court of Appeals has previously recognized that the predecessor to C.L. \u00a7 3-420(a), C.L. \u00a7 3-419(1), imposed absolute liability where a party payed an instrument over a forged indorsement, because payment has been made to a person who does not possess good title. <em>See Citizens Bank of Maryland v. Maryland Industrial Finishing Co., </em>338 Md. 448, 452-53, 659 A.2d 313 (1995) (citing <em>Menichini v. Grant, </em>995 F.2d 1224, 1232 (3rd Cir.1993); <em>Equitable Life Assur. Soc. of U.S. v. Okey, </em>812 F.2d 906, 910 (4th Cir.1987); <em>Mid-Atl. Tennis Cts. v. Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>658 F.Supp. 140, 143 (D.Md.l987)).<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Prior to trial, the parties stipulated that, although the check was payable jointly, appellant never indorsed the check nor did it authorize any person to do so. The parties further stipulated that Middleburg Bank, as the depositary bank, did not contact either appellant or JIA to verify the authenticity of the word \u201cSaxon,\u201d which appeared on the check as appellant\u2019s purported indorsement. Rather, when presented with the check, Middleburg Bank deposited the proceeds into the account of the Dunlap Firm and delivered the check to its intermediary bank. The check was ultimately presented to Chesapeake Bank, the drawee bank, which electronically debited $140,000 from JIA\u2019s account and credited that amount to the Middleburg Bank account. On May 20, 2005, Middleburg Bank credited $140,000 to the Dunlap Firm\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">In sum, a check in which appellant claims an interest was taken for deposit (in the case of Middleburg Bank) and paid (in the case of Chesapeake Bank) upon a forged indorsement and without appellant\u2019s consent. Although there is, thus, no dispute as to many of the facts essential to appellant\u2019s conversion claim, final judgment cannot be entered on appellant\u2019s motion for judgment until the circuit court resolves the damages question. Moreover, because appellant\u2019s argument in support of its motion for judgment focused almost exclusively on resolving the issue of damages, and because the circuit court appeared to have denied appellant\u2019s motion for judgment on those grounds, appellees were not afforded the opportunity to present any argument against appellant\u2019s contention that appellees were liable for conversion as a matter of law. There may be defenses that appellees are able to assert that, on this record, we are unable to discern.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the circuit court insofar as it determined that appellees were not liable on appellant\u2019s conversion claims because damages were not sufficiently proven. Upon remand, the circuit court shall consider whether final judgment is appropriate in light of the court\u2019s ruling with respect to the proof of damages as to the conversion claims, as we have recounted in the preceding section. In addition, appellees shall be afforded the opportunity to argue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>against appellant\u2019s motion for judgment. <em>See Northwestern Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co., </em>979 F.Supp. at 355, 358 (holding that, under the predecessor statute to C.L. \u00a7 3-420, plaintiff was entitled as a matter of law to recover, from depositary bank on two checks that were not properly endorsed and should not have been paid, but that final judgment could not be granted until the issue of damages was resolved by the trial court).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Motion for Judgment\u2014Negligence Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">In its motion for judgment, Middleburg Bank asserted that appellant had failed to provide any evidence regarding the standard of care governing Middleburg Bank, the sole bank against whom a negligence count was brought, which actually went to trial. Appellant countered that an expert was not required to establish Middleburg\u2019s duty of care and emphasized that the check included express instructions that all payees must endorse the check exactly as their names appeared therein. According to appellant, the fact that Middle-burg Bank accepted the handwritten word \u201cSaxon\u201d as appellant\u2019s indorsement, while the check was made payable to \u201cSaxon Mortgage Services,\u201d demonstrated that Middleburg Bank failed to act reasonably in taking the check for deposit. After granting appellees\u2019 motions for judgment on appellant\u2019s conversion claims, the circuit court turned to the negligence claim and ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-8\">As to the negligence count. One, you need damages for negligence count as well and there\u2019s no evidence once again of damages, and two, <em>there is absolutely no evidence of what the standard is for [the] reasonable banking industry. </em>Therefore, I\u2019m granting the mo\u2014granting judgment for Middleburg Bank on the negligence count as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">On appeal, appellant argues that the circuit court erroneously granted Middleburg Bank\u2019s motion for judgment on the negligence claim on the grounds that appellant failed to offer any evidence of banking industry standards through expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>testimony. Middleburg Bank counters that expert testimony was required to establish what banking practices, procedures and standards governed its conduct, because those matters are beyond the ordinary knowledge of laypersons.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">We initially observe that the circuit court\u2019s ruling did not expressly mention the absence of expert testimony as the basis for its judgment. However, the necessity <em>vel non </em>of such testimony, in order to establish the applicable standard of care, was argued by both appellant and Middleburg Bank. Moreover, neither party has argued that the circuit court did <em>not </em>base its ruling on the lack of expert testimony. Based on our review of the record, we discern that the circuit court\u2019s conclusion that there was \u201cabsolutely no evidence of what the standard is for the reasonable banking industry\u201d referred both to (1) the absence of expert testimony specifically establishing a banking industry standard and (2) the general need to establish a banking industry standard prior to determining that Middleburg Bank failed to exercise the appropriate degree of commercial reasonableness required under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Turning to the merits of appellant\u2019s argument in relation to this ruling, \u201c[t]o establish a cause of action in negligence!.,] a plaintiff must prove the existence of four elements: a duty owed to him [or her] (or to a class of which he [or she] is a part), a breach of that duty, a legally cognizable causal relationship between the breach of duty and the harm suffered, and damages.\u201d <em>Jacques v. First Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>307 Md. 527, 531-32, 515 A.2d 756 (1986) (citations omitted). In order to succeed on its claim for negligence, therefore, appellant was required to show that Middleburg Bank owed appellant a duty, which was breached when Middleburg Bank took the instrument for deposit upon a forged indorsement, thus injuring appellant. Assuming that Middle-burg Bank, as a depositary bank, owed a legally cognizable duty of care to appellant, a co-payee\u2014a proposition that Middleburg Bank does not appear to challenge\u2014we agree that appellant was not required, under the facts of this case, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>elicit expert testimony to prove Middleburg Bank\u2019s standard of care. Nor was additional evidence of a specific \u201cbanking industry practice\u201d required, under the circumstances of this case, to determine whether Middleburg Bank violated the appropriate standard of reasonable care.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Certainly, a plaintiff alleging a bank\u2019s negligence \u201cmust show that a defendant failed to exercise that degree of care which a reasonably prudent bank would have exercised under the same or similar circumstances.\u201d <em>Jacques, </em>307 Md. at 543-44, 515 A.2d 756 (addressing whether a bank owes a duty of care to a customer in evaluating that customer\u2019s loan application). Moreover, \u201c[a]s in any other negligence case, an industry standard, if it exists, may be proven as evidence of the applicable standard of care.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 544, 515 A.2d 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Nonetheless, in <em>Free State Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Ellis, </em>45 Md.App. 159, 162, 411 A.2d 1090 (1980), a case involving a negligence claim by a bank\u2019s customer against the bank, we declined to adopt a rule that \u201cexpert testimony is required in order to establish a negligent deviation from the \u2018commercially reasonable standard\u2019 against which the Bank\u2019s actions are to be measured.... \u201d We further rejected the bank\u2019s argument that the bank\u2019s conduct, in that case, was \u201c \u2018assuredly beyond the common knowledge of the jurors\u2019</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-7\">Although there may be situations that necessitate expert testimony relative to the standard of care required of a bank in dealings with customers, this case is not of that category. Certainly, no expert testimony was needed to show that banks do not ordinarily release the collateral of a customer and take in substitution thereof a paper writing which is not collateral, and which does no more than allow the bank to collect monies due on the collateral and credit it to the account of another. No expert testimony is needed to show the jurors that banks do not ordinarily release a deed of trust that secures a $200,000 promissory note payable to the bank\u2019s customer and which has been assigned to the bank as collateral for the customer\u2019s loan, and accept as substitute collateral a note secured by a deed of trust, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>payable to a party other than the bank\u2019s customer, and which is not even assigned to the bank, except, for all practical purposes, for collection. No expert testimony is needed to demonstrate to the jury that by doing what it did in the instant case, the Bank stripped its customer of his security for a $200,000 loan to another party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 163, 411 A.2d 1090. We concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">We think that even if expert testimony is ordinarily, needed to prove the standard of reasonable care used by banks in the community in its dealings with its customers, the case now before us is of the type that the average juror would know without expert testimony that banks simply do not ordinarily do what the Appellant Bank did in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AzS\"><em>Id. </em>at 164, 411 A.2d 1090.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Similarly, we conclude that the facts of this case are not of the category requiring expert testimony establishing a \u201cbank<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>ing industry practice\u201d in order for the circuit court to determine whether Middleburg Bank breached its duty of care to appellant relative to its payment on the instrument despite the forged indorsement. The check itself contained the following instruction on the back of the check above the indorsement lines: \u201cAll Payees must endorse below exactly as written on face of check.\u201d Appellant was designated as a payee, on the face of the check, as \u201cSaxon Mortgage Service.\u201d The forged indorsement, however, consisted of one word: \u201cSaxon.\u201d In addition, Lisa Kilgore, Middleburg Bank\u2019s Senior Vice President of Operations, testified as to the contents of what she characterized as \u201can internal document used for training purposes.\u201d According to these training guidelines, a payee should endorse its name exactly as it appears on the front of the check. <em>See generally Inventory Locator Service, Inc. v. Dunn, </em>776 S.W.2d 523, 526-27 (Tenn.Ct.App.1989) (addressing \u201creasonable commercial standards\u201d as part of the affirmative defense to conversion actions provided in Tennessee\u2019s counterpart to the former C.L. \u00a7 3-419(3) and observing that,' \u201c[wjhile a bank\u2019s own procedures cannot in and of themselves be equated with reasonable commercial standards, a bank\u2019s failure to follow its own normal procedures is indicative of a failure to act in accordance with reasonable commercial standards.\u201d) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">We do not perceive the issue of whether a bank violated a standard of care owed to appellant because the bank failed to follow its own internal training guidelines or the express instruction on the check to ensure that the payee\u2019s name is endorsed exactly as reflected on the front of the check, to be \u201c \u2018so particularly related to some science or profession that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>is beyond the ken of the average lay[person],\u2019 \u201d requiring the testimony of an expert to show the degree of care a reasonably prudent bank should have exercised under the circumstances. <em>Wood v.

Nonetheless, the circuit court granted Middleburg Bank\u2019s motion for judgment on the negligence claim on the grounds that there was \u201cabsolutely no evidence of what the standard is\u201d for the banking industry, following argument during which Middleburg\u2019s position on this point was that appellant had presented no evidence regarding the applicable standard of care. Appellant was required to show that Middleburg Bank failed to exercise \u201cthat degree of care which a reasonably prudent bank would have exercised under the same or similar circumstances,\u201d <em>Jacques, </em>307 Md. at 533-34, 515 A.2d 756. While evidence of an industry standard <em>may </em>be proven as evidence of an applicable standard of care, <em>id. </em>at 543, 515 A.2d 756, we hold that, under the circumstances of this case, such evidence was unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">We now turn to the lingering issue of damages. Appellant, in its brief to this Court, neglected to challenge the circuit court\u2019s ruling that there was no proof of damages as to the negligence claim. In fact, appellant first addresses this ruling in its reply belief. Ordinarily, we will not consider issues raised for the first time in a reply brief. <em>Gazunis v. Foster, </em>400 Md. 541, 554, 929 A.2d 531 (2007). However, because it is evident that the circuit court based its damages decision, with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>respect to the negligence claim, on the analysis that informed its damages determination with respect to the conversion claims\u2014an analysis that we have determined was based on an erroneous interpretation of the law\u2014we shall reverse the circuit court\u2019s granting of judgment in favor of Middleburg Bank on the negligence claim and remand for a determination as to (1) whether appellant failed to prove that Middleburg Bank breached its duty of care to appellant and (2) appellant\u2019s proof of damages on the negligence count, taking into account the court\u2019s factual findings in its ruling on the motions for judgment as to the conversion claims.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">JUDGMENTS OF THE CIRCUIT COURT AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.

We recognize that the court sustained objections to questions asked by appellant's counsel, on redirect examination, regarding whether there was property damage from the fire and whether repairs were made on the property after the fire. Those matters, however, are sufficiently distinct from the narrow issue of whether appellant could testify to the value of the property before and after the fire. Furthermore, the former objection was sustained on hearsay grounds, while the latter was sustained on the grounds that it exceeded the scope of redirect.

Although appellant cites to <em>Peoples Nat\u2019l Bank of Maryland v. Am. Fidelity Fire Ins.

As appellant points out, we ultimately affirmed a trial court's award of summary judgment in favor of a co-payee \"for the face amount of the check.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Appellant asserts that, by negative implication, <em>Peoples Nat'l Bank </em>stands for the proposition that a co-payee is not required to provide proof of damages beyond the face amount of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>check.

Appellant asserts that the \"Banks have attempted to cloud a simple check conversion case by raising a plethora of issues about lienholder\u2019s rights, mortgagor's rights, servicing agent\u2019s rights, and limitations on a mortgagee's insurable interest to the extent of the mortgage debt; none of these issues relate to UCC \u00a7 3-420.\" While we agree with appellant that the cases cited by appellees relating to a mortgagee\u2019s insurable interest do not change the statutory presumption as to the measure of liability expressly established in C.L. \u00a7 3-420(b), it must be underscored, however, that a plaintiff\u2019s actual interest in the amount of an instrument remains a relevant and material issue. It must, however, be generated by appellees in keeping with the statutory presumption.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b302-7\">. As we have explained, die insurance policy identified appellant as the \"first mortgagee and/or loss payee\u201d and American General \"and its successors [sic] and/or assigns, ATIMA,\u201d as the \"second mortgagee and/or loss payee.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b302-8\">. Appellant also argues that the circuit court erroneously prevented McAllister from testifying that Harrison owed over $140,000 on the mortgage or that the extent of damage caused by the fire exceeded $140,000. We have held that the circuit court's ruling on the motions <em>in Limine </em>was proper. We decline to further address this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b306-6\">. The Court of Appeals also recognized, however, that</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">[t]he exposure created by this strict or absolute liability is somewhat mitigated by \u00a7 3-419(3), which limits the liability of a bank to the proceeds that remain in the bank\u2019s hands, if the bank establishes (1) that it acted in good faith and (2) that it acted \u201cin accordance with the reasonable commercial standards applicable to the business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AK\">338 Md. at 453, 659 A.2d 313. The current C.L. \u00a7 3-420(c) retains this affirmative defense, although it is no longer available for depositary banks:</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">A representative, other than a depositary bank, who has in good faith dealt with an instrument or its proceeds on behalf of one who was not the person entitled to enforce the instrument is not liable in conversion to that person beyond the amount of any proceeds that it has not paid out.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b311-8\">. In its appellate brief, appellant states that the \"exact issue\u201d presented to this Court, <em>i.e., </em>whether appellant was required to introduce expert testimony to prove reasonable banking industry standards in order to succeed in its claim against Middleburg Bank, was addressed in <em>Citizens Bank of Maryland v. Maryland Indus. Finishing Co., </em>338 Md. 448, 659 A.2d 313 (1995). As Middleburg Bank points out, Citizens Baidc cannot reasonably be characterized as having addressed the \"exact issue\u201d presented by appellant. Rather, the Court of Appeals determined,</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">whether, for the purposes o\u00ed a conversion action under Maryland Code (1975, 1992 Rep. Vol.), \u00a7 3-419 of the Commercial Law Article, an agent\u2019s indorsement on checks payable to the agent\u2019s principal were unauthorized (1) when the agent indorsed the checks with an improper motive or later misappropriated the checks, or (2) when the agent omitted restrictive language required by the principal to be part of the indorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 452, 659 A.2d 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">In our decision in <em>Maryland Indust. Finishing Co. v. Citizens Bank of Maryland, </em>100 Md.App. 671, 685, 642 A.2d 317 (1994), which was vacated by the Court of Appeals and remanded to this Court with instructions to remand to the circuit court, we held that a circuit court erroneously placed the burden of establishing reasonable commercial standards in a conversion claim on the plaintiff under C.L. \u00a7 3-419(3), the predecessor statute to C.L. \u00a7 3-420, which established an affirmative defense for the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-12\">The Court of Appeals did not squarely address this issue, but did observe, in a footnote, that we had erroneously determined that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>court\u2019s comments regarding the burden to establish industry standards related to the conversion claim, when, according to the Court, they actually referred to a negligence claim that was also litigated at trial. <em>Citizens Bank, </em>338 Md. at 465 n. 11, 659 A.2d 313. The Court concluded by noting that a plaintiff has the burden of establishing reasonable commercial standards in a negligence claim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">It is evident that <em>Citizens Bank, supra, </em>does not address the \"exact issue\" that we now discuss. In any event, appellant, in its reply brief, is notably less fervent about the applicability of <em>Citizens Bank.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b314-7\">. Appellant argues that a plaintiff must prove actual damages in order to obtain recovery in a negligence action. <em>See Johnson v. Valu Food, Inc., </em>132 Md.App. 118, 126, 751 A.2d 19 (2000). As we have explained, on remand, the circuit court may articulate factual findings as to appellant\u2019s \"interest\u201d in the check, or the actual loss sustained by appellant, for purposes of granting or denying judgment on appellant\u2019s conversion claims. Those findings may have a direct bearing on whether appellant has sufficiently established damages as to its negligence action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
