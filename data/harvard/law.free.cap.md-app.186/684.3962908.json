The petition was accompanied by a proposed show cause order and named Thomas G. Stewart (\u201cStewart\u201d) as the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">The petition alleged that Baltimore Street Builders, LLC (hereinafter \u201cBSB\u201d) entered into a contract with Stewart to construct an addition to an existing building that Stewart owned. The work contracted for was intended for residential use. According to the petition, during the course of the construction work, BSB was directed by Stewart to furnish and install additional labor and materials, which resulted in the issuance of change orders that increased the contract price to a projected total cost of $363,780.07. Stewart paid BSB $183,418.60 but failed to pay the $180,361.47 balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">Attached to the petition was the contract signed on February 25, 2006, by Stewart and by one Robert Lenkey, on behalf of BSB.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>A show cause order was issued by the circuit court on March 12, 2008. It required Stewart to show cause \u201cby filing a counter-affidavit or verified answer on or before the 23rd day of April, 2008, why a lien for the amount claimed should not attach upon the land described in the petition.\u201d The petition and the show cause order were served upon Stewart on April 3, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Stewart, <em>pro se, </em>attempted to file an answer to the petition and show cause order on April 23, 2008. His attempt, however, was rebuffed by the clerk of the circuit court because his answer was not accompanied by a certificate of service.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">On April 29, 2008, BSB filed a motion asking the court to issue an interlocutory order granting BSB a mechanic\u2019s lien, based upon the fact that Stewart had not filed a response to the petition. On May 4, 2008, Stewart, by counsel, filed an answer to the petition, supported by an affidavit. Stewart also filed on the same date a motion for additional time to file an answer to the petition to establish and enforce the mechanic\u2019s lien and a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment. This last mentioned pleading was supported by a memorandum of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">Four days after Stewart\u2019s pleadings were filed, on May 8, 2008, a hearing was held in the circuit court concerning the petition to enforce the mechanic\u2019s lien. At the conclusion of the hearing, the judge delivered an oral opinion in which she ruled that because BSB had no home improvement license it had no right to enforce the contract or to establish a lien based upon that contract. A written order was promptly signed dismissing the petition. BSB then filed this appeal in which it raises three questions, which we have reordered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-8\">1. Did the Circuit Court err by finding as a matter of fact and law that [a]ppellant was not a licensed contractor, as required by the Maryland Home Improvement Commission?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-9\">2. Did the Circuit court err by not giving [a]ppellant 30 days to request a trial on [ajppellant\u2019s Petition to Establish and Enforce Mechanic\u2019s Lien?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>3. Did the Circuit court err in denying [ajppellant\u2019s motion for an interlocutory Order?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">In the affidavit filed on May 4, 2008, Stewart swore that the following facts were true: 1) that prior to signing a home improvement contract with BSB he dealt with Robert Lenkey; 2) Lenkey told Stewart that he owned Harbour House Builders, LLC [Harbour House] and that Harbour House would be the entity that would enter into a contract with him; 3) on the day the contract was signed, Lenkey told Stewart that another company he owned, BSB, would perform the home improvement work on Stewart\u2019s property; 4) after the contract was signed, Stewart learned that BSB did not come into existence until March 9, 2007, which was, according to Stewart\u2019s affidavit, \u201cnear the expiration of Robert and Barbara Lenkeys\u2019 work on my property.\u201d; 5) work on Stewart\u2019s property began in \u201cMid-January 2006\u201d and was completed in \u201cJune 2007,\u201d 6) the work performed on his property by Lenkey and/or BSB was deficient in numerous respects; 7) after the contract was executed, at some unspecified time, Stewart learned that \u201cRobert Lenkey, Barbara Lenkey and BSB [were] not licensed as home improvement contractors [with] the Maryland Home Improvement Commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">Attached to Stewart\u2019s affidavits were various exhibits that demonstrated, <em>inter alia, </em>that neither the Lenkeys or BSB have ever had a home improvement license; the exhibits also showed that, according to the records of the Maryland State Department of Assessment and Taxation, BSB did not come into existence until March 9, 2007, which was a little over a year after BSB\u2019s contract with Stewart was signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">The May 8, 2008 Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">At the beginning of the hearing, counsel for BSB pointed out that there was a \u201clegal issue\u201d that was presented for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>first time in Stewart\u2019s motion to dismiss and/or motion for summary judgment. BSB\u2019s counsel said that he and counsel for Stewart, because of this new issue, were \u201crequesting the court ... to postpone the interlocutory hearing, so that we could resolve [the legal issues] through a hearing on the summary judgment motion or [the] motion to dismiss.\u201d The court inquired of counsel for BSB whether he wanted a five minute recess to talk to opposing counsel while the court considered another matter. To this, BSB\u2019s counsel said (ambiguously) \u201cfine\u2014the time for me to respond to the motion hasn\u2019t passed yet.\u201d The court next advised counsel that it was going to decide the motion to dismiss and/or motion for summary judgment first, and that it was necessary for her to do so in order to decide whether or not to grant BSB\u2019s petition to establish a mechanic\u2019s lien. Counsel for BSB did not object; instead, he said that he understood the court\u2019s position, and after some further colloquy, a short recess was called while the court directed its attention to another case.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">After the just mentioned interlude, counsel for BSB admitted to the court that his client had never had a home improvement license. BSB\u2019s counsel proffered, however, that James Kunkel,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a 50% owner of BSB, held \u201ca home improvement license through a company called Stonehenge International [,] Incorporated.... \u201d According to counsel\u2019s proffer, Stonehenge International, Inc. (\u201cStonehenge\u201d) did work on Stewart\u2019s home inasmuch as Mr. Kunkel, as a representative of Stonehenge, \u201cacted as the construction management company on the project.\u201d Counsel for BSB also proffered that his clients (at some unspecified time) contacted the Home Improvement Commission and based on that contact \u201cwere led to believe that they were operating properly, because one of the principals in their company held a home improvement license.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Counsel for BSB further proffered that: 1) BSB had a federal tax identification number that was issued to it in 2005; 2) BSB filed an income tax return in 2006, and 3) Mr. Kunkel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>was listed on the tax returns as a 50% member<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of BSB, a \u201cLimited Liability Company.\u201d BSB also introduced into evidence a complaint against BSB, which was filed by Stewart with the Home Improvement Commission. According to BSB\u2019s counsel, the complaint with the Home Improvement Commission was significant because Stewart said in that complaint that before the project commenced, Robert Lenkey introduced Stewart \u201cto his [Mr. Lenkey\u2019s] partner Jimmy Kunkel (who has a business that operates in Maryland under the name of \u2018Stonehenge International\u2019)\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">BSB makes several arguments in its opening brief in support of its claim that the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment against it. First, it claims that \u201cthe circuit court erred as a matter of law when it found that appellant was not a license[d] contractor when performing the contract with appellee.\u201d Under the argument just mentioned, BSB, citing <em>Antigua Condominium Asso. v. Melba Investors Atlantic, Inc., </em>307 Md. 700, 719, 517 A.2d 75 (1986) and <em>Worsham v. Ehrlich, </em>181 Md.App. 711, 722, 957 A.2d 161 (2008), makes the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayn\">the trial court here treated the motion as one for summary judgment by allowing matters outside the pleading into evidence [on] the day of the hearing on Appellant\u2019s Show Cause Order. Since the trial court treated the motion as one for summary judgment, it must provide the parties with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>a reasonable opportunity to present, in a form suitable for consideration on summary judgment, additional pertinent material.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The rule BSB cites is well established and the reason for it \u201cis because a non-moving party may be prejudiced if a trial court treats a motion to dismiss as a motion for summary judgment by considering matters outside the pleadings, but does not give the non-moving party a reasonable opportunity to present material that may be pertinent to the court\u2019s decision as required by Maryland Rule 2-501.\u201d <em>Worsham, </em>181 Md.App. at 722-23, 957 A.2d 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">We agree with BSB that the circuit court did treat the motion as one for summary judgment. After all, the facts as set forth in the complaint indisputably stated a cause of action upon which relief could be granted. It was only by looking outside the pleading, more specifically by looking at the affidavit signed by Stewart, that the court had a basis to rule that BSB could not enforce the contract because it had no home improvement license.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">BSB maintains that the court erred in failing to give it a reasonable amount of time to respond to the summary judgment motion. Stewart answers by pointing out (correctly) that BSB failed to state in its opening brief what else it would have presented to the circuit court if it had been granted more time.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">The failure to point out what would have been done if more time had been available is important because in order to prevail in a civil case, an appellant must show not only error but must show as well that it was prejudiced by that error. <em>See Flores v. Bell, </em>398 Md. 27, 33, 919 A.2d 716 (2007). In its reply brief, BSB sets forth what it would present if we were to remand this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-10\">1. Evidence of licensure by the Maryland Home Improvement by Mr. Kunkel and Stonehenge International.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>2.

A case analysis of Maryland law demonstrating how the courts have viewed \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with regulatory statutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">We will assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that all the proffers made by BSB\u2019s counsel to the motions judge are true and that if given the chance BSB would have presented additional facts to the circuit court in accordance with representations made by it in its reply brief. But even with those assumptions, we shall hold that appellant has failed to show that it was prejudiced by the court\u2019s failure to give it additional time to answer the summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">The Maryland Home Improvement Law is set forth in Maryland Code (1992, 1998 Repl.Vol., 2002 Supp.), section 8-101 to 8-702 of the Business Regulation Article.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">Section 8-301 reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-7\">\u00a7 8-301. License required; exceptions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-8\">(a) <em>Contractor </em>license.\u2014Except as otherwise provided in this title, a person must have a contractor license whenever the person acts as a contractor in the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-9\">(b) <em>Subcontractor </em>license.\u2014Except as otherwise provided in this title</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-10\">(c) <em>Salesperson </em>license.\u2014Except as otherwise provided in this title, a person must have a salesperson license or contractor license whenever the person sells a home improvement in the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-11\">(d) Exceptions.\u2014This section does not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-12\">(1) an individual who works for a contractor or subcontractor for a salary or wages but who is not a salesperson for the contractor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-13\">(2) a clerical employee, retail clerk, or other employee of a licensed contractor who is not a salesperson, as to a transaction on the premises of the license contractor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>(3) a solicitor for a contractor' who calls an owner by telephone only;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-5\">(4) an architect, electrician, plumber, heating, ventilation, airconditioning, or refrigeration contractor, or other person who:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-6\">(i) is required by State or local law to meet standards of competency or experience before engaging in an occupation or profession;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-7\">(ii) currently is licensed in that occupation or profession under State or local law; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-8\">(iii) is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-9\">1. acting only within the scope of that occupation or profession; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-10\">2. installing a central heating or air-conditioning system;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-11\">(5) a security systems technician licensed under Title 18 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-12\">(6) a person who is selling a home improvement to be performed by a person described in item (4) of this subsection. (Ann.Code 1957, art. 56, \u00a7\u00a7 247, 255, 256; 1992, ch. 4, \u00a7 2; ch. 649; 1994, ch. 3, \u00a7 13; ch. 362; 1999, ch. 483.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-13\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b716-14\">Section l-101(g) of the Business Regulation Article defines \u201cperson\u201d as \u201can individual, receiver, trustee, guardian, personal representative, fiduciary, representative of any kind, partnership, firm, association, corporation, or other entity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-15\">BSB did not exist at the time the contract for home improvements was signed. It was, according to appellant\u2019s proffer, a partnership. BSB did exist, however, at the time of the hearing on this matter. Because Robert Lenkey signed the contract for BSB, he would have been liable to Stewart if the contract was breached and Stewart had sued for damages. <em>Curtis G. Testerman Co., v. Buck, </em>340 Md. 569, 576, 667 A.2d 649 (1995). Inasmuch as neither Robert Lenkey or BSB of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>the informal partnership known as BSB ever had a home improvement contractor\u2019s license, it cannot be said that the \u201cperson\u201d with whom appellee contracted complied with section 8-301(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">In <em>S.A.S. Personnel Consultants Inc. v. Pat-Pan, Inc., </em>286 Md. 335, 341, 407 A.2d 1139 (1979), the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-5\">This Court assumes, if the Legislature does not indicate otherwise, that contracts made by unlicensed persons subject to regulatory statutes designed to protect the public are illegal as against public policy and will not be enforced. <em>Harry Berenter, Inc. v. Berman, </em>258 Md. 290, 298-99, 265 A.2d 759, 764 (1970); <em>Goldsmith &amp; Dell v. Manufacturers\u2019 Liability Ins. Co., </em>132 Md. 283, 286, 103 A. 627, 628 (1918).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The Maryland Home Improvement Law \u201cis a regulatory statute enacted for the protection of the public.\u201d <em>Brzowski v. Maryland Home Improvement Commission, </em>114 Md.App. 615, 628, 691 A.2d 699 (1997) (citing <em>Harry Berenter, Inc. v. Berman, </em>258 Md. 290, 294, 265 A.2d 759 (1970)). In <em>Brzowski, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-7\">The act also established the Home Improvement Guaranty Fund. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 8-401 <em>et seq. </em>The Fund was created to provide an additional remedy for homeowners who suffered actual loss due to unsatisfactory work performed by a home improvement contractor. Md. Ann. Code art. 56, \u00a7 257A(a) (Supp.1985) (recodified at Md.Code Ann., Bus. reg., \u00a7\u00a7 8-403(a),-405(a)); Senate Economic and Environmental Affairs Committee, Bill Analysis for Senate Bill 507 at 2 (1985). The statutory provisions governing the administration of the Fund, however, limit payments from the Fund to only those claims that establish that a homeowner has suffered \u201cactual loss\u201d due to the act or omission of a licensed contractor. Md.Code Ann., Bus. Reg. \u00a7 8-405(a). We shall explain further.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-8\">A claim for reimbursement from the Fund requires the submission of a claim to the Commission, with \u201cthe amount claimed based on the <em>actual loss. \u201d Id., </em>\u00a7 8-406(1) (emphasis added). Upon receipt of a claim, the Commission must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>transmit a copy of the claim to the contractor \u201calleged to be responsible for the <em>actual loss.\u201d Id., </em>\u00a7 8-407(b)(l) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-4\">When the Commission orders payment from the Fund, serious repercussions can be visited upon the contractor responsible for the actual loss that the Fund payment sought to compensate. For instance, if the Commission pays any amount from the Fund on account of a contractor\u2019s conduct, the Commission may suspend the contractor\u2019s license if he fails to reimburse the Fund in full. Md.Code Ann., Bus. Reg. \u00a7 8-411. Naturally, loss of license can have dire consequences for a contractor. A person may not act as contractor in this state without a contractor\u2019s license. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 8-601(a). Indeed, \u201ca licensed person will not be given the assistance of the courts in enforcing contracts within the provisions of the regulatory statute because such enforcement is against public policy.\u201d <em>Harry Berenter, </em>258 Md. at 293, 265 A.2d at 761. <em>See Donmar Md. Corp. v. Hawkesworth, </em>46 Md.App. 575, 576, 420 A.2d 295 (1980). Furthermore, if the Commission pays a claim against the Fund, the rights of the claimant against the contractor are subrogated to the Commission to the extent of the amount paid to the claimant from the Fund. Md.Code Ann., Bus. Reg. \u00a7 8-410(a)(l). The Commission, therefore, may sue any contractor on whose account a claim was paid, if the contractor does not reimburse the Fund in full, including interest. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 8-410(b).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">114 Md.App. at 628-30, 691 A.2d 699 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Stewart contends that the case <em>subjudice </em>is controlled by <em>Harry Berenter, supra. </em>In the <em>Berenter </em>case, Harry Berenter, Inc. attempted to enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County against the property of Phillip G. and Toby Berman. 258 Md. at 291, 265 A.2d 759. In that case, as in the one <em>sub judice, </em>the contractor who performed the home improvement work was not licensed under the Maryland Home Improvement Law. <em>Id. </em>In the <em>Harry Beren</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number><em>ter </em>case, the Court of Appeals, relying upon <em>Goldsmith v. Manufacturers\u2019 Liability Ins. Co., </em>132 Md. 283, 103 A. 627 (1918), and later Maryland cases, held that the Maryland Home Improvement Law is a regulatory statute enacted for the protection of the public and not merely a revenue measure. 258 Md. at 294, 265 A.2d 759. The Court of Appeals then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-4\">Berenter, Inc. earnestly contends that because the enforcement of a mechanic\u2019s lien is involved in an equity court, the rule against the enforcement of contracts by unlicensed persons under regulatory laws should not apply. In our opinion, even though the mechanic\u2019s lien is created by statute, nevertheless such a lien is provided for the <em>enforcement of a contract </em>for work done and materials furnished, Code (1957), Art. 63, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 19. The same public policy is involved in regard to this remedy as is present in regard to other remedies to enforce contracts. It is also clear that courts of equity will not lend their aid to enforce an illegal contract, 3 Pomeroy, <em>Equity Jurisprudence </em>(5th Ed.), \u00a7 940, p. 728.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-5\">The appellant Berenter, Inc., also argues that unless the mechanic\u2019s lien is enforced, the Bermans will be \u201cunjustly enriched to no small extent.\u201d However, as we said in <em>Thorpe v. Carte, </em>[252 Md. 523, 250 A.2d 618 (1969) ] <em>supra, </em>quoting from 2 Restatement, <em>Contracts, </em>\u00a7 598, comment a:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AT\">The court\u2019s refusal is not for the sake of the defendant, but because it will not aid such a plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-6\">Nor is the contention that there is unjust enrichment of the defendants tenable. To permit a recovery on a <em>quantum meruit </em>would defeat and nullify the statute. <em>Northen v. Elledge, </em>72 Ariz. 166, 232 P.2d 111 (1951); <em>Lewis &amp; Queen v. N.M. Ball Sons, </em>48 Cal.2d 141, 308 P.2d 713 (1957).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALB\"><em>Berenter, </em>258 Md. at 296, 265 A.2d 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">In its reply brief, BSB relies on section 09.08.01.04(B) of the Maryland Code of Regulations (\u201cCOMAR\u201d), in support of its position that no license was needed. Section 09.08.01.04 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>04 Corporate or Partnership Licensure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-5\">A.

After all, COMAR 09.08.01.04(A) says in plain English that no corporation or partnership can act as a home improvement contractor unless it obtains a home improvement or contractor\u2019s license. And, based on appellant\u2019s proffer, BSB was an informal partnership prior to becoming a limited liability company.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">BSB next argues that the contract should be enforced because BSB substantially complied with the statute. It phrases its argument as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-7\">Appellant presented evidence by proffer, affidavit and one exhibit that Baltimore Street Builders did comply or at least substantially comply with the statutory requirements. If remanded, Appellant will argue that there was substantial compliance, since one of its members of the limited liability company, who did have the home improvement commission license, not only had a license but oversaw the work in Appellee\u2019s home.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">Because BSB\u2019s counsel admitted at oral argument before us that it was Mr. Kunkel\u2019s company, Stonehenge International, that had the license, we interpret the appellant\u2019s argument to be that BSB substantially complied with the statute because at the time the contract with Stewart was signed, BSB was a partnership and Mr. Kunkel was one of BSB\u2019s partners, and an entity controlled by Mr. Kunkel had a license. Such an attenuated relationship with a license holder can scarcely be considered \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d in light of the requirement that the partnership [BSB] that contracts to do the home improvement work must be licensed. <em>See </em>COMAR 09.08.01.04(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">Appellant next argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>Since the decision in <em>Harry Berenter, Inc. v. Berman, </em>258 Md. 290 [265 A.2d 759] (1970), the Courts have not followed the strict application of this decision. See: <em>Gannon and Sons[Son], Inc. v. Emerson, </em>291 Md. 443 [435 A.2d 449] (1981); <em>Citaramanis v. Hallowell, </em>329[328] Md. 142 [613 A.2d 964] (1992). In <em>Dereggi[DeReggi] Construction Company v.

At times, the statutory goals are best satisfied by allowing such contracts to be enforced. Id.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-5\">The <em>Dereggi[DeReggi] </em>case specifically held that substantial compliance with requirements of the Montgomery County Code requiring a builder\u2019s license before executing a contract was sufficient for the builder to maintain a cause of action. <em>Id. </em>at 660 [747 A.2d 743],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">We have no quarrel with the proposition that substantial compliance with the licensing statute entitles a contractor to enforce a home improvement contract. The <em>DeReggi </em>case, <em>supra, </em>like the one at hand, dealt with the issue of whether the circuit court erred in dismissing a petition to establish a mechanic\u2019s lien brought by a contractor, who at the time it contracted with the defendant, did not have the required license to do the work mentioned in the petition to establish the mechanic\u2019s lien. 130 Md.App. at 653, 747 A.2d 743. In <em>DeReggi, </em>the contractor agreed to build a home for the appellees in Montgomery County but, at the time of contracting, did not have the license required under the Montgomery County Code. <em>Id. </em>at 652-53, 747 A.2d 743. The <em>DeReggi </em>Court distinguished that case from <em>Berenter </em>on the grounds that the contractor \u201cdid obtain a building license after the contract was executed but before any actual work began pursuant to the contract.\u201d The contractor in <em>DeReggi </em>contended that because he had a license when the work began, he had substantially complied with the requirements of the Mont<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>gomery County Code. <em>Id. </em>at 658, 747 A.2d 743. After holding that substantial compliance with the Montgomery County licensing requirement would be sufficient to allow a builder to maintain a cause of action to enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien, <em>id. </em>at 660, 747 A.2d 743, we remanded the case so that additional evidence could be produced concerning the question as to whether the builder had substantially complied with the Montgomery County Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">Judge Sally Adkins, speaking for this Court in <em>DeReggi, </em>said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-5\">[C]ircumstances may arise where a financially responsible and otherwise qualified builder fails to strictly comply with the licensing requirements. To deny such a builder access to the courts <em>per se </em>will lead to a harsh and inequitable result in the instances where a builder completes the project in a professional manner. For this reason, we agree with those jurisdictions that have found that substantial compliance with builder\u2019s licensing requirements is sufficient. <em>See Capitol </em>Indent.[Indemnity], 900 P.2d at 1214 (citing cases); <em>McNairy v. Sugar Creek Resort, Inc., </em>576 So.2d 185, 187 (Ala.1991); <em>Latipac, Inc. v. Superior Court of Marin County, </em>64 Cal.2d 278, 49 Cal.Rptr. 676, 411 P.2d 564, 567 (1966) (\u201cIf the facts clearly indicate that the contractor has \u2018substantially\u2019 complied with the statute and that such compliance has afforded to the obligor the protection contemplated by the statute, we have rejected the obligor\u2019s attempts to escape liability.\u201d); <em>Murphy v. Campbell Inv. Co., </em>79 Wash.2d 417, 486 P.2d 1080, 1083 (1971).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-6\">In the instant case, we remand to the circuit court for a determination of whether appellants substantially complied with the MCC [Montgomery County Code]. The trial court should determine whether the purpose of the statute, to protect the public from unscrupulous and financially irresponsible contractors, has been met. In determining whether there was substantial compliance, courts in other jurisdictions have looked at a number of factors, including: (1) whether the contractor held a valid license at the time of contracting; (2) whether the contractor readily secured a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>license; and (3) the responsibility and competence of the contractor. <em>See Latipac, </em>49 Cal.Rptr. 676, 411 P.2d at 568-70. Although \u201ceach factor need not be present ... \u2018the true test is whether the contractor\u2019s substantial compliance with the licensing requirements satisfies the policy of the statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Capitol Indent. [Indemnity], </em>900 P.2d at 1213 (quoting <em>Koehler v. Donnelly, </em>114 N.M. 363, 838 P.2d 980, 982 (1992)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 660-61, 747 A.2d 743.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">The facts here presented stand in stark contrast to the facts presented in <em>DeReggi, </em>where the contractor obtained the required license prior to starting work on the contract. Here BSB never acquired the license required. Four of the cases cited in <em>DeReggi </em>provide good illustrations of what does constitute substantial compliance with a licensing statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">In <em>Jones v. Short, </em>696 P.2d 665 (Alaska 1985), a contractor filed a petition to establish a mechanic\u2019s lien. <em>Id. </em>at 666. The petition was challenged by the property owner, who demonstrated that the petitioner did not have a valid certificate of registration as required by state law when the contract with defendant was made. <em>Id. </em>at 667. Nevertheless, the contractor had, prior to entering into the contract, done everything necessary to obtain the required certificate, including acquiring public liability and property insurance and a surety bond, and had paid a filing fee, but his insurance agent had failed to procure the necessary insurance certificate for him. The <em>Jones </em>Court held that petitioner was in substantial compliance with the regulatory statute because what the contractor had done afforded the public the same protection that strict compliance would offer. <em>Id. </em>at 668.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">In the case of <em>Aesthetic Property Maintenance, Inc. v. Capitol Indemnity Corporation, </em>183 Ariz. 74, 900 P.2d 1210, 1212 (1995), a licensed contractor moved to a new address while in the process of renewing its license in 1990. The contractor included its new address with the renewal papers he filed and the license was renewed. <em>Id. </em>In late 1991, the Registrar of Contractors erroneously sent a renewal notice to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>the contractor\u2019s old address. Because the notice was not received, the license was not renewed, as it should have been by the end of 1991. Because it was not renewed, the license expired. <em>Id. </em>Meanwhile, in December 1991, prior to the expiration of its license, the contractor entered into a contract to perform certain construction work with the defendant. <em>Id. </em>The contractor\u2019s license was suspended on January 1, 1992, and work was completed on March 5, 1992. <em>Id. </em>The contractor did not learn of the suspension until late June 1992. <em>Id. </em>When the contractor discovered the mistake, it immediately sought and received reinstatement. During this lapse of licensure, the contractor maintained its general liability insurance, workers\u2019 compensation insurance, and surety bond. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">The contractor was not paid and it sued the defendant for non-payment; the defendant raised the defense of non-licensure. <em>Id. </em>The Arizona Supreme Court noted, at the outset, that the purpose of the licensure statute was to protect the public from unscrupulous, unqualified, and financially irresponsible contractors. <em>Id. </em>at 1213. The court held that under the facts of that case, the legislative purpose had been fulfilled because the contractor remained financially responsible by keeping current its surety bond, workers\u2019 compensation insurance, liability insurance, and financial documents and that no one was prejudiced by the contractor\u2019s failure to strictly comply with the licensing requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 1213-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">In <em>McNairy v. Sugar Creek Resort, Inc., </em>576 So.2d 185 (Ala.1991), a contractor, on July 6, 1987, applied for a license and with his application deposited a cashier\u2019s check in the amount of $200.00 to pay for it. On the same date, the contractor requested that his bank release certain information to the licensing board. <em>Id. </em>at 185-86. The bank neglected to file the necessary paper work with the licensing board for almost a year. <em>Id. </em>at 186. On June 20, 1988, the bank belatedly filed the required information and the State issued the contractor a license on that date. <em>Id. </em>Meanwhile, while it was not licensed, the contractor entered into a contract with Sugar Creek Resort, Inc. (\u201cSugar Creek\u201d). <em>Id. </em>at 187-88. At that point, it was unknown to the contractor that the bank had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>not sent the paperwork to the State. As a result, the contractor did some work for Sugar Creek while unlicensed. <em>Id. </em>In response to a suit for non-payment of the amount due on the contract, Sugar Creek raised a no-license defense. The Alabama Supreme Court held in favor of the contractor and against Sugar Creek because the contractor\u2019s failure to obtain a license was solely caused by his bank\u2019s oversight, and because Sugar Creek, after the contractor became licensed, repeatedly ratified and adopted the original contract by making payments. <em>Id. </em>at 188-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Another substantial performance case cited in <em>DeReggi </em>is <em>Murphy v. Campbell Investment Co., </em>79 Wash.2d 417, 486 P.2d 1080 (1971). In that case, a contractor applied for a license, but the application was rejected because the contractor failed to include proof of liability and property damage insurance (although in fact the contractor had such insurance). <em>Id. </em>at 1081. At the same time, the contractor was negotiating a contract with a property owner to provide labor, materials, and equipment for a construction project. <em>Id. </em>The parties signed a contract, construction started immediately thereafter, and the contractor resubmitted its license application about three weeks after work started. The license was then promptly issued. The Court held that substantial compliance with the licensing statute was shown inasmuch as the purpose of the statute was to \u201cprevent the victimizing of a defenseless public by unreliable, fraudulent and incompetent contractors, many of whom operated a transient business from the relative safety of neighboring states.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1088. The statute was written to ensure minimum financial security for the consumers who hire building contractors. Once again, the statutory purpose was fulfilled because the contractor had the required property and liability insurance and surety bond, and the license having been rejected due to a purely technical defect. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">The common feature of the cases just summarized is that shortly after the contract at issue was signed, the contractor obtained a license, the defendant was not prejudiced, and the purpose of the statute was accomplished even though the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>contractor had not strictly complied with the dictates of the licensing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">The purpose of the Maryland Home Improvement Law is, among other things, to protect homeowners from unskilled builders. That is the obvious reason for requiring an applicant for a license to pass a test and to have experience. <em>See </em>Md.Code Ann., (Bus.Reg.) sections 8-302 and 8-302.2. Another purpose is to make sure that contractors are financially responsible. <em>See </em>section 8-302.1 (requiring contractors to have at least $50,000.00 in liability insurance). Also built into the law are remedies that the homeowner has against licensed contractors. Section 8-208 of the Home Improvement Law charges the Home Improvement Commission with the administration and enforcement of the statute and subtitle 3 Sections 8-301-8-317 authorize the commission to take remedial actions if there are violations of the licensing provisions. As pointed out in <em>Brzowski v. Maryland Home Improvement Commission, </em>114 Md.App. at 628, 691 A.2d 699, provisions of the law governing the administration of the Home Improvement Guaranty Fund limit payments from the Fund to only those submitted by claimants who can establish that he or she has suffered actual loss due to the act or omission of a licensed contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Because neither BSB nor Mr. Lenkey, who signed on behalf of BSB, had a home improvement license, Stewart was foreclosed from making a successful claim against either of them before the Home Improvement Commission, even though Stewart claims that the contractor was guilty of faulty workmanship. Nor does Stewart have any assurance that the person and/or entity he contracted with is financially sound. And, the mere fact that Stonehenge International, a sub contractor, was licensed does not fulfill the purpose of the Home Improvement Law insofar as Stewart is concerned. After all, Stewart never contracted with that entity and thus could not have successfully brought a breach contract action against Stonehenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>For all the reasons set forth above, we hold that BSB did not substantially comply with the licensing requirements of the Maryland Home Improvement Law. Thus, the motions judge did not err when she ruled that the contract BSB sought to enforce by imposition of a mechanic\u2019s lien was unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Appellant claims, citing Md. Rule 12-304(e)(3), that the court erred in not allowing it thirty days to request that the case be set for trial. Md. Rule 12-304 deals with the procedure to be followed when a petition to establish a mechanic\u2019s lien is filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">Maryland Rule 12-304(e)(3) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-8\">(3) Probable cause not found. If no judgment or interlocutory order is entered under subsection (1) and (2), the court shall enter an order that the portion of the complaint seeking to establish the lien be dismissed unless the plaintiff, within 30 days thereafter, files a written request that the portion of the complaint seeking to establish the lien be assigned for trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">The rule relied upon by BSB only applies when the court finds that no probable cause for the issuance of a mechanic\u2019s lien exists. The circuit court did not make a \u201cno probable cause\u201d finding in this case, nor was it required to do so. <em>Berenter v. Berman, supra, </em>is directly on point. The holding in <em>Berenter </em>was that an unlicensed home improvement contractor cannot enforce a home improvement contract by imposition of a mechanic\u2019s lien. 258 Md. at 291, 298-99, 265 A.2d 759. Because BSB\u2019s contract with Stewart could not be enforced, appellant was not entitled to a trial at which it could attempt to enforce the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-10\">y.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-11\">As already mentioned, BSB raises the question: \u201cDid the circuit court err in denying Appellant\u2019s motion for an interlocutory order?\u201d In its brief, however, it does not answer that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>question. Nor is any argument presented in relation to it. By failing to present argument in support of its position, appellant waived its right to have us consider this question. <em>See Beck v. Mangels, </em>100 Md.App. 144, 149, 640 A.2d 236 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b711-6\">.
