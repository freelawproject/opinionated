The court sentenced appellant to life imprisonment on the first-degree felony murder conviction, 25 years on each of the two first-degree assault convictions, and 20 years on each of the three convictions for use of a handgun in a crime of violence convictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The sentences were consecutive, resulting in an aggregate sentence of life imprisonment, plus 110 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">Appellant presents the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-10\">1. Did the court err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress his statements to the police?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-11\">2. Did the trial court err in refusing to instruct the jury on second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-12\">3. Did the trial court err in responding to a question from the jury during deliberations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-13\">4. Did the trial court err in granting the State\u2019s motion to join for trial the two cases against appellant?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-14\">For the reasons set forth below, we shall affirm appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">On September 8, 2006, at approximately 9:30 p.m., Randy Hudson drove to pick up his daughter at the home of her grandparents, Anna and Eric Fountain. As Mr. Hudson approached the back door of the residence and inserted his key in the door, \u201csome guy jump[ed] out from nowhere and grab [bed][him] from behind.\u201d The attacker forced Mr. Hudson into a headlock and dragged him into the alley behind the house. Two other men approached, one armed with a handgun. The men advised Mr. Hudson that he should be quiet, and they demanded his money. After the three men took approximately $3,000, Mr. Hudson broke free and attempted to run away, but he tripped on a manhole cover. The men caught Mr. Hudson, and they beat him. As a result of the physical assault, Mr. Hudson drifted in and out of consciousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Anna Fountain, who was sleeping on the couch in the living room with her granddaughter that night, testified that she woke up when she heard a noise in the house. She saw two men coming down the stairs. The men pointed a gun at Ms. Fountain and instructed her \u201cnot to look up at them.\u201d The men went out the back door, came back in, and then ran back upstairs. Each of the four times they did this, they pointed the gun at her and told her not to look at them. One of the men took Ms. Fountain\u2019s cell phone.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On the fourth trip into the house, they brought Mr. Hudson into the residence, kicked him, and dragged him upstairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">After the men left, Ms. Fountain locked the back door; She ran upstairs and discovered her husband, Eric Fountain, who had been shot, and Mr. Hudson. Ms. Fountain went through Mr. Hudson\u2019s pockets, located his cell phone, and, at 10:57 p.m., called 9-1-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Officer Thomas Wehrle testified that he arrived at the scene in response to a call for a possible shooting, and he heard loud screams. The door to the residence was slightly ajar and he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>saw Ms. Fountain on her knees, screaming and crying. Upon seeing the police officers, Ms. Fountain stated, \u201che\u2019s upstairs. Hurry.\u201d The police officers discovered two bodies on the second floor. Mr. Hudson was lying on his back, unresponsive, but alive. Mr. Fountain was unresponsive, and \u201c[i]t appeared initially that he was deceased.\u201d Medical personnel arrived and pronounced Mr. Fountain dead. The medical examiner later determined the cause of death to be two gunshot wounds to Mr. Fountain\u2019s torso.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">On September 29, 2006, at approximately 4:30 a.m., the Baltimore County Police arrested appellant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Sergeant Marvin Haw transported appellant to police headquarters. Appellant stated: \u201c[WJhat took so long? It\u2019s been, like, three weeks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Detective Craig Schrott, a homicide detective with the Baltimore County Police Department, interviewed appellant later that day from approximately 12:47 p.m. to 2:10 p.m. The detective informed appellant of his <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>rights, including that \u201canything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.\u201d Appellant waived these rights and agreed to speak with the detective without an attorney present. The first thing that appellant said was: \u201cWhat I want to know is[,J who the hell put me in this situation?\u201d The detective responded: \u201c[YJou remember the incident, \u2019cause you were there that day, right?\u201d Mr. Lee stated: \u201cI\u2019m not stupid. I\u2019m not stupid. I know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Later in the interview, appellant acknowledged going into the Fountain residence. He stated, however, that he went into the house after Darnell Smith, his cousin, and John Satterfield. He initially stated that he did not know what was going on inside the house. He admitted going to the second floor of the house and seeing Mr. Fountain, who had been shot, but he denied hearing any gunshots and denied that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>knew \u201cwho did it.\u201d Appellant denied that he was with Darnell when the shooting took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Soon thereafter, Detective Schrott advised that he knew that appellant shot Mr. Fountain and explained why appellant would want to explain what happened:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-6\">[DETECTIVE:] But reason\u2014has a difference, bud, in the end. It really does. It makes a difference to you; it makes a difference to that man\u2019s[ ] family. It makes, it makes a difference. \u25a0 It, it really does. Now, if you were coldblooded and you went in there and you didn\u2019t care, this is what happened, so be it. But I can see that\u2019s not it. I mean, that, that\u2019s not even an option with you. I can see that. You got a heart. You got humanity to you. I think it\u2019s one of the things that just happened, you can\u2019t explain it. A bad decision to go inside that house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-7\">You didn\u2019t even have a gun when you went up there. Your cousin were [sic] to go back outside, because he was upset because there wasn\u2019t any money upstairs, like [Mr. Hudson] said, and he gave you the gun and asked [ ] you [to] watch that man\u2014and if that man would have just stayed in the bed, I have no doubt, no doubt in my mind you and I would have never met. Isn\u2019t that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-8\">[APPELLANT:] Oh, my God.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-9\">[DETECTIVE:] What\u2019s important\u2014well, it\u2019s important for you, Chris; it\u2019s[ ] important for everybody. You don\u2019t[ ] want to be seen as coldblood[ed]. I know[ ] you\u2019re not. But you got to give an explanation. I mean, you\u2019re the only[ ] one that was up there when it happened, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYG\">[APPELLANT:] (Witness shaking head no.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-10\">[DETECTIVE:] I mean, if you don\u2019t tell the story, nobody\u2019s going to tell you it. And it just sounds\u2014it\u2019s like reading a newspaper, you know. The two of you were upstairs. Darnell gives you the gun. He goes downstairs, at which time that man\u2019s shot. Nobody really knows what happened up there. I mean, could have been where people are going to say, well, maybe he said hell with it, he just shot him \u2018cause he was pissed\u2019 cause there\u2019s no money up there. You <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>don\u2019t want people thinking that, you know. I think it was an accident. I\u2014true, I do\u20141 can look on your face and I know it was an accident. But I need you to tell me that. It\u2019s no doubt whether you did it or not. There\u2019s no doubt, Chris. The only question is the details. I think it\u2019s important for you to be able to get this off your shoulders. I can see how you\u2019re living with this. It\u2019s important for that man\u2019s family to know, too. There\u2019s a difference in a situation like that from being perceived as cold-blooded or a situation that just took an ugly twist by no fault of your own. That something just happened, and that\u2019s the reaction it was. Or, or if he struggled, if he reached for the gun, maybe you went to hit him with the gun and the gun went off. I mean, what happened?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The detective then asked several questions about Mr. Fountain\u2019s location to \u201cget a better picture of what\u2019s going on, what you\u2019re going through.\u201d The following then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-6\">[DETECTIVE:]\u2014is he standing up, or was he still in bed? Was he sleeping? Was he awake? Chris, bud\u2014all right. Was he still in bed or did he get up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-7\">[APPELLANT:] I\u2019m going to jail, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-8\">[DETECTIVE:] We\u2019re not talking about jail right now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABZj\">[APPELLANT:] Just\u2014that\u2019s what the whole thing is about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5F\">[DETECTIVE:] That ain\u2019t what it\u2019s about. It\u2019s about getting to what the truth is, that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about. Now, was he still in bed, or did he get out of bed while your cousin was up there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-9\">[APPELLANT:] He was still in bed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-10\">When asked what happened, appellant told the detective that Mr. Satterfield advised that there was money under the bed. The interrogation continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-11\">[DETECTIVE:] John told you that. So\u2014all right, sir\u2014so when you got there, you went into that room, was that man awake; was he asleep?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-12\">[APPELLANT:] He was asleep.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-13\">[DETECTIVE:] He was asleep?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>[APPELLANT:] Yeah, this is being recorded [somewhere, aint it?]<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-4\">[DETECTIVE:] This is between you and me, bud. Only me and you are here, all right? All right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-5\">[APPELLANT:] I\u2019m trying to put together fact and accept that my life is basically over.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Appellant then stated that he, not John Satterfield, was getting a murder charge. Detective Schrott explained that, for felony murder, a person who did not personally kill the victim would be guilty of murder if the killing occurred during a felony in which the person participated.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">The detective then returned to questioning appellant about the events that transpired immediately prior to the shooting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7U\">[DETECTIVE:] Are you guys\u2014do you wake him up, or does your cousin wake him up looking for the money, or do you try to find the money without waking him up?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsP\">[APPELLANT:] First we look under the bed. He, he woke up when my cousin left, then he try to rush me. He got too close. I tried to run. I didn\u2019t see, I didn\u2019t see why. I try to get him away from me so I could leave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-8\">[DETECTIVE:] So you were trying to get away?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ats\">[APPELLANT:] I, I thought, I thought a gunshot would scare him. I ain\u2019t know I hit him. I wasn\u2019t even looking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxV\">[DETECTIVE:] How\u2019d you shoot when you were running? I mean, did you shoot like over you shoulder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azn\">[APPELLANT:] No. Like, like this (Indicating). \u2018Cause I was close, near the door, and he, he just kept coming. I shot two immediate times. It\u2019s not like I shot, went away, shot here. I shot. [T]wo immediate times.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">According to appellant, he gave the gun back to his cousin after they left the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>On October 23, 2006, a grand jury indicted appellant for felony murder and other charges relating to the events that resulted in Mr. Fountain\u2019s death. Appellant was denied bail, and he remained incarcerated at the Baltimore County Department of Corrections pending trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">On November 29, 2006, an inmate in the Baltimore County Detention Center volunteered information to law enforcement regarding this case. A \u201cbody wire\u201d was placed on the inmate,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and it recorded a conversation between the inmate and appellant. During this conversation, appellant negotiated an agreement with the informant to murder Chelene Smith, a potential witness against him on the murder charge. Shortly after obtaining this recording, appellant was charged with soliciting the murder of Ms. Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">On July 16, 2007, the State filed a Motion for Joinder of Offense, seeking to join the case involving the crimes at the Fountain residence with the separate charge against appellant for soliciting the murder of a witness. The State argued that a joint trial was appropriate because the \u201cevidence is mutually admissible,\u201d stating that \u201cevidence of the Murder ... provides motive for the subsequent Solicitation to Commit Murder\u201d and \u201c[t]he evidence in [the Solicitation to Commit Murder case] provides evidence of the Defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt for the Murder.\u201d On August 8, 2007, the circuit court granted the State\u2019s motion to join the two cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">On August 27 and 28, 2007, the court held a hearing on appellant\u2019s motion to suppress his statement to Detective Schrott. Appellant argued that appellant\u2019s statement should have been suppressed because it was involuntary and it was taken in violation of <em>Miranda. </em>Appellant argued, among other things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-8\">[W]hat you have is, in effect, an agreement that it\u2019s not going to be used. I mean, the first thing the Detective said is, Anything you say is going to be used against you. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>then he lies to him about it being recorded for the purpose of being used against him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The State argued that the detective\u2019s statement was not improper, and that it did not impact appellant\u2019s willingness to be involved in the interrogation. The State argued that appellant voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived his rights and gave a statement to the detective.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">Prior to the State\u2019s argument, the court noted that it had \u201csome concern that Detective Schrott basically vitiates the <em>[Miranda </em>] waiver about anything you say can be used against you when he says this is just between you and me.... \u201d Ultimately, however, at the conclusion of all the arguments the court denied appellant\u2019s motion, reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-7\">The statement he makes is, this is being recorded, ain\u2019t it? The Detective does not directly answer that question by saying yes or no, but he certainly leaves the Defendant to believe that the conversation is just between the two of them, which was not true. But I do not think that [ ] it changed the Defendant\u2019s willingness to answer the questions in any way. Or violated his rights. So the Motion to suppress the Defendant\u2019s statement is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">On January 14, 2008, trial commenced. Tori Kucz testified that, on September 8, 2006, she was with her boyfriend, Mr. Satterfield; her friend, Chelene Smith; appellant; and his cousin, Darnell Smith.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Ms. Kucz testified that appellant, Mr. Satterfield, and Darnell left her and Chelene to go for a walk. After approximately 45 minutes to an hour, Ms. Kucz heard people running and saying, \u201c[sjtart the car. Get in the fuckin\u2019 car. Start the car.\u201d She got into her car with Chelene, Darnell, and appellant; Appellant said: \u201cI shot him, yo.\u201d He continued: \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to. He came at the gun. I know, yo. I know. I didn\u2019t mean to shoot him. I think he\u2019s dead, yo. He turnt [sic] that color white, you know, the color white when they die, when somebody\u2019s dead. He turnt [sic] that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>color white.\u201d They drove off and picked up Mr. Satterfield, who \u201cstarted flippin\u2019 out on [Darnell] and [appellant],\u201d swearing at them, telling them that they were dumb, and stating, that \u201cnobody was supposed to get shot.\u201d Ms. Kucz testified that appellant \u201ckept sayin\u2019 over and over ... he\u2019s that color white, <em>jo. </em>I think I really shot him. He came at the gun. I didn\u2019t mean to do it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Ms. Kucz testified that they drove to Baltimore City and stopped at a 7-Eleven off of Bel Air Road. Appellant had a cell phone, which he wiped off and threw in the grass behind the convenience store.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Two police officers and a forensic technician testified regarding the initial response to the 9-1-1 call and the collection of evidence at the crime scene, including a shell casing that was discovered at the residence. A handgun was recovered from the house where Darnell was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Sergeant Mark Ensor, an expert in firearms identification with the Baltimore County Police, testified that the bullet removed from the victim\u2019s body, as well as the shell casing located at the crime scene, was fired from the handgun seized from Darnell\u2019s address.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">Appellant testified in his own defense. Although acknowledging that he entered the Fountains\u2019 home, appellant denied shooting Mr. Fountain, hitting Mr. Hudson, threatening Ms. Fountain, and taking property from either Mr. Hudson or Ms. Fountain. Instead, appellant blamed his cousin, Darnell, for the crimes. Appellant testified that Darnell entered the Fountain residence armed with a handgun. He testified that he went to the house to see if Darnell \u201cwas all right or what he was doin[g].\u201d Appellant went upstairs, and he saw his cousin looking under the bed for money. Appellant testified that his cousin admitted shooting Mr. Fountain, stating: \u201c[H]e tried to rush me. I had to shoot him.\u201d Appellant acknowledged that he took the gun from his cousin at one point, and that he helped bring Mr. Hudson into the house, but he denied other involvement in the crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>With respect to his statement to the police, appellant testified that he confessed to shooting Mr. Fountain because Mr. Satterfield, purportedly a member of a powerful prison gang, threatened to kill him or his family if he did not admit to the police that he shot Mr. Fountain. With respect to the recorded negotiations with an informant regarding hiring a person to murder Chelene, appellant testified that he \u201cwasn\u2019t serious.\u201d Rather, he was \u201cjust talkin\u2019 trash\u201d and \u201c[vjentin\u2019 [his] anger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">On January 17, 2008, the jury began deliberations. The jury returned a verdict the next day, finding appellant guilty of (1) first-degree felony murder of Mr. Fountain; (2) first-degree burglary of the Fountain residence; (8) two counts of first-degree assault of Mr. Hudson and Ms. Fountain; (4) three counts of use of a handgun in the commission of a felony relating to Mr. Fountain, Ms. Fountain, and Mr. Hudson; (5) and three counts of use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, with the same three victims. The jury found appellant not guilty of solicitation to murder Chelene Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">Motion to Suppress</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">Appellant\u2019s first contention is that the circuit court erred in denying his motion to suppress the statement that he gave to the police following his arrest. This contention is based on an exchange between appellant and Detective Schrott, which occurred after appellant had waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and after some discussion of the events of the evening. This exchange was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-11\">[APPELLANT:] Yeah, this is being recorded [somewhere aint it?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-13\">[DETECTIVE:] This is between you and me, bud. Only me and you are here, all right? All right?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>Although the suppression court initially expressed \u201csome concern\u201d that the statement vitiated the <em>Miranda </em>waiver, it ultimately denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-4\">The statement he makes is, this is being recorded, ain\u2019t it? The Detective does not directly answer that question by saying yes or no, but he certainly leaves the Defendant to believe that the conversation is just between the two of them, which was not true. But I do not think that the, it changed the Defendant\u2019s willingness to answer the questions in any way. Or violated his rights. So the Motion to Suppress the Defendant\u2019s statement is denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">An appellate court reviews the grant or denial of a motion to suppress by looking \u201cto the record of the suppression hearing.\u201d <em>State v. Tolbert, </em>381 Md. 539, 548, 850 A.2d 1192, <em>cert. denied, </em>543 U.S. 852, 125 S.Ct. 263, 160 L.Ed.2d 85 (2004). The court accepts the factual findings of the circuit court unless clearly erroneous, and it reviews \u201cthe evidence and the inferences that may be reasonably drawn in the light most favorable to the prevailing party.\u201d <em>Rush v. State, </em>403 Md. 68, 83, 939 A.2d 689 (2008). The appellate court, however, makes \u201can independent, constitutional appraisal of the record by reviewing the law and applying it to the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Shatzer v. State, </em>405 Md. 585, 592, 954 A.2d 1118 (2008), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1043, 173 L.Ed.2d 468 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">In arguing that the circuit court\u2019s ruling was erroneous, appellant characterizes Detective Schrott\u2019s statement as a \u201cpromise of confidentiality.\u201d Appellant argues that any subsequent statements he made should be suppressed because: (1) \u201c[t]he detective\u2019s assurance of confidentiality contradicted the <em>Miranda </em>warning that anything he said could be used against him in court and therefore nullified the prior <em>Miranda </em>advisement\u201d; and (2) the detective\u2019s statement \u201crenders [appellant\u2019s] statements involuntary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">The State argues that the trial court properly denied the motion to suppress for several reasons. First, it contends that there was neither a request for, nor promise of, confidentiality in this case. Second, the State argues that other statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>made during the interrogation, \u201cas well as [appellant\u2019s] demeanor during the confession ... all demonstrate that [appellant] had no reasonable expectation that his statements would not be used against him[.]\u201d Third, the State contends that the record supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the detective\u2019s statement \u201cdid not change [appellant\u2019s] willingness to answer questions in any way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">In Maryland, the confession of a criminal defendant will not be admitted as evidence at trial unless it was \u201c(1) voluntary under Maryland nonconstitutional law, (2) voluntary under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, and (3) elicited in conformance with the mandates of <em>Miranda.\u201d Griner v.

As explained below, we agree with the State that the circuit court properly rejected the argument that Detective Schrott\u2019s statement violated <em>Miranda </em>or rendered appellant\u2019s confession involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">\n<em>Miranda</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">It is well-established that, before police officers may subject an individual to custodial interrogation, the individual must be advised of certain rights, including that \u201canything he says can be used against him in a court of law....\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 479, 86 S.Ct. 1602.

Second, the waiver must have been made with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it. Only if the \u201ctotality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation\u201d reveals both an uncoerced choice and the requisite level of comprehension may a court properly conclude that the <em>Miranda </em>rights have been waived.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-5\"><em>Moran v. Burbine, </em>475 U.S. 412, 421, 106 S.Ct. 1185, 89 L.Ed.2d 410 (1986) (citation omitted). The determination whether an accused knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to remain silent is determined by reviewing the \u201ctotality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation.\u201d <em>McIntyre v. State, </em>309 Md. 607, 615, 526 A.2d 30(1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Here, there is no question that appellant was advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and that his initial waiver of these rights was valid. Rather, appellant\u2019s argument is that following this waiver, \u201cLt]he deception employed by the detective vitiated [his Miranda; ] rights and nullified his waiver.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">The Court of Appeals has stated that the police \u201care permitted to use a certain amount of subterfuge, when questioning an individual about his or her suspected involvement in a crime.\u201d <em>Ball v. State, </em>347 Md. 156, 178, 699 A.2d 1170 (1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1082, 118 S.Ct. 866, 139 L.Ed.2d 763 (1998).

LaFave, Jerold H. Israel and Nancy J. King, Criminal Procedure \u00a7 6.9(c) (3d. ed. 2000)), <em>aff'd, </em>394 Md. 378, 906 A.2d 374 (2006).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">In <em>Logan, </em>this Court found a <em>Miranda </em>violation when a detective made \u201caffirmative misstatements that conflicted with the <em>Miranda </em>advisement that anything appellant said could be used against him.\u201d 164 Md.App. at 48, 882 A.2d 330. The detective made various statements to Logan prior to Logan\u2019s waiver of rights, including: \u201cwe\u2019re talking\u201d; \u201cthe only way this jeopardizes you is if you don\u2019t tell the truth\u201d; and that the officer would not \u201cuse any of the information to harm\u201d Logan. <em>Id. </em>This Court held that, in light of these statements, the <em>Miranda </em>advisement was \u201cfatally flawed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49, 882 A.2d 330. In particular, we held that the officer\u2019s statement, that the only way this jeopardizes you is if you don\u2019t tell the truth, \u201cflatly contradicted the <em>Miranda </em>warning, and thus nullified\u201d the <em>Miranda </em>warning given to Logan. <em>Id. </em>at 48, 882 A.2d 330.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">We note that in <em>Logan </em>the improper statements were made <em>before </em>the suspect waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Here, by contrast, the statements at issue were made <em>after </em>Lee was advised of his rights and waived them. Some courts have indicated that misstatements or deception by police after a \u2022valid waiver does not invalidate the prior waiver. <em>See United States v. Bezanson-Perkins, </em>390 F.3d 34, 41 (1st Cir.2004) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>(questioning whether police misstatements <em>after </em>a voluntary-waiver could invalidate the waiver); <em>United States v. Chadwick, </em>999 F.2d 1282, 1286 (8th Cir.1993) (detective\u2019s statement that Chadwick\u2019s cooperation would \u201chelp\u201d him did not invalidate Chadwick\u2019s waiver of <em>his Miranda </em>rights; it \u201ccould not have had any impact on Chadwick\u2019s decision to waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights, since the waiver had occurred earlier.\u201d). <em>See also Soffar v. Cockrell, </em>300 F.3d 588, 598 (5th Cir.2002) (detective\u2019s misleading statements to the defendant did not invalidate a <em>Miranda </em>waiver that had already occurred).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Other courts, however, have made no distinction with respect to the timing of police deception, and they have held that police deception after a waiver can nullify or vitiate the earlier <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>See, e.g., State v. Pillar, </em>359 N.J.Super. 249, 820 A.2d 1, 10-11 (App.Div.) (agreement to suspect\u2019s request to speak \u201coff the record\u201d rendered subsequent statement inadmissible because \u201csuch a misrepresentation directly contradicts and thereby neutralizes the entire purpose of the Miranda warnings\u201d), <em>cert. denied, in </em>N.J. 572, 832 A.2d 322 (2003); <em>State v. Stanga, </em>617 N.W.2d 486, 491 (S.D.2000) (statements made after waiver \u201cnullified\u201d the earlier <em>Miranda, </em>warnings). Courts adopting this approach view a suspect\u2019s waiver as a <em>\u201ccontinuing </em>decision, implicit throughout the interrogation.\u201d Andrew V. Jezic. Frank Molony, &amp; William E. Nolan, Maryland Law on Confessions \u00a7 11:10, at 444 (2008). Thus, even if an initial waiver of <em>Miranda </em>was valid, subsequent deception by the police may \u201cinvalidate! ] an essential term of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, th\u00e9reby rendering that waiver no longer in effect.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\"> We agree that the timing of the police deception is not dispositive. Rather, the central issue is whether the deception misleads the suspect regarding the rights explained in the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and deprives the suspect \u201cof knowledge essential to his ability to understand the nature of his rights and the consequences of abandoning them.\u201d <em>Moran, </em>475 U.S. at 424, 106 S.Ct. 1135. If a voluntary decision to speak is \u201cmade with full awareness and comprehension of all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>the information <em>Miranda </em>requires the police to convey,\u201d a waiver is valid. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">Against this background, we consider appellant\u2019s claim that a police officer\u2019s promise of confidentiality is the type of deception that nullifies an earlier <em>Miranda </em>warning. Prior to the <em>Miranda </em>decision, the Court of Appeals found that promises of confidentiality were not improper. <em>In Markley v. State, </em>173 Md. 309, 316-18, 196 A. 95 (1938), the Court of Appeals rejected the argument that it is improper for the police to promise to keep the suspect\u2019s name \u201cout of any published statements\u201d and to regard his statement as \u201cconfidential.\u201d The Court stated that \u201c[a]n assurance of secrecy is regularly held insufficient to render a confession inadmissible on the ground that it is involuntary.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 317, 196 A. 95. As indicated, however, this case pre dates the <em>Miranda </em>decision. Thus, it does not address the issue here, <em>i.e., </em>whether a promise of confidentiality nullifies the requisite <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Courts in other jurisdictions have held that a police officer\u2019s express promise of confidentiality contradicts the <em>Miranda </em>warning that \u201canything [a suspect] says can be used against [the suspect] in a court of law,\u201d 384 U.S. at 479, 86 S.Ct. 1602, and, therefore, it nullifies the warning. In <em>Spence v. State, </em>281 Ga. 697, 642 S.E.2d 856, 857 (2007), the defendant waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and was interrogated about a murder. After the defendant \u201cbroke down in tears,\u201d the officer said \u201cjust you and me,\u201d and told the defendant \u201c[t]his is confidential what we\u2019re doing right here. Do you understand that? This is confidential.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>The suspect subsequently gave a statement implicating himself in the murder. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court of Georgia held that the statement was inadmissible. <em>Id. </em>at 858. The court relied on the rationale of <em>Hopkins v. Cockrell, </em>325 F.3d 579, 585 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 968, 124 S.Ct. 430, 157 L.Ed.2d 314 (2003), in which the Fifth Circuit held that the police cannot make statements inconsistent with the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and then use the confession against the defendant. <em>Spence, </em>642 S.E.2d at 858.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>In <em>Hopkins, </em>the investigating officer told the defendant that \u201ctheir conversation was confidential,\u201d stating \u201c[t]his is for me and you. This is for me. Okay. This ain\u2019t for nobody else.\u201d 325 F.3d at 584. The Fifth Circuit held that these statements \u201cpassed the line into the sort of lying that deprives a defendant \u2018of the knowledge essential to his ability to understand the nature of his rights and the consequences of abandoning them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Moran, </em>475 U.S. at 424, 106 S.Ct. 1135.).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Similarly, in <em>Pillar, </em>820 A.2d at 8, following administration of <em>Miranda </em>warnings, the defendant asked to \u201csay something \u2018off-the-record.\u2019 \u201d The police agreed to listen to an \u201coff-the-record\u201d statement, and the defendant made an incriminating admission. <em>Id. </em>In concluding that the statement should have been suppressed, the Superior Court of New Jersey reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APb\">A police officer cannot directly contradict, out of one side of his mouth, the <em>Miranda </em>warnings just given out of the other. An acquiescence to hear an \u201coff-the-record\u201d statement from a suspect, which the officer ought to know cannot be \u201coff-the-record,\u201d totally undermines and eviscerates the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, at least with respect to a statement made, as here, in immediate and direct response to the misleading assurance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">We agree that an express promise of confidentiality is inconsistent with the <em>Miranda </em>warning that \u201canything [a suspect] says can be used against [the suspect] in a court of law.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 479, 86 S.Ct. 1602. When a police officer makes such a promise of confidentiality, it can nullify the <em>Miranda </em>warning. If the totality of the circumstances shows that the suspect was led to believe that his or her statement would not go beyond the interrogation room, a subsequent statement is not given in compliance with the requirements of <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">Turning to the facts of the present case, we must determine, under the totality of the circumstances, whether Detective Schrott\u2019s statement amounted to a promise of confidentiality. A promise is \u201c[t]he manifestation of an intention to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>act or refrain from acting in a specified manner, conveyed in such a way that another is justified in understanding that a commitment has been made; a person\u2019s assurance that the person will or will not do something.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1249 (8th ed. 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Here, unlike the cases cited, <em>supra, </em>there was no express promise that the defendant\u2019s statements would remain confidential or that the statements were \u201coff-the-record.\u201d Detective Schrott merely responded to appellant\u2019s query regarding whether the interrogation was being recorded by stating: \u201cThis is between you and me, bud. Only me and you are here, all right? All right?\u201d As the State notes, this statement did not reflect any agreement of confidentiality. Rather, it was an equivocal response that was designed, not to establish a confidential relationship, but to deflect appellant\u2019s suggestion that he was aware that the interrogation was being recorded. We view Detective Schrott\u2019s response as sidestepping appellant\u2019s question regarding whether the interrogation was being recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Even if the response is viewed as an affirmative misstatement that the interrogation was not being recorded, however, such a response would not violate <em>Miranda. </em>\u201cThere is no requirement that a defendant who has properly been given <em>Miranda </em>warnings must also be told he ... may be tape-recorded or video-recorded or both.\u201d <em>State v. Vandever, </em>314 N.J.Super. 124, 714 A.2d 326, 328 (App.Div.1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>178 N.J. 32, 834 A.2d 405 (2003). Police deception regarding whether an interrogation is being recorded, does not contradict the <em>Miranda </em>warning that anything the suspect says can be used against the suspect. A police officer\u2019s false statement that an interrogation is not being recorded, when in fact it is being recorded, does not render a confession inadmissible. <em>State v. Wilson, </em>755 S.W.2d 707 (Mo.Ct.App.1988).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>Perhaps recognizing that deception regarding whether an interrogation is being recorded does not violate <em>Miranda, </em>appellant\u2019s argument is couched solely on the assertion that Detective Schrott\u2019s statement was a promise of confidentiality. As indicated, however, unlike the cases cited, <em>supra, </em>the detective did not make an express promise of confidentiality, and he did not contradict the <em>Miranda </em>warnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">Appellant cites to one case that merits further discussion. <em>State v. Stanga, </em>617 N.W.2d at 486, involved statements similar to the statement in this case. The facts in that case, however, were materially different.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">In <em>Stanga, </em>the police arrested Stanga and advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>Id. </em>at 487-88. Based on Stanga\u2019s \u201cslurred speech\u201d and the smell of alcohol on his breath, the police concluded that Stanga was \u201cunder the influence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 488. The court summarized the interrogation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-6\">[Detective] Lubbers said numerous times that he was there to listen, making comments such as \u201cit\u2019s between you and me,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m here to listen to your side,\u201d and \u201cyou need to get this off your chest,\u201d all as part of his interrogation technique. Stanga said repeatedly that he went to the house to \u201ctalk\u201d to Judy, but he also admitted hitting her, and then divulged having in mind a plan to kill her. Throughout the interview, he sought assurances on whether he could trust the detective-whether he could speak \u201cstraight up.\u201d When Stanga seemed to forget who he was talking to, Lubbers reminded him, \u201cWell, T am the cop.\u201d At one point, Stanga told the detective, \u201cI know you\u2019re here to get something against me.\u201d But Lubbers responded, \u201cNo, I\u2019m here for you and I to talk.\u201d After hearing this, Stanga said, \u201cOkay. I\u2019m going to tell you straight up, and if it goes any further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>than me and you, then I won\u2019t tell. I don\u2019t know.\u201d Lubbers responded, \u201cYou can trust me straight up. Go ahead.\u201d Still needing more assurance, Stanga asked, \u201cWhat I say to you, suppose it goes to everybody?\u201d As the videotape ran and as other officers watched unseen, Lubbers replied, \u201cBetween you and me. There\u2019s nobody else in the room here. It\u2019s between you and me.\u201d Stanga confided again that he was thinking about killing Judy when he broke into her home. Later, seeming to understand that his statement could be used against him, Stanga said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you the truth and you tell the judge.\u201d Yet at the end of the interview, Stanga repeated his earlier overture, \u201cDon\u2019t tell anybody either.\u201d Lubbers responded, \u201cNo, I ain\u2019t telling anybody anything'....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The Supreme Court of South Dakota held that some of the police officer\u2019s assurances \u201cclearly crossed the line\u201d and \u201cnullified\u201d the earlier <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>Id. </em>at 490. The court stressed that the officer \u201crepeatedly contradict[ed] the admonition that anything Stanga said could be used against him,\u201d noting that the officer \u201ctold Stanga twelve times that what was said during the interrogation was between the two of them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 490 (emphasis added). The court stated that the <em>Miranda </em>warnings \u201cwould be senseless if interrogating officers can deceive suspects into believing their admissions will not go beyond the interrogation room.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">The facts in <em>Stanga </em>are materially different from the facts here. In <em>Stanga, </em>the suspect was intoxicated, the officer stated 12 times that any statements made were between the two of them, and the defendant sought assurances from the detective that his statements would remain confidential. <em>Id. </em>at 488, 490. It was in this context that the court held that the officer \u201ccrossed the line\u201d and \u201cnullified\u201d the earlier <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>Id. </em>at 490-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">Here, by contrast, Detective Schrott did not deceive appellant into believing that his admissions would \u201cnot go beyond the interrogation room.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 491. Detective Schrott made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>one statement that the conversation was between the two of them. The statement was not made in response to a request for confidentiality, but rather, it was in response to a question whether the interrogation was being recorded. In context, the statement was not a promise of confidentiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">Moreover, a review of the entire interrogation makes clear that neither appellant nor Detective Schrott believed that the statements appellant made were confidential. Detective Schrott, in suggesting why appellant would want to give a statement, appealed to appellant\u2019s concern about how others might view the murder, stating \u201cyou don\u2019t want to be seen as coldblooded\u201d and \u201c[fit\u2019s for [the victim\u2019s] family to know [what happened] too.\u201d Detective Schrott subsequently advised appellant that he would speak to the prosecutor and inform the prosecutor that appellant was cooperative and that he \u201cgave [the police] the straight story.\u201d Although the Detective\u2019s second statement occurred after appellant gave his confession, it supports our finding that, unlike the cases to which appellant cites, neither appellant nor the detective believed that the statements made during the interrogation would remain confidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">We note that officers should use caution in making statements such as those made here because they subsequently could be construed as vitiating the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Here, however, in the context in which the words were spoken, the officer did not cross the line. Unlike the above cases, the officer did not promise confidentiality or suggest that appellant\u2019s statements would not go beyond the interrogation room. We find no <em>Miranda </em>violation in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">Voluntariness of the Confession</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">Appellant next argues that Detective Schrott\u2019s statement, that \u201c[t]his is between you and me, bud,\u201d rendered his subsequent confession involuntary. In Maryland, a confession is not admissible if it was not made freely and voluntarily. <em>Tolbert, </em>381 Md. at 558, 850 A.2d 1192.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>Appellant\u2019s argument that his confession was not voluntary-rests solely on his assertion that Detective Schrott\u2019s statement constituted a promise of confidentiality. In support of his argument, he cites cases from other jurisdictions, which hold that a promise of confidentiality renders a subsequent statement involuntary. <em>See Jones v. State, </em>65 P.3d 903, 905 (Alaska Ct.App.2003) (law enforcement advised that a suspect\u2019s statement was \u201c[o]ff the record\u201d); <em>State v. McDermott, </em>131 N.H. 495, 554 A.2d 1302, 1304 (1989) (federal agent promised that statement \u201cwould not leave the office\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">For the reasons discussed, <em>supra, </em>we have found that there was no promise of confidentiality in this case. The cases cited by appellant, therefore., are inapposite, and appellant\u2019s argument is unavailing. The circuit court properly denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress his statement to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Failure to Instruct Jury</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Appellant\u2019s second contention of error is that the circuit court deprived him \u201cof a fundamentally fair trial\u201d when it instructed the jury on first-degree felony murder, but it refused to give his requested jury instruction on second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter. In his initial brief, appellant supports his argument by quoting extensively from <em>Hook v. State, </em>315 Md. 25, 553 A.2d 233 (1989), which addressed the refusal of a court to give a lesser included offense instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">The State counters that the circuit court properly declined appellant\u2019s request for two reasons: (1) second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter are not lesser included offenses of felony murder; and (2) no rational jury could have found appellant guilty of second-degree murder or involuntary manslaughter without also finding him guilty of felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">In <em>Hook, </em>the Court of Appeals discussed a defendant\u2019s right to have the jury instructed regarding a lesser included offense. In that case, similar to this case, the State charged the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>defendant with murder pursuant to the shortened statutory form indictment. <em>Id. </em>at 32, 553 A.2d 233.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Pursuant to this form of indictment, even though the language used refers to first-degree murder, a defendant may be convicted of first-degree murder, second-degree murder, or manslaughter. <em>Id. </em>at 32 n. 11, 553 A.2d 233. A conviction of murder in the first-degree may be on the basis of premeditated murder or felony murder. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">In <em>Hook, </em>at trial, the State entered a nol pros, over defense counsel\u2019s objection, to the second-degree murder charge. <em>Id. </em>at 35, 553 A.2d 233. Defense counsel requested permission to argue second-degree murder to the jury, but \u201c[t]he court refused to instruct the jury as to second degree murder and refused to permit defense counsel to argue to the jury the issue of second degree murder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37, 553 A.2d 233. The jury convicted the defendant of murder in the first-degree based on both premeditated murder and felony murder. <em>Id. </em>at 38, 553 A.2d 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The Court of Appeals reversed Hook\u2019s conviction. Although recognizing the broad discretion of a prosecutor regarding whether to nol pros a count, \u201cor even part of a count,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 35, 553 A.2d 233, the Court noted that the prosecutor\u2019s discretion \u201cmay be fettered in the proper circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 37, 553 A.2d 233. The Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-7\">When the defendant is plainly guilty of some offense, and the evidence is legally sufficient for the trier of fact to convict him of either the greater offense or a lesser included offense, it is fundamentally unfair under Maryland common law for the State, over the defendant\u2019s objection, to <em>nol pros </em>the lesser included offense.... In short, it is simply offensive to fundamental fairness, in such circumstances, to deprive the trier of fact, over the defendant\u2019s objection, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>the third option of convicting the defendant of a lesser included offense. And if the trial is before a jury, the defendant is entitled, if he so desires, to have the jury instructed as to the lesser included offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 43-44, 553 A.2d 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Although appellant\u2019s initial brief relied heavily on the <em>Hook </em>analysis that a defendant is entitled to have lesser included offenses submitted to the jury, in appellant\u2019s reply brief and during oral argument, counsel for appellant stated that she was not arguing that second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter were lesser included offenses. Rather, she argued that, because the State charged appellant in Count I under the \u201cshort-form\u201d indictment, second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter were charged offenses on which appellant was entitled to an instruction.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">This argument misconstrues the scope of the <em>Hook </em>decision. In <em>Hook, </em>the Court of Appeals made clear that, if the State properly enters a nolle prosequi with respect to some of the charges included in a short form indictment, those offenses are no longer in the case. 315 Md. at 41, 553 A.2d 233 (court\u2019s refusal to give the requested instruction on second-degree murder stemmed from State\u2019s nol pros of second-degree murder, leaving no charge of second-degree murder on which the jury could convict).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">Here, the prosecutor nol prossed the charges of second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter. When appellant moved for judgment of acquittal at the close of the State\u2019s case on the charge of first-degree premeditated murder, the court noted that the verdict sheet submitted by the prosecutor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>\u201csays only felony murder of Eric Fountain.\u201d The following exchange then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-5\">[PROSECUTOR]: That is the instruction we have submitted. We are not arguing premeditated [murder] of Eric Fountain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-6\">[THE COURT]: So it only says felony murder. That\u2019s all that\u2019s being submitted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-8\">[THE COURT]: Which is first-degree murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, ma\u2019am. I just wanted to make sure that we\u2019re not talking about any others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-10\">Other than that, I would just suggest the State has failed to prove a prima facie case as to the charge of felony murder, and not ask to be heard any further.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-11\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-12\">By submitting only the charge of first-degree felony murder to the jury, the prosecutor effectively nol prossed the charges of first-degree premeditated murder, second-degree murder, and manslaughter. <em>See Jackson v. State, </em>322 Md. 117, 123, 124 n. 3, 586 A.2d 6 (1991) (prosecutor\u2019s submission of only three counts to the jury constituted a nol pros of the other two counts, regardless of how the prosecutor characterized her actions); <em>Dean v. State, </em>325 Md. 230, 234, 600 A.2d 409 (1992) (a nolle prosequi \u201c \u2018need not be couched in any particular language or take any specific form; it is the substance of the prosecution\u2019s action which controls\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Hooper v. State, </em>293 Md. 162, 168, 443 A.2d 86 (1982)). In light of the nol pros, to which there was no objection, second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter were not before the jury. Accordingly, the court was not required to instruct the jury on those offenses under Maryland Rule 4-325(c).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See Dean, </em>325 Md. at 240, 600 A.2d 409 (trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to instruct on a charge of assault with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>intent to disfigure because State nol prossed charge and it \u201cwas not before the court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The issue in <em>Hook </em>was whether the court should have allowed the prosecutor, over objection, to nol pros the charge of second-degree murder. The question was whether it violated fundamental fairness to nol pros second-degree murder, which was a lesser included offense of the charge submitted to the jury, first-degree premeditated murder. 315 Md. at 41, 553 A.2d 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">Here, unlike in <em>Hook, </em>the prosecutor nol prossed the charge of first-degree premeditated murder, in addition to the charges of second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter. The only charge submitted to the jury in Count I was first-degree felony murder. Thus, pursuant to <em>Hook, </em>fundamental fairness required instructions on second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter only if they are lesser included offenses of first-degree felony murder. This Court has consistently rejected such an assertion. <em>See Malik v. State, </em>152 Md.App. 305, 331, 831 A.2d 1101 (2003). (\u201c[Sjecond degree murder is not a lesser included offense of first degree felony murder.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>378 Md. 618, 837 A.2d 929 (2003); <em>Sutton v. State, </em>139 Md.App. 412, 458, 776 A.2d 47 (\u201cIt is clear that neither second degree murder nor manslaughter is a lesser included offense of felony murder.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>366 Md. 249, 783 A.2d 223 (2001); <em>West v. State, </em>124 Md.App. 147, 161, 720 A.2d 1253 (1998) (\u201c[T]he jury was not required to be instructed on second-degree murder because it is not a lesser included offense of first-degree felony murder .... \u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>353 Md. 270, 725 A.2d 1068 (1999). <em>Accord </em>Judge Charles E. Moylan, Jr., Criminal Homicide Law \u00a7 5.2, at 115 (2002) (\u201cThe law is clear that where one of the statutorily designed felonies (or their attempts) spelled out in [the first-degree felony murder statute] is involved, the verdict must be first-degree murder or nothing. There is no lesser included second-degree form or manslaughter form of the crime involved and no instruction on such lesser offenses should be given.\u201d) (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Because the State nol prossed the charges of second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter, and because they are not lesser included offenses of first-degree felony murder, appellant was not entitled to an instruction on these offenses. The trial court properly denied appellant\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Supplemental Jury Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">During its deliberations, the jury submitted a note with the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-8\">1. In the case of felony murder anyone present is as guilty as the person who personally commits the murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-10\">2. In the case of felony robbery does the same hold true?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AM3\">Both the prosecutor and defense counsel initially agreed with the court\u2019s suggestion to answer the question by referring the jury to the previous jury instructions given.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Defense counsel, however, subsequently expressed concern that the first sentence in the jury note was not accurate. After hearing argument from both the State and defense counsel regarding the proper response, the court responded to the jury\u2019s question as it initially suggested: \u201cThe answer to this question is contained in the Jury Instructions provided to you.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">Appellant contends that the circuit court erred in its response to the jury\u2019s question. He argues that the jury note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>\u201cevinced the jury\u2019s misunderstanding of the law,\u201d and the court \u201cfailed in its duty\u201d to clarify the confusion and \u201cgive the jury the required guidance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The State argues that the court properly exercised its discretion in responding to the jury note. It argues that it is not clear \u201cwhether the jury\u2019s language was the result of actual confusion or a simple error in paraphrasing,\u201d or, if there was confusion, \u201cthe extent or source of that confusion.\u201d The State argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-6\">Rather than craft a response that speculated as to the source and extent of confusion\u2014confusion that may or may not have existed\u2014the trial judge instead opted to instruct the jury to review the previously provided jury instructions. Because such language was clearly designed to avoid any further confusion that may have resulted from a response based in speculation, the trial judge did not abuse her discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">Moreover, the State asserts that \u201cit is clear that the language in the instructions previously provided [to the jury] adequately addressed any possible questions that were evidenced by the jury\u2019s note,\u201d and, therefore, \u201cthe trial judge\u2019s admonishment to the jury to review the instructions already provided was within her proper discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">Maryland Rule 4-325(a) provides that \u201c[t]he court shall give instructions to the jury at the conclusion of all the evidence and before closing arguments and may supplement them at a later time when appropriate.\u201d \u201cTrial courts have discretion in deciding whether to give a jury supplemental instructions in a criminal cause.\u201d <em>Cruz v. State, </em>407 Md. 202, 210, 963 A.2d 1184 (2009). The court\u2019s decision to give supplemental instructions \u201cwill not be disturbed on appeal, absent a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Roary v. State, </em>385 Md. 217, 237, 867 A.2d 1095 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">There is no dispute in this case that the court properly exercised its discretion in giving a supplemental jury instruction. The question here involves the propriety of the court\u2019s response to the jury\u2019s question.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>The Court of Appeals has made clear that, when a jury asks a question that reflects confusion on an issue, the trial judge \u201cmust respond\u201d to the question \u201cin a way that clarifies the confusion\u201d if \u201cthe question involves an issue central to the case.\u201d <em>State v. Baby, </em>404 Md. 220, 263, 946 A.2d 463 (2008) (citing <em>Lovell v. State, </em>347 Md. 623, 658-59, 702 A.2d 261 (1997)). In <em>Baby, </em>the defendant was charged with first-degree rape. <em>Id. </em>at 223, 946 A.2d 463. The trial judge instructed the jury on the elements of the offense, including that \u201c[rjape is unlawful vaginal intercourse with a female by force or threat of force and without her consent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 262, 946 A.2d 463. During deliberations, the jury sent a note asking: \u201cIf a female consents to sex initially and, during the course of the sex act to which she consented, for whatever reason, she changes her mind and the man continues until climax, does the result constitute rape?\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court responded that it was \u201cunable to answer this question as posed. Please reread the instructions as to each element and apply the law to the facts as you find them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The next day, the jury sent another note, asking: \u201cIf at any time the woman says stop is that rape?\u201d <em>Id. </em>The judge again referred the jury to its instruction giving \u201cthe legal definition of rape which includes the definition of consent.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">The Court of Appeals held that the judge\u2019s response, referring the jury to the previous instruction on the elements of rape, was not sufficient to address either of the jury\u2019s questions. <em>Id. </em>at 263-64, 946 A.2d 463. The Court did not hold that it was never sufficient to answer a jury\u2019s question by referring to the prior instructions. Rather, the Court held that the response was not sufficient in that case because the initial instructions given did not answer the jury\u2019s question: \u201c[T]he definition makes no reference to the issue of post-penetration withdrawal of consent which was central to the jury\u2019s questions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 263-64, 946 A.2d 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Here, in contrast to <em>Baby, </em>the court\u2019s response to the jury, that the answer to the jury\u2019s question was contained in the jury instructions already provided, did address the jury\u2019s question. The instructions previously given, and which had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>been provided to the jury in writing, made clear that an individual\u2019s mere presence while a crime is committed is insufficient to support a conviction for felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">The instruction regarding the significance of appellant\u2019s presence at the crime scene was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-5\">A person\u2019s presence at the scene of a crime, without more, is not enough to prove that the person committed a crime. The fact that a person witnessed a crime, made no objection or did not notify the police does not make that person guilty of a crime. However, a person\u2019s presence at the time and place of the crime is a fact in determining whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">With respect to the felony murder count, the court instructed the jury that, in order to convict the appellant of felony murder, the State must prove that appellant participated in the underlying robbery or burglary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-8\">To convict the defendant of first-degree felony murder, the State must prove that the defendant or another participating in the crime with the defendant committed a robbery and/or first-degree burglary, that the defendant killed Eric Fountain, and that the act resulting in the death of Eric Fountain occurred during the commission of the robbery and/or first-degree burglary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">With respect to aiding and abetting, the court instructed the jury that aiding and abetting required the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-10\">A person who aids and abets in the commission of a crime is as guilty as the actual perpetrator even though he did not personally commit each of the acts that constitutes the crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-11\">A person who aids and abets in the commission of a crime by knowingly associating with the criminal venture with the intent to help commit the crime, being present when the crime is committed, and seeking by some act to make the crime succeed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>In order to prove that the defendant aided and abetted the commission of a crime, the State must prove that the defendant was present when the crime was committed and that the defendant willfully participated with the intent to make the crime succeed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Thus, to the extent that the jury was confused about the requirements for a conviction, the court\u2019s response that the jury should refer to the court\u2019s earlier instructions was a proper response, and it was sufficient to address the jury\u2019s question. The initial instructions clearly indicated that appellant\u2019s presence alone was insufficient to support a conviction. We find no error in the court\u2019s supplemental instruction to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">Motion for Joinder</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">Appellant\u2019s final contention is that the circuit court erred in granting the State\u2019s motion to join for trial the charges involving the solicitation of the murder of Chelene with the charges involving the Fountain residence. Appellant argues that \u201cthe lack of mutual admissibility required separate trials\u201d because evidence that appellant was detained in the Baltimore County Detention Center, where \u201che purportedly solicited another inmate to murder Chelene, was irrelevant to the murder case and highly prejudicial.\u201d He further contends that, even if evidence of the murder was admissible to show motive for the charge of solicitation of murder, admission of the details of the murder was \u201cextremely prejudicial\u201d with respect to the solicitation charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">The State counters that appellant is not entitled to a new trial on this ground for three reasons. First, it argues, appellant failed to preserve this issue for appellate review. Second, even if preserved, the State argues that the circuit court properly joined the two cases for trial because the evidence was mutually admissible. Third, the State disputes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>appellant\u2019s claim that evidence relating to each offense was highly prejudicial to trial on the other offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Initially, we conclude that appellant failed to preserve this issue for our review. Appellant did not make the same argument below that he raises on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">In arguing against joinder in the circuit court, appellant began by suggesting that the court defer ruling on the motion to join offenses until the State decided whether it was going to call Chelene as a witness: \u201cAgain, in light of the question whether Ms. Smith is even going to testify, I would suggest that that may be premature until that decision is made.\u201d The court rejected that suggestion. The following then occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Then I would suggest to the Court it would be inappropriate to join them because I\u2019m concerned abo\u00fct testimony coming in that would be admissible in the one case but would only be admissible in that one. If they are joined I have to deal with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-8\">But, um, if she is unavailable I\u2019m not sure what effect that is going to have on the State\u2019s ability to even proceed on the matter, and yet the testimony might already been in. So I\u2019m just concerned about that confusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, it\u2019s the State\u2019s position whether Ms. Smith were to testify or not, the defendant\u2019s actions in soliciting her murder, because she is [a] witness in [this] case, is evidence of guilt. Whether she actually appears to testify or not, that doesn\u2019t\u2014that doesn\u2019t matter in the terms of whether the cases should be joined. It is still, the one case is solicitation, it is evidence of the solicitation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-10\">The other is, it\u2019s the murder she is a potential witness and it\u2019s evidence of guilt in terms of trying to eliminate that witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Well, again, that makes certain assumptions that I would suggest the Court should not engage in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>For one thing, the assumption that is, let\u2019s assume he did solicit to have her come to some harm, that\u2019s an assumption, it is for that reason, not some other reason.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The prosecutor then proffered that the informant stated that appellant wanted Ms. Smith harmed \u201cbecause there were only two people who could have ratted him out, one is her.\u201d Defense counsel clarified that the informant was the other person, and he advised the court that he had no further argument on the State\u2019s motion to join the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Appellant\u2019s argument below was based on a concern that Chelene might give testimony that was not admissible in both trials.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> He did not argue, as he does on appeal, that \u201cthe lack of mutual admissibility required separate trials\u201d or that the evidence relating to each offense was \u201chighly prejudicial\u201d in a trial on the other offenses. Under these circumstances, appellant has failed to preserve this issue for appeal. <em>See Jeffries v. State, </em>113 Md.App. 322, 341, 688 A.2d 16 (\u201c \u2018[W]hen the grounds for an objection are stated by the objecting party, either on a volunteered basis or at the request of the court, only those specifically stated are preserved for appellate review; those not stated are deemed waived.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Banks v.

If it appears that any party will be prejudiced by the joinder for trial of counts, charging documents, or defendants, the court may, on its own initiative or on motion of any party, order separate trials of counts, charging documents, or defendants, or grant any other relief as justice requires.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Md. Rule 4\u2014253(b)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Joinder of offenses \u201chas been justified on the basis that \u2018a single trial effects an economy, by saving time and money, to the prosecution, the defendant, and the criminal justice system.\u2019\u201d <em>Conyers v.

If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>answer to both questions is yes, then joinder of offenses or defendants is appropriate. In order to resolve question number one, a court must apply the first step of the \u201cother crimes\u201d analysis announced in <em>[State v.] Faulkner[, </em>314 Md. 630, 552 A.2d 896 (1989) ]. If question number one is answered in the negative, then there is no need to address question number two....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-4\"><em>Conyers, </em>345 Md. at 553, 693 A.2d 781. <em>Accord Harper v. State, </em>162 Md.App. 55, 88, 873 A.2d 395 (2005). If, however, the answer to step one is yes, and the evidence is mutually admissible, \u201cthe trial judge has discretion to join or sever the charges, and that decision will be disturbed only if an abuse of discretion is apparent.\u201d <em>Carter v. State, </em>374 Md. 693, 705, 824 A.2d 123 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">With respect to the first step of the two-part test, the evidence here was mutually admissible. The Court of Appeals decision in <em>Conyers </em>is instructive in this regard. In <em>Conyers, </em>the appellant and Lawrence Bradshaw committed a burglary. 345 Md. at 534-35, 693 A.2d 781. After Conyers shot and killed Wanda Johnson, a resident of the house, Conyers became aware that Mr. Bradshaw had been identified as a participant in the crimes. <em>Id. </em>at 535-36, 693 A.2d 781. Conyers then shot and killed Mr. Bradshaw. <em>Id. </em>at 536, 693 A.2d 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Conyers argued that the trial court erred in joining for trial the charges regarding the murder of Ms. Johnson with the charges regarding the murder of Mr. Bradshaw. In rejecting that argument, the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-7\">The judge determined that evidence concerning the Johnson murder would be admissible in a trial on the Bradshaw murder because it would be relevant to show motive. The Bradshaw murder was, according to the State\u2019s theory, committed to conceal the Johnson murder. This Court has repeatedly stated that motive is one of the \u201cother purposes\u201d that will overcome the presumption of exclusion that pertains to \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>Evidence concerning' the Bradshaw murder, similarly, would be admissible in a trial on the Johnson murder. It would be relevant to show consciousness of guilt by showing that Appellant murdered the only witness to the Johnson killing. This Court has held that consciousness of guilt is an \u201cother purpose\u201d that will overcome the presumption of exclusion that is attached to \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence. Evidence of escape from confinement or of flight after a crime is the most common \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence that is offered to show consciousness of guilt. Other attempts to conceal involvement in criminal activity have also been held admissible to show a defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt, however. Mr. Bradshaw was present at the scene of Ms. Johnson\u2019s murder and potentially could identify Appellant as Ms. Johnson\u2019s murderer. Evidence that Appellant was also responsible for Mr. Bradshaw\u2019s murder would be admissible as evidence of Appellant\u2019s consciousness of guilt and as an expression of his attempt to conceal his involvement in the murder of Ms. Johnson.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 554-55, 693 A.2d 781 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">That same analysis applies here. As in <em>Conyers, </em>evidence of the murder of Mr. Fountain was admissible with respect to the solicitation charge because it was relevant to show motive. Similarly, evidence relating to the offense of soliciting the murder of Chelene, one of \u201ctwo people who could have ratted him out\u201d on the murder, was admissible to show consciousness of guilt. <em>See United States v. Van Metre, </em>150 F.3d 339, 352 (4th Cir.1998) (solicitation of inmate to murder witness who would testify in defendant\u2019s forthcoming kidnapping case was admissible to demonstrate consciousness of guilt); <em>Lovett v. State, </em>516 A.2d 455, 468 (Del.1986) (evidence of the defendant\u2019s plan to kill a prospective witness against him on murder charges was relevant to the defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt), <em>cert. denied, </em>481 U.S. 1018, 107 S.Ct. 1898, 95 L.Ed.2d 504 (1987). Thus, the evidence here was mutually admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">We turn next to the second step of the two-part test regarding joinder, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cdoes the interest in judicial econo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>my outweigh any other arguments favoring severance?\u201d <em>Conyers, </em>345 Md. at 553, 693 A.2d 781. This determination is within the discretion of the trial judge, and it will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Carter, </em>374 Md. at 705, 824 A.2d 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">Appellant contends that, even if evidence of the murder was admissible in a trial on the solicitation charge to show motive, the \u201cdetails of the murder\u201d would be \u201cextremely prejudicial in a separate trial for the solicitation charge.\u201d Similarly, appellant argues that evidence that he was detained at the Baltimore County Detention Center when he solicited another inmate to murder Chelene was \u201chighly prejudicial\u201d to the murder case. We are not persuaded that the evidence was unduly prejudicial. We find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s order granting the State\u2019s motion for joinder of offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.
