S. Grosscvp </em>for defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<footnote data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b210-5\"> The court, from the testimony in the case, finds the following facts, to wit:</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">That on the 21st day of March, a. d. 1887, the plaintiffs and the defendant entered into a contract in writing, as set forth in the foregoing bill of exceptions, by which the plaintiffs agreed to do all the clearing, grubbing and masonry necessary to complete the road-bed of the defendant from the bank of the Mississippi River to Galesburg, a distance of about fifty miles'; that on the 21st day of March, a. d. 1887, the plaintiffs entered into a contract with Jones, Forrest &amp; Bodkin, which is in terms as set forth in the foregoing bill off exceptions, and that the parties have stipulated in writing as set forth in the bill of exceptions, and that the defendant was at all times aware that the plaintiffs had made the said agreement with Jones, Forrest <em>&amp; </em>Bodkin and never objected thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">The court further finds that the work'covered by the contract was, for the purp.ose of construction, divided by the defendant into four divisions, and that the work of each division was. by the defendant put in charge of an assistant or division engineer, who was employed by the defendant and acted under the general direction of the chief engineer of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">The court further finds that the plaintiffs, through Jones, Forrest &amp; Bodkin and their sub-contractors, performed the said work according to the-terms of the said contract, and that the same has been accepted and taken possession of by the said defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">The court further finds that shortly after the entering into of said contract between Jones, Forrest \u2022&amp; Bodkin and the plaintiffs the said Jones, Forrest &amp; Bodkin sub-let all of the work on division 9 except a portion of section 119 (respecting which section there is no controversy between the parties in this suit), and that according to the said contract of sub-letting the said sub-contractors were to receive from Jones, Forrest &amp; Bodkin 90 per cent of what was coming to Jones, Forrest &amp; Bodkin according to .their contract with the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">The court further finds that the said sub-contractors performed their work under the charge of the division \u00e9ng-ineers; that upon the first of each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>month each division engineer made up and forwarded to the assistant chief engineer a paper showing his estimate of the work done on. each section of his division, both according to its quantities and classifications, upon which were computed and extended in the office of the said assistant chief enaithe said contract', to the beg headed \u201c monthly estimate\u201d and bore the attestation of the division engineers, and were approved by the assistant chief engineer and chief engineer; that said certificates were all in form identical with the one sot forth in the preceding bill of exceptions; that from month to month tissue copies of said certificates were delivered to the plaintiffs and payment made for the amount thereby shown to be comiug to them, less 10 per cent reserved under the contract and less previous payments made; that each month the defendant sent to the division engineers in the field tissue copies of said certificates; that the plaintiffs sent their said tissue copies of said certificates to Jones, Forrest &amp; Bodkin, together with their check for the amount coming due to them under the contract; that thereupon Jones, Forrest &amp;\u25a0 BodMn from time to time paid to their sub-contractors the amounts coming due to them according to the quantities and classifications of said certificates, and that the defendant had knowledge that the plaintiffs were paying Jones, Forrest &amp; Bodkin, and that said Jones, Forrest &amp; Bodkin were from time to time paying to their sub-contractors in accordance with said certificates. neer the aggregate amounts</p>\n<p id=\"APr\">The court finds that Dressier, the division engineer of division 9, sent in his last month\u2019s paper on November 1st, and that his successor, Baker, sent in a monthly paper on division 9 on December 1, which was the last month\u2019s paper on that division and which paper adopted Dressler\u2019s figures as shown in his last monthly paper and added something thereto for work done subsequently.</p>\n<p id=\"A12\">The court further finds-that the work under said contract was substantially completed, with the exception of a small amount of grading, before the last of said monthly papers was so made up and sent to the plaintiffs, and that, said plaintiffs paid what was coming to Jones, F.orrest &amp; Bodkin according-td^the showing of said last monthly certificate, and Jones,'Forrest &amp; Bodkin, in reliance, upon the correctness of said certificate, paid to their sub-contractors on division 9 (that being the only division here in dispute) what was coming to them in accordance with the showing of said last monthly certificate, except in the case of one of their sub-bontractors who was paid $889.00 less and another sub-contractor who was paid abo.ut $500.00 less than said certificate shows to have been coming, a portion of which was for work on division 9 and a portion for work on division 10, respecting which division 10 there is no dispute, but there is no evidence showing-what exact portion o\u00bf said $880.00 and- $500.00 belonged to division <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>9, and what portion to division 10; that such payments by Jones, Forrest &amp; Bodkin to their sub-contractors were made at various times down to January 12, 1888, but were all made before Jones, Forrest <em>&amp; </em>Bodkin had any knowledge of Baker\u2019s remeasurements, hereinafter mentioned, or of any claim on the part of the defendant that Dressler\u2019s estimates were erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"AME\">The court further finds that some time after the last of these monthly certificates was delivered to the plaintiffs one George T. Baker, who had had charge of division 7, made certain remeasurements and reclassifications of the work done in divisions 8 and 9; that the work on these two divisions prior to November 26th had not been done under the supervision of said Baker, but was done under the supervision of one F. F. Ames and R. Dressier respectively, and that said Baker embodied the results of his remeasurements and reclassifications in the estimate called the final estimate; which said estimate was approved by the assistant'enginoer-in-chief and the engineer-in-chief, and delivered to the plaintiffs in March, 1888.</p>\n<p id=\"ADCC\">The court further finds that the said reestimate and reclassification so made largely changed the quantities aud classifications of the work done on division 9 from the showing of quantities and classifications of said division made in the several monthly certificates, including the one made after the substantial completion of the work as aforesaid; that said reclassification and remeasurement of said Baker were made without the cooperation or knowledge of the plaintiffs or their sub-contractoi-s, and that the plaintiffs had paid to Jones, Forrest &amp;-Bodkin, and Jones, Forrest &amp; Bodkin had made payments to their sub-contractors under their said contracts, as above set forth, and according to the quantities and classifications shown by the monthly certificates before either of them had knowledge of said Baker\u2019s remeasurements and reclassifications.</p>\n<p id=\"Ast\">The court further finds that the said last monthly certificate of the work on division 9 could, with reasonable care upon the part of the division engineer, have been made nearly accurate, and that upon the assumption of the correctness of said Baker\u2019s so-called final estimate the discrepancy between it and the said certificate could be the result only of negligence or incompetency upon the part of the division engineer in charge of said division unless the said division engineer was purposely dishonest; but the court finds thatithere was no proof of dishonesty in which the plaintiffs or their sub-contractors took any part or of which they had any knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"Au8\">The court further finds that the effect of the said monthly certificates of quantities and classifications of work done on division 9 was to cause the plaintiffs to pay to Jones, Forrest &amp; Bodkin more on account of each of said certificates than they would have paid if said certificates had been made according to the remeasurement and reclassification of said Baker, and Jones, Forrest &amp; Bodkin in turn to pay more to their sub-contractors than they would have paid if the said monthly certificates had been made accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>ing to Baker\u2019s remeasurement and reclassification; so that if the plaintiffs are to be \u00bf\u00bfaid for the entire work according to the revision made by Baker they will be the losers to the extent of the errors said to have been corrected on division 9.</p>\n<p id=\"AW5\">The court further finds that according to the said estimate of Bakel', upon the divisions other than division 9, there is a balance due to the plaintiffs from the defendant of $17,351.68, and that-on the basis of the last monthly certificate of Dressier on division 9, viz., the certificate of November 1st, as above set forth, there is a balance due on that division of $11,586.48, in which amount is included so much of the sums of $880.00 and $500.00 as is applicable to-division 9, as above referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"AWI\">The court therefore finds in favor of the plaintiffs for the amount of $28,938.16.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b216-8\">Mr. Justice Harlan,</author>\n<p id=\"AFE\">after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">The written contract between the parties in this case does not materially differ from the one before this court in <em>Martinsburg </em>&amp; <em>Potomac Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>March, </em>114 U. S. 549, 553. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>In that case the contractor did not allege in his declaration that the engineer ever certified in writing the complete performance of the contract, together with an estimate of the work done and the amount of compensation due him according to the prices established by the parties; which certificate and estimate was made by the agreement a condition of the liability of the company to pay the contractor the balance, if any, due him. Nor did the declaration allege any facts which, in the absence of such a certificate by the engineer whose determination was made final and conclusive,- entitled the contractor to sue the company on the contract. It was held, in accordance with the principles announced in <em>Kihlberg </em>v. <em>United States, </em>97 U. S. 398, and <em>Sweeney </em>v. <em>United States, </em>109 U. S. 618, that the declaration was fatally defective in that it contained \u201c no averment that the engineer had been guilty of fraud, or had made such gross mistake in his estimates as necessarily implied bad faith, or had failed to exercise an honest judgment in discharging the duty imposed upon him.\u201d Some observations in that case are pertinent in the present one. It was said-: \u201cWe are to presume from the terms of the contract that both parties considered the possibility of disputes arising between them in reference to the execution of the contract. And it is to be -presumed that in their minds was the possibility that the engineer might err in his determination of such matters. Consequently, to the end that the interests of neither party should be put in peril by disputes as to any of the matters covered by their agreement, or in reference to the quantity of the work to be done under it, or the compensation which the plaintiff might be entitled to demand, it was expressly stipulated that the engineer\u2019s determination should be final and conclusive. Neither party reserved the right to revise that determination for mere errors or mistakes upon his part. They chose to risk his estimates, and to rely upon their, right, Tthich the law presumes they did not intend to waive, to demand that the engineer should, at all times, and in respect to every matter submitted to his determination, exercise an honest judgment, and commit no such mistakes as, under all the circumstances, would imply bad faith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>The only difference between that case and the present one is that the alleged mistakes of the engineer in the former were favorable to the railroad company, while in this case they are favorable to the contractors. But that difference cannot affect the interpretation of the contract. In the present case the agreement was that the work should be executed under the direction and supervision of the chipf engineer of the railroad company and his assistants, by whose measurements and calculations the quantities and amounts of the several kinds of work should be determined, and \u201c whose determination shall be conclusive upon the- parties.\u201d Any decision of the chief engineer relating to the execution of the contract was to be \u201cbinding and final upo'n both parties.\u201d His measurements and calculations as to excavations were made \u201c final and conclusive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">\u2022 What are the substantial.facts found by the,'court below? The work was in four divisions, each division being in charge of an assistant or division .engineer, who acted under the general direction of the chief engineer. The agreement provided for monthly payments to the contractor, On the certificate of the engineer, \u201c for work done; \u201d ten per cent from the value thereof to be retained by the company until the whole work was completed in accordance with the contract. \u2022 The work was under the immediate supervision of the division engineer. On the first day of each month he made up and forwarded to the assistant chief .engineer an estimate of work done on each section of his division, according to quantities and classifications. Upon such estimates the assistant chief engineer ascertained the amount due the contractor to the beginning of the month. These monthly estimates were approved by both the assistant chief engineer and chief engineer. This course was \u25a0pursued until the work was substantially completed, and was accepted and taken possession of by the company. Subsequently, without the knowledge or cooperation of the contractors, Baker, a-subordinate engineer of the railroad company, who had not supervised the work of the plaintiffs, reestimated and reclassified it, and upon such reestimate and reclassification, which were approved by the chief engineer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>the company claimed that the monthly estimates upon which the plaintiffs had been paid from time to time were much too large.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-3\">We are of opinion that the ultimate facts, as' found by the court, do not authorize the railroad company to go behind the estimates from time to time by its division engineer, which were approved and certified by the assistant chief engineer and chief engineer. Within a reasonable interpretation of the contract, the last monthly estimate of work done on division nine, (that being the only division here :in dispute,) followed by the acceptance by the company of the whole work, was a certificate of complete performance entitling the plaintiff to be paid in full according to the terms of the contract. While there was evidence tending to show that the estimates by the division engineer, upon which the last monthly certificate was based, were not made up from actual measurements on the ground, but from reports by subcontractors, there was, also, evidence tending to show that the remeasurements and reclassifications which the company caused to be made after the completion and acceptance of the work, and which it calls the \u201c final estimate,\u201d were inaccurate. But there is no fact distinctly found indicating fraud upon the part of the company\u2019s engineers, or such gross mistakes by them as imply bad faith. It is found only that the monthly estimates might, with reasonable care, have been made nearly accurate, and that, <em>if </em>the ^measurements and reclassifications were correct, the discrepancy between them and the monthly estimates, upon which the plaintiffs were paid from time to time, could be explained only upon the ground of negligence, \u2019incompetency or dishonesty' upon the part of the division engineer. But the court did not find that the monthly estimates were inaccurate, or that the chief or division engineer was dishonest, or that the subsequent remeasurement and reclassification were \u2022correct. The mere incompetency or mere negligence of the division or chief engineer does not meet the requirements of the case, unless their mistakes were so gross as to imply bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">We are of opinion that the judgment is supported by the finding of facts, and' it is Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
