The court said: \u201c It will be observed that the land was entered by Egan after the passage of the act of Congress granting swamp lands to the State. But the entry was made nine days before the land was selected as swamp land; and in this connection it may be remarked, that the fact is well known to all who have given the subject any consideration, that after the passage of the swamp land act of 1850, the various land offices continued open, and lands were sold by the United States which were subsequently claimed by the States under the provisions of the swamp act. This condition of things, no doubt, led to some of the legislation by Congress and the State- of Illinois after the act-of 1850, which will be referred to hereafter.\u201d The court then considered the acts of Congress of September 28, 1850, March 2, 1855 and March 3, 1857, and the acts of the legislature of the State,-of January 22, 1852, and March 4, 1854, and thus continued :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b671-3\">\u201c It is thus manifest, from the legislation of Congress and the legislation of - the State, that it has always been the intention, both of the general government and of the State, to pro: tect the title of a purchaser of swamp lands. Congress, in making the grant to the State, had- the right to impose such terms and conditions as it saw proper, and the State, in granting the lands to the counties, had-the undoubted power to provide that purchasers who' had bought and paid for the lands should be protected in their several purchases, as, in effect, it did. The county of Cook derived its title to the land under and by virtue of the act of 1852, as amended in 1854, and if the acts do not pass the title to the land in question, it is plain that Cook County could not recover. The first section of the act of 1852 is general in terms, granting all swamp lands which had been granted to the State, to the respective counties ; but section two qualifies section one, and declares that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>whenever it shall appear that any of the lands granted to the State shall have been sold, it shall be lawful for the said counties to convey such lands to the purchasers thereof. This was followed by an amendment, passed in 1854, requiring the county courts, by an order to be entered, to make all necessary orders for securing to purchasers of swamp 'lands their titles to such lands.' Under this legislation it is manifest that the State of Illinois never intend\u00e9d to transfer to the counties lands that had been entered from the United States, but, on the other hand, the object was to\u2019 protect the title of all purchasers. The language, \u2018it shall be lawful for the said counties to convey,\u2019 did not leave a discretion resting with the county to hold the land or convey, as it might think proper; but a positive duty was imposed to transfer such title as it acquired, to the purchaser from the United States, and a county could acquire no rights to the lands by a refusal'to observe the requirements of the statute. Indeed, we think it a fair and reasonable construction of the acts of 1852 and 1854, when considered in connection with the acts of Congress, to hold that where lands have been bought, in good faith, from the United States, the title to such lands did not become vested in the county, but passed to the purchaser, under his entry.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-5\">\u201c The copy of the certificate of entry procured from the land office at .Washington, and read in evidence, contained a statement written acrossfits face, that the entry had been can-celled, and also another statement that it had been reinstated. The commissioner of the general land office had no authority to vacate the entry, and any order that he may have, made did not affect the rights of Egan. <em>Brill </em>v.

Gaillard, 127 U. S. 216; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Risk, </em>137 U. S. 300. Tested by this rule this writ of error, cannot be sustained. .</p>\n<p id=\"b675-3\">The Supreme Court of Illinois held that title passed to that State by the act of Congress, and that the plaintiff established a <em>prima facie </em>right to recover, but that as the State, in granting the lands to the counties, had the undoubted power to provide that purchasers who had bought and paid for the lands should be protected in their several purchases, and bad so provided by its act of 1852, and this land had been \u201c sold by the United States\u201d to Egan after September 28, 1850, within the meaning of that act, no title passed to the county. The judgment of the state court proceeded wholly upon the construction of the terms and conditions of the grant of the State to the county by the act of 1852, and as amended by the act of 1854, and the validity of those enactments was not drawn in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">Tile effect claimed by counsel as attributable to the act of Congress of 1850, as operating as a grant <em>in prmenti </em>to the State of Illinois, was given to it by the Supreme Court, and the confirmatory act of Congress of March 3, 1857, did not enter into the decision of the case, because under the conclu.sion reached there was no title in plaintiff to be confirmed. There was no decision against a claim or title asserted under the United States, but simply that the county did not obtain title under the grant of the State; that the act of 1852 imposed a positive duty on the cqunty to transfer such title as it \u00bfcquired to the purchaser from the United States; and that where lands had been bought in good faith from the United States, the title to such lands did not become vested in the county but passed to the purchaser. under his entry. This \u25a0construction by the state court of the laws of the State is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>controlling in the premises. <em>Gormley </em>v. Clark, 134 U. S. 338, 348, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">It is said- that as Cook County was under township organization law in 1852, and hence under the government of a board of supervisors and not of county courts, it had no special legislative authority to dispose of swamp lands until the passage of the act of March 4, 1854, (Sess. Laws, 1854, p. 184,) imparting that power, and that, therefore, the second section of the act of 1852 did not apply to that county. While this .point does not seem to have been presented to the state court, yet, if the | State did not intend to transfer title to the lands that had bben entered from the United States, as was held by the court, the mere want of power to convey, which was at -the next session of the general assembly supplied, would not require a different construction to the contrary of such intention. ...</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">As the acts of Congress referred to in the first and second errors.assigned did not purport to vest title to swamp lands in ' Cook or any other county, and the court only passed upon the alleged grant by the State, we are unable to perceive that any federal question was, in this regard, necessarily or in fact decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">It is further assigned for error that the Supreme Court sustained \u201c the trial court in the admission of improper testimony, to -wit, the register and receiver\u2019s certificate to the land in question, dated October 20, 1853, the same being illegal, and also because the same was cancelled August 10, 1855, the subsequent chain of defendant\u2019s title resting upon said can-celled certificate.\u201d And the argument is that the validity of an authority exercised under the United States, namely, the action of the Land Department, was drawn in question, and that the-decision was against its validity because against the validity of the alleged cancellation.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">The trial court was not -requested to hold the entry void because of cancellation, and we think the plaintiff\u2019s objection to the admission of the certificate in'evidence, and its request for a ruling that, the Egan entry tv-as. cancelled, and that such cancellation, \u201cin the absence of any facts or.evidence showing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>the circumstances which .led to its cancellation, must be presumed to have been based upon sufficient facts to authorize it,\u201d did not draw the validity of the authority of the department in question within \u00a7 709. Eev. Stat. upon which section our jurisdiction rests.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">The validity of a statute is not drawn in question-every time rights claimed under such statute are controverted, nor is the validity of an authority every time an act done by such authority is disputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">The validity of the authority here was'not primarily denied, and the denial7 made the subject of direct inquiry. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>137 U. S. 280; <em>Baltimore &amp; Potomac Railroad </em>v. Hopkins, 130 U. S. 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">The court may have concluded that the transaction as shown by the memoranda was a substitution by Egan, with the consent of the officers of, the Land Department, of warrant No. 101,043 for the original warrant No; 2495, which, for some erasure, was suspended ; and that the alleged cancellation was not a cancellation of the purchase and entry, but of the location under the suspended warrant, and that, although the official order of substitution was not made by the commissioner until 1883, yet it was manifest from the endorsements that it had been made, in fact, in 1855. ,At all events, it ruled that the entry by Egan, and the receipt and retention by the United States of the money and warrant delivered by him in payment therefor, was a sale by the United States of the land to Egan.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Certainly the plaintiff did not specially set up or claim any title by reason of the alleged cancellation,/and the court rendered no decision against a title so specially set up or claimed.\u2019 <em>Chappell </em>v. Bradshaw, 128 U. S. 132.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">In <em>Neilson </em>v. Lagow, 7 How. 772, 775, the plaintiff claimed land under an authority-exercised by the Secretary of the Treasury in behalf of the''United States, and the decision was against the validity of the authority thus exercised, and such was the case in <em>Lytle </em>v. Arkansas, 22 How. 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">The claim of title here was under the act of the legislature of Illinois, and the question arising on Egan\u2019s entry and pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>chase of the land was as to whether the land had been sold by the United States within the intent and meaning of the act of June 22, 1852.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">The Supreme Court did indeed say, in relation to this matter, that the commissioner had no authority to vacate the entry, and that any order that he might have made did not affect the rights of Egan, and cited to the proposition the case of <em>Brill </em>v. Stiles, 35 Illinois, 305, where it* was held \u201c that the mere fact that an entry has been declared void by the commissioner of the general land office does not have the effect of vacating the entry.\u201d In other words, the court was of opinion that the commissioner could not, without notice, and arbitrarily, deprive a person of land lawfully entered and paid for, as was ruled in' <em>Cornelius </em>v. <em>Kessel, </em>128 U. S. 456, 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">But the expression of this view in construing the language of the state statute was- not a decision against a title specially set up or claimed under an authority exercised under the United States, nor against the validity of such an authority.</p>\n<p id=\"AaT\">It is, however, earnestly urged that the Supreme Court erred \u201cin holding that, under the act of June'22, 1852, of said State, said land was conveyed to said Cook County, upon a condition, and not absolutely, the action of said court in holding that the act of March 4th, 1854, of said State, transferred said title of Cook County in said land to William B. Egan, and his assigns, impaired the obligation of the contract in said act of 1852, whereby said land was conveyed to said Cook County.\u201d This contention as we understand it, is; that although the county was merely \u25a0 a public corporation, and held the swamp lands for public purposes as an agency of the State, yet the act of 1852 was a contract between the State and the county; which the State could not by subsequent legislation change; and that the act of March 4,1854, impaired the obligation of the, grant to the plaintiff in the prior act. We cannot find that chis question was raised in the trial court or in the Supreme C\u00f3\u00fcrt, nor do we understand that the Supreme Court held, as asse ted, that the act of .1854 transferred the title of Cook Count \u2019 to Egan. ' It was the act of 1852 that the court proceeded f;pon, and the act of 1854, relating to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>manner in which the conditions imposed by the act of 1852' should be given effect, added nothing to those conditions, and was not treated by the court as controlling the question of title. And it would be sufficient to dispose of the contention that no such point was raised in the state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-3\">As to the admission ip evidence of the certificate to Bunn and the patent to Bowen, the trial court made no findings as to this entry, and the decision of the Supreme Court makes no reference to it; nor do the other assignments of error require any observations.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">These swamp lands were granted to the several States in which thejr were situated for the purpose, expressed on the face of the act, of enabling them to construct the necessary levees and drains to reclaim them; and the language of the proviso to the second section was <em>\u201c </em>that the proceeds of said. lands, whether from sale or by direct appropriation in kind, shall be applied,'exclusively, as far as. necessary, to the purpose of reclaiming said lands by means of the levees and drains aforesaid.\u201d <em>We </em>have repeatedly held that the State had full-power of disposition of the lands, and that the application of the proceeds to the purposes of the grant rested upon the good faith of the State, which might exercise its discretion as to their disposal. <em>Mills County </em>v. <em>Railroad Companies, </em>107 U. S. 557, 566; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>127 U. S. 182, 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">. The acts of the general assembly of the State of Illinois were in entire harmony with the acts of Congress, and the intention of the legislation was, as the Supreme Court of Illinois held, to protect the title of purchasers from the United States, after the passage of the act of September 28, 1850, which took effect as a grant <em>inprcesenti, </em>while it was sought' \"by the Illinois acts to secure to the counties the right to receive .the consideration for the lands, as well as to the purchasers the title of the State.-</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\"><em>We </em>have carefully considered the record in the light of the elaborate arguments of counsel for plaintiff in error, but are constrained to hold that we have no jurisdiction to review the judgment of the state court, and the writ \u00f3f error will, therefore, be</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
