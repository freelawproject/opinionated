This court has'no power, in any case, to issue a writ of prohibition to that court, because it is not a District Court of the United States within section 688, Devised Statutes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-10\">II. The question of jurisdiction of the Alaska court, which petitioners seek to present, cannot be raised on the record of the admiralty proceedings on file in this court, because <em>(a) </em>The face of those proceedings shows jurisdiction in the Alaska court, and after sentence, in such a case, prohibition will not issue, <em>(h) </em>Even if the evidence on appeal may be here examined, it shows the taking of seals within three miles of the Alaskan islands, which is confessedly within the jurisdiction of that court, and thfe seizure did not oust the jurisdiction to condemn the vessel; first, because objection on that account was waived; second, because, however tortious or illegal, the seizure could not annul the proceeding; and third, because the seizure, even if upon the high seas, was legal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-11\">III. Conceding all the facts averred in the petition, the question of the jurisdiction of the Alaskan court depends upon the extent of the dominion of the United States in Behring Sea. This is a political question to' be decided by the political department of the government \u2014 the Executive and Congress. They have both decided it against the petitioners\u2019 contention. This is conclusive upon the1 judiciary.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Mr. Chief Justice Fuller</author>\n<p id=\"AJ9\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">This is an application for leave to file a petition for a writ of prohibition to the District Court of the United States for the District of Alaska. The Attorney General being present and expressing a desire to that effect, opportunity was afforded him to be heard in opposition to granting the ieave to file, and this resulted in argument having a much wider range than was necessary\" to the disposition of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\"><em>We </em>are of opinion, upon the preliminary question, that this court has jurisdiction to proceed in respect to the District Court of the United States for the District of Alaska, by way of prohibition, under section 688 of the Revised Statutes, and leave will therefore be given to file the petition for such writ and the accompanying suggestion.
