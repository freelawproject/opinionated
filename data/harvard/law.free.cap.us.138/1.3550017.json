The twelfth paragraph was as follows: \u201cAnd whereas, for .-the purpose of enabling the party of the. third-part to reach the Union Depot of St. Louis, Missouri, an amicable arrangement and agreement for a right of way outside of and through said Forest Park has been made and entered into by and-between the parties of the second and third parts, and- in pursuance thereof the parties of the second and. third parts are to enter upon'-and enjoy the right of way and all the rights, privileges, immunities, powers, improvements and property belonging to or vested in, or that may belong to or vest in, the party of the second part, in common, in, upon and through said park, under certain regulations, terms and conditions agreed upon by and-between- said parties therein; and whereas the party of the third -part, in further pursuance of said last-named agreement, is about to construct, maintain and operate a railroa'd in, upon and through said park, at great expense, and to engage in other great outlays-and to assume other heavy burthens and- responsibilities to be of: advantage to said third \u25a0 party through the continued-enjoyment of said right of way - and other 'rights, privileges, powers, franchises, immunities, improvements and property in, upon and through-said park: Now, therefore, in view of .-the premises and. as inducements to said party of- the third part to proceed as intended, the- party of the .first part does. hereby grant and convey unto, and license and permit, the said party of the third part,.its successors and assigns, to have, hold, use and enjoy.said right of way in, upon and through.said park, in common with and to be held and enjoyed jointly with said party of the second part and its assigns, on the terms of the said contract between them, and under the same terms and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>conditions as are hereby and hereinbefore imposed upon said party of the second part, and which are hereby assumed by said party of the third part as to improvements, except as to building a depot and switch in said park, which the party of the second part is to do itself; or in case said party of the second part, its successors or assigns, shuuld forfeit its said rights, privileges and franchises in, upon and through said park, or from any cause cease to have, maintain or enjoy the same, then it is hereby agi\u2019eed'and convenanted that the party of the third part shall not also be excluded from said park but shall, with its successors and assigns, continue to have, maintain and enjoy all of said fights, privileges, immunities, franchises, improvements and property, on the terms hereinbefore set\" forth, continuously and forever.\u201d The thirteenth paragraph provided that the Kansas City company should have no depot in the park.

The foregoing contract was signed by the parties, but it was never, acknowledged as a deed. It was afterwards, in 1879, recorded in the office of the. county recorder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-5\">(7) The evidence showed\"that, after-the execution of the foregoing deed and contracts, the Kansas City company acquired from divers parties the necessary additional right of way between the park and the Union Depot, and proceeded to construct and put in operation its road through the park, tunnel and cut, and on down to the Union Depot in the city, the road through the park being on the line established by the tripartite agreement; that at-the same time the Park Commissioners proceeded with the work referred to in the last clause of that agreement, and expended for material and work on the arched entrances or exits, rendered necessary by the presence of the railroad in the park, and in the erection of walls for _the tunnel in the park,. nearly $40,000; that the road through the park was completed in 1876 by the Kansas City company ; and that, the County company having failed in the performance of all its covenants, and having failed to refund to the Kansas City company any portion of the cost of constructing the road through the park, it lost and abandoned all claim to the right of way and Toad-bed through the park,tunnel and cut, and the Kansas City- company thereupon, under the terms of the agreement,- took sole control of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>road through the park, tunnel and cut. Afterwards, in 1878, it acquired, by purchase from third parties, all the property and rights of way of the County company between the park and the Union Depot.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-5\">(8) In 1879, the Kansas City company was consolidated with the Wabash Railway company under the name of the \u201c Wabash, St. Louis and' Pacific Railway Company.\u201d The Wabash company assumed all the obligations of the Kansas City company, and in so far as this controversy is concerned the consolidation was only a change of name.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-6\">(9) In 1880, the Wabash company conveyed its property in trust to the Central Trust Company of New York and James Cheney, to secure a series of bonds, $18,000,000 of which were issued and sold.. In 1884, the Wabash company became insolvent, and Solon Humphreys and Thomas E. Tutt were, by the Circuit Court of the United States .for the Eastern District of Missouri, appointed receivers of its property, and afterwards bills were filed by the Central Trust Company and Cheney to foreclose said mortgage, as before mentioned. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ar\">(10) In 1886, while Humphreys and Tutt., receivers, were in possession of the-Wabash property, the Colorado company having constructed, a line of railroad connecting with the Wabash road at-the north line of Forest Park, and of -the game gauge, demanded of the receivers permission to run its carg over the Wabash tracks through the park, and down to the Union Depot in. the nity, which UHion_ Depot was, on August 11, 1875, and has since continued to be, the only general passenger depot-reached by all railroads entering the city. The Colorado company .contended that it was entitled to. this-right under the contracts aforesaid, and particularly under the provisions of the ninth and the subsequent paragraphs of the tripartite agreement. This claim was denied by the receivers, and thereupon'the Colorado company and the city of St. Louis filed their said bill of- intervention, setting forth the facts above stated, and praying the. court-to enjoin and restrain the Wabash company and the 'receivers from interfering with its use of said property.' The city of St. Louis joined in the proceeding as the' successor of the Park Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>missioners, the park having, by \u00e1ppropriate legislation,' been brought within the jurisdiction of the city. An. amended bill of intervention was filed August 4, 1886. The prayer of the amended bill was as follows: \u201cYour orators pray that a writ of injunction issue out of and under the seal of this honorable court enjoining and restraining the said Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railway Company, and the said Solon Humphreys and Thomas E. Tutt, as such receivers, and each of them and of their agents, servants, counsellors and employ\u00e9s, from in any manner refusing to permit your orator, the St. Louis, Kansas City and Colorado Railroad Company, under such reasonable regulations, and terms as to this court may seem proper, from using the said right of way of said Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific \"Railway Company, commencing at the north line of said park, where the railway of said Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railway Company enters said park, thence over said right of way to said Eighteenth Street in said city of St. Louis, by running its engines and cars'over and up'on said right of way, including the tracks of said Wabash, St. Louis and Pacific Railway Company between the points at said Union Avenue and said Eighteenth Street.\u201d In their answer the Wabash company and the receivers admitted the. execution of the agreements, but denied that under- them, or either of them, the .Colorado company had any right to use any portion of the Wabash tracks or right of way through the park or between the park and Eighteenth Street. The answer then stated the facts concerning the execution of the general mortgage by the Wabash company in 1880, to the Central Trust Company and Chenoy ; averred that the Wabash ^company had made default in the payment of interest on its bonds; .tha-fe-by the terms of'said mortgage said \u25a0 trustees were-entitled--to' possession <em>of </em>said'1 property; that said receivers \u201cwere in possession of said railroad finder said mo'rtgage for the benefit of the holders bf said mortgage bonds, and that neither said bondholders, trustees or receivers were privy to or bound by any agreement or contract mad'eNay the County -company. with-. said Park Commissioners,-with respect t\u00f3\u2019 the- use of its-railroad through .said ]3ark or elsewhere, by other railroad companies.'

Considerable testimony was taken by the master, but it related almost entirely to matters affecting the compensation to be paid for the \u00fase of the tracks and property in question, and it is unnecessary to refer to it in detail. The following testimony of witnesses, on other points, was given: S. T. Emerson, chief engineer in charge of the construction of the Kansas City road from the Union Depot to the north line of the park, testified as follows: \u201cQ..Now. from that point [Forsyth Junction] to the Union Depot, what is the most, or the only, practical entrance to the depot from that point? A. The Wabash railroad.\u201d W. Emerson also testified as follows : \u201c Q. How many tracks, if any, are on the right of way where the Wabash railway now enters the park from Eighteenth Street, the thirty feet from Eighteenth Street to the park and the forty-two feet through the park ? A. There, are occasional places where there is a side track. There could not be but one track besides the main track on the thirtv feet.\u201d Andrew McKinley, president of the Boai\u2019d of Forest Park Commissioners at the time the tripartite agreement was made, testified as follows: \u201c Q. What was' the policy of the board with reference to railroads\" passing through the park, at the time of the execution of the tripartite agreement ? A. There was a great deal of discussion and there was quite a controversy about where the road should run, under the provision which I have mentioned,\u201d (referring to the act of the legislature, requiring the County road to enter on the eastern side, through Duncan\u2019s subdivision). \u201c Q. Please describe the park to the master, whether it has been improved, and, if so, how, in a general way ? A. The provisions contained in the proviso that I have just spoken of were intended to protect the park .against the invasions of all railroads, unquestionably. I put-it there myself. Q. What-effect would the invasion of the park, by railroads have upon the park for the purpose for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>which it was established ? A. I think a very damaging effect upon the point of use and'upon the point of landscaping. Q. For what purposes .was the park intended to be used principally\u2014 as a driving park.? - A. It is shown in the act itself to be dedicated to the people of the city and county of St. Louis for their enjoyment forever \u2014 that is, a pleasure ground for the people of St. Louis. Q. Are there drives running through it? A. Yes, sir; nineteen arid- three-quarters miles of drives through the park. Q. What effect would the penetration of the-park by railroads, at different points have upon the park as a driving park ?\u2022 A. Up' to this time it was apprehended that the road [would produce some great danger to persons visiting Forest; Park, and it was. a long time before that public impression was relieved of the apprehension that horses would be frightened, grid hence there is a provision that the road shall be covered ovemvith a cover or ..protected by trees. During the time I was president of the park it was not- thought to be necessary. .Q. How much money has been expended in beautifying the park? A. $405,000 during my admiriistration; since, that time nothing. It remains as it was then. Q. What does it represent in money to-day ? A. In cash paid $1,300,000, and, besides that, some contributions made by the! city since. The interest on that sum, of course, \u25a0is to be added. The' bonds are thirty-year bonds.\u201d Cross-examination : \u201c Q. - riv, the expenditures by the Park Commissioners were in the erection of masonry composing these two arches and the principal viaduct through which the people enter the park. -It was in the masonry composing those structures? A. Yes, sir; thjere would have been no necessity7 for them, exc\u00e9pt for \u25a0 the railroad. Q. They were made necessary by the railroad ? A. Y \u00e9s, sir. Q. They were for the convenience of persons-passing in and out of the. park? A. Yes, sir. -Q. Without the railroad there would have been no necessity : for the culverts;. they 'were 'the entrances for carriage and \u25a0footmen? A. Yes, sir.\u201d A. A.-,Talmage, general manager of the Wabash company, testified as follows: \u201c Q. Would it be practicable for any other rogl subject to your rules and regulations to use the track from the north dine of \u25a0the- .park to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>depot \u2014 I mean the main track <em>% </em>A. It could be done under the.rules and regulations of this company,- but usually it is done by substituting the motive power and trainmen of o\u00far own road to handle the trains of foreign-roads.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-4\">(12) The Wabash company and the receivers excepted to the reports of the master (of which there were- two) on various grounds, which need not be given in detail.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-5\">(13) The exceptions were argued before the court beld by Mr. Justice Brewer, then Circuit Judge, and Judge Treat, and it held, (29 Fed.

It differed, however, with the master on the question of the compensation to be-paid by the Colorado company, and sustained exception eleven on that point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-6\">(14) The court then entered a decree, December -31, 1886, finding that the equities were with the intervenors, and that \u25a0they were entitled to the relief prayed for, and fixing the compensation to be paid by the Colorado Company for the use of -the right of way and tracks, side-tracks, switches, turn-outs, turn-tables and other terminal- facilities of the Wabash company, between the north line of Forest Park and Eighteenth Street in the city of St. Louis, at $2500 per month.

The court thereupon entered an order, on said day, reciting the petition, and that it appeared to the court that said Joy, Hubbard, Welles and Ashley were the owners of the premises and right of way theretofore owned by the Wabash company, between the north line of Forest Park and across the park to Eighteenth Street in the city of St. Louis, over which the intervenor was seeking to obtain a right to run its engines and cars, and ordering, that said purchasers be made parties defendant in the cause.

The court erred in holding that the covenants on the part of the County Eailroad company to permit other railroads to use its right of way between the park and the termi-. nus of its line in the city,' was binding on the Kansas City company, and gave respondent the right to use the right of way and tracks afterwards acquired and constructed by the Kansas City company between the park and the city.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b43-7\">Our contention is, that the' provision at the end of the twelfth paragraph of the tripartite agreement to the effect that\u2018\u201c if the County company should forfeit its rights, privi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>leges and franchises upon and through the park, such forfeiture should not affect the rights of the Kansas City company, but'that the Kansas City company should continue to have, maintain arid enjoy all of said rights, privileges, immunities, franchises, improvements and property on the terms therein-before set forth, continuously and forever,\u201d \u2014 only relates to the right of way through the park, and that it has no reference to anything between the park and the city.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-5\">It is obvious that the other two parties to the agreement intended, by the last clause of the twelfth paragraph,- to say to the Kansas City .company, as. an .inducement for it to proceed with the work of constructing the line through the \u2022park, that in case it did make the expenditures contemplated, it should not' afterwards be excluded from the park in consequence of any future forfeiture or failure, on the part, of the County company to fulfil its covenants. The idea was that if the Kansas City company constructed the line through the park, it was to continue in' the park on the same terms imposed upon the County company. Therefore, no matter what view the court may take of the. decree with respect to other matters, it was erroneous for the court to extend the decree over any portion of the track of the Kansas City company lying outside the park.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-6\">II. The court erred in holding and decreeing that the covenant of the County company \u2014 to the effect that' \u201c it would permit other railroads to use its right of way between the park and. the terminus of its road in the city \u201d \u2014 created an equitable easement in the road between the park and the city which affected that property in the hands of Joy and others, \u00e1s purchasers from the Kansas City compan 3m</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-7\">An equitable easement is said to be a right without profit, which the owner of one tract of land has, to restrict or regulate,'.for the benefit of his own tract, the uses to be riiade of another contiguous tract. There \u25a0 must, of course, be two estates, a dominant and a servient estate, and in order to create an equitable easement, or an easement which only a court of equity can-enforce, the burden or duty imposed on the servient estate, must be for the benefit of the dominant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>estate. The covenants must \u201ctouch or concern or \u201c extend to the support of the dominant estate.\u201d They must be \u201cfor the benefit of the dominant estate.\u201d <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Union Railway Co., </em>11 Gray, 359; <em>Jenks </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>115 Mass. 217; <em>Jeffries </em>v. <em>Jeffries, </em>117 Mass. 184; <em>Norcross v. James, </em>140 Mass. 188.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-5\">These cases hold that when a party conveys a portion of his lands, and the grantor accepts a covenant back from his grantee, to the effect that neither he nor his assigns will \u00fase the land granted for a purpose prejudicial to the property retained, such covenants, although they cannot be strictly said to run with the land, nevertheless create in the grantor and his assigns equitable easements in the lands conveyed for the benefit of the lands not conveyed, and courts of equity have, therefore, enjoined the covenantor from violating the covenant to the prejudice of the covenantee and'his assigns.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-6\">In the foregoing, cases, as well as in all. that are cited and relied upon by the appellees, it will be found upon examination that the covenants which were enforced were contained in deeds of grant, and that they concerned the use of property granted, in its relation to the property retained. The personal covenants of the grantees were, in those cases, regarded as creating easements in the lands granted which would be enforced in equity, although at law they were' not covenants which run with the land.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-7\">Now, we concede that there are circumstances under which the covenant in question might be enforced if the bill had been filed against the County company (covenantor) and had only related to the right of way in the park. If the bill had only related to the right of way in the park, and it could be truthfully said that the County company, acquired its right of way through the.park under a grhnt from the Park Commissioners, and the court could furthermore see that to enforce the covenant would be beneficial to the park, then we think the case would come under the rule announced in the cases above cited.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b45-8\">But when it comes to the right of way outside the park our contention is, that the doctrine of equitable easement has no application, and that as to the property outside the park the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>covenant of the County company, with respect to its use by other companies,s.was merely personal. <em>Des Moines &amp; Fort Dodge Railroad </em>v.

Bailey, 2 Myl. &amp; K 517.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-4\">If covenants do not run with land, it is only when they are restrictive and relate to the lands granted that they will be enforced even.in equity against assignees with notice.. It is said in many pases, and the rule seems now firmly established, that courts of equity, will not enforce against the grantee of the covenantor, who has himself entered into no covenant, any covenant of his grantor, which does not run with the land and which requires the expenditure of money. <em>Haywood </em>v. <em>Brunswick Building Society, </em>8 Q. B. D. 403; <em>London &amp; Southwestern Railway </em>v. <em>Gomm, </em>20 Ch. D. 562. Therefore, in so far as the decree gives to the Colorado company the use of the right of way outside the park, it should be reversed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-5\">III... The court erred in holding and decreeing that a covenant, on the part of the County company.\u201c to permit other railroads to use its right of way under such reasonable regulations and upon such terms and for such fair and equitable compensation to be paid therefor as might be agreed upon by such, companies,\u201d constituted an agreement sufficiently definite to .be specifically enforced in a court of equity.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-6\">A party who merely agrees to permit another at some future time to enter upon and use a given piece of property on such terms and for such compensation, as may, when the time arrives, be agreed upon, does not part with any interest in his estate or impair his dominion over it. The mere right in one party to use the property of another on such terms as may be agreed upon, gives the covenantee no interest in the property. One gets nothing by such a contract. He had the same privilege before the contract was made.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-7\">In this case, the regulations, compensation and terms on which the property was to be used, were all left by the contract tb the future determination of the parties, and the question is, as to whether a court of equity ought to put itself in the place of-the parties and supply not merely some subordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>nate missing term, but make, in fact, tbe whole agreement. Or in other words, can a court of equity, under the guise of enforcing a contract, make the contract tvhich it enforces, and in so doing, fix the terms on which one party may use the property of another, when the very contract in question leaves the matter of fixing the terms to the parties themselves ? Can a court of equity do that? See <em>Colson </em>v. Thompson, 2 Wheat. 336; <em>Hennessy </em>v. Woolworth, 128 U. S. 438; <em>McKibbin </em>v. Brown, 1 McCarter (14 N. J.

The court erred in entering a decree compelling the specific performance, by tbe Wabash company, of a continuous duty requiring the exercise of skill and personal judgment, as well as the constant expenditure of money, and requiring the court to retain perpetual control over the cause in order to superintend the execution of the decree, and make, from time to time, such changes in the rules and regulations adopted as the circumstances of the parties and the shifting contingencies of business and trade should render necessary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-7\">The question of whether a court of equity will specifically enforce a contract which requires the performance of continu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>\u25a0ous duties, and the constant supervision, by the court, of a business involving skill, personal labor, cultivated judgment and the constant expenditure of money, and where, if performance is decreed, the case must remain indefinitely in court, has been so recently and so fully considered here, that to determine this case it seems only necessary to examine the decree and see whether it falls within the rule announced.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-4\">Under this decree .the case must remain forever in court, and the court to the end of time may be called upon to determine the innumerable controversies that may arise between the parties under its provisions. Under it, constant payments .\u25a0and settlements are to be made, some monthly, others ann\u00fa.\u25a0ally, and hence it is a constant and perpetual duty of the \u25a0court to enforce those provisions. Under the decree it is made he duty of the Wabash company to perpetually maintain the tracks and all said terminal facilities in good repair, and the question of what is good repair is an issue on which the parties are entitled \u2022 to be heard, and may call for as. many separate trials as there are complaints.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-5\">And furthermore, to keep the property in good repair', calls .for the constant expenditure of money and the exercise of judgment and professional skill, and .to perform that duty the \u25a0court must, if required, compel the Wabash company, or its .assigns, to raise money and afterwards expend it with the judgement and skill necessary to keep the tracks, turn-tables and \u25a0other terminals\"in good repair. A failure to comply with any one of the ninety-eight rules, or a dispute as to their meaning, furnishes a controversy that can only be determined by the court that entered the decree. Not only that, but new rules may be made and the question of whether they are reasonable, as reserved to the court, and, on application of the parties, must be determin\u00e9d by it. In short, the whole future management of the property is; by the decree,'taken out of the hands of its owners and, for all time, subjected to the orders land control of the court,</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-6\">In <em>Texas and Pacific Railway Co. </em>v.

And it was said that the task of supervising and enforcing a contract for the building of a house or a railroad, was outside the proper functions of a court of equity and not within the powers of a specific performance.

Therefore, no matter what view may be taken of the case in other respects, the decree was erroneous in two particulars: First, because it is broader than the covenant; and second, because it is broader than the prayer of the bill.

Of course these parties have no contract relations. The Colorado company has no contract relations with any one, and it is not pretended that Joy and his associates have entered into any covenants.

The court erred in holding that the contract of the County company to permit other railroads to use its right of \u25a0way, was binding on Joy and his associates, they being purchasers in good faith and without notice, under the mortgage made by the \"Wabash company in 1880.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-8\">If the tripartite agreement was never acknowledged as a deed, then the filing of it in the office of the Recorder, imported no notice to Joy and his associates. That point was expressly ruled in <em>Bishop </em>v. Schneider, 46 Missouri, 472. But to ' avoid the effect of the rule laid down in that case, the court found that the recitation in the deed of August 11th, 1875, from the County company to the Kansas City company (which deed was duly recorded) to the effect \u201c that the County\u2018company executed that deed in pursuance of the terms of a certain contract made between the same parties on the 11th day of August, 1875, and in full satisfaction of so much of said contract as related to the conveyance of certain pieces of land and rights of way to said party of the second part,\u201d was sufficient to put subsequent purchasers on inquiry as to the contents of the previous unrecorded contract between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>the two companies; and that, having found and examined the contract between the two companies, a purchaser would discover in it a reference to the unacknowledged and improperly recorded tripartite agreement, and that upon reading the tripartite agreement he would find the clause on which the Colorado company bases its claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-5\">Now, we contend that the above finding was erroneous, and we say (1) that a statement in a general warranty deed to the effect, \u201c that it is made in pursuance of a previous personal contract between the parties and in full satisfaction of so much thereof as relates to the conveyance of the pi\u2019operty,\u201d is not, and in reason cannot be, sufficient to put a subsequent grantee on inquiry for prior incumbrances ; and (2) that when the document referred to is not a deed, but a mere collateral personal agreement, a reference to it in a deed, in which the grantor con venan ts that he is seized of an indefeasible estate in fee simple, does not even put a subsequent purchaser on inquiry</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-6\">But, again, the court found, that the further .statement in the deed from the County company to the Kansas City company, to the effect, <em>\u201c </em>that the County company conveyed said rights of way, subject to the terms and conditions upon which the same were granted to the County company,\u201d was, sufficient to put subsequent purchasers on inquiry as to such conditions. \"We grant that proposition,\u2019 but let us inquire what property the County company was conveying to the Kansas City company \u201c subject to* the terms and conditions upon which it had been conveyed to the County company.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b51-7\">As to the lots outside the park, there is nothing in all tbq record tending to show on what conditions one foot of that ground had been conveyed to the County company. And asi to the right of way through the park, the County company held that property under its deed from Griswold, as well as under the third section of the Park Act, and there is nothing in either the deed or act, showing, or tending to show, that the County company held, its-right of way through the park subject to any conditions whatever.- The County com pan <em>y </em>claimed nothing in the park through any grant from the Park <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Commissioners, and the Park Commissioners never attempted to grant anything to that company. The title to the lands in the park was vested in the people of the county, and the Legislature had absolute control over it for all purposes. <em>State </em>v. <em>St. Louis County </em>Court, 34 Missouri, 546; <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Dist, of Columbia, </em>91 U. S. 540. As to the property outside the park \u2014 that which was acquired from other parties by deed or by condemnation \u2014 there was certainly nothing in the deed from the County company to put Joy and his associates on inquiry concerning incumbrances on those portions of the line. The deed of the County company forms no link in the chain of title through which Joy and his associates held by far the ma,jor portion of the line between the park and the city, and we understand that purchasers are only bound to take notice of recitals contained in the deeds which form links in their chain of title. They are not bound to inquire into collateral contracts and circumstances. <em>Acer </em>v. <em>Westcott, </em>46 N. Y. 384; <em>Burch </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>44 Alabama, 115; <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Back-house, </em>17 Ves. 282; <em>Mueller </em>v. <em>Engeln, </em>12 Bush, 441; <em>Penrose v. Griffith, </em>4 Binney, 231.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b52-5\">Certainly, the recitals in the contracts or even in the deed from the County company to the Kansas City company, were no sort of notice to purchasers of any incumbrances upon, or easements in, all that portion of the right of way outside the park not' conveyed by the County company to the Kansas City company. As to the property not purchased^from the County company, the recitals in its deed to the Kansas City company lay outside the chain through which Joy and his associates derive title to all that portion of the property which never belonged to the County company. Therefore, as to all the property; not purchased from the County company, the record shows no fact sufficient to put a purchaser on inquiry for incumbrances of any sort.

The Board of Forest Park Commissioners had, under the act of March 25, 1871, the power to lay off, improve, adorn, govern, manage and control the use of the park and the avenues surrounding it. Before the execution of the tripartite agreement, neither the County company nor the Kansas City company liad any railroad to the Union Depot. The County company had located its line east and west of the park, and had purchased the right of way at different points along its line from the Union Depot to the park; but it had built no railroad, and the location of its right of way through the park was undetermined at the time. The Kansas City company had its depot for freight and passengers in the northern part of the city, some distance from the Union Depot. As the Union Depot was at that time the only general passenger depot in the city, and was reached by most of the railroads -which entered the city, the Kansas City company determined to build a branch of its road from Ferguson, about nine or ten miles from the city, to the Union Depot, and thus avail itself of better facilities for doing a passenger business, and to cross the bridge over the Mississippi River with its trains. It is stated in the agreement of August 11, 1875, between the County company and the Kansas City company, that the latter required the right of way in order to reach the Union' Depot. Its branch line from Ferguson was located through the park. In its efforts to obtain the right of way through the park it encountered the County company. The Board of Park Commissioners was conferred with by the two companies, in regard to securing a definite right of way for both of them through the park. This is shown by the testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>mony of Mr. McKinley, before referred to. The Park Commissioners were willing, at that time, to grant the use of one right of way through the park, on a certain line, with conditions as to the use of such right of way by other railroads, so as to protect the park, as far as possible, from invasion by other railroads, on separate and independent rights of .way. In order to accomplish this result, the board expended $40,000 in aid of the construction of the railroad through the park. In view of the deep cut on the,line of the Wabash road just east of the park, it would be difficult for any other railroad to enter the park, from the east, on an independent right of way, and at the same time use the right of way of the Kansas City company through the park. Hence, arose the provision that this right to use the right of way by other railroads should apply not only to the \u201c right of way through the park,\u201d but also to' the right of way \u201c up to the terminus of its road in the city of St. Louis,\u201d that is, the right of way from the park to .the Union Depot.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">It was under- these circumstances that the tripartite agreement came into existence; and the terms of paragraph 9 of it must be construed. That paragraph is here repeated : \u201c Ninth. Said party of the second part shall permit, under such reasonable regulations and terms as may be agreed upon, other railroads to use its right of way through the park and up to the terminus of its road in the city of St. Louis, upon such terms and for such fair and equitable compensation to be paid to it therefor as may be agreed upon by such companies.\u201d It is to be construed in connection with paragraph 12 of the same agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">In regard to these two paragraphs, the opinion of the Circuit Court says: \u201c It will be observed that by the ninth paragraph the County road agreed to permit the use of its right of way by other railroads. Whether a like obligation was assumed by the Kansas road depends upon the last sentence in the twelfth paragraph, which purports to grant to the Kansas road the right to occupy and enjoy the right of way through' the park jointly with the County road <em>\u2018 </em>on the terms of the said contract between them, and under the same terms and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>conditions as are hereby and hereinbefore imposed upon said party of the second part, and which, are hereby assumed by said party of the third part as to improvements, except as to Duilding a depot and switch in said park, which the party of the second part is to do itself.\u2019 It must be conceded that the meaning of this language is not perfectly clear. It is claimed by the defendants that the words \u2018 as to improvements, except as to building, etc.,\u2019 qualify not only the immediately preceding clause, commencing. \u2018 and which are hereby assumed,\u2019 but also the one prior, commencing \u2018and under the same terms and conditions,\u2019 and therefore that the terms and conditions as to improvements are those alone cast upon the Kansas road. This would make the two clauses but a single compound one, qualified by the following relative clause \u2018 as to improvements,\u2019 etc. As against this it must be observed that, grammatically, a relative clause generally qualifies its immediate antecedent, and therefore, in this case, would refer simply to that clause Avhich. provides for the assumption by the Kansas road. This natural grammatical construction is strengthened by the punctuation \u2014.a comma after the words \u2018 party of the second part \u2019 and none after the words \u2018party of the third part,\u2019 which seems to separate the entire first clause from the second and its qualifying terms. I know that the matter of punctuation is never relied upon to defeat the obvious intent; but, Avhen the meaning is doubtful, the punctuation is certainly a matter tending to throw light upon it. Further, there are not simply two, but really three, antecedent clauses, the first one being \u2018 the terms of the said contract between them,\u2019 that is, the two railroad- companies. Yery clearly this qualifying clause does not refer to that, and therefore it should not be held to qualify the second, unless the obvious intent compels such construction. It is objected that the clause commencing \u2018 and which are hereby assumed\u2019 is, under this construction, superfluous. I think not. These improvement's called for the expenditure of money, and the idea seemed to be that the Kansas road should not only hold its rights upon certain conditions but, that, as to those involving expenditure of money, it should expressly assume the performance. There is a manifest differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>cnee between a conveyance subject to.a mortgage and a conveyance in which the grantee assumes the payment of the mortgage. This distinction evidently dictated the form of expression used.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">It appears, from paragraph 12, that the Kansas Oity company had in view the failure of the County company to comply w-ith the provisions of paragraphs 1 to 8 inclusive of the tripartite agreement relating to the construction of the road, among which was the. provision which required the completion of the road within one year, under the penalty of the forfeiture of all rights under the agreement. The Kansas City company guarded against such contingency by the provision, in paragraph 12, that, in case the County company, its successors or assigns, should forfeit its rights, privileges and franchises in, upon and through the park, or from any cause should cease to have, maintain or enjoy the same,' then the Kansas City company should not also be excluded from the park, but, with its successors and assigns, should continue to have, maintain and enjoy all of said rights, privileges, immunities, franchises, improvements and property, on the terms thereinbefore set forth, continuously and' forever. Thereby, in case of the forfeiture of its rights by the County company, the Kansas City company became possessed of the entire right of way, subject to the terms of the agreement of August 11,1875, between the two companies, and to those of the tripartite agreement of the same date; and that which, prior to the forfeiture, was held' and.enjoyed jointly by the two companies, became the sole property of the. Kansas City company, its successors and assigns, .on. the terms of the said contract between the two companies, and under the same terms ^md conditions which were imposed upon the Kansas City company. Among the conditions so imposed were those of paragraph 9 of the tripartite agreement. Further, those terms as to improvements, except as to building a depot and switch in the park, were assumed by the Kansas City company. The depot and switch were to be built by the County company. The word \u201c improvements \u201d related to the building of the road and the erection of what was to be erected, except the depot and switch. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>reason why the Kansas City company did not assume the \u2022building of the depot and switch appears from a clause in the agreement of August 11,1875, between the two companies, to the effect that the County company should have and maintain the passenger depot in the park, so far as the two companies were concerned, and that the Kansas City company should not have the power of stopping any of its trains in the park. As, however, the latter company would use the right of way through the park, and what were called the improvements,\u201d except the depot and switch, the Park Commissioners required it to assume the obligations of the County company in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">This was the view of the contract taken by the Circuit Court, arid we think it was-correct. It is evidently in accordance with the intention of ''the parties to the tripartite agreement. The, object of the Park Commissioners was to protect the park from the invasion of more than one railroad track ; and, to accomplish that result, it was necessary to give to other railroad companies the right to use the one right of way, and to impose on the Kansas-City coinpany, as. well as the County company, the obligation to permit other companies to use such right of way. <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Michigan Central Railroad, </em>111 U. S. 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">We are also of opinion that, the covenants in paragraph 9 of the tripartite agreement, as to the use of the right of way by other railroad companies, are binding upon subsequent purchasers, with notice, from the Kansas City company. <em>Tulk </em>v. <em>Moxhay, </em>2 Phillips, 774; <em>Luker </em>v. <em>Dennis, </em>7 Ch.

Y. 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>In the present case, the tripartite agreement is a link in the chain of title of the mortgagees and. of the purchasing committee. The right of way through the park, granted by Gris-wold to the County company, November 3, 18.71, was lost by non-user. The right of way granted by the Park Commissioners to the County company under the first park act, of March 25, 1872, failed because that act was declared unconstitutional, in <em>Chouteau </em>v. Leffingwell, 54 Missouri, 458. The third line, that established by the tripartite agreement, was not identical with either of the two prior lines. The Park Commissioners, therefore, granted to the two companies, under the tripartite agreement, all the right of way which they acquired in the park. The right of the mortgagees -and of the purchasing committee to use such right of way is based solely upon that agreement; and, holding under it, they must hold subject to its terms and conditions, irrespectively of the question of notice. <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Union </em>Railway, 11 Gray, 359; <em>Vandoren </em>V. Robinson, 16 N. J. Eq. 256; <em>Tulk </em>v. Moxhay, 2 Phillips, 774; <em>Luker </em>v. Dennis, 7 Ch. D. 227; <em>Western </em>v. <em>Macdermott, </em>L. R. 2 Ch. 72. Therefore, the Wabash company, the mortgagees, and the purchasing committee must be held to have had notice of the covenants and conditions of the tripartite agreement prior to the execution of the mortgage, and are bound by them, whether the covenants be or be not strictly such as run with the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Nor is the failure to acknowledge the tripartite agreement as a deed of any importance. There was sufficient to put the purchasers on inquiry, and to charge 'them with notice of all the facts which such an inquiry would have made known. The Wabash company came into existpnce in August, 1879, through the consolidation of the Kansas City company with the Wabash Eailway company. This consolidation took place under statutes by virtue of which the consolidated company took all the property, rights and franchises and assumed all the liabilities of. the Kansas City company. The Wabash company, therefore, was not strictly a purchaser from the Kansas City company. The consolidation was merely a change of name. If the Kansas City company was bound by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>the tripartite agreement to grant the use of the right of way to other railroads, on certain terms, the Wabash company, as consolidated, was equally bound to do so. The mortgage was executed in 1880, and the committee purchased in 1886. The tripartite agreement was recorded in the recorder\u2019s office of the city of St. Louis, September 5,1879, prior to the execution of the mortgage and prior to the purchase under it made by the committee. <em>Bishop </em>v. <em>Schneider, </em>46 Missouri, 472; <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Hampton, </em>46 Missouri, 404; <em>Digman </em>v. <em>McCollum, </em>47 Missouri, 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">The tripartite agreement, and that between the County company and the Kansas City company,-and the deed from the County company to the Kansas City company, all of them bear date August 11,1875. The deed was duly acknowledged, and \u2022 was recorded August 13, 1875. It is a link in the chain of title of the mortgagees and the purchasing .committee. It recites that it is made.in pursuance of the-terms of a certain contract made and executed between the County company and the Kansas City company, and dated August 11, 1875, and is in full satisfaction of so much of such' contract as relates to the conveyance of certain pieces, of land and right of way to the Kansas City company. It also contains the following provision <em>\u201c </em>And also the said party of the first part hath conveyed, assigned and transferred, and by these presents doth convey, assign and transfer, unto the said party of the second part, and to its successors and assigns, an undivided one-half of all the right, title or interest of the party of the first part of, in or to the right of way, and of, in or to any and all other rights, privileges and franchises, powers and immunities owned by, or vested in or enjoyed by, or that may hereafter be acquired and owned by, vested in or enjoyed by, the party of the first part, in, through or upon Forest Park, by any means or from any source whatever; all of which conveyances of the said rights of way in this deed mentioned are made subject to' the terms and' conditions upon which the same were granted-to the party- of the first part, together with all .and singular the tenements, hereditaments and appurtenances thereunto belonging or in anywise' apper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>taming.\u201d Thus this deed refers to the contract of August 11, 1875, between the County company and the Kansas City company, and to the terms thereof; and the Kansas City company took its title subject to the. terms and conditions imposed upon the County company by the tripartite, agreement. This reference to the terms and conditions on which the right of way mentioned in the deed was .granted to the Kansas City company put all the parties to the deed, and their assigns, on inquiry as to the terms of the contract by which such rights of way were granted, and led up to the provision in the agreement of August 11, 1875, between the two companies, which referred to the tripartite agreement in the following language: \u201c And whereas, under this agreement and a certain agreement between the parties hereto and the Commissioners of Forest Park of even date herewith, the party of the second part is about to, and hereby, in consideration of the covenants and agreements of the party of the first part, hereinafter particularly set forth, and of the covenants and agreements of said Commissioners of. Forest Park in said agreement with them contained, does covenant and agree to construct and maintain a railroad bed and road in, upon and through said Forest Park and the tunnel and cut hereinbefore specified, according to certain plans and specifications agreed upon, and according to the terms and conditions of said agreement with said commissioners, for the joint use of both the parties (of the first part and of the second part) hereto, their several successors-and assigns-.\u201d Being thus chargeable with notice of the contents, of the contract of August 11, 1875, between the County company and the1 Kansas City company, the mortgagees and the purchasing committee were chargeable also with notice of the tripartite agreement, to which it;, referred ; and they purchased subject to the terms on which the right of way was granted. <em>Kirkpatrick </em>v. <em>Peshine, </em>24 N.

The agreement between the County company and the Kansas City company provided that the County company should pay to the Kansas City company one-half 'of the cost of the construction and maintenance of the road-beel through the park and the tunnel and the cut, within two years from August-11, 1875, and that, if the County company should fail or refuse to make payment for sixty days after demand, after it should become due, all the rights, \u2022 privileges, franchises, powers, immunities, improvements and property of the County company, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>in, through or upon Forest Park, and .in, into, through, over or upon the tunnel and cut, should become, by virtue, of such failure and refusal, without further process or proceedings, forfeited to the Kansas City company, its successors and assigns; that, in case of such forfeiture, no further payments should be made by the County company, but the Kansas City company might enter upon the sole and absolute possession and enjoyment of all such rights, privileges, franchises, powers, immunities, improvements and property, to the exclusion of the County company; and that the latter company should-, in such case, convey by deed to the Kansas City company, its-successors and assigns, all of such rights, privileges, franchises, powers, immunities, improvements and property. The two years expired in 1877. The County company, having paid nothing, forfeited to the Kansas City company all its interest in the right of way through the park and through the tunnel and the cut east of the park.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">By the two agreements and the deed, the Kansas City company obtained from the County company an undivided one-half of the right of way through the park, and the other rights of way, then owned by the County company, between the park and the Union Depot, and, by virtue of the two' agreements and the .forfeiture, without' further action by either the County company or the Parle Commissioners, the Kansas City company became vested with the title to the whole right of way through the park, the tunnel and the cut, and became substituted for the County company under the agreements. All the obligations and conditions imposed upon the County company became those of the Kansas City company, except as to building the depot and the switch in the park; .and the latter company became subject to the conditions which were imposed on -the County company by the tripartite agreement. That agreement created the easement before referred to, which covered the tracks through the park and the tracks east of the park to the Union.Depot. <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Union Railway Co., </em>11 Gray, 359, 364; <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Nightingale, </em>6 Allen, 341, 344.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The permission to other railroad companies to use such tracks was a concession to the Park Commissioners, and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>one o'f the conditions of the grant of the right of way through the park to the County company; and the Kansas City company obtained the title to, and the exclusive possession of, such right of way, under the agreement providing for such permission. It would be inequitable to permit the Kansas City company, or its successor, to continue to use the right of way through the park and at the same time to deprive the Park Commissioners, or their successor, the city of St. Louis, as trustees of the public, of the benefit of the use by other railroad companies of the right of way between the park and the Union Depot. The park was dedicated to the use of the people of the city and county of. St. Louis, and it was the duty of their trustees to preserve that use to them, for park purposes. In the view of those trustees, it was necessary, for the protection of the park, that other railroad companies should be permitted to use not only the right of way through the park but also that between the park and the-Union Depot. In order to obtain the right of way through the park, the Kansas City company subjected itself, to the condition imposed by paragraph 9 of the tripartite agreement, and it is right that that company and its successor should be held to a strict compliance with its covenant. The appellants, although enjoying the benefit of the $40,000 expended by the Park Commissioners and of the right of way through the park, deny their liability under the agreement, without offering to return to the grantors the property obtained by virtue of the agreement. Under such circumstances, these parties cannot be heard to allege that the agreement was against the policy of the law. <em>Wiggins Ferry Co. </em>v. <em>Chicago &amp; Alton </em>Railroad, <em>13 </em>Missouri, 413.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">In respect to the point that paragraph 9 of the tripartite agreement covers the use by other railroad companies, not only of the right of way through the park, but also of the right of way to the terminus of the County company\u2019s-road in the city of St. Louis, the Circuit Court very rightly said, in its opinion: \u201c It is argued with great force, however, by counsel for the respondents, that even if the purchasers, were charged with notice of these terms and conditions as attaching to the lands described in the deed, inasmuch as the Kansas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>road obtained a large .portion of its right of way between Forest Park and the Union Depot from other sources, it took these latter portions, free from any burden cast upon the lands specifically conveyed by the County road. \u2018Can it be,\u2019 he says, 4 that a condition in a d\u00e9ed of a few feet of the right of way, in a long line of three hundred miles, casts a burden on \u2022the entire line, to be assumed by every succeeding purchaser?\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">I might answer this extreme case by a reverse question : Can it be possible that a condition attached to substantially the entire right of way of this long line of road can be defeated by the fact that some few,feet have been acquired by a deed free from- such condition? But these extreme cases do not constitute the practical matter before us. Here the County road had an incomplete right of way through the park and to the Union Depot. A share of this incomplete right of-way it conveyed to the Kansas toad subject to certain conditions. Can it be that the completion by the Kansas road of this right of way, by the purchase of intervening and isolated tracts, destroys the entire value of the conditions ?. Looking at this matter in-a practical way, -and from a reasonable' standpoint, I think the answer to this question must. be in the negative. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">In <em>Bronson </em>v. <em>Coffin, </em>108 Mass. 175, 180, it was said, the court speaking by Gray, J.: \u201c An interest in the nature of an easement in the land which the covenant ^purports to bind, whether already existing, or treated by the very deed which contains the covenant, constitutes a sufficient privity of estate to make the burden of a covenant to do certain acts upon that land, for the support and protection of' that interest and the beneficial use and enjoyment of the land granted, run with the land charged. And an obligation, duly expressed, that the structures upon one'parcel of land shall forever be.pf a certain character for the benefit of an adjoining parcel is equally a charge upon the first parcel, whether~the obligation is affirmative or merely restrictive, and whether the affirmative acts necessary' to carry the obligation into effect are to be done by the owner of the one or the owner of the other.\u201d And it -was held by the court, where there was a covenant to make and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>maintain a fence on a railroad* contained in a deed granting to the road a strip for the right of way, that this covenant. was an incumbrance on all the remaining land of the grantor, and ran with that land, because the covenant gave the grantee an interest in the nature of an easement in the adjoining land, of the grantor.

Stats, of Missouri of 1866, c. 63, sec. 32, p. 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">The only right of way through the park and to the Union depot claimed by the appellants is that established by the tripartite agreement. Every other right of way through the park was surrendered, by that agreement, to the Park Commissioners, because that agreement says that the line and grade established by it was thereby fixed \u201cas the sole and finally established right of way to which \u201d the County company was- \u201c entitled by statute or otherwise through said park, or any part thereof.\u201d Such line and grade were laid down and described on the plat and profile which were attached to the tripartite agreement and formed part thereof. The Park Commissioners expended about $40,000 \u2019in complying with their engagements under that agreement. At its date, as testified to by Mr. McKinley, it was feared that the invasion the park by railroads would not only affect unfavorably the landscape beauty of the park, but would also produce great danger to persons visiting it; and it was a long time before the apprehension was relieved that horses would be frightened. The consideration for the expenditure of the $40,000 was the provision of the tripartite agreement which protected the-park and-prevented its being defaced and injured by the construction of other railroads through it. The confining of such railroads to the use of the single right of way established was a reasonable'precaution. <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Michigan Cent. Railroad, </em>111 U. S. 228; <em>Mayor of New York </em>v. Williams, 15 N. Y. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>s&gt;02. Such provision was in the interest of the public safety, and the Park Commissioners had the right to exact it.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">In case the County company should forfeit its rights in the park, the Kansas City company was to continue to enjoy the right of way on the terms- imposed on the County company by paragraph 9 of the tripartite agreement. Such construction of the contract is the only one consistent with fair dealing and the manifest intention of the parties. The tripartite agreement is the only muniment of title under which the appellants now enjoy the right of way. The grant of the right to other railroads to use such right of way through the park and to the Union Depot was a grant to the Park Commissioners, as trustees for the public, and is to be construed liberally. Paragraph 9 is imperative. It provides that the County company \u201cshall permit\u201d other railroads to use its right of way. This is to be done \u201c under such reasonable regulations and terms as may' be agreed upon,\u201d and \u201c upon- such terms and for such fair and equitable compensation to be paid \u201d to the County company \u201ctherefor as may be agreed upon by such companies.\u201d Not only are the regulations and terms to \u25a0 be reasonable, but the .compensation is to be fair and equitable.. Although the statement is that the compensation is to be such \u201c as may be agreed upon by such companies,\u201d yet the statement that it is to be \u201cfair and equitable\u2019\u2019plainly brings in the element of its determination by a court of equity. If. the parties agree upon it, very well; but- if they do. not, still the right of way is to be enjoyed upon making compensation, and the only way to ascertain what is a \u201c fair and equitable \u201d compensation therefor is to determine it by a court of equity. Such is, in substance, the agreement of the parties. The provision cannot be construed as meaning that, if the parties ,do not agree, there is to be no compensation, aind that, because there can in that event be no compensation, there is to be no enjoyment of the right of way. In this view, it cannot be said that the court is making an agreement for the parties -whieh they did not make themselves. <em>Emery </em>v. <em>Wave, </em>8 Ves, 505; <em>Milnes </em>v. <em>Gery, </em>14 Ves. 399; <em>Gregory </em>v. Mighall, 1 8 Ves. 328; <em>City of Providence v</em>. <em>St. John's </em>Lodge, 2 R. I. 46; <em>Dike </em>v. Greene, 4 R. I. 285.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>On the question whether paragraph 9 of the tripartite agreement covers not merely the right of - way through the park and up to the terminus of the road in the city of St.' Louis, but also the tracks for that extent, the opinion of the Circuit Court very properly says: \u201c The language of the ninth paragraph, under which, as before noticed, intervenors must claim, is that the party of the second part shall permit other railroads to use its \u2018right of way.\u2019 Now, the term \u2018right of way\u2019 has a twofold signification. It sometimes is used to describe a right belonging to a party, a right of passage over any tract; and it is also used to describe that strip of land which railroad companies take upon which to construct their road-bed. Obviously, iii this paragraph, it is used in the latter sense. Through both of these contracts'the terms \u2018right of way,\u2019 \u2018 track,\u2019 and \u2018 road-bed \u2019 frequently appear, and in all case\u2019s the term \u2018 right of way \\js used as descriptive of the strip' above referred to. Notably, imthe fifth paragraph, is the distinction between the \u2018right of way\u2019 and the \u2018track\u2019 disclosed, in which it is provided-that the depbt shall be wholly outside of the right of way, but immediately adjoining the track. Now, the right of way through- the park, as given by the Cris wold deed, was 40 feet; as fixed by the contract with the Forest Park Commissioners was 10 feet; 'and by this present contract, 42 feet. So the County road conveyed to the Kansas road, outside of the park, a strip either 30 \u00f3r 28 feet in width for its right of way. My thought, at first, was that the intervenors could only claim a right to use so much of this right of way as was not, in fact, occupied by the track of the Wabash, and that all that was intended by this ninth paragraph was to permit other railroad companies to occupy and use so much of the Kansas road\u2019s right of way as it did not itself occupy and use; but, after reflection on the arguments of counsel, I have been led to the conviction that this was too narrow a construction, and was not the real intent of the parties. The master, in his report, shows that the entire right of way is occupied by tracks and sidings, so that there is no room for another and independent ti\u2019ack; and as th.ere is nothing to show that this occupation has not been made in good faith, and to supply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>the needs of the Wabash company, if my first interpretation, had been- correct, the intervenors would plainly be without any rights. I think, however, the true construction is this: that the Kansas company was to have the first right \u2014 a right not limited to its necessities, but as broad as its convenience. Subject, and only subject, to such prior right, other companies were to have the use of the right of way, and' if the respondent\u2019s business compell\u00e9d the occupation by its tracks or sidings of the entire right of way, but the convenience of its business would permit the use of those tracks and sidings by another road, then such other road would be entitled to the use of both the right of way and the tracks and sidings. This construction is, I think, in accordance with the obvious intent of the parties, who were contracting for general rights, and not fixing the specific details.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The evidence shows that the entire right of way is occupied with tracks and sidings, so that there is no room for another and independent track, and that the entrance into the Union Depot over the tracks of the Wabash company is the only practical route for the road of the Colorado company to that depot. As the Kansas City company had the right to cover its right of way with main and side-tracks, so that there should be no room on such right of way for the tracks of another railroad, it would be in its power to defeat the intent of the agreement, if the right of way should be held not to include the tracks. Moreover, as the County company and the Kansas City company were tenants in common of the right of way through the park and to the east end of the cut, each company had the right to .use the whole of the right of way, subject to the right of the other company to use the 'whole of it. Hence, the grant to other roads of the privilege of using the right of way applied to the whole of. such right of way through the park, and not to a particular part of it. The track cannot be separated from the right of way, the right of way being the principal thing and the track merely an incident. A right of way is of no practical use to a railroad without a superstructure and rails. The track is a necessary incident to the enjoyment of the right of way. The record shows that the railroad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>of the Colorado company is of the same gauge as that of the Wabash company, and that it is entirely practicable for the Colorado company to use the tracks of the Wabash company from the north line of the park to the Union Depot, subject to the reasonable rules and regulations of the Wabash company.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">The appellants having denied all right of the Colorado company under the tripartite agreement, it became necessary for the intervenors to come into a court of equity; and the court, having taken cognizance rightfully of the subject matter in controversy, has the power to settle not only the right but also the amount of compensation. The action of the Circuit Court was,, in effect, to enforce the specific performance of the agreement. The offer by the Colorado company, in its bill, to pay a fair and equitable compensation, with its prayer to have such compensation determined by the court, brought the matter within the cognizance of the court, the other party having substantially agreed, by paragraph 9 of the tripartite agreement, that the compensation should be determined by a court of equity. The prayer for an injunction to restrain the Wabash company and its receiver from refusing to permit the Colorado company to use the right of way of the Wabash company from the north line of the park to Eighteenth Street, is a prayer for all that is necessary to secure practically the specific performance of the agreement. <em>Dinham </em>v. <em>Bradford, </em>L. R. 5 Ch. 519; <em>Tillett </em>v. <em>Charing Cross Bridge Co., </em>26 Beav. 419; <em>Raphael </em>v. <em>Thames Valley </em>Railway, L. R. 2 Eq. 37; <em>Tscheider </em>v. <em>Biddle, </em>4 Dillon, 55; <em>Biddle </em>v. <em>Ramsey, </em>52 Missouri, 153; <em>Arnot </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>44 Missouri, 27; <em>Hug </em>v. <em>Van Burklee, </em>58 Missouri, 202; <em>Gregory </em>v. <em>Mighell, </em>18 Ves. 328.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The right to use the right of way is a continuing right. If the remedy were to be at law, repeated actions for damages would be necessary. The \u2022 remedy at law. would be wholly inadequate. It would not\" secure directly the enforcement of the provision of paragraph 9 of the tripartite agreement, or the use of the right of way.-by the Colorado company. It would be neither plain or complete, nor would it be a reasonable substitute for the remedy in equity, by the injunction asked for.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>The appellants rely largely upon cases of the character of that of <em>Marble Co. </em>v. Ripley, 10 Wall. 339, where this court refused to enforce the specific performance of a personal contract to deliver from a quarry marble of certain kinds and in blocks of a specified kind, holding that, as the duties required of the owners of the marble quarry were continuous, and the agreement was one for a perpetual supply of marble, the court could make no decree which would end the controversy, and the case would have to remain in the court forever, with the liability on the part of the court to be called upon, to the end of time, to determine, not only whether the 'prescribed quantity of marble h\u00e1d been delivered, but whether every block was from the right place, and was sound, and of suitable size or shape or proportion; and it was held that it was impracticable for 'the court to superintend the execution of such a decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">In the present case, it is urged that the court will be called upon to determine from tim\u00e9 to time what are reasonable regulations to be made by the Wabash company for the running of trains upon its tracks by the Colorado company. But this is no more than a court Of equity is called upon t\u00f3 do whenever it takes charge of the running of a railroad by means of a receiver. Irrespectively of this, the decree is complete in itself and disposes.of the controversy; and it is not unusual for a court of equity to take supplemental proceedings to carry out its decree and make it effective under altered circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Considerations of the interests of the public are held to be controlling upon a court of equity, when a public, means of. transportation, such as a railroad, comes into the possession and under the dominion of the court. These considerations have been recognized and; applied by this court in several cases. <em>Barton </em>v. Barbour, 104 U. S. 126; <em>Miltenberger </em>v. <em>Logansport Railway, </em>106 U. S. 286, 311, 312; <em>Union Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Illinois Midland </em>Railway, 117 U. S. 434, 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">The Circuit Court having adopted the rate of compensation insisted upon by the appellants, and -the Colorado company not having taken an. appeal., the .question-of the rate of com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>pensation is concluded between the parties. So also is the question that the rules and regulations for the running of the trains of the Colorado company are to be those prescribed by the Wabash company and its successors.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">In view of the testimony as to the use, by agreement, of the tracks of one railroad company by the engines and cars of another, the practical difficulties insisted upon of carrying out the regulations laid down in the decree of the Circuit Court amount to very little, if anything. That these regulations are practical is shown by the agreement, of August Tl, 1875, between the County company and the Kansas City company, in that provision thereof, which is as follows, and which was adopted to a certain extent by the Circuit Court in its decree: \u201c It is agreed and covenanted that to accommodate the running arrangements of the party of the second part said party of the second part shall have the absolute and sole control of the running, starting and .regulating of the time-tables of and for -its own trains; and it is further agreed and covenanted that no train, locomotive, car or other conveyance of the party of the first p\u00e1rt, its successors or assigns, shall be allowed or attempted to be started or run within eight (8) minutes of the time fixed or stated for the starting, coming in or running of the train or trains of the party of the second part, its successors or assigns; and there shall be twenty minutes\u2019 time between the starting and coming in of the'trains of the party \u25a0 of the second part, and this matter as to said specified times shall be-under the sole control and regulation of the party of the second part.\u201d It is to be noted, however, that the agree-, ment referred to gave to the Kansas City company the control only of its own trains, while the decree gives to the Wabash company the control of all the trains to be run over its tracks, with the proviso that the 'trains of the Colorado company shall not be started or run within eight minutes of the time fixed for the starting, coming in.or running of the trains of the Wabash company. The latter company is required. only to \u00a1make reasonable rules and regulations for the running of the trains of the Colorado company. . The Wabash company is to \u2022fix the time-tables, and the trains of the Colorado company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>are to be operated' on the track's of the Wabash company, subject to the rules and regulations of the latter company so long as a train of the former company occupies the tracks of the latter company.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">It is objected that the details of the manner of the use of the right of way are not_set forth in paragraph 9 of the tripartite agreement, and that, therefore, a court of equity will not decree a specific performance. But, viewing the two agreements of August 11, 1875, as It single contract, the details as to the manner of use of the right of way are sufficiently furnished by agreement of the parties, for it is provided by the agreement of August 11, 1875, between the County company and the Kansas City company, not only that the latter company shall have the absolute and sole control of the starting, running and regulating of the time-tables of and for its own trains, -but also, that the matter of the relative times of the starting, coming in and running of the trains of the County company and of those of the Kansas City company shall be under the sole control and regulation of the latter company, its successors and assigns.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The case of <em>Texas &amp; Pacific Railway Co. </em>v. Marshall, 136 U. S. 393, is much relied upon by the appellants-; but the principle of that case does not apply to the present one. There, the court held that, if the railroad company was under a contract with the city of Marshall to keep there its principal office of business and its main machine shops and car works, it was much more consonant to justice that the injury suffered by the city should be compensated by a single judgment in an action at law; that there was no substantial difficulty in ascertaining such compensation ; and that, therefore, the city had a complete remedy at law. But in the present case, the remedy in damages by an action at law would be entirely inadequate, and nothing short of the interposition of a court of equity would provide for the exigencies of the situation. See, also, <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Northampton &amp;c. Railway Co., </em>L. R. 9 Ch. 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The decree of the Circuit Court is so framed as to execute itself. It finds that the rules and regulations now in force for the running of trains over the right of way and tracks of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Wabash company, and which are set forth in the record, are reasonable rules Nand regulations. So long as they are undisturbed, there is no occasion for the action or interposition of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">The fact that the railroads which are to be allowed, under paragraph 9 of the tripartite agreement, to .use the right of way through the park and up to the terminus in the city of St. Louis, are not named in that paragraph, is of no importance. <em>Wolverhampton Railway Co. </em>v. <em>London and North-western Railway, </em>L. R. 16 Eq. 433; <em>Express Cases, </em>117 U. S. 1; <em>Railway Co. v. Alling, </em>99 U. S. 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Railroads are common carriers and owe duties to the public. The rights of the public in respect to these great highways of communication should be fostered by the courts; and it is one of the most useful functions of a court of equity that its methods of procedure are capable of being made such as to accommodate themselves to the development of the interests of the public, in the progress of trade and traffic, by new methods of intercourse and transportation. The present case is a striking illustration. Here is a great public park, one of the lungs of an important city, which, in order to maintain its usefulness as a park, must be as free as possible from being serrated by railroads ;\u2022 and yet the interests of the public demand that it shall be crossed by a railroad. But the evil consequences of such crossing are to be reduced to a minimum by having a single right of way, and a single set of tracks, to be used by all the railroads which desire to cross the park. These two antagonisms must be reconciled, and that can be &lt;Jone only by the interposition of a court of equity, which thus will be exercising one of its most beneficent functions.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">As to the objection that there is no mutuality in the contract, and therefore it cannot be enforced, the Circuit Court says in its opinion: \u201c Asv to the objection on the ground of the want of mutuality in the contract, I think it of little force. The respondent has been paid for the privilege that is now claimed. The consideration,, as I have heretofore shown, was ample; and, when a party has received payment for a privilege, I do not think it can resist the enforcement of that privi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>lege on the mere ground that it cannot compel the other party to continue in its enjoyment.\u201d <em>We </em>concur in this view. Under the tripartite agreement, the right of way through the park was obtained by the Kansas Oity company, and, in consideration of the covenants contained in paragraph 9 and other paragraphs of that agreement, $40,000 were expended by the Park Commissioners in aid of the construction of the railroad through the park, upon the right of way granted. Things were to be done by each party for valuable considerations to be paid by one to. the other. .The Park Commissioners complied in all respects with the agreement. Although the one easement -was granted in consideration of the other, the appellants refused to permit the enjoyment of the easement which they granted. The want of mutuality is urged when the appellants are called upon to comply with the covenant which is valuable to the city of St. Louis and the public whom that city represents. . Such want of mutuality is alleged to consist-in the inability of the appellants to prevent other railroads which may use the right of way from discontinuing such use, and in the fact that the contract did not specify the period during which the other railroads should be required to use the right of way. But we think that there is no such want of mutuality as should interfere with the enforcement of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">It is insisted that the. County company had no power to bind itself to grant the use of its right of way east of the park. But the appellants do not occupy a position to insist upon that objection, so long as they themselves use the right of way which was granted, and enjoy'the benefit of the money which the Park Commissioners expended.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">The city of St. Louis is, fn the present case, not merely a nominal party, but is charged with the duty of protecting the park, and of preserving and fostering the commerce of the city. Both of those objects are clearly set forth in the tripartite agreement executed by the Park Commissioners, of whom the city of St. Louis is the successor; and the considerations thus arising are legitimate ones in a court of equity, the case being founded' upon the tripartite agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">\n<em>Deoree affirmed</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
