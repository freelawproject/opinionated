Defendant appealed as of right. In <em>People v Whitfield, </em>214 Mich App 348, 354-355; 543 NW2d 347 (1995), we found that defendant was denied effective assistance of counsel by his attorney\u2019s failure to appeal the probate court\u2019s decision to waive jurisdiction pursuant to MCL 712A.4(4); MSA 27.3178(598.4)(4). As a remedy, we remanded this matter to allow defendant to appeal in the circuit court the probate court\u2019s waiver decision. We retained jurisdiction. The circuit court affirmed the probate court\u2019s waiver decision, and we do likewise.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">When the probate court decided to waive its jurisdiction over defendant, MCL 712A.4(4); MSA 27.3178(598.4)(4) required it to consider six factors, \u201cgiving each weight as appropriate to the circumstances.\u201d These factors were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-6\">(a) The prior record and character of the child, his or her physical and mental maturity, and his or her pattern of living.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-7\">(b) The seriousness of the offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-8\">(c) Whether the offense is part of a repetitive pattern of offenses which would lead to 1 of the following determinations:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-9\">(i) The child is not amenable to treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-10\">(ii) That despite the child\u2019s potential for treatment, the nature of the child\u2019s delinquent behavior is likely to disrupt the rehabilitation of other children in the treatment program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-11\">(d) Whether, despite the child\u2019s potential for treatment, the nature of the child\u2019s delinquent behavior is likely to render the child dangerous to the public if released at the age of 19 or 21.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-12\">(e) Whether the child is more likely to be rehabilitated by the services and facilities available in adult programs and procedures than in juvenile programs and procedures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>(f) Whether it is in the best interests of the public welfare and the protection of the public security that the child stand trial as an adult offender. [MCL 712A.4(4); MSA 27.3178C598.4X4).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">We will affirm a probate court\u2019s waiver decision whenever the court\u2019s findings, based on substantial evidence and on thorough investigation, show either that the juvenile is not amenable to treatment, or, that despite his potential for treatment, the nature of his difficulty is likely to render him dangerous to the public if he were to be released at the age of nineteen or twenty-one, or to disrupt the rehabilitation of other children in the program before his release. <em>People v Dunbar, </em>423 Mich 380, 387; 377 NW2d 262 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Defendant argues that the probate court\u2019s findings regarding the statutory criteria were not supported by substantial evidence on the record. On review of the probate court\u2019s findings regarding each criteria, we reach a different conclusion than defendant and determine that the probate court\u2019s findings were supported by substantial evidence on the record. We affirm the probate court\u2019s decision to waive jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Concerning the first statutory criterion, the probate court found that defendant had only one prior informal contact with the juvenile system, but that his school record contained numerous instances of misconduct that evidenced a highly combative, assaultive character. Defendant had been disciplined on several occasions for acts of violence committed against fellow students. The probate court further found that defendant appeared more mature than his chronological age, but was emotionally immature. Defendant exhibited a poor pattern of living by repeatedly absenting himself from his parents\u2019 home for long periods without their permission and associating with negatively influential older persons. Further record evidence showed that defendant had committed a significant instance of misconduct at the juvenile home during his pretrial incarceration. We find ample evidence on the record to support the probate-court\u2019s conclusions regarding the first waiver criterion, and we further agree with the probate court\u2019s determination that its findings regarding the first statutory factor militated in favor of waiving jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Next, regarding the second factor, the probate court found that defendant had been charged with \u201csome of the most severe charges under the criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>laws of the State of Michigan.\u201d Defendant does not, and indeed cannot, argue with the accuracy of this finding. However, he advances that the probate court ultimately accorded this finding preemptive weight in reaching its decision to waive jurisdiction, which is not permissible. <em>Dunbar, supra </em>at 396. We do not agree that the probate court engaged in an improper weighing of the statutory criteria. It is clear from the entire record that the probate court arrived at its waiver decision after full consideration and weighing of the statutory criteria set forth in MCL 712A.4(4); MSA 27.3178(598.4)(4). The fact that the probate court may have accorded <em>significant </em>weight to the seriousness of defendant\u2019s heinous offenses is not grounds for reversal, because it was directed to weigh the statutory factors \u201cas appropriate to the circumstances.\u201d We simply do not require the probate court to give a neutral gloss to defendant\u2019s despicable acts where such neutrality was not required by the statute governing the waiver decision, and we further agree with the probate court that the seriousness of defendant\u2019s offenses weighed heavily in favor of waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">With regard to the fourth statutory factor,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the probate court found that despite defendant\u2019s amenability to treatment, the nature of his delinquent behavior was likely to render him a danger to the public if he were released from juvenile detention at the ages of nineteen or twenty-one. Substantial record evidence supported this finding. Three witnesses associated with the juvenile justice system opined that, in light of his marked behavioral difficulties, defendant would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>not receive adequate treatment in a juvenile facility by the time of his inevitable departure and would therefore pose a threat to public safety on his release. We find no basis on which to disturb these findings and agree with the probate court\u2019s conclusion that they favored waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Next, the probate court found that the fifth statutory factor, which considers whether the juvenile would more likely be rehabilitated by the services and facilities available in adult programs than in juvenile programs, weighed in favor of waiver. Particularly, Jean Hoffman, the supervisor of Ingham County Social Services, testified that a juvenile of defendant\u2019s age and behavioral disposition was not likely to be redeemed by the treatment method used in the juvenile system, especially because defendant would spend relatively little time in juvenile incarceration. The probate court\u2019s findings regarding factor five were supported on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Lastly, the probate court found that the best interests of the public welfare and security dictated that defendant stand trial as an adult. In light of the nature of defendant\u2019s offenses, his past behavioral problems, his continuing antisocial behavior, and the near inevitable failure of his treatment in the juvenile system, there is simply no basis on which to refute this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">After thoroughly reviewing the probate court\u2019s findings, we are not persuaded that its decision to waive jurisdiction over defendant was the product of mistake, an improper weighing of the statutory factors, or an erroneous view of the evidence presented at the waiver hearing. We. believe that waiver was appropriate under the circumstances, either because defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>ant was not amenable to treatment in the juvenile system or, despite his amenability to some form of rehabilitation, the nature of his assaultive, violent behavior was likely to render him a danger to the public if he were to be released at the age of nineteen or twenty-one.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b716-6\"> Effective January 1, 1997, this statute was amended. 1996 PA 262. The new statute directs the probate court to consider six criteria when making its waiver decision, and requires the probate court to give \u201cgreater weight to the seriousness of the alleged offense and the juvenile\u2019s prior record of delinquency than to the other criteria.\u201d The new criteria are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-7\">(a) The seriousness of the alleged offense in terms of community protection, including, but not limited to, the existence of any aggravating factors recognized by the sentencing guidelines, the use of a firearm or other dangerous weapon, and the impact on any victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-8\">(b) The culpability of the juvenile in committing the alleged offense, including, but not limited to, the level of the juvenile\u2019s participation in planning and carrying out the offense and the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors recognized by the sentencing guidelines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-9\">(c) The juvenile\u2019s prior record of delinquency including, but not limited to, any record of detention, any police record, any school record, or any other evidence indicating prior delinquent behavior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-10\">(d) The juvenile\u2019s programming history, including, but not limited to, the juvenile\u2019s past willingness to participate meaningfully in available programming.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-11\">(e) The adequacy of the punishment or programming available in the juvenile justice system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-12\">(f) The dispositional options available for the juvenile. [MCL 712A.4(4); MSA 27.3178(598.4)(4).]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b718-6\"> Defendant does not disagree with the probate court\u2019s findings regarding the third criterion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
