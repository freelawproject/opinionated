But the statute says \u201cas long as used . . . for public purposes\u201d and it is conceded there was, on the taxing date in question, no actual use for such purposes. Much violence must be done to the wording of the statute if the trustees\u2019 contention is to prevail. The argument is, in effect, that under the unusual circumstances of this particularly worthy case, it ought to be the law. But the exemption statute is to be strictly construed, and in this case even a most liberal construction does not attain the desired result. If the statute said \u201cused for public purposes\u201d there might be more force to the contention\u2014but it actually says, and means, \u201cused by the public for public purposes.\u201d Those three words \u201cby the pub' lie\u201d mean something and are decisive. Sympathy with the aims and purposes of this splendid project do not permit this Court to write into the statute something which is not there. As Chief Justice, Andrews said in <em>City of Hartford vs. Hartford Theological Seminary, </em>66 Conn. 475, 482: \u201cExemptions, no matter how meritorious, are of grace, and must be strictly construed. They embrace only what is strictly within their terms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-13\">An examination of our Connecticut cases reveals no case in point, but there are significant observations supporting my conclusion. Cases in other states cited by the plaintiff are governed by the statutes of those states.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-14\">Judgment is for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
