Phillips, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This matter is before the Court on the motion for Summary Judgment (the \"Motion\") filed by Plaintiff Terry Allen (\"Allen\" or \"Plaintiff\") pursuant to Rule 56(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. This adversary proceeding was commenced when Allen filed a complaint (the \"Complaint\") against the debtor, Richard W. Drake (\"Drake\" or the \"Debtor\"), requesting a determination that the judgment Allen obtained against Drake in the Second Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada (the \"District Court\") is nondischargeable pursuant to \u00a7 523(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6). Allen asks the Court to award summary judgment in his favor because of the preclusive effect of the Nevada judgment. For the reasons stated below, the Court will deny the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The state court litigation that preceded Drake's bankruptcy filing concerned Hotel Contracting Services, Inc. (\"HCS\"), a business in which Drake, Allen and others were all, at one time, shareholders, officers and directors. The debt that Allen seeks to be held nondischargeable arose from a suit filed by Drake in the Second Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (the \"Nevada Action\") against Allen and Stuart and Kitty Burns (the \"Burns\") (jointly \"the HCS Defendants\"), alleging various contract and tort causes of action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Allen moved to dismiss the Nevada Action\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   for failure to state a claim, based upon Nevada's anti-SLAPP statute\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Rule 12(b)(5) of the Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure. The District Court granted Allen's motion, dismissing Drake's causes of action for failure to state a claim but denying Allen relief under the anti-SLAPP statute and rejecting his claim for attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On appeal, the Nevada Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of the Nevada Action and found that certain of Drake's asserted causes of action violated Nevada's anti-SLAPP statute. It held that the District Court should have granted Allen's anti-SLAPP motion and entered an order remanding the case to the District Court to consider Allen's request for attorney's fees (the \" Remand Order\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On remand, the District Court entered an order awarding Allen $51,409.89 in attorney's fees, costs and damages allowable under state law in connection with an anti-SLAPP violation (the \"Judgment Order\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 25, 2017, Drake filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case (Case No. 17-10253-(KHK) ) in this Court. Allen timely filed the Complaint on February 15, 2017, Drake filed his answer on March 10, 2017, and Allen filed the Motion to dismiss the Complaint on June 15, 2017. The Debtor responded to the Motion, and the parties have submitted memoranda. The Court heard oral argument on the Motion on September 18, 2017, after which it took the matter under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Undisputed Facts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Rule 56(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Fed.

P. 56(c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Allen maintains that the facts compelling the Court to rule that his claim is nondischargeable pursuant to \u00a7 523(a)(6) are established by the six exhibits attached to the memorandum accompanying the Motion (the \"Memorandum\"). These exhibits include the Remand Order and the Judgment Order, proof of domestication of the Judgment Order in Virginia, pleadings from the Nevada Action, and the Debtor's response to Allen's interrogatories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In his response to the Motion, the Debtor challenges Allen's exhibits on evidentiary and procedural grounds, asserting that the exhibits are not properly authenticated, include hearsay, and cannot be considered because they were not attached to the Complaint or identified in the Plaintiff's Rule 7026 disclosures.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In particular, the Debtor objects to the Court's consideration of the two Nevada court orders-the Remand Order entered by the Nevada Supreme Court (attached to the Memorandum as Exhibit B) and the Judgment Order entered by the District Court upon remand (attached to the Memorandum as Exhibit A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Notably, the Debtor does not contend that the documents are not what they purport to be, contain any inaccuracies or omissions, or are unable to be presented in a form that would be admissible in evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rule 56(c) allows the movant to cite \"materials in the record, including depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials ....\" There is nothing in Rule 56 limiting a court to consideration of only materials submitted simultaneously with the complaint,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   nor is a court prohibited from considering materials that were not included in a Rule 26 disclosure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the Debtor has not objected to the List of Exhibits filed by the Plaintiff on July 10, 2017, which includes the exhibits attached to the Memorandum. Under the Court's Initial Scheduling Order (Doc. 4), these exhibits are deemed admitted. The Court may therefore properly consider and rely upon each of the exhibits attached to the Memorandum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The evidence in the record, submitted in accordance with Rule 56(c) and considered in the light most favorable to the Debtor (the non-moving party), establishes the following. On October 13, 2015, the District Court entered the Judgment Order. The Judgment Order references and is based upon the Remand Order, which held that the Debtor violated the Nevada anti-SLAPP law, a statute designed to prevent meritless lawsuits instituted to prevent the exercise of First Amendment rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   Remand Order resulted in part from Allen's appeal of the District Court's initial denial of his anti-SLAPP motion to dismiss. On appeal, the Nevada Supreme Court found that certain of the Debtor's causes of action against Allen were \"based on Allen's 'good faith communication in furtherance of the right to petition' because they are based on the filing of the [Allen] complaint.\" Remand Order at 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   It\n   held that the District Court should have granted Allen's anti-SLAPP motion as to those causes of action and remanded the case to the District Court \"for consideration of Allen's request for attorney fees and costs under NRS 41.670.\" Remand Order at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On remand, the District Court entered the Judgment Order, awarding Allen $45,841.00 in attorneys' fees, $753.52 in costs, $3,138.77 in additional costs and $1,676.60 pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Nev.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2041.670\">\n    Nev.

Allen may therefore proceed on summary judgment if he carries the burden of demonstrating that each of the necessary elements of collateral estoppel has been met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Here, the Judgment Order and the Remand Order are final on the merits, and the parties in dispute are the same as in the prior litigation. What is left to be resolved is whether the issues previously decided were actually litigated and are identical to the issues that must now be decided. More specifically, in order to apply collateral estoppel, this Court must find that the parties actually litigated the issues and that the Nevada courts determined that the Debtor caused an injury to Allen by acting willfully and maliciously.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The thrust of Allen's argument is that the Nevada Supreme Court's finding that his anti-SLAPP motion should have been granted is sufficient to establish the elements of \u00a7 523(a)(6). Allen urges this Court to interpret the Nevada Supreme Court's ruling as a finding that the Debtor's suit was meritless, was filed solely to increase his litigation costs, and was therefore willful and malicious. This contention is apparently based solely on the Nevada Supreme Court's comment in\n   <em>\n    John v. Douglas County School District\n   </em>\n   that \"[t]he hallmark of a SLAPP lawsuit is that it is filed to obtain a financial advantage over one's adversary by increasing litigation costs until the adversary's case is weakened or abandoned.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3710318\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/125/746/\">\n    125 Nev. 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3710318\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/125/746/\">\n    219 P.3d 1276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1280 (2009). He further maintains that the injury caused by the Debtor has been established by the damages awarded in the Judgment Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Allen has cited no instance in which a court has applied \u00a7 523(a)(6) to deny the discharge of a debt arising as a result of a creditor's successful anti-SLAPP motion. Although circumstances may exist in which such a debt may be excepted from discharge, it does not necessarily follow that any successful anti-SLAPP motion proves that the underlying litigation was filed vexatiously and with the actual intent to cause an injury to the other party. Therefore, the Court is unwilling to adopt a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   rule that a claim for damages awarded in connection with any anti-SLAPP motion is nondischargeable pursuant to \u00a7 523(a)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In this case, Allen has not established by a preponderance of the evidence that that the parties litigated and the state courts determined that the Debtor's actions were willful and malicious. Even if the Court were to find that the Debtor injured Allen, collateral estoppel does not bar the Debtor from litigating the dischargeability of Allen's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Although its anti-SLAPP statute may have been intended by the Nevada legislature to discourage lawsuits that \"abuse the judicial process by chilling, intimidating, and punishing individuals for\n   their involvement in public affairs,\" and to protect citizens' and public officials' \"ability to openly engage in discussions of public concern,\"\n   <em>\n    John v.

Dismissal was apparently warranted under the language of the statute, but the Nevada Supreme Court made no finding that the Debtor engaged in the type of bad faith that the Nevada legislature apparently envisioned when it enacted the statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Likewise, the Judgment Order includes no findings of willfulness and maliciousness on the part of the Debtor.

Additionally, Allen has not shown that the Nevada courts made a finding that the Debtor's lawsuit was pursued with a knowing disregard for Allen's rights. The Nevada Supreme Court's decision was accompanied only by the finding that the Debtor's claims against Allen lacked a probability of success because they challenged Allen's attempt to dissolve HCS, relief that Allen was entitled to pursue under Nevada law. Remand Order at 4. The decisions of the state courts do not include the legal and factual findings necessary to establish the elements required to successfully prevail on an objection to discharge under \u00a7 523(a)(6) and, therefore, the Court finds that the Debtor is not collaterally estopped\n   from litigating these issues in this adversary proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   For these reasons, the Motion has been denied and a separate order has been issued.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    <em>\n     Drake v.
