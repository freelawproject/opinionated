N.D. Ill. 2011) (Goldgar, J.) (recognizing same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Prior to the commencement of the Case, the Debtor's business consisted of the distribution of stainless steel products to various manufacturers. When the Debtor's financial condition began to deteriorate, the Debtor's board of directors approved the Assignment Agreement,\n   commencing an Illinois assignment for the benefit of creditors through which the Assignee was duly appointed to liquidate the assets of the Debtor (the \"\n   <em>\n    ABC\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On or about November 11, 2016, Katten was engaged by the Assignee under a general retainer in the amount of $155,000.00\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (the \"\n   <em>\n    Retainer\n   </em>\n   \") to provide legal assistance regarding the Assignee's duties. Among the services with which Katten assisted were settlements with creditors and an auctioning of the Debtor's equipment on February 2, 2017 (the \"\n   <em>\n    Auction\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On February 3, 2017 (the \"\n   <em>\n    Petition Date\n   </em>\n   \"), one day after the Auction but prior to the consummation of the sale under the Auction (the \"\n   <em>\n    Sale\n   </em>\n   \"), certain creditors of the Debtor commenced an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding against the Debtor under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Timed as it was, the petition prevented the Sale from being concluded, leaving the Assignee in limbo. Further, the petitioning creditors sought no first-day relief from the court to clarify this situation. Through Katten, the Assignee attempted to obtain instructions from the Debtor regarding the turnover of the Debtor's property in the Assignee's possession (the \"\n   <em>\n    Assets\n   </em>\n   \"), but the Debtor did not wish to actively participate in the bankruptcy. As a result, the Assignee remained in possession of the Debtor's property, and in light of the Sale and the continuing duties of the Assignee under the ABC, Katten promptly filed the 543 Motion seeking on behalf of the Assignee guidance from the bankruptcy court on how to proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On February 9, 2017, the court conducted a hearing on the 543 Motion at which the Assignee, Katten and the petitioning creditors were present and at which no party contested the Assignee's continuing possession of the Assets. The Debtor, through counsel, also appeared but took no position on the matters. As a result, the court entered the 543 Order, which directed the Assignee to remain in possession of the Assets and continue to administer them in accordance with prepetition agreements and the Sale. The 543 Order also relieved the Assignee of the requirements imposed by section 543(a) and (b) of the Bankruptcy Code. Though the 543 Order was of limited duration, additional orders under section 543 were subsequently granted throughout the chapter 11 proceedings, preserving the effects of the 543 Order up until the appointment of the Trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On February 28, 2017, there being no contest and the Petition having been raised, the Order for Relief was granted. Nonetheless, without the participation of the Debtor, the case continued to founder. On March 7, 2017, the court entered the Conversion Order, converting the Case from a proceeding under chapter 11 to a proceeding under chapter 7 (the \"\n   <em>\n    Conversion\n   </em>\n   \"). The Trustee was thereafter appointed\n   on March 16, 2017. After the Conversion, Katten continued to render legal services to the Assignee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On September 1, 2017, the Assignee filed the Application, initially seeking four forms of relief. First, the Assignee sought to allow Katten an administrative expense representing the amount due prior to the Petition Date and to allow Katten to withdraw that value from the Retainer. Though Katten's services for that period were not presented with any degree of particularity in the Application, the request for reimbursement for work performed prior to the Petition Date and the application of the Retainer to the same were not contested by the Trustee. Second, the Assignee sought compensation for services rendered by Katten for services performed between February 3, 2017, and June 27, 2017 (the \"\n   <em>\n    Statement Period\n   </em>\n   \"). The Assignee requested an administrative expense for Katten's services during the Statement Period under sections 503 and 543 of the Bankruptcy Code. Third, the Assignee sought authorization for Katten to apply the remaining balance of the Retainer to that owed for Katten's services during the Statement Period. Last, the Assignee sought an administrative expense and court authority for the Trustee to pay Katten the remaining amount owed to Katten after application of the Retainer to the amounts owed for the Statement Period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On October 13, 2017, the Trustee filed the Response opposing the last three requests. On October 27, 2017, the Assignee filed the Reply in support of those requests. Further, without leave of the court, the Assignee filed the Supplement on November 28, 2017, to correct for inaccuracies made in the Application for Katten's incurred fees. In the Supplement, the Assignee also noted that Katten incurred additional costs for services provided to the Assignee since the initial filing of the Application. The Assignee has not filed a final application that reflects a calculation and request for compensation of those additional costs and services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   At the Hearing on the Application, at which counsel for the Assignee and the Trustee argued in support of their respective positions, the court stated that it would narrow its analysis to the legal issue of whether or not the Assignee was entitled to an administrative expense. The court also instructed the parties that only after that determination, if necessary, the court would conduct a further hearing on the quantification of the expenses. Upon review of the record of this matter, the court finds no other hearing necessary and this Memorandum Decision and accompanying order fully conclude the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   This matter is fundamentally about the treatment of administrative expenses of custodians and their counsel. The custodian in the Case, the Assignee, seeks an administrative expense for its counsel, Katten, under alternative theories based in section 503(b)(1), section 503(b)(3), section 503(b)(4) and section 543 of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Trustee has objected to the Application raising what are in essence four points of contention. First, the Trustee contends that Katten may not be allowed an administrative expense as it was required to seek approval from the court to render legal services to the Assignee. Second, the Trustee contends that administrative expenses under section 503 are limited to claims for prepetition services. Third, the Trustee contends that the services were unreasonable and not sufficiently described, resulting in vague, duplicative and excessive time entries. Last, the Trustee contends that Katten's services in preparing and\n   defending the Assignee Application were unreasonable and should be reduced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Before taking up the Trustee's objections, it is necessary to first determine which of the Assignee's alternative statutory arguments carries the day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Applicable Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   It is not contested that the Assignee was a \"custodian\" as defined in the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11)(B) (an \"assignee under a general assignment for the benefit of the debtor's creditors\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   As a custodian, the Assignee previously sought and was awarded an administrative expense under section 503(b)(3)(E).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Assignee Award. Administrative expenses under section 503(b)(3)(E) are reserved for custodians, and recently this court discussed the nuances of that section in an unrelated case.\n   <em>\n    In re Montemurro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415004\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/581/565/#p578\">\n    581 B.R. 565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 578-79 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 2018) (Barnes, J.). The court has also addressed recently the eligibility of a party to whom a custodian has become obligated to seek an administrative expense thereunder.\n   <em>\n    In re Stainless Sales Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269018\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/579/836/#p841\">\n    579 B.R. 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 841 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 2017) (\"\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Stainless I\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Katten is not a custodian, however, but rather counsel rendering services to a custodian. Katten is therefore not eligible for an administrative expense under section 503(b)(3)(E).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Stainless I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269018\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/579/836/#p841\">\n    579 B.R. at 842\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The better reading of section 503(b)(3) is that such expenses are for the named parties alone ....\"). Katten may, however, be eligible to be compensated under section 543(c)(1) (as a party to whom the Assignee has become obligated), section 543(c)(2) (as a cost or expense of the Assignee) or under section 503(b)(4) (as an administrative expense of a professional serving a party with an expense under section 503(b)(3) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The first, section 543(c)(1), appears to be implicated on its face. Section 543(c)(1) states that the court shall \"protect all entities to which a custodian has become obligated with respect to such property or proceeds, product, offspring, rents, or profits of such property.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20543\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1). Katten appears to be such an entity. Unlike section 503(b), section 543 does not include a separate provision for the payment of a custodian's professionals.

It is well established that section 327 only applies to trustees and debtors when acting in a trustee's stead. That is due to the express language in section 327 making it applicable to trustees and, as applicable, the language of other Bankruptcy Code provisions bestowing the rights and obligations of trustees on debtors.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201107\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

The court will follow it in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In doing so, the court takes into account the rarity of this situation. The Assignee and Katten have seen this case through a number of unique and potentially legally-distinct phases. This case began with an involuntary petition timed, so it appears, to occur at the most disruptive possible point in the Assignee's tenure-immediately following the Auction, before the underlying Sale could be consummated. Once the Petition was filed, the Assignee and Katten were forced to consider how to comply with section 543 in what was obviously a grey period and determine what, if anything, should be done about the interrupted Sale. The entry of the 543 Order alleviated some of those concerns, but once\n   again, after the Conversion but before the Trustee was appointed, another grey period arose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The first of these grey periods arose out of the unique combination of this being an involuntary chapter 11 filed to interrupt the ABC and there being little or no participation in the Case by the Debtor. Given the Debtor's lack of interest in the Case, the Case was in desperate need of an interim trustee. No provision for that exists for involuntary chapter 11 cases, however.\n   <em>\n    But see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20303\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) (allowing for an interim trustee to be appointed before the entry of an order for relief in an involuntary chapter 7). Instead, there was no party to protect the Assets other than the Assignee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Assignee moved promptly for guidance from the court, but even then was forced to do so on an interim basis given that no order for relief had been granted and thus the Debtor's rights were still nebulous. Section 543 gives no guidance as to how it should apply in such cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The entry of the Order for Relief and subsequent orders under section 543 may have provided some degree of additional certainty, but on the same day the Order for Relief was entered, the petitioning creditors moved for the appointment of a trustee and a secured creditor moved for an order converting the case to one under chapter 7. Though the Conversion was ultimately ordered, it occurred more than a month after the Petition Date. During this period, the Assignee was forced to maintain the Assets and, by order of the court, consummate the Sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The second grey period is of similar, though shorter nature, but occurred after the Conversion but before the Trustee was appointed. While the United States Trustee appointed a trustee on the day following the conversion, that trustee resigned. It was nine days after the Conversion that the Trustee took on his role. While it could be argued that the Conversion terminated the excuse from compliance permitted by the 543 Order, the Assignee was again left in the uncomfortable position of being the custodian of the Assets with no clear avenue to follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Following the appointment of the Trustee, all that remained for the Assignee was to turnover the remaining Assets and make an accounting for its actions. A custodian may be compensated for those actions.\n   <em>\n    Kenval Mktg.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6096538\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/84/32/#p34\">\n    84 B.R. at 35-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Should Katten seek the authority of the court to apply the Retainer to prepetition expenses, it must meet this standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   That said, even under this more expansive view, Katten's application costs are extraordinary. As part of the Application, Katten submitted Invoice No. 1301396983 in the amount of $22,042.50. This invoice is entirely spent on matters relating to compilation and submission of the Assignee Application. Excluding this amount from the total Application and excluding unsupported prepetition and post-Application fees, the total amount applied for by Katten is $60,682.50, resulting in a 36% application cost. This is beyond what the court may allow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Under the circumstances, the court will expand the traditional 3-5% set forth in the cases above to 10%, but no more. Ten percent of $60,682.50. The court will therefore allow the fees sought in Invoice No. 1301396983 in the amount of $6,068.25.

The court has reviewed the time entries and expenses in light of the applicable standards under section 503(b)(4) set forth above and the normal rules of compensation of this District, and finds the following reductions to apply:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   As for services, a small amount of time (2.6 hours @ $375.00/hour) was either purely clerical in nature or of no benefit to the client. In addition, an even smaller amount of time was billed for a consultation in excess of the other party's time entries for the same consultation (0.2 hours @ $790.00/hour). As such, the court finds that $1,133.00 of the services rendered are not reasonable. The remainder will be allowed. As for expenses, multiple taxis were charged to attend court hearings approximately seven blocks from Katten's offices ($42.00). In the absence of further substantiation of the need for those taxi expenses are unnecessary and thus are disallowed. The remainder will be allowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   As a result, the court allows as reasonable compensation $51,025.00 for services and $547.09 for actual, necessary expenses for this period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   (b)\n   <em>\n    Katten's Chapter 7 Services and Expenses\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The Assignee has sought $8,524.50 for Katten's services and $3,141.74 for Katten's expenses in the chapter 7 case, from the entry of the Conversion Order on March 7, 2017 to the filing of the Application on September 1, 2017. The court has reviewed the time entries and expenses in light of the applicable standards under section 503(b)(4) set forth above and the normal rules of compensation of this District, and finds the following reductions to apply:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   As for services, the court finds the entire amount to be reasonable. The requested amount will be allowed. As for expenses, Katten mailed on June 22, 2017 a total of 255 items by certified mail, without any description of the need for certified mail as opposed to regular United States mail. The standard compensable mail costs for regular United States mail by meter is $0.47/letter. As a result, the court will reduce the requested $2,145.38 for certified mail costs to an allowed expense of $119.85 (255 items @ $0.47). The result is\n   a reduction of $2,025.53. The remainder will be allowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   As a result, the court allows as reasonable compensation $8,524.50 for services and $1,116.21 for actual, necessary expenses for this period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   In conclusion, the Application is approved and Katten's fees and expenses are allowed in the manner discussed above.
