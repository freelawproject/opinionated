It is the propriety of those facts that is at issue in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Schaller is the founder, president and sole owner of the Schaller Law Firm (the \"\n   <em>\n    Schaller Firm\n   </em>\n   \"). The Schaller Firm primarily represents consumers in bankruptcy matters. In that role, it marketed its services to clients who were facing sheriff sales of their homes. The U.S. Trustee takes issue with the Schaller Firm's practice in handling these cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Most notably, the U.S. Trustee condemns what it refers to as Schaller's surrender method (the \"\n   <em>\n    Surrender Method\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Surrender Method is where Schaller targets individuals struggling to keep their homes, in many cases known to Schaller because of pending, public foreclosure actions. If an individual responds to Schaller's marketing efforts and hires Schaller, Schaller commences a chapter 13 bankruptcy case on the client's behalf. In such a case, the client, now a debtor in bankruptcy, is obligated to propose a plan of repayment that treats all of the debtor's assets and liabilities, yet Schaller customarily proposes a plan that does not address the mortgage obligation or provide for the surrender of the debtor's home. Only when forced to do so does Schaller modify the deficient plan to address the home, in most cases surrendering the home to the mortgage holder. In taking on these representations, Schaller causes each the debtor to sign an agreement that the debtor will attempt a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   modification of the mortgage without Schaller's assistance and further acknowledges that, if the debtor is unable to get the modification, the Schaller Firm will acquiesce to a motion seeking to lift the automatic stay on the debtor's home when brought by the mortgage holder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The U.S. Trustee maintains that the goal of the Surrender Method is to achieve, by application of the automatic stay, enough delay so that a debtor can make enough plan payments for Schaller to collect a fee, but not to legitimately reorganize the debtor's obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In the Case at bar, in 2015, the Debtor was facing an upcoming sheriff sale of his home located at 3419 N. Kedzie Avenue, Chicago, IL 60618 (the \"\n   <em>\n    Kedzie Property\n   </em>\n   \"). The Debtor also owned another property located at 5944 W. 64th Street, Chicago IL 60638 (the \"\n   <em>\n    64th Street Property\n   </em>\n   \"). The Kedzie Property was scheduled to be sold via foreclosure sale on February 20, 2015 and, as a result, Schaller sent to the Debtor what appears to be one of his standard solicitation mailings. In response, the Debtor requested that the Schaller Firm file for chapter 13 bankruptcy relief on his behalf and, in so doing, became one of Schaller's Surrender Method clients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Schaller Firm filed the Debtor's first voluntary petition for relief under chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code on February 13, 2015 (\"\n   <em>\n    Tabor I\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Attorney Michael Oreluk (\"\n   <em>\n    Oreluk\n   </em>\n   \"), an associate with the Schaller Firm, signed the Tabor I petition and submitted the case using his Case Management/Electronic Case File (\"\n   <em>\n    CM/ECF\n   </em>\n   \") account. In Tabor I, however, neither Schaller nor Oreluk nor any other attorney from the Schaller Firm filed the required chapter 13 plan on the Debtor's behalf. As a result, the chapter 13 trustee moved for and received dismissal of the Tabor I case for failure to file a plan on June 03, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   It does not appear that\n   anyone from the Schaller Firm contested the dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In Tabor I, a court-approved retention agreement (\"\n   <em>\n    CARA\n   </em>\n   \"),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Local Form 23c, and application for compensation were filed with Oreluk's signature,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   indicating that the Debtor paid $1,000.00 plus filing expenses in advance of the Schaller Firm filing the case. In the application, Oreluk sought compensation to be paid to the Schaller Firm, not to himself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Attorney's Application for Compensation Representing Chapter 13 Debtor(s) [Tabor I, Dkt. No. 13] and proposed order thereto [Tabor I, Dkt. No. 13-3]. The Schaller Firm's overall request for compensation was in the amount of $4,000.00. Upon the dismissal of Tabor I, Judge Schmetterer entered an order granting the Schaller Firm's application for compensation insofar as funds held by the chapter 13 trustee. As a result, the chapter 13 trustee disbursed another $2,432.70 of funds paid by the Debtor. The Schaller Firm therefore received $3,432.70 in total compensation for Tabor I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Two months after the dismissal of Tabor I, the Schaller Firm again contacted the Debtor, sending him correspondence advising him that filing a bankruptcy case would stop any potential sheriff sale. While the Debtor was hesitant to file a second case, after the Debtor spoke to Schaller, he consented. On August 3, 2015, the Schaller Firm filed a second petition for relief under chapter 13 on behalf of the Debtor, commencing this Case (\"\n   <em>\n    Tabor II\n   </em>\n   \"). Oreluk signed the Tabor II petition and all documents associated with the Case on the Debtor's behalf and filed the Case using his CM/ECF account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The schedules in Tabor II [Dkt. No. 11] (the \"\n   <em>\n    Schedules\n   </em>\n   \") were filed on August 17, 2015, reflecting $1,268,380.27 in secured claims and $80,218.39 in general unsecured claims. On that same date, the Debtor's chapter 13 plan [Dkt. No. 9] (the \"\n   <em>\n    Plan\n   </em>\n   \") was filed. The Plan provided that the Debtor would pay $600.00 per month for 60 months towards his debts. Out of that payment, the Schaller Firm's fees, one priority unsecured claim and the chapter 13 trustee's fees would be paid first, with the remainder going to the Debtor's general unsecured creditors. The Plan included no payments on account of the Kedzie Property or the 64th Street Property. Instead, the Plan included an express provision in the special terms section requesting that the chapter 13 trustee make no payments to JPMorgan Chase, the mortgage holder on the Kedzie Property. Plan, at \u00b6 G(2). It was silent as to the treatment of Sun West Mortgage Company, Inc., the reverse mortgage holder on the 64th Street Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The chapter 13 trustee subsequently filed a motion to dismiss Tabor II based on the Debtor's failure to begin Plan payments and ineligibility for chapter 13 relief under section 109(e) of the Bankruptcy Code. Motion to Dismiss for Unreasonable Delay [Dkt. No. 19]. The request for dismissal was not contested and was granted at the first hearing thereon on, September 23, 2015. Order Dismissing Case for Unreasonable Delay [Dkt. No. 20].\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In Tabor II, a CARA was again filed indicating that the Debtor paid $1,000.00 plus filing expenses in advance of the Schaller Firm filing the case. The Schaller Firm did not, however, file an application for compensation. Upon the dismissal of Tabor II, therefore, no further compensation was ordered. As a result, the Schaller Firm received $1,000.00 in total compensation for the Case, a case pending for 51 days, bringing Schaller's total received compensation for Tabor I and Tabor II to $4,432.70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   While the Case was thereafter closed, it was reopened by the U.S. Trustee to bring the Motion at bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The U.S. Trustee alleges in its Motion that the legal representation provided to the Debtor was deficient and that this deficiency was typical of the legal services offered by the Schaller Firm. More specifically, the U.S. Trustee alleges that Schaller counseled the Debtor to file for chapter 13 relief knowing that he did not qualify under the Bankruptcy Code. The U.S. Trustee also contends that the Schaller Firm filed inaccurate, prefabricated schedules in both of the Debtor's cases, a common practice of the Schaller Firm. Last, the U.S. Trustee asserts that the Plan proposed on behalf of the Debtor in this Case was flawed and certain to fail because of the Debtor's financial circumstances. All of this, the U.S. Trustee alleges, was done more to benefit Schaller financially than to genuinely assist the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   RELIEF REQUESTED\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The matter before the court is complex and has consumed much of the court's limited resources. Too often and with increasing frequency, the court must take its focus off of the substantive matters before it and turn instead to issues of attorney behavior.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Gilliam\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 17bk18368,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12421068\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/582/459/#p469\">\n    582 B.R. 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 469-70,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201582481\">\n    2018 WL 1582481\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. Mar. 28, 2018) (Barnes, J.) (ruling on over 50 cases wherein attorney behavior with respect to compensation was challenged).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Some of the complexity in this matter stems from the U.S. Trustee's management of its case against Schaller. Originally, the U.S. Trustee sought to have this court proceed against Schaller as a disciplinary matter under Rule 9029-4B (the \"\n   <em>\n    Bankruptcy Court Disciplinary Rules\n   </em>\n   \")\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the Local Rules for the United States Bankruptcy Court of the Northern District of Illinois. The request was insufficiently pled, however, and was returned to the U.S. Trustee to be corrected. Instead, the U.S. Trustee forwent the collective process and filed individual motions for sanctions in many of the cases in which Schaller was counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Despite the fact that these motions are filed in individual cases, the U.S. Trustee appears to seek a finding in this Case with respect to Schaller's practices generally. The focus in this individual sanction proceeding is, however, on the facts of the Case at bar. This leaves the court to bring the focus back to the facts of this Case, looking to general practices when such practices help understand behavior in this Case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Another complication-and not a small one-is that neither the U.S. Trustee nor\n   Schaller called the Debtor as a witness in the Trial (defined\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   ). At the Trial, it was explained that the Debtor was elderly and ill and thus coming to the Trial would have been too stressful. Tr. at p. 12, Nov. 6, 2017. However, no attempt was made to admit the Debtor's testimony in his absence.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Fed. R. Evid. 804. Thus, many questions regarding the Debtor's complicity in the conduct at bar went unanswered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Further complicating the presentation of issues is the manner in which the U.S. Trustee has sought relief in this Case. For example, in the Motion, the U.S. Trustee did not enumerate \"claims\"\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   . That nomenclature was not put into use until the U.S. Trustee's Pretrial Statement. The United States Trustee's Pretrial Statement [Dkt. No. 76] (the \"\n   <em>\n    U.S. Trustee's Pretrial Statement\n   </em>\n   \"), however, sets forth six claims (the \"\n   <em>\n    Claims\n   </em>\n   \"). These Claims are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Claim 1\n   </em>\n   : \"Robert Schaller caused Elton Tabor to be counseled to file Chapter 13, as opposed to Chapter 7, for the primary purpose of furthering Robert Schaller's pecuniary interests. Facing foreclosure of his home in February 2015, and again in July 2015, Mr. Tabor responded to one of Robert Schaller's letters by turning to the Schaller Law Firm for help. Although Mr. Tabor lacked the financial resources to save his home through Chapter 13 bankruptcy, and although he was not even eligible to be a Chapter 13 debtor due to the debt limits, Robert Schaller filed two Chapter 13 petitions on his behalf.\" U.S. Trustee's Pretrial Stmt., at p. 1.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Claim 2\n   </em>\n   : \"Robert Schaller advertised to financially desperate and vulnerable potential clients that he knew to be on the precipice of losing their homes, including Elton Tabor, and made misleading and illusory claims in such advertisements, including the premise of a 'DEADLINE TO SAVE YOUR HOME.' In fact, when Robert Schaller sent such advertisements to Mr. Tabor and others, he had no intention of 'saving' their homes. Robert Schaller's intention was to propose and confirm a Chapter 13 plan that either did not address the mortgage obligations, or provided for the surrender of the home. This is what is known as Schaller's 'Surrender Method' Chapter 13 case. The practical purpose of the Surrender Method is to achieve enough delay with the automatic stay so that sufficient payments can be made for the Trustee to disburse to Robert Schaller for an attorney fee. The theoretical idea is that the client will negotiate,\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , a modification of their home loan. Although Robert Schaller almost always uses the Court-Approved Retention Agreement in Surrender Method cases, and although he is fully aware that Paragraph 16 has been interpreted to include negotiations with secured lenders, he often causes Surrender Method clients to execute side agreements absolving him of any responsibility concerning the mortgage modification component of the approach he counsels. In other words, Schaller markets to prospective clients facing a challenge with a particular debt (their home mortgage); prospective clients seek Schaller's assistance in dealing with that challenge, and Schaller sells a substantial number of prospective clients a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case that proposes to resolve all debts\n   <em>\n    except the one that led them to him in the first place.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 1-2 (footnote omitted).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Claim 3\n   </em>\n   : \"The Chapter 13 plan prepared and filed for Elton Tabor in Case No. 16-26544 was filed in bad faith.

Schaller argued in Motion\n   <em>\n    in Limine\n   </em>\n   I that the motion for sanctions that he previously tendered to the U.S. Trustee but did not file with the court should be barred because it lacks relevance. Schaller's evidentiary objection, in the context of Motion\n   <em>\n    in Limine\n   </em>\n   I, was at its basis a challenge to the relevance of the evidence to the questions before the court. Federal Rule of Evidence 403 affords the court the authority to \"exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or more of the following: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.\" Fed.

Cir. 2005). As such, the court declined at the outset of the Trial to exclude the unfiled motion for sanctions, but instead, as with all exhibits, reserved its ruling on the questions of relevance and weight pending the presentation at the Trial. Now, given the court's understanding of the underlying substantive issues and the evidence presented at the Trial, the court finds Schaller's motion for sanctions of little or no probative value and declines to consider it in rendering a decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Motion\n   <em>\n    in Limine\n   </em>\n   I also sought to bar evidence of Claim 6 as asserted in the U.S. Trustee's Pretrial Statement. Claim 6 states, in pertinent part, that Schaller has\n   refused to acknowledge deficiencies in his practice and conduct which could be categorized as predatory and dishonest. Claim 6 was not included in the relief sought in the original Motion, appearing instead for the first time in the U.S. Trustee's Pretrial Statement. Because this Claim was not included in the Motion, Schaller argues that he would be prejudiced by having to defend against it after the close of discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The proper procedure for asserting new claims after the close of discovery is to file a motion requesting leave to amend the operative pleading. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15 ;\n   <em>\n    Dubicz v. Commonwealth Edison Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9215184\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/377/787/#p792\">\n    377 F.3d 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 792 (7th Cir. 2004). The risk of prejudice in doing otherwise is too great. While this Claim might have relevance, to have it considered the U.S. Trustee must have presented it in its original Motion or, at the very least, in time for Schaller to have had an opportunity to respond. The court therefore granted Schaller's request to bar Claim 6 and instructed the U.S. Trustee that it would decline to rule on Claim 6. The court will only enter relief as requested in the Motion and, as previously held, will weigh the relevance of evidence if presented for a proper purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Schaller's Motion\n   <em>\n    in Limine\n   </em>\n   II sought to bar evidence regarding Claims 2, 4 and 5 in the U.S. Trustee's Pretrial Statement. Schaller asserted that the doctrine of collateral estoppel barred these Claims. Specifically, Schaller alleged that when the bankruptcy judges in this court declined to initiate a collective disciplinary action against him for allegations under the Bankruptcy Court Disciplinary Rules, that decision was an adjudication on the merits of the Motion in this Case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The court determined that this argument lacked merit as Schaller did not establish the collateral estoppel elements. Collateral estoppel has the following required elements: \"1) the issue sought to be precluded must be the same as that involved in the prior action, 2) the issue must have been actually litigated, 3) the determination of the issue must have been essential to the final judgment, and 4) the party against whom estoppel is invoked must be fully represented in the prior action.\"\n   <em>\n    Klingman v. Levinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1768056,6544657\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/831/1292/\">\n    831 F.2d 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1295 (7th Cir. 1987).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Collateral estoppel is inapplicable because none of these elements is satisfied. Most importantly, there was no final judgment on the merits in a former suit; in fact, there was no judgment at all. As noted earlier, the U.S. Trustee's complaint of misconduct was deemed insufficiently pled and the matter was returned to the U.S. Trustee to be corrected. While that did not happen, the opportunity to correct the complaint remains. For these reasons, Schaller's request to apply collateral estoppel was denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Through Motions\n   <em>\n    in Limine\n   </em>\n   II, III and IV Schaller sought to bar evidence from cases that he has filed for other debtors. Schaller argued that Judge Hollis's prior rulings in this Case held that the evidence mentioned was not proper and limited the scope of the Trial to the allegations of this Case. As Judge Hollis determined, it is the Motion that dictates the issues and scope of the Trial. Any Claims not relevant to the facts of Tabor I or Tabor II are outside the scope of consideration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In Motion\n   <em>\n    in Limine\n   </em>\n   II, Schaller argued that this limitation should bar Claims 2\n   and 4 as asserted in the U.S. Trustee's Pretrial Statement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Those Claims, however, arise from the facts of this Case. Thus, the court allowed Claims 2 and 4 to proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Motion\n   <em>\n    in Limine\n   </em>\n   III, however, presents a different argument. There Schaller alleged that the U.S. Trustee failed to disclose proposed testimony from Mark Goddard (\"\n   <em>\n    Goddard\n   </em>\n   \") and Eli Randall (\"\n   <em>\n    Randall\n   </em>\n   \"), both former clients of Schaller, to Schaller's counsel during discovery and thus was barred from presenting them as witnesses at the Trial under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37, which states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   If a party fails to provide information or identify a witness as required by Rule 26(a) or (e), or the party is not allowed to use that information or witness to supply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial, unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c)(1). The U.S. Trustee acknowledged the nondisclosure and agreed to forego calling Goddard and Randall. Therefore, the request in Motion\n   <em>\n    in Limine\n   </em>\n   III to bar the testimony of Goddard and Randall was rendered moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In Motion\n   <em>\n    in Limine\n   </em>\n   III, Schaller also argued that the schedules in the bankruptcy cases of Goddard and Randall, U.S. Trustee Exh. Nos. 47 and 48, should not be admitted. In response, the U.S. Trustee argued that these had been produced in response to Schaller's March 14, 2017 document request. The U.S. Trustee asserts that, because they produced the documents, there would be no prejudice. The court agrees, but as Schaller's objection was also a relevance objection, stated that it would determine the relevance of the documents if and when presented. The court denied Schaller's request to bar the schedules in the Goddard and Randall cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Motion\n   <em>\n    in Limine\n   </em>\n   IV sought to bar the testimony of Zuzanna Jedynak (\"\n   <em>\n    Jedynak\n   </em>\n   \") and Oksana Prus (\"\n   <em>\n    Prus\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Schaller argued that the Trustee failed to disclose their testimony during discovery and that the testimony is thus prejudicial. Despite admitting a failure to disclose the testimony in question, the U.S. Trustee argued that the testimony was not prejudicial because it only spoke to the contentiousness of a meeting that Schaller had with Jedynak and Prus as the catalyst for Schaller changing his practice of filing bankruptcy cases under the CM/ECF accounts of his associates instead of his own. The U.S. Trustee further argued that the failure to disclose these witnesses was because the witnesses were unknown until Schaller provided all discovery, which was after the disclosure deadline for witnesses. The U.S. Trustee also argued that Schaller would not be prejudiced as his counsel deposed Jedynak for four hours and had a deposition with Prus scheduled to occur before the Trial. Schaller argued in response that the deposition of Jedynak was for matters briefed in the Jedynak case and Schaller did not use the deposition of Jedynak to prepare for this Trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The court was not convinced that Schaller had a proper opportunity to cross-examine Jedynak and Prus with respect to preparation for this Case and is empowered\n   to exclude evidence in such circumstances. The court may exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or more of the following: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence. Fed. R. Evid. 403. The presentation of the testimony of Jedynak and Prus in this Case and the prejudice that it may have in the Jedynak case outweigh the relevance that could be obtained from testimony with respect to the allegations in this Case. For these reasons, the court granted Schaller's request to bar the testimony of Jedynak and Prus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Last, in Motion\n   <em>\n    in Limine\n   </em>\n   IV, Schaller requested that the schedules in the Jedynak case be barred. For the reasons stated by the court in ruling on Schaller's previous request to bar the schedules of Goddard and Randall, the request was denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The U.S. Trustee's Motion in\n    <em>\n     Limine\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The U.S. Trustee filed one motion in\n   <em>\n    limine\n   </em>\n   in which he sought rulings on the admissibility of three exhibits based on two theories of law. The court ruled on each by addressing each theory of law in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The U.S. Trustee objected to the admission of Schaller Exh. Nos. 51 and 52 for the truth of the matters asserted therein-valuation of property-under Federal Rule of Evidence 802 because Zillow printouts constitute hearsay and do not satisfy any exception. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 802, \"[h]earsay is not admissible unless any of the following provides otherwise: a federal statute; these rules; or other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court.\" Fed. R. Evid. 802. Schaller argued that he is not using Zillow printouts to establish the value of the properties in the Debtor's Case, but rather to show the process used when preparing the Debtor's Schedules. Thus, he argued, the printouts are excepted from hearsay under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(3) as a then-existing mental, emotional or physical condition. In the alternative, Schaller argued that the Zillow printouts may be admitted for the truth of the valuation of the Debtor's properties as the Debtor could use them as the owner of the properties in testifying as to their value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The undersigned routinely prohibits reliance on Zillow in matters of evidentiary value. \"Zillow is a participatory cite [sic] almost like Wikipedia. In the same manner that Wikipedia allows anyone to input or change entries, Zillow allows homeowners to do so. A homeowner with no technical skill beyond the ability to surf the web can log in to Zillow and add or subtract data that will change the value of his property. This of course makes Zillow inherently unreliable.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Darosa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3786265\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/442/173/#p177\">\n    442 B.R. 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 177 (Bankr. D. Mass. 2010). Zillow is therefore not a statement that has equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness. Numerous courts dispute the trustworthiness of Zillow, including this court as stated in prior rulings. The court therefore ruled that the Zillow exhibits, Schaller Exh. Nos. 51 and 52, were not admissible for valuation purposes but did not produce their use otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The U.S. Trustee objected to the admission of Schaller Exh. No. 73-\"Video Regarding Bankruptcy\"-under Federal Rule of Evidence 901 because Schaller failed to provide any evidence to demonstrate that the video is what Schaller claims it to be. To the extent that Schaller could produce such evidence-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   that the video was tendered to the Debtor-the U.S. Trustee did not object to Schaller Exh. No. 73 being used for a relevant purpose. In response, Schaller admitted a failure to timely disclose the video in a transferrable file but\n   alleged that he sent a YouTube hyperlink satisfying his disclosure requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \"To satisfy the requirement of authenticating or identifying an item of evidence, the proponent must produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims it is.\" Fed.

Ind. Aug. 30, 2010). Using these guidelines, the court declined to admit Schaller Exh. No. 73 in advance, but reserved for later ruling overall admissibility until such time that Schaller could adequately authenticate transmittal and reception of the video to the Debtor. Whether the Debtor received the video was never adduced at the Trial, perhaps because the Debtor did not testify. Schaller's counsel did not refer to Schaller Exh. No. 73 at the Trial or Schaller's Closing Argument. Given the court's understanding of the issues, the court finds now that Schaller Exh. No. 73 offers little probative value and declines to consider it in rendering its decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Objection to Pretrial Statements\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The U.S. Trustee also filed an objection to Schaller's Pretrial Statement.

What is he required to show?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Schaller makes much of the requirements of Bankruptcy Rule 9011, arguing that the court take into consideration 9011's focus on deterrence or otherwise use 9011 case law as a guide. In so doing, Schaller encourages the court to find that Schaller cannot be held liable for his filings on behalf of the Debtor as they were the product of his reasonable inquiries and beliefs resulting therefrom. While such a guide may be helpful, this not a Bankruptcy Rule 9011 action and thus the applicable standard is not necessarily the one under that rule, much in the same way this court need not find that Schaller multiplied the proceedings in this Case unreasonably and vexatiously, as this is not a section 1927 matter. As the Seventh Circuit has made clear, just because an action under section 105 encompasses acts which have their own explicit standards does not mean that the bankruptcy court must meet those standards when acting under section 105.\n   <em>\n    In re L &amp; S Indus., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12257834,10516147\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/989/929/\">\n    989 F.2d 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 932 (7th Cir. 1993) (a bankruptcy court need not meet all the traditional preliminary injunction standards when enjoining a matter using section 105 authority).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   Nor is it necessary, as Schaller argues, for the U.S. Trustee to show that Schaller's conduct rises to the level of an abuse of process. That provision in section 105(a) is in the savings clause, not the grant of authority. It exists to clarify the court's power to prevent abuses of process and not as a limitation on the Bankruptcy Code's express provisions. It is not a precondition on the exercise of the authority expressly conferred in section 105. True, when the Seventh Circuit focused on that language in\n   <em>\n    Volpert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"869161,694977\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/110/494/\">\n    110 F.3d at 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , it did so in the context of what was a clear abuse of process. It would be an incorrect reading of\n   <em>\n    Volpert\n   </em>\n   and section 105 to conclude that section 105 only applies where an abuse of process has been shown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Finally, it is not necessary, as Schaller argues, for the court to make a specific finding of bad faith to support the U.S. Trustee's cause. In making this argument and the immediately preceding argument, Schaller perilously relies on bankruptcy cases from outside of this jurisdiction. He would do well to look closer to home. In\n   <em>\n    Rimsat\n   </em>\n   , the Seventh Circuit stated that \"we will not reverse an order imposing sanctions merely because the sanctioning court did not make an explicit finding of 'bad faith.' \"\n   <em>\n    Rimsat\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1747500\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/212/1039/#p1049\">\n    212 F.3d at 1047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Not so, as has been amply demonstrated above. However, because a showing of bad faith has been held to satisfy the standards for section 105 relief, if the U.S. Trustee does show bad faith, the inquiry is satisfied.

In Tabor II, which was filed exactly two months after Tabor I was dismissed but while Tabor I was still open, with required documents but no Plan payments having been made and in the face of an eligibility challenge, the case was dismissed after only 51 days, prior to the first confirmation hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   In addition to the other factual overlap with\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   , the timing here, especially in relation to Schaller's marketing and the applicable timing under the Bankruptcy Rules and Bankruptcy Code, is remarkable. The outside date for a section 341 meeting of creditors in a chapter 13 case is 50 days in ordinary circumstances and 60 if certain conditions are met. Fed. R. Bankr. P. 2003. The outside date for the first confirmation hearing in a chapter 13 case is 45 days after the section 341 meeting of creditors. Together, this brings outside the date (in a jurisdiction overrun with chapter 13 case, thus susceptible to delay) to 95 to 105 days. Assuming dismissal at the first confirmation hearing as was noted in\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   , Schaller's estimate of additional time afforded a debtor to stay in their home is spot on.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   This timing might be a result of the projected loan modification turnaround, but if it is, that was not made clear to the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   If this process was truly about a successful bankruptcy irrespective of the loan modification, one would think that Schaller would train his attorneys on how to deal with the outcomes. He did not. For example, Pollak testified that that he would not know how to analyze the likelihood of the Debtor's success with a modification against the effect it would have on a chapter 13 filing. Tr. at p. 40, Nov. 29, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   Given all of the foregoing, as well as Schaller's own testimony, the solicitation sent to the Debtor, other marketing materials made available by Schaller and the agreements between him and the Debtor narrowing the focus of the bankruptcy to the loan modifications with which he offered no assistance, the court has little hesitation in concluding that this Case was improperly motivated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   Because bad faith is considered in the totality of circumstances, even where such motivation exists, it is necessary for the court to look at the other factors involved. For that reason, and because bad faith is not the sole inquiry in a section 105 proceeding, the court will look further, including the overall circumstances in which conduct such as the foregoing occurred, if it in fact did occur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   E.\n   <em>\n    Bankruptcy Rule 9011, Revisited\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   In similar fashion, Schaller defends against the section 105 relief sought by the U.S. Trustee by attempting to show that his inquiry into the facts was reasonable, a test under Rule 11 and Bankruptcy Rule 9011. Again, as demonstrated above, that standard does not govern a section 105 inquiry. Nonetheless, as in the case of bad faith, Schaller's inquiry into the facts has some bearing and should that inquiry prove to be unreasonable in light of a showing by the U.S. Trustee of the elements of Rule 11 and Bankruptcy Rule 9011 culpability, it would appear that the U.S. Trustee's section 105 inquiry is satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   As with Rule 11, under Bankruptcy Rule 9011, an attorney may be sanctioned for her representations to the court if, among other things, those representations are presented for an improper purpose, including to cause unnecessary delay. Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9011(b)(1) ; Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(1). The factual contentions of those representations must also have evidentiary support. Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9011(b)(3) ; Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(3). Bankruptcy Rule 9011 and Rule 11 each contain what appears to be a savings clause relating to the attorney's \"inquiry reasonable under the circumstances\" and based on \"knowledge, information, and belief.\" Fed.

P. 11(b)(1), (2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   Schaller makes much of this savings clause, arguing that his inquiry into the facts and the circumstances of both the Debtor's eligibility and the Debtor's Schedules was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   Schaller is correct insofar as his filings on behalf of the Debtor with the bankruptcy court constitute representations that fall within the ambit of Bankruptcy Rule 9011.

Specifically, the Debtor's Schedules reflect secured debt totaling $1,268,380.27. That is taken directly from Schedule A. The unsecured debt, on the other hand, is based on a calculation.\n   <em>\n    In re Miller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4178656\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/493/55/#p58\">\n    493 B.R. 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 58 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 2013) (Goldgar, J.). One begins with the amount the Debtor scheduled on Schedule F, $80,218.39. Next one adds to that the total of the unsecured amounts set forth on Schedule A, in this case $691,807.27. Together that is the total amount of unsecured debt, in this case, $772,025.66. The Debtor's scheduled amounts for secured and unsecured debt both exceed the applicable debt limits in section 109(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   In light of the foregoing, Schaller puts forth a variety of arguments. First, he challenges the amounts in the Schedules, claiming that they were incorrectly calculated and that the Debtor was eligible. Next, he argues that he and his employees reasonably believed that the Debtor was eligible. Schaller also, at points, appears to veer away from the debt eligibility question to defend his belief that the Debtor had regular income sufficient to support a chapter 13 plan. Last, Schaller attempts to distance himself from the actual documents on file, both by arguing that they do not reflect his reasonable beliefs regarding eligibility and by laying off any blame associated with them on his associates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   None of Schaller's arguments, however, can deflect this matter from the objective truth that the Schaller Firm filed Tabor II based on Schedules that, on their face, reflected a debtor who was ineligible for chapter 13 relief under section 109(e). Any reasonable inquiry into the very documents that were prepared by the Schaller Firm would have led Schaller to the conclusion that the contention that the Debtor was eligible was groundless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   Not only was the Debtor ineligible, but Schaller did not contest dismissal of Tabor II on that, or any other ground. In both Tabor I and Tabor II, there is no indication that Schaller or anyone at the Schaller Firm defended any of the multiple motions to dismiss. In Tabor I, there were three motions to dismiss pending at the time of dismissal, each grounded in a failure to perform basic case requirements. In Tabor II, the unreasonable delay motion which contained both an allegation of failure to perform basic case requirements and the eligibility contention was granted on the first hearing thereon. It was only once Schaller had a personal stake in the outcome that he stepped forward with these arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   The exhibits and testimony presented to the court make clear that the \"Surrender Method\" is entirely about debtors and their homes. Yet the Schedules themselves, prepared and filed by Schaller or his associates either did not accurately reflect the home and the debt on it, or did and made the Debtor ineligible for chapter 13 relief. In either case, Schaller failed in\n   his duty to the Debtor and to the court to make accurate representations on the Debtor's behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Nonetheless, Schaller Filed or Caused to Be Filed a Chapter 13 Case on Behalf of the Debtor\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   There is no question that, based on the Schedules on file in this Case, the Debtor was ineligible for chapter 13 relief, as set forth above. Tabor II was dismissed on that and other grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   Yet the Tabor I and Tabor II petitions were in fact filed by the Schaller Firm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   In both Tabor I and Tabor II, all the documents filed with the court were filed under the CM/ECF account of Oreluk, as an associate with the Schaller Firm. Most of those documents indicate that Oreluk, as an associate with the Schaller Firm, was counsel to the Debtor. Under the circumstances here, the court would have little hesitancy finding that Oreluk was the Debtor's attorney and therefore the preceding failures are attributable to him. Were this a Bankruptcy Rule 9011 matter targeting Oreluk, the court would per the express terms thereunder also hold the Schaller Firm liable for any violations of Bankruptcy Rule 9011 by Oreluk. Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9011(c)(1)(A) (\"Absent exceptional circumstances, a law firm shall be held jointly responsible for violations committed by its partners, associates, and employees.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   Schaller, of course, is not Oreluk nor the Schaller Firm\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   . As founder, president and sole partner of the Schaller Firm, Schaller was Oreluk's boss and direct supervisor. Tr. at pp. 16-17, Nov. 27, 2017. Any liability of the Schaller Firm would ultimately be borne by Schaller indirectly. The question here though is whether Schaller can be directly liable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   This is in part where the flexibility of section 105 comes into play. As noted above, section 105 assists in cutting through multiplicitous proceedings, simplifying the matter. Can it, however, be used to assess liability to Schaller for Oreluk's conduct?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   The court concludes that it can.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   Section 105(a) expressly affords the bankruptcy court the ability to \"issue any order, process, or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this title.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20105\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ;\n   <em>\n    Caesars\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5887513,4365871\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/808/1186/\">\n    808 F.3d at 1188-89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (bankruptcy court may use section 105 to further the Bankruptcy Code's \"central objectives\").

No. 13-3; Tr. at p. 142, Nov. 6, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   Nothing in the record before the court demonstrated a proper bankruptcy motive behind the filings of Tabor I and Tabor II, and neither the U.S. Trustee nor Schaller called the Debtor to testify. That testimony might have evidenced a desire to reorganize beyond the facially invalid attempt to delay the mortgage creditors. In the absence of that testimony, the record speaks for itself. Two ineligible cases in succession, one dismissed for failure to comply with the filing requirements of the Bankruptcy Code and one dismissed for ineligibility and failure to make Plan payments. Each the product of a system designed by Schaller to delay foreclosures but not to legitimately invoke bankruptcy relief. These filings were improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   Under the totality of these circumstances, there is little doubt that it was Schaller who caused the ineligible cases to be filed. Schaller cannot escape blame by laying off his responsibilities on his associates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    The Reason the Ineligible Cases Were Filed and Liability Therefore\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   Despite all of the foregoing, the court cannot-nor does it need to-conclude that it was financial gain that motivated the improper petitions. None of the standards analyzed above require the court to determine the motivation of the attorney behind an improperly motivated bankruptcy case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   The reason the Tabor I and Tabor II cases were filed is abundantly clear from the record. They were filed as a product of Schaller's Surrender Method approach to chapter 13 bankruptcies, designed to delay the collection efforts of the Debtor's mortgage holders. There is no need to look to Schaller's profit motive as the underlying, primary motive herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-266\">\n   The ineligible filings for the purposes of delaying collection would be, if this were an action under Bankruptcy Rule 9011(b)(1) or for bad faith dismissal under section 1307(c), enough. Under these circumstances, those improprieties redound upon the attorney who orchestrated the deficient filings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   The court therefore concludes that Schaller's causing the ineligible Tabor I and Tabor II cases to be filed was improper and merits redress under section 105(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Claim 2\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   The U.S. Trustee outlines in \"Claim 2\" that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-270\">\n   Robert Schaller advertised to financially desperate and vulnerable potential clients that he knew to be on the precipice of losing their homes, including Elton Tabor, and made misleading and illusory claims in such advertisements, including the premise of a \"DEADLINE TO SAVE YOUR HOME.\" In fact, when Robert Schaller sent such advertisements to Mr. Tabor and others, he had no intention of 'saving' their homes. Robert Schaller's intention was to propose and confirm a Chapter 13 plan that either did not address the mortgage obligations, or provided for the surrender of the home. This is what is known as Schaller's \"Surrender Method\" Chapter 13 case. The practical purpose of the Surrender Method is to achieve enough delay with the automatic stay so that sufficient payments can be made for the Trustee to disburse to Robert Schaller for an attorney fee. The theoretical idea is that the client will negotiate,\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , a modification of their home loan. Although Robert Schaller almost always uses the Court-Approved Retention Agreement in Surrender Method cases, and although he is fully aware that Paragraph 16 has been interpreted to include negotiations with secured lenders, he often causes Surrender Method clients to execute side agreements absolving him of any responsibility concerning the mortgage modification component of the approach he counsels. In other words, Schaller markets to prospective clients facing a challenge with a particular debt (their home mortgage); prospective clients seek Schaller's assistance in dealing with that challenge, and Schaller sells a substantial number of prospective clients a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case that proposes to resolve all debts\n   <em>\n    except the one that led them to him in the first place.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   U.S. Trustee's Pretrial Stmt., at pp. 1-2 (footnote omitted). In addressing the U.S. Trustee's Claim this court must consider whether Schaller's actions fall under the ambit of this court generally and the matter before the court specifically.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   It appears here that the U.S. Trustee seeks a ruling that the Surrender Method is impermissible, that in implementing the Surrender Method, Schaller has taken advantage of an at-risk demographic and that\n   Schaller has violated the terms of the CARA. Each of the former two requests appear beyond the scope of this Case and the middle request appears to veer into the territory of professional responsibility. Only the last request appears squarely before the court, and that too has issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   The court will consider each request in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-274\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The Propriety of the Surrender Method\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   The court has addressed the pitfalls of the Surrender Method in addressing Claim 1. There, the court was careful not to make broad-sweeping statements about its propriety. Even though it is abundantly clear that the sole purpose of this Case, a Surrender Method case, was to buy time through the protection of the automatic stay, the court cannot conclude on the record before it that every Surrender Method case is equally flawed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   As Judge Schmetterer has stated, \"the [c]ourt must be careful not to deny the protection of the Bankruptcy Code to a debtor whose legitimate efforts at financial rehabilitation may be hidden among derivative benefits (such as the delay of creditors resulting from the automatic stay) that, if viewed alone, might suggest bad faith.\"\n   <em>\n    Strug-Div.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675558\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/375/445/#p449\">\n    375 B.R. at 449\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-277\">\n   Schaller is correct that the Bankruptcy Code does permit surrender of property under a chapter 13 plan.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5)(C). Schaller is also, presumably, correct that judges in this district have approved plans in cases filed by him which fall into the category of what the U.S. Trustee calls the Surrender Method. That the latter has occurred does notmake it right, in much the same way that this court cannot, as discussed below, require Schaller to defer from conduct only a single judge has disproved, unless it is clear the others would as well. The fact that the former is an option does not permit a debtor to file intentionally deficient plans knowing that they can be corrected with that option later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-278\">\n   Here, the implementation of the Surrender Method was flawed from the outset. The Debtor was ineligible for chapter 13 relief. Further, as discussed below, the chapter 13 plan filed for the Debtor in Tabor II failed to properly address the central issues in the Case: the mortgages and properties. Also, as discussed below, the Schedules were slapdash in nature. These, and the other failures noted above, made Tabor I and Tabor II doomed to fail, and speak poorly of the Surrender Method. As implemented in these cases, the Surrender Method was inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-279\">\n   The court cannot conclude more generally than that, however. As noted at the outset, this matter has always been focused on the facts of Tabor I and Tabor II. What has gone on in other cases might help explain what happened here, but it is not the focus of this matter. For that reason, the court cannot give the U.S. Trustee what they seek here. Propriety must be determined on a case-by-case basis, under the totality of the circumstances in each case at hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-280\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The Professional Responsibility Allegations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-281\">\n   At the Trial, Schaller testified that the correspondence he originally sent the Debtor was sent by him through a mailing service. Tr. at p. 70, Nov. 16, 2017. Schaller explained that the letter in question was \"just one of hundreds-hundreds and hundreds of letters that we sent out on the same day.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    at 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

He also acknowledged that \"most of these people are unsophisticated.\" Tr. at p. 73, Nov. 6, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   Yet the correspondence in question arguably creates the impression that Schaller is offering to help save the home, with statements such as \"Deadline to Save Your Home\" appearing multiple times, \"Instant Relief &amp; Peace of Mind\" and \"protect your home.\" U.S. Trustee Exh. No. 22. Further, Schaller guarantees to stop the sheriff sale.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"200\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That is a promise he might technically fulfill by delaying the scheduled sale, but in this Case, that technical fulfillment is a distinction with no real difference. The ultimate result, loss of the Debtor's home to the mortgage holder by sheriff's sale, is exactly what occurred. U.S. Trustee Exh. No. 30. Further, because Tabor II was unsuccessful, the Debtor lost the ability to address therein the $517,749.84 deficiency assessed in the sheriff's sale.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   At the very least, the correspondence appears likely to create unjustified expectations in the results that will be achieved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-283\">\n   Schaller's solicitation of the Debtor is troubling on other levels. In it, for example, he offers a \"$500 Coupon\" that, according to its terms, acts as a discount off of the client's retainer if certain conditions are met. U.S. Trustee Exh. No. 22. The court questions whether clients truly understand that, if it works as advertised, this is a discount solely off of the amount required to be paid up front as opposed to later, not off of the price of the legal services offered. Whether it works as advertised is another matter. At the Trial, Schaller testified that he had no set retainer, stating that \"I would try to distinguish between the level of the difficulty of the case. If you have, for example, a business Chapter 13 case, maybe it would be more. If you had a simple Chapter 7, it might be less.\n   <em>\n    So that would all depend on each case\n   </em>\n   .\" Tr. at p. 75, Nov. 6, 2017 (emphasis added). An offer to discount from an unspecified and undefined amount is potentially an empty one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-284\">\n   In particular, the court cannot help being struck by the similarities between this Case and\n   <em>\n    In re Komar\n   </em>\n   , an Illinois Supreme Court case involving a solicitation.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5554495\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/125/427/\">\n    125 Ill.2d 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=126%20Ill.%20Dec.%20930\">\n    126 Ill.Dec. 930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=532%20N.E.2d%20801\">\n    532 N.E.2d 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 807 (1988). In\n   <em>\n    Komar\n   </em>\n   , where a lawyer sent a mailing that included statements guaranteeing to save a potential client's home, the Illinois Supreme Court found that the solicitation was misleading and contained deceptive statements.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=532%20N.E.2d%20801\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court took particular issue that the lawyer intentionally directed his solicitations to \"unemployed, minimally educated, unsophisticated and distraught\" potential clients who feared the imminent loss of their homes by foreclosure, finding that the solicitations contained statements that created an unrealistic sense of urgency and illusory assurances that the potential client would be able to receive the relief promised through the solicitation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=532%20N.E.2d%20801\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-285\">\n   Each of the foregoing appears to implicate rules governing professional responsibility in Illinois and in the Northern District of Illinois.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-286\">\n   Schaller, as an attorney both licensed in the State of Illinois and admitted to practice before the District Court, answers to both sets of professional responsibility standards. As an Illinois attorney, Schaller must comply with the Illinois Rules of Professional Conduct (the \"\n   <em>\n    IL RPC\n   </em>\n   \"), Ill. Sup. Ct. R. Art. VIII (amended eff. Jan. 1, 2016).

In the Northern District of Illinois, the District Court has put into place the NDIL Disciplinary Rules and has historically supervised attorney conduct before both it and the bankruptcy court.

Matters arising in the case are traditionally just that, those that happen within the four walls of the bankruptcy case. When a debtor is in bankruptcy, virtually every legal issue the debtor faces has an impact on the bankruptcy. Debtors' lawyers need not, however, represent a debtor on all such matters. Further, all claims are subject to renegotiation. Being engaged as a debtor's bankruptcy lawyer, without more, cannot put an affirmative duty on counsel to conduct those negotiations on behalf of the debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-296\">\n   True, a distinction might be drawn that, as in\n   <em>\n    Gage\n   </em>\n   , the renegotiation here is central to the debtor's case and thus included within those duties. But the court cannot in clear conscience sanction Schaller for failing to follow the opinion of one judge in this matter, in a jurisdiction where a single judge's opinion is not controlling. If the bankruptcy court determines to expressly include mortgage renegotiations within the duties in the CARA, it is best done by the court as a whole and unequivocally, not through catchall language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   For similar reason, the court cannot conclude that the agreement in relation to the automatic stay is invalid. True, the CARA requires the counsel to \"[t]imely respond to motions for relief from stay.\" CARA, at p. 3, \u00b6 14. Schaller's side agreement does not, however, appear to relieve him of the duty to respond. Instead, it appears only to authorize his response to be acquiescence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-298\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Claim 3\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-299\">\n   Claim 3 states, in pertinent part, that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-300\">\n   The Chapter 13 plan prepared and filed for Elton Tabor in Case No. 15-26544 was filed in bad faith.

The Debtor's Schedules A &amp; D reflect the Debtor's two Properties and secured creditors in relation thereto, but the Plan provides treatment of none. Section C of the Plan indicates no creditors who will be paid directly, yet Sections E(2), E(3.1), E(3.2) and E(5) reflect no treatment of secured creditors under the Plan. The only mention of any secured creditor takes place in Section G(2), which provides that \"[t]he Chapter 13 trustee shall make NO payments to mortgagee JPMorgan Chase on its secured claim in accordance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5)(A).

The Plan in Section A(1)(c) states that the Debtor's total monthly household income is $3,137.98. This is derived from the Debtor's Schedule I, which states that the Debtor had a monthly income comprised of rent ($2,250.00), social security ($800.00) and pension/retirement ($87.98). The Debtor's Schedule J reflects monthly expenses, excluding rent/mortgage payments, of over $1,000.00. Without the rent income, the Plan is unfeasible. Yet nothing in the Plan in any way acts to preserve the income upon which the Plan is predicated;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-313\">\n   That, considering these omissions, the Plan is unfeasible is something that Schaller knew or should have known. The Plan, invalid on its face, does not further any legitimate goal of bankruptcy relief and serves only the purpose of misleading all parties into believing the plan requirement has been fulfilled, thus prolonging the case inappropriately; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-314\">\n   That taken in light of the foregoing, the Plan does not propose payments to the Debtor's creditors in a fundamentally fair way.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-315\">\n   Schaller agrees that determining the good faith of a chapter 13 plan is a fact intensive evaluation requiring the court to use a totality of the circumstances approach. Schaller's central argument is, however, that while the filing of a petition in bad faith may lead to dismissal, the filing of a plan in bad faith does not lead to the same result. Schaller relies on\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that a good faith inquiry is not derived from an evaluation of specific amounts or percentages to unsecured creditors because that issue is addressed in section 1325(b).\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6123424,1783472\" index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/848/813/\">\n    848 F.2d at 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Schaller also argues that section 727(a)(4)(A) guides the analysis of good faith, which requires a debtor to knowingly and fraudulently have made a false oath. Finally, Schaller decries the lack of testimony from the Debtor, arguing that without it, the court cannot conclude a lack of good faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-316\">\n   These arguments are unavailing. The court has previously discussed both the distinction between sections 727(a)(4)(A) and 1325 of the Bankruptcy Code. In so doing, the court concluded that an analysis under the totality of the circumstances test\n   can dictate a finding of bad faith even in the absence of a debtor's testimony or an evidentiary hearing.\n   <em>\n    Blake\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516265\" index=\"235\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/885/1065/#p1083\">\n    885 F.3d at 1083\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In that regard, the court also considered the Debtor's lack of availability and concluded that the totality of the circumstances dictated a finding of lack of good faith. The record speaks for itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-317\">\n   Last, Schaller has misread the holding in\n   <em>\n    Smith.\n   </em>\n   True, the\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   court did conclude that a plan could be proposed in good faith even though payment percentages to unsecured creditors might be miscalculated.\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6123424,1783472\" index=\"236\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/848/813/\">\n    848 F.2d at 820\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Everything else was just pre-set, you could say.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201746\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201746\">\n    at p. 180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Oreluk further testified that he did not check to see if the other attorneys had checked with the clients regarding the pre-filled items.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201746\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201746\">\n    at 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-346\">\n   This pre-filling of the schedules is dangerous and could possibly have been rectified had there been a true control in place ensuring that debtors ratified the numbers. Schaller testified that he put into place a datasheet to inquire as to what the contents of the schedules should in fact be, and that his associates would go over the datasheet with each debtor then again to confirm the answers in the completed schedule with each debtor. Tr. at p. 233, Nov. 6, 2017; Tr. at pp. 18-23, 38-42, Nov. 7, 2017;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   U.S. Trustee Exh. No. 9 (Tabor I datasheet). However, as noted above, Oreluk and Fabinksi testified to different approaches to these same controls. For example, Oreluk testified that he would question the contents of a datasheet only if there was an indication the client was being uncooperative or lazy. Tr. at p. 37, Nov. 27, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-347\">\n   Further, there appeared to be no true compliance with the CARA requirement that the attorney \"personally review with the debtor and sign the completed petition, plan, statements, and schedules.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CARA, at p. 2. Fabinksi testified that clients never returned to the office to review the schedules with the lawyers. Instead, the documents were simply emailed to clients for signature, Tr. at pp. 58-60, Nov. 27, 2017, using an email drafted by Schaller and given to his associates to solicit signatures with. Tr. at p. 218, Nov. 6, 2017. At no time does it appear that any attorney from the Schaller Firm personally reviewed the completed schedules with debtors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-348\">\n   This lack of control appears to have manifested itself in Tabor I and Tabor II. A datasheet exists for Tabor I, U.S. Trustee Exh. No. 9, but none apparently for Tabor II. Further, the Tabor I datasheet is blank in the area for a listing of personal property. Yet the default, pre-filled numbers made their way onto lines 1, 4-7 and 35 on Schedule B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-349\">\n   This happened an alarming number of times. U.S. Trustee Exh. No. 1(a) (\"the\n   <em>\n    Summary Chart\n   </em>\n   \") summarizes these aspects of schedule Bs in all bankruptcy cases filed by the Schaller Firm during the years 2013, 2014 and 2015. As the Summary Chart shows, an overwhelming number of the petitions filed by Schaller include the same amounts as were submitted here, for example cash ($20.00), household goods ($250.00) and clothing ($775.00).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-350\">\n   Schaller's use of pre-filled schedules strikes to the very heart of bankruptcy disclosures. Here it is the Debtor, not the attorney, that must provide the values.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Bankr. P. 1008. Schaller is correct that debtors may seek advice of counsel in formulating their response, the evidence indicates that Schaller's practice has gone beyond advising debtors. He is, in fact, testifying for them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-351\">\n   Once again, had the Debtor testified, it is possible that he might have ratified the amounts in the Schedules and the court would have to consider the Debtor's Schedules in that light. But the Debtor did not testify. In the absence of that testimony, the record speaks for itself. The conduct of the Schaller Firm and thereby Schaller in Tabor I and Tabor II violated Bankruptcy Rule 1008 and, by failing to personally review the Schedules with the Debtor, the express duties of the CARA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-352\">\n   E.\n   <em>\n    Claim 5\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-353\">\n   Claim 5 concentrates on the firm culture that Schaller created at the Schaller Firm. The U.S. Trustee maintains that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-354\">\n   [a]t times relevant, Robert Schaller created a law firm culture that ascribed insufficient priority to (i) the accuracy of sworn schedules filed by Robert Schaller's clients, as evidenced by the various inaccuracies in the schedules of Elton Tabor, and (ii)the manner in which the schedules were presented to Mr. Tabor for review, which was inconsistent with the obligations set forth in the Court-Approved Retention Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-355\">\n   U.S Trustee's Pretrial Statement, at p. 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-356\">\n   Schaller testified at the Trial that the processes he established as principal of the Schaller Firm were \"very thorough.\" Tr. at p. 17, Nov. 7, 2017. Throughout his testimony, Schaller described in great detail the practices and procedures he established. The evidentiary record, however, paints a different picture of the practices and procedures of the Schaller Firm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-357\">\n   It is not necessary to restate here the multiple issues noted above, for two reasons. First, if Tabor I and Tabor II are illustrative of the practices and procedures of the Schaller Firm, then it is a simple conclusion that Schaller's practices and procedures fall outside of acceptable practices and procedures in this District and elsewhere.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-358\">\n   Second, however, this matter is not about Schaller's law firm culture. The court cannot see a cognizable claim here in relation to the Tabor I and Tabor II cases. The individual failures, including the ones pointed out by the U.S. Trustee in this Claim, have previously been addressed. The culture might explain these failures but does not stand alone as a cause of action in a matter of this scope.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-359\">\n   The relevance, of course, may be in connecting Schaller personally to the actions of the Schaller Firm and the lawyers working there. If that is the purpose and as it may be necessary to restate it here, the court reiterates its earlier conclusion with respect to Claim 1: Under the totality of these circumstances, there is little doubt that it was Schaller who is ultimately responsible for the failure set forth herein. Schaller cannot escape blame by laying off his responsibilities on his associates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-360\">\n   REMEDIES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-361\">\n   Having found that Schaller is responsible for some, but not all, of the Claims asserted by the U.S. Trustee, the question then becomes what remedy should be afforded. As noted above, the U.S. Trustee seeks here: (1) refund of all fees collected from the Debtor in the Tabor I and Tabor II matters; (2) a sanction of $5,000.00 or more against Schaller for his alleged conduct; and (3) reimbursement of the U.S. Trustee's fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-362\">\n   The court has previously concluded that it will not in a matter of this nature order the second remedy, as that appears more punitive than remedial. Some courts, in matters such as these, have also refused to order a refund of the fees at issue. In\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   , the court found no cause to order the counsel to return fees to the debtor, stating that \"[h]e got what he paid for. He wanted to stiff-arm the creditor until he was eligible for a discharge, and his goal was accomplished. He should not get any money back to encourage such behavior.\"\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%20612254\">\n    2011 WL 612254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-363\">\n   Such an approach would not correctly reflect the scenario here. It is not clear what the Debtor wanted as the Debtor did not testify. Schaller's advertisement did speak to delay, and some delay is indeed what the Debtor received. The Debtor did not get the sheriff's sale stopped, as promised,\n   merely delayed. Further, the overall goal was much more likely a desire to save the Debtor's home, as Schaller's advertisements exploit. That might not have been possible even in a legitimate case, but it certainly did not happen here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-364\">\n   Under the circumstances, it is the court's conclusion that compensatory damages must include a refund to the Debtor all of the fees Schaller has collected in Tabor I and Tabor II. By the court's calculation, that amount is $4,432.70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-365\">\n   In the court's determination, compensatory damages require somewhat more. As noted above, however, the Debtor also was assessed a deficiency claim of $517,749.84 on the sheriff sale of the Kedzie Property. U.S. Trustee Exh. No. 30. That amount has every appearance of being dischargeable in a bankruptcy case. Further, the disposition of the 64th Street Property is unclear.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, the Debtor appears to be left in need of a further bankruptcy, one that would not be necessary had his previous cases been pursued correctly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-366\">\n   The court will therefore also require Schaller to pay to the Debtor $4,000.00 to allow the Debtor to seek bankruptcy relief, as necessary. The amount of $4,000.00 is the \"no look\" fee for a chapter 13 case under the CARA. It may be that a subsequent case will cost more or less than that amount, depending on the complexity and bankruptcy chapter of that case. As that is uncertain at this time, $4,000.00 is a fair estimation of the cost.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-367\">\n   Finally, the U.S. Trustee's request for its fees and costs in this proceeding will be granted. For the sake of clarity and because it appears that the U.S. Trustee has not pursued this case in the most expeditious of ways, the court will allow fees and expenses beginning with the drafting and submission of the motion to reopen this Case and going forward only, and even then only those fees and costs bearing a direct relation to this Case. The court is aware that the U.S. Trustee is pursuing Schaller on what are, essentially, parallel tracks in several cases. This grant of fees and costs does not encompass the U.S. Trustee's fees and costs in those other matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-368\">\n   Taken together and combined with the publication of this Memorandum Decision, the court concludes that these compensatory damages are derivative from and proportionate in relation to the actions in question in this Case and Schaller's culpability therefore.\n   <em>\n    Zale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11129760,11076623\" index=\"248\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/239/910/\">\n    239 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   916-17 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United Mine Workers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"353858\" index=\"249\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/330/258/#p298\">\n    330 U.S. at 298-99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"353858\" index=\"250\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/330/258/#p298\">\n    67 S.Ct. 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Shakman,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1003719\" index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/533/344/#p349\">\n    533 F.2d at 349-50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-369\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-370\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the court will grant the U.S. Trustee's Motion for Sanctions in the manner described above. This court finds that the U.S. Trustee has met its burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence the need to address the circumstances discussed herein in a proceeding under section 105. The integrity of the bankruptcy process demands nothing less.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-371\">\n   A separate order will be issued concurrently with this Memorandum Decision to that effect.
