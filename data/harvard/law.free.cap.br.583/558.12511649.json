Ward (the \"Plaintiff\") filed this adversary proceeding against his mortgage lender, Fidelity Bank (the \"Defendant\"). The Plaintiff, proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , alleges that the Defendant \"monetized\" a promissory note signed by the Plaintiff and used the funds therefrom to finance the Plaintiff's purchase of real property. He contends that the Defendant's conduct discharged his obligation\n   to repay the debt. Based on these allegations, the Plaintiff brings claims against the Defendant under Georgia law and under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FDCPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201692\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   He also seeks a declaratory judgment concerning the Defendant's security interest in the real property. Before the Court is the Defendant's Motion to Dismiss (adv. dckt. 13) the Complaint (adv. dckt. 1) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Although the Court has liberally construed the Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   filings, his Complaint will be dismissed for the reasons set forth below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

On November 16, 2017, the Plaintiff filed this adversary proceeding against the Defendant, enumerating claims for \"action of trespass on the case/trespass quare clausum fregit,\" \"action of trover,\" \"action of covenant,\" and declaratory judgment. (Adv. Dckt. 1). In a section of his Complaint entitled \"Bill of Particulars,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Plaintiff demands $100,000.00 in compensatory damages and contends that he is entitled to \"triple damages of $300,000.00 should a fraudulent claim be found.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    at p. 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(Adv. Dckt. 6). In the Answer, the only defense asserted by the Defendant is that the Complaint must be dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (\"Federal Rules\") because it fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    at p. 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Defendant also requests attorneys' fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 26, 2018, the Defendant filed the instant Motion to Dismiss the Plaintiff's Complaint pursuant to Federal Rule 12(b)(6) (adv. dckt. 13), as well as a supporting memorandum of law (adv. dckt. 14). On February 12, 2018, the Plaintiff filed a response. (Adv. Dckt. 17). At a hearing on February 15, 2018, the Defendant's counsel presented oral argument, and the Plaintiff rested on his written response. The matter was taken under advisement and is now ripe for ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    III. THE PLAINTIFF'S ALLEGATIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As set forth in the Plaintiff's Complaint, the facts of this case are as follows: On April 30, 2014, the Plaintiff obtained a mortgage loan from the Defendant in the amount of $81,900.00.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Adv. Dckt. 1, p. 7). As evidenced by a promissory note (the \"Promissory Note\"), the Plaintiff promised to pay the Defendant $391.04 per month beginning on June 1, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    at p. 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Exhibit \"1\"). The Plaintiff also executed a security deed conveying to the Defendant title to real property commonly known as 126 Greenbriar Court, Savannah, Chatham County, Georgia 31419 (the \"Property\").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    at p. 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Exhibit 2\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In the Complaint, the Plaintiff alleges that the Defendant engaged in certain fraudulent conduct in connection with the April 30, 2014 loan transaction. These allegations are somewhat confusing. According to the Complaint, the Defendant did not \"finance the purchase of the Subject Property with its own money.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    at p. 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, the Defendant \"endorsed the Note 'Pay to the Order of' and left it blank.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Defendant then \"deposited the Note into a transaction account in [the Plaintiff's] name[,] ... wrote a check off of that account to pay the seller of the Subject Property,\" and \"sold the Note through the Securitization process to fund [the Plaintiff's] deposit account,\" which the Defendant \"unlawfully depleted.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    at p. 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In his response to the Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, the Plaintiff clarifies his allegations. There, he explains that \"banks endorse the back of the Promissory Note like a check and place the funds on their books as a debit.\" (Adv. Dckt. 17, p. 6). Then, \"because they use [Generally Accepted Accounting Principles], they place an entry on the credit side of the ledger[,] thereby making the man or women [sic] who signed the Promissory Note the Creditor of the funds.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In other words, the Defendant financed the purchase of the Property with money the Defendant \"created when it monetized [the] Promissory Note.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    at p. 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   According to the Plaintiff, the Defendant's conduct took place without his knowledge or consent. At the time of the loan transaction, the Plaintiff did not know \"that [his] Promissory Note was the same as cash or a cashier's check.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    at p. 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Plaintiff learned of the Defendant's alleged actions when he \"saw a video on the Internet of a speech recorded by a member of the Federal Reserve Board who explained this fraudulent scheme that is practiced by so many banks and mortgage lenders in the residential mortgage lending business.\" (Adv. Dckt. 1, p. 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After the April 30, 2014 loan transaction, the Defendant allegedly used the United States Postal Service \"to collect on a [f]raudulent debt,\" made various \"false claims exceeding their jurisdiction,\" and \"charged [the Plaintiff] for mortgage insurance ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Adv. Dckt. 1, p. 21). The Plaintiff further alleges that the Defendant \"used threats of intimidation, double recovery, and extortion using the mail.\" (Adv. Dckt. 1, p. 21). One such communication is a letter from the Defendant's counsel dated February 10, 2017. (Adv. Dckt. 1, p. 64) (Exhibit \"4\"). Pursuant to \u00a7 1692g(a) of the FDCPA, the letter notified the Plaintiff that the amount of the debt was $83,562.88, identified the creditor as the Defendant, and informed the Plaintiff of his right to dispute the validity of the debt\n   within 30 days. (Adv. Dckt. 1, p. 64) (Exhibit \"4\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Subsequently, the Plaintiff drafted a document entitled \"Notice of Default Judgment.\" (Adv. Dckt. 1, pp. 52-62) (Exhibit \"4\"). This document, dated March 31, 2017, is addressed to the Defendant's counsel and cc'd to an assortment of federal, State of Georgia, and ecclesiastical officials. (Adv. Dckt. 1, pp. 57-58). It provides in relevant part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   I, as man, Tremar Kenard Ward, Authorized Representative to the Legal Entity/Artificial Person \"TREMAR K WARD,\" conjoined with all the derivatives thereof, have sent (via Certified United States Mail) this formal Default Judgment in the contested matters of the above and to address any related former Claims or Actions initiated by you and/or held in your Trusted Responsibility.

The document attached as Exhibit \"3\" is a solicitation letter sent to the Plaintiff by DVH Law Group, LLC,\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   by the Defendant's counsel, Brock and Scott PLLC. (Adv.

The Defendant, however, improperly filed the instant Motion to Dismiss under Federal Rule 12(b)(6) after first raising the same defense in its Answer. \"A party's Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is a nullity if the party files that motion after raising the defense of failure to state a claim in its answer.\"\n   <em>\n    Whitehurst v.

The Plaintiff's \"Notice of Default Judgment\" (containing his demand for debt verification) is dated March 31, 2017, more than 30 days after February 10, 2017. (Adv. Dckt. 1, p. 52). Although it is possible that the Plaintiff received the February 10, 2017 notice within the 30-day period before he sent the \"Notice of Default Judgment,\" he does not allege sufficient facts to support this inference.
