Feeney, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n   <strong>\n    I. INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The matter before the Court is the Motion filed by MSCI 2007-IQ16 Blue Hill Avenue, LLC (\"Blue Hill\") to Dismiss or, in the Alternative, for Relief from Stay (the \"Motion to Dismiss or for Relief from Stay\"). The Debtor filed an objection to the Motion, and the Court held a hearing on April 3, 2018, at which the Court directed the Debtor's attorney to file a supplemental brief on the judicial estoppel argument made by Blue Hill, which was filed on April 6, 2018. The Court then took the matter under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Preliminarily, A. Hirsch Realty, LLC (the \"Debtor\"), through its Expedited Motion for Use of Cash Collateral (the \"Cash Collateral Motion\"), and Blue Hill, in its Opposition to the Cash Collateral Motion, as well as in its Motion to Dismiss or for Relief from Stay, raise the issue of the enforceability of certain prepetition bankruptcy waivers, including a waiver of the protection of the automatic stay, a waiver of the right to oppose dismissal of the case, and a waiver of the use of cash collateral, which were contained in a modification agreement (the \"Modification Agreement\") that was approved, in form, prior to its execution, by the bankruptcy court in the Debtor's prior Chapter 11 case in conjunction with confirmation of the Debtor's First Amended Plan of Reorganization. The Debtor, on the one hand, takes the position that the provisions are unenforceable because they amount to a complete waiver of bankruptcy protection in violation of public policy. Blue Hill, on the other hand, maintains they are enforceable, thus warranting dismissal of the Debtor's case, or, alternatively, entry of an order granting it relief from the automatic stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The issue initially was raised on February 7, 2018 at a hearing on the Debtor's Expedited Motion for Use of Cash Collateral on an Interim Basis. At that time, the Court entered the following order:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons stated on the record, the Court authorized the Debtor's interim use of cash collateral through the continued hearing date of March 7, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. The Debtor shall file a reconciliation of actual income and expenses to projections by March 6, 2018 at 4:30 p.m. Counsel shall submit their briefs on the objection and on the legal issues identified at the hearing and any agreed statement of facts by February 19, 2018 at 4:30 p.m. In the event, the parties cannot agree on all facts needed for the Court to decide the legal issues, they shall file a joint statement of disputed facts by February 19, 2018 and the Court will schedule an evidentiary hearing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The parties obtained an extension of time to file briefs. On March 12, 2018, Blue Hill filed its Motion to Dismiss or for Relief from Stay, the Debtor filed a Brief in Opposition to Blue Hill's Motion to Dismiss or for Relief from Stay in which it challenged the enforceability of certain provisions of the parties' prepetition Modification Agreement, and the parties filed a Stipulation of Undisputed and Disputed Facts in Connection with the Motion to Dismiss or for Relief from Stay and the Debtor's Opposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    material\n   </em>\n   facts necessary to resolve the issue as to the enforceability of the prepetition waivers are not in dispute. For the reasons set forth below, the Court only shall consider Blue Hill's alternative request for relief from the automatic stay. The Court shall enter an order granting Blue Hill's alternative request to grant it relief from the automatic stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. THE PARTIES' STIPULATION OF UNDISPUTED FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Court paraphrases the Stipulation and supplements the Undisputed Facts filed by the parties with reference to the contents of documents filed in the Debtor in its prior case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Approximately six years ago, on March 14, 2012, the Debtor filed a Chapter 11 case captioned A. Hirsch Realty, LLC, Case No. 12-12092-WCH (Bankr. D. Mass.) (the \"First Bankruptcy\"). The Debtor filed the First Bankruptcy to prevent a foreclosure of the Property, as defined below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On January 5, 2018, the Debtor commenced its present Chapter 11 case as a single asset real estate case, as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (51B), with the filing of a voluntary petition. Andrew H. Sherman executed the petition as Manager and authorized representative of the Debtor. In addition Andrew Sherman, as the Manager and 99% Member of the Debtor, executed the \"Written Consent of Managers and Members,\" authorizing the commencement of the Chapter 11 case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On January 19, 2018, the Debtor filed its Schedules and Statement of Financial Affairs. On Schedule A/B: Assets-Real and Personal Property, it listed real property located at 1613-1615 Blue Hill Avenue, Mattapan, Massachusetts (the \"Property\") with a value of $4 million. On Schedule D: Creditors Who Have Claims Secured by Property, the Debtor listed Blue Hill as the holder of a first mortgage in the amount of $2,584,359.31. On Schedule E/F: Creditors Who Have Unsecured Claims, the Debtor listed four claims, including the claims of the Massachusetts Development Finance Agency in the sum of $288,000; Marlene Sherman in the sum of $80,000,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Skolnick CPA in the sum of $4,200, and Associated Elevator Companies in the sum of $1,800.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   It also listed eight unexpired commercial real estate leases with tenants for premises at the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Undisputed Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Debtor's sole business is owning and managing the Property. The Property is a three-story commercial building in Mattapan Square consisting of approximately 16,000 square feet. The first floor contains retail space and the second and third floors contain offices. The only income generated by the Debtor is the rental income from the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On or about August 1, 2007, the Debtor secured a loan from NCB, FSB in the original principal sum of $2,300,000 with respect to the Property. The terms and conditions of the loan are evidenced by, among other documents, a Mortgage Note (the \"Note\"), a Mortgage, Assignment of Leases and Rents and Security Agreement (the \"Mortgage\"), and an Assignment of Leases and Rents (the \"Assignment\") (collectively,\n   the \"Loan Documents\"). The original Note was subject to the following basic terms:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   a. Principal balance: $2,300,000.00\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   b. Monthly payment: $14,161.50\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   c. Maturity date: August 1, 2017\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   d. Interest rate: 6.25%\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   e. Default interest rate: 11.25%\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Through a series of loan assignments, the Loan Documents were assigned to Blue Hill.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On or about March 2011, the Debtor defaulted under the Note by failing to remit all amounts due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   U.S. Bank, N.A., as Trustee for the Registered Holders of Morgan Stanley Capital I Inc., Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2007-IQ16 (the \"Trust\") filed a claim in the First Bankruptcy (which was subsequently allowed) in the sum of $2,480,134.45.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The claim was comprised of the following amounts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Principal: $2,200,816.25\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Accrued interest: $132,965.98\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Default interest: $94,146.03\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Late charges: $7,788.88\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Servicing advances: $46,135.13\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Escrow credits: ($1,717.82)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On May 10, 2013, the Trust filed a disclosure statement and proposed plan of reorganization in the First Bankruptcy. The Trust attached an appraisal of the Property to its disclosure statement indicating the value of the Property, as of October 5, 2012, was $1,070,000 (In its Cash Collateral Motion filed in this case, the Debtor indicated that the value now is approximately $3.8 to $4.0 million.) As part of its disclosure statement and plan of reorganization, the Trust proposed to take title to the Property \"for a deemed payment of $1,070,000.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On May 24, 2013, the Debtor filed its own plan. The Trust objected to the Debtor's plan, and the Debtor objected to the Trust's plan. On May 29, 2013, the Court scheduled a plan confirmation hearing for June 26, 2013. On June 18, 2013, the Debtor and the Trust filed a \"Joint Motion to Continue Hearings on Adequacy of Disclosure, Plan Confirmation, Pending Claim Objections and to Further Extend the Use of Cash Collateral,\" seeking to continue the hearing on plan confirmation and other matters for approximately 30 days. Subsequently, the Court rescheduled the hearing for August 14, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On October 30, 2013, Judge Hillman conducted a hearing on the competing plans. He continued the hearing to December 4, 2013, and then to January 8, 2014, and March 5, 2014, each time as a result of one of the parties claiming more time was needed in order for them to agree on a consensual plan. On March 4, 2014, the Trust and the Debtor filed a Joint Motion to Set Final Hearing on Plan Confirmation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court granted the Joint Motion,\n   canceled the March 5, 2014 hearing, and ordered the filing of a new disclosure statement and plan before the Court would schedule any further hearings on plan confirmation. It stated in pertinent part: \"Because of the radical changes proposed to the disclosure statement and plan, a new disclosure statement and plan must be filed before any further hearing will be scheduled. The parties shall notify the court to the extent that the motions previously scheduled for today still require hearings.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The parties took several additional months to finalize an amended disclosure statement and plan of reorganization. On July 17, 2014, the Debtor filed an agreed upon First Amended Plan of Reorganization\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a Proposed Form of Disclosure Statement Regarding Debtor's First Amended Plan of Reorganization (the \"Disclosure Statement\"). The Court approved the Disclosure Statement and held a confirmation hearing on September 18, 2014. In support of confirmation, the Debtor's principal, Andrew Sherman (\"Sherman\"), filed an Affidavit. Thereafter, the parties filed periodic updates with the Court concerning their ongoing efforts to negotiate mutually agreeable loan documents. On December 2, 2014, the parties filed a Joint Motion for Entry of Proposed Confirmation Order. The Court entered the Confirmation Order that same day (the \"Confirmation Order\"). The Confirmation Order provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   The obligations of the Debtor and the guarantors, Andrew Sherman and Sara Sherman, in connection the promissory note dated August 1, 2007 in the original principal amount of $2,300,000.00 (the \"Note\"), the mortgage on Debtor's property commonly known as 1613-1615 Blue Hill Avenue, Mattapan, Massachusetts and recorded in the Suffolk Registry of Deeds at Book 42285, Page 156 (the \"Mortgage\"), which is now held by U.S. Bank, National Association, as Trustee for Morgan Stanley Capital I Inc., Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2007-IQ16 (\"U.S. Bank\") and an Assignment of\n   Leases and Rents at the Property (the \"Assignment\"), as well as other financing documents (collectively the \"Loan Documents\") shall be affirmed and reinstated in all respects, except as otherwise modified by the Plan and the terms of this Order. The Debtor shall execute the Modification Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit A (with the loan balances as updated and amended by the noteholder through the date of execution) and shall otherwise cause the Modification Agreement and the closing conditions of the Modification Agreement to be completed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Confirmation Order also provided that \"in the event that the Modification Agreement and other loan documents have not been duly executed the Court will schedule a hearing on the dismissal of the proceeding.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Approximately two and one-half months after the entry of the Confirmation Order, on February 12, 2015, the parties executed the Modification Agreement. Sherman and his wife, Sara Sherman, signed a Joinder By and Agreement of Guarantor (the \"Joinder\"). Pursuant to a Fifth Status Report filed by U.S. Bank in accordance with Confirmation Order, U.S. Bank advised the Court that \"[t]he Debtor has provided this afternoon (February 12, 2015) by electronic mail copies of certain signature pages intended to effect the closing of the Plan transactions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Under the Modification Agreement, $658,203.34 in interest, late fees and lender expenses was capitalized and added to the pre-modification principal balance of $2,153,585.28 for a post-modification principal balance of $2,811,788.62. Under the Modification Agreement, the interest rate, monthly payment, and maturity date of the loan remained unchanged. The Modification Agreement provided at Section 2.3 the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    No Bankruptcy Intent.\n   </em>\n   None of Borrower or Guarantor (collectively, \"Borrower Parties\") has been a party to any Debtor Proceeding within seven (7) years prior to the Effective Date, other than the Pending Debtor Proceeding. No Borrower Parties has [sic] any intent to (a) file a voluntary petition with any bankruptcy court of competent jurisdiction or to be the subject of any petition under the Bankruptcy Code; (b) be the subject of any order for relief issued under the Bankruptcy Code; (c) file or be the subject of any petition seeking any reorganization, arrangement, composition, readjustment, liquidation, dissolution, or similar relief under any present or future federal or state act or law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, or other relief for debtors; (d) seek or consent to or acquiesce in the appointment of any trustee, receiver, conservator, liquidator or assignee for the benefit of creditors; or (e) be the subject of any order, judgment, or decree entered by any court of competent jurisdiction approving a petition filed against such party in connection with any Debtor proceeding.\n   <em>\n    Borrower acknowledges that the filing of any petition or the seeking of any relief in a Debtor Proceeding by any of Borrower Parties, whether directly or indirectly, would be in bad faith and solely for purposes of delaying, inhibiting or otherwise impending\n   </em>\n   [sic]\n   <em>\n    the exercise by Lender of Lender's rights and remedies against Borrower and the Property pursuant to the Loan Documents or at law\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   (emphasis supplied). The Modification Agreement provided at Section 3.4(a) the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    Lender Relief Upon Debtor Proceeding\n   </em>\n   . After an Event of Default, including without limitation, an Event of Default under Section 23(g) of the Security Instrument,\n   in the event that any of Borrower Parties shall take any action constituting a Debtor Proceeding (other than the Pending Debtor Proceeding), and such action causes Lender to seek necessary or appropriate relief, then Lender shall be entitled to and\n   <em>\n    Borrower irrevocably consents to (a) entry of an order granting stay relief and/or dismissal of such Debtor Proceeding, on either basis, for cause, (b) entry of an order from the bankruptcy court prohibiting Borrower's use of all \"cash collateral\" (as defined in Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code ) and (c) entry of an order that such Debtor Proceeding is a Single Asset Real Estate Case\n   </em>\n   . Moreover, (x) Borrower waives its exclusive right pursuant to Section 1121(b) of the Bankruptcy Code to file a plan of reorganization and irrevocably agrees and consents that Lender may file a plan immediately upon the entry of an order for relief if an involuntary petition is filed against Borrower or upon the filing of a voluntary petition by Borrower; (y) in the event that Lender shall move pursuant to Section 1121(d) of the Bankruptcy Code for an order reducing the 120 day exclusive period, Borrower shall not object to any such motion, and (z) Borrower waives any rights it may have pursuant to Section 108(b) of the Bankruptcy Code. Moreover, in the event that Borrower files or colludes in the filing of any action constituting a Debtor Proceeding, Lender shall immediately become entitled, among other relief to which Lender may be entitled under the Loan Documents, and at law or in equity, (x) to obtain an order from the court dismissing such filing as a bad faith filing and Borrower agrees that such filing shall have been made in bad faith and (y) to obtain an order from the court dismissing such filing as a bad faith filing and Borrower agrees that it will take no action to oppose the entry of such order of dismissal or to dispute a finding of fact by the court that such filing was made in bad faith.\n   <em>\n    The provisions of this Section shall survive the termination of this Agreement.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   (emphasis supplied). In addition, Section 3.5(f) provided that \"On or before the Execution Date, Borrower shall have made modifications to it organization documents, as such modification have been approved by Lender to incorporate the concept of an independent manager, whose vote will be needed for Borrower to engage in certain major decisions, one of which being the Borrower seeking relief in a Debtor Proceeding.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On August 31, 2016, the Debtor filed a Motion for Entry of Final Decree. The Court granted the motion on October 5, 2016, and the First Bankruptcy was closed on October 24, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Following the First Bankruptcy, the Debtor continued operating the Property. The Debtor's only income is rental income from the Property. The Maturity Date on the Note was August 1, 2017. The Debtor defaulted on the modified Note by failing to pay the amount due on maturity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On or about August 3, 2017, Blue Hill sent the Debtor a Notice of Default, and demanded the turnover of all rents. On December 1, 2017, Blue Hill filed a lawsuit against the Debtor and against Andrew and Sara Sherman in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, captioned\n   <em>\n    MSCI 2007-IQ16\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blue Hill Avenue, LLC v. A. Hirsch Realty, LLC\n   </em>\n   , Civil Action No. 17-12359-PBS (D. Mass. Dec. 1, 2017). In addition, Blue Hill scheduled a foreclosure sale for January 5, 2018. The Debtor commenced the instant case, as a single asset real estate case, in the morning of January 5, 2018 (the \"Petition\n   Date\"), in order to stay the foreclosure sale scheduled for later that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   On January 31, 2018, the Debtor filed its Cash Collateral Motion. With the consent of Blue Hill, the Debtor was authorized to use cash collateral on an interim basis through a continued hearing date of April 3, 2018 and thereafter through a continued hearing on April 23, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

According to the Debtor, \"[t]aken together, these provisions should not be enforced because they amount to a complete waiver of bankruptcy protection in violation of public policy.\" The Debtor adds, as an alternative argument that \"given the facts and circumstances of the Debtor's current chapter 11 case, even if the Debtor's pre-petition waiver of the automatic stay, right to oppose dismissal, or waiver of the use of cash collateral are not per se unenforceable, Blue Hill's motion should be denied because there is no basis for relief from stay, there is no cause for the dismissal of this case, and Blue Hill's interest is adequately protected\" and its unsecured creditors would be harmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Debtor maintains that this Court should examine the waiver provisions \"as a whole and not in separate distinct pieces\" because the extent of the waivers benefitting Blue Hill are tantamount a direct waiver of the right to file a bankruptcy\n   petition. The Debtor contends that enforcing its prior consent to immediate dismissal of its present case, either be it outright or as a bad faith filing, is indistinguishable from a waiver of the right to file a bankruptcy petition.

The Debtor urges this Court to consider the following factors taken from the decisions in\n   <em>\n    Atrium High Point\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Powers\n   </em>\n   to assess whether the dismissal and stay waiver should be enforced:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   1.

On the other hand, the Debtor contends that unsecured creditors with claims totaling approximately $374,000 will be harmed because there is sufficient equity in the Property that could be realized from a sale or refinancing to pay their claims in full through a reorganization, while they likely would receive nothing if Blue Hill were to foreclose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   With respect to the likelihood of a successful reorganization, the Debtor states that one is \"extremely likely\" in view of the significant equity in the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Blue Hill's Contentions as to Adequate Protection\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Blue Hill disputes the Debtor's assertion as to the value of the Property, observing that \"The Debtor's unsupported valuation has no basis in reality. In fact, a review of\n   the Debtor's financial disclosures in the First Bankruptcy versus its Supplemental Cash Collateral Budget ... in this bankruptcy reveals that the Property's value has not changed appreciably since the First Bankruptcy.\" While noting that NOI [net operating income] is used to determine the value of a commercial property using the income approach, Blue Hill observes that the Debtor's Proposed Cash Collateral Budget, when compared to prior budgets from the First Bankruptcy, shows \"(a) marginally higher rental income (an increase of about 10% from 2013-2014); (b) 30% higher expenses; and (c) a lower total yearly NOI.\" It adds:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   The lack of any appreciable increase in value from the First Bankruptcy is further corroborated by an Appraisal commissioned by Blue Hill and conducted by Colliers International Valuation and Advisory Services dated August 28, 2017, which opines that the Property's as-is market value as of the appraisal date was $2,850,000. Based on the above, it is clear that the Debtor's unsupported value of $3.8 to $4.0 million is wholly unrealistic and contrary to accepted appraisal methodologies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Here, the debtor, who is represented by able counsel, appears to be fairly sophisticated and further appears to have received consideration for the pre-petition waiver that arose from the prior bankruptcy proceeding. The debtor cites no evidence of coercion, fraud, or mutual mistake, nor does the debtor indicate that any compelling change in circumstances has occurred since the agreement was entered and approved in the prior bankruptcy proceeding. Indeed, the waiver is embodied in a bankruptcy-court approved settlement agreement that is only a few years old and whose subject is the same property at issue in the instant bankruptcy proceeding. Finally, enforcement of the waiver will further the legitimate public policy of encouraging out-of-court restructurings and settlements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203212243\">\n    2016 WL 3212243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at * 5 (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    In re Triple A &amp; R Capital Inv., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Puerto Rico observed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   Although stay waivers were long thought to be unenforceable as against public policy, an increasing number of courts are now enforcing them. There is no controlling law on this subject in this District or this Circuit. A review of the cases nationwide that addressed this issue indicate a trend that appears toward the enforcement of stay waivers. The difficult issue of whether prepetition stay waivers are enforceable, reflects the tension between the public policies favoring out of court workouts, on the one hand, and protecting the collective interest of the debtor's creditors, on the other. Bankruptcy courts that have tackled this issue have used different approaches with conflicting results. Three basic approaches have emerged: (1) uphold the stay waiver in broad unqualified terms on the basis of freedom of contract; (2) reject the stay waiver as unenforceable per se as against public policy; and (3) treat the waiver as a factor in deciding whether \"cause\" exists to lift the stay. This last approach has gained\n   ground in recent years.\n   <em>\n    It is important to note that the courts are in agreement that a prepetition waiver of the automatic stay, even if enforceable, does not enable the secured creditor to enforce its lien without first obtaining stay relief from the bankruptcy court\n   </em>\n   . This requirement is satisfied in this case because PRLP indeed filed a motion requesting the lift of stay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <em>\n    In re Triple A &amp; R Capital Inv., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4276553\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/519/581/#p584\">\n    519 B.R. at 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnotes omitted). The court determined that the stay waiver was enforceable because it was included in a stipulation regarding the use of cash collateral and adequate protection that it had approved. Pursuant to the stipulation, the debtor ratified and agreed to be bound by the clause in a forbearance agreement which contained the waiver of the protection of the automatic stay.

As a result, it was able to emerge from Chapter 11 in control of the Property. Although the Debtor asserts that it lacked bargaining power and the Modification Agreement was tantamount to a reaffirmation agreement, there is no evidence that the Modification Agreement was anything but a negotiated, arms' length settlement between two sophisticated parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The Debtor argues that Blue Hill is adequately protected, that there is equity in the Property, and that it has a likelihood of a successful reorganization because it is pursuing a dual tract of a sale or refinancing to pay all its creditors, including Blue Hill, in full.

The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit upheld a fine of $100 as a sanction for the Debtor's failure to deliver a copy to the Chapter 13 trustee of his request for an extension of the filing deadline for his federal income tax return within the time allowed under the terms of the confirmed plan.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-162\">\n    As noted above, the Debtor ascribes a value of approximately $3.8 to $4.0 million to the Property and avers that Blue Hill's claim is approximately $2.6 million.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-163\">\n    Use of the multi-factor approach does not warrant an evidentiary hearing in this case. Although the parties indicate that there are facts in dispute (i.e., whether Andrew and Sara Sherman were represented by counsel in the First Bankruptcy; the value of the Property; the amount of Blue Hill's claim; the amount of unsecured claims against the Debtor's estate; whether the Debtor continued to make payments on the Note after it matured; whether enforcement of any or all of the waivers in the Modification Agreement will harm the Debtor's unsecured creditors (Blue Hill contends that this is a disputed issue of law, not a disputed fact); whether the Debtor has a likelihood of a successful reorganization (Blue Hill contends that this is a disputed issue of law, not a disputed fact); and whether failure to enforce any or all of the waivers in the Modification Agreement will harm Blue Hill (Blue Hill contends that this is a disputed issue of law, not a disputed fact), this Court can assess those factors without conducting an evidentiary hearing based upon the record of proceedings in this case and the First Bankruptcy.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
