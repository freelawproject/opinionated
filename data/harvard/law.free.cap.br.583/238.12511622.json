At the time of the petition, they lived in a large home and estate located at 757 South Moon Beam in Eagle, Idaho (the \"Residence\"). The Residence is located on property adjoining a 40 acre lake. In addition to the main house, there is a large garage with a guest house. The Residence includes significant landscaping, pools and spas, a private beach area, and a dock into the lake.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Tim generates virtually all income for the family and manages all of the businesses and household finances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Kim was a stay-at-home mother while their son, Jeff, was younger. As of the petition date, she generated $1,200 per month in income by providing cleaning services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Kim's role in regard to the family finances is minimal and essentially limited to making bank deposits and issuing checks at Tim's request. However, Kim had full access to family accounts and the ability to spend freely, even though Debtors would generally discuss purchases in excess of $10,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In 2001, Tim purchased a $31,000 diamond and platinum ring (the \"Ring\") for Kim as a replacement for her original wedding ring.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2007, Kim worked with a jeweler to do a customized rebuilding of the Ring at an additional cost of $4,510.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Tim, Kim loved the Ring and wore it every day unless it was being repaired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In June 2010, the Ring was appraised in order to have it added to Debtors' homeowner's insurance policy. That appraisal established a value of $46,295.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Using the appraisal, Kim obtained a rider to Debtors' homeowner's insurance policy, effective July 2010, insuring the Ring in that amount.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Debtors initial bankruptcy schedules listed several items of jewelry with a total value of $9,250.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   On April 21, 2015, the UST sent Debtors' counsel a letter requesting additional information and documentation including copies of insurance\n   policies with any jewelry riders. The following day, Debtors amended their schedule B to add a \"Ladies platinum and diamond band\" valued at $2,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 8, 2015, in response to the UST's request, Debtors provided the UST a copy of their homeowner's insurance policy, which included a rider for a ladies platinum and diamond ring insured for $46,295.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, a notation on the rider in Tim's handwriting stated \"Paula / Kim Moms ring paula has\" [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] and \"she paid us for insuring it while she lived with us.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On May 22, 2015, during Debtors' \u00a7 341(a) meeting, Kim was asked about the $46,295 ring listed on the insurance policy. Kim testified that the reference was to a ring belonging to her sister, Paula Hull (\"Paula\"), and that Paula's ring was insured on the Debtors' policy because Paula was living with them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   A year later, in discovery responses, Debtors acknowledged the ring listed on the policy rider was not \"Paula's ring\" but instead referred to Kim's Ring that had been valued at $46,295.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Debtors asserted the Ring was no longer in their possession because Kim had thrown it into the lake behind their Residence following marital troubles and a fight, it was never recovered, and thus they had no interest in the Ring at the time of the petition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   The discovery responses also asserted that Kim's testimony at the May 2015 \u00a7 341(a) meeting about the $46,000 ring was mistaken because she assumed the questions referred to Paula's ring. They also stated that, when questioned, Kim \"did not remember the $46,000 [R]ing that had previously been thrown in the lake.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   At trial, Kim elaborated upon the circumstances that led her to throw the Ring in the lake. Kim testified that she discovered in December 2014 that Tim had been having an affair. This created marital tension that culminated on February 14, 2015-Valentine's Day-when Kim removed the Ring that reminded her of Tim's infidelity and threw it into the lake behind the Residence. Tim testified that Debtors believed the Ring was \"cursed.\" He was not upset that Kim threw it in the lake because he understood her feelings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   At trial, Ryan Jamison (\"Jamison\"), a scuba diver who also does underwater search and salvage, testified that Tim contacted\n   him in May of 2016 to discuss searching for the Ring in the lake behind the Residence. Jamison agreed to do so. However, Tim then told Jamison that he had been advised to postpone searching for the Ring.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On June 3, 2016, Tim ordered a replica of the Ring to be made by the same jeweler who rebuilt the Ring. The replica cost $9,000, reflecting the fact that the main stone was a cubic zirconia rather than a natural diamond. Kim had not expressed a desire to have a replica, but Tim stated he ordered the replica as a surprise for Kim's 50th birthday, believing she would appreciate the gift because she was so fond of the Ring and he thought the new ring would symbolize a new start for Debtors' marriage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   It was only in May 2017, shortly before trial, that Tim once again contacted Jamison and hired him to search for the Ring. On May 31, 2017, Jamison and his brother met at the Residence and together searched the lake. Initially, Jamison was unable to locate the Ring. He then asked Kim to throw rocks into the lake so he could judge her throwing range. After that exercise, Jamison moved closer to shore and, ultimately, located the Ring.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Upon exiting the water, he gave the ring to Debtors' attorney, who was present during the search. Debtors' attorney then contacted the UST and Trustee to notify them about the recovery of the Ring. The Ring was delivered to the Trustee at trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Analysis and disposition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The UST's \u00a7 727(a)(2) cause of action requires the Court to determine whether (1) Debtors concealed the Ring and (2) whether such concealment was done with actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor or the trustee. And, under \u00a7 727(a)(4), the Court must determine whether Debtors knowingly and fraudulently made material false oaths about the Ring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   For purposes of this opinion, the Court focuses on the defense that the Ring was tossed in the lake on February 14, 2015, and Debtors forgot to mention anything about it in their April 16, 2015 bankruptcy filings or their subsequent filings. There are, of course, two possible scenarios. One is that the Ring was thrown into the lake in February 2015. The other is that the\n   Ring was concealed, but not thrown into the lake until some later point in time, where it was recovered on the eve of trial by Jamison. But the Court finds that, under either scenario, there was concealment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   There is no evidence conclusively establishing when the Ring entered the lake. However, even if it was thrown into the water in February 2015, Debtors were certainly aware of it when discussing a filing and meeting with counsel just weeks after the event. This event, and the marital discord that fomented it, was significant and dramatic. The Ring was obviously very valuable and personally symbolic. Debtors knew the Ring might be recovered and briefly considered that course of action. But Debtors did not disclose anything regarding the situation in their filings or to Trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Kim explained that their scheduled jewelry list omitted the Ring because they no longer had the Ring at the time they prepared that list. This suggests their manner of scheduling was the result of a conscious decision not to include the Ring because it was \"gone.\" Even crediting Debtors' testimony that the Ring was \"gone,\" it still existed, and was Debtors' property on the date of filing, despite Debtors allegedly not having immediate physical possession of it. There was no impediment to listing the Ring as property of the estate and explaining the circumstances of its location,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that it was \"in the lake behind our house at 757 S. Moon Beam, Eagle, ID.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , sched. B (allowing debtors to provide both \"Description\n   <em>\n    and Location\n   </em>\n   of Property\"). Why they did not do so was not adequately explained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   And if Debtors truly believed the Ring irretrievably gone, they did not disclose or explain on their statement of financial affairs (\"SOFA\") the loss of this valuable asset mere weeks before filing. Tim said, referring to the SOFA's language, this was because the Ring's loss was not one resulting from fire, theft, other casualty, or gambling. He testified, though, that he knew the Ring was in the lake, that Kim had thrown it there, and that it could be retrieved. However hypertechnically Debtors wished to read SOFA question no. 8, it is undoubtedly clear that they\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   have disclosed the \"loss\" of the Ring, provided its \"description and value\" and a \"description of circumstances [of loss]\" and the \"date of loss.\" They did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Inconsistent with her other explanation, Kim stated that Debtors' failure to disclose the Ring in their schedules and SOFA was simply inadvertent, and the result of their forgetting about the Ring thrown in the lake because it was not in the pile of jewelry Kim collected and used when listing their jewelry in their schedules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Context matters in determining Debtors' states of mind when failing to disclose the Ring. Tim first met with potential bankruptcy counsel in the fall of 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Debtors thereafter met with the bankruptcy attorney who represents them in this case on or about February 23, 2015, just nine days after the Ring was purportedly thrown in the lake.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given the dramatic disposal of\n   the Ring, the Ring's value (both monetary and sentimental), and the fact that the event occurred a little over one week prior to meeting with bankruptcy counsel and less than two months before bankruptcy, Kim's explanation of such a short memory is difficult to accept.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The question of concealment is not limited solely to Debtors' failure to disclose assets initially in their schedules and SOFA. Debtors' subsequent conduct in response to inquiry about the Ring is relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   On April 21, 2015, the UST sent a letter seeking copies of homeowner's insurance policies including jewelry riders from Debtors. The next day, Debtors amended their schedules to include a \"platinum and diamond\" wedding band, but one valued at only $2,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Debtors then provided a copy of an insurance rider showing a ring valued at over $46,000. At no time during these inquiries did Debtors disclose Kim's $46,000 platinum and diamond Ring, nor did they advise that she had thrown that Ring into the lake in a fit of anger shortly before bankruptcy. Instead, upon questioning by Trustee, Debtors claimed this was \"Paula's ring\" and did not identify or address Kim's Ring. This assertion about the insured ring being Paula's was made under oath at their May 22, 2015 meeting of creditors. Debtors now claim that they were simply confused at the meeting of creditors, arguably because they had not had an opportunity to review the insurance rider for clarity. Debtors' professed confusion regarding the ring listed on their insurance policy with a $46,000 value is not persuasive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   After careful consideration of the entirety of the evidentiary record and-importantly-the evaluation of the credibility of Tim and Kim, the Court finds Debtors concealed the Ring. Debtors failed to list the Ring in their schedules and SOFA. They continued to conceal the Ring when specifically questioned by Trustee about the $46,295 ring listed on Debtors' homeowner's insurance policy by explaining that the ring listed belonged to Paula. The Court further finds that both Tim and Kim concealed the Ring with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud Trustee. The UST met its burden of showing that Debtors' discharges should be denied pursuant to \u00a7 727(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The evidence further leads the Court to find that Debtors made false oaths regarding the Ring-both by failing to disclose the Ring in their schedules and SOFA and by misstating on multiple occasions that the rider on their homeowner's insurance policy referred to Paula's ring. These false oaths were material, as they related to property of the estate and detrimentally affected Trustee's ability to administer the estate. Further, the Court finds Debtors knew the oaths were false and were not the result of inadvertent omissions. Rather, Debtors' false oaths were done with the requisite intent to prevent Trustee from discovering the existence of the Ring. The UST met its burden of showing that Tim's and Kim's discharges should be denied pursuant \u00a7 727(a)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    B. High Valley Cabin\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Tim's attorney, Dennis Charney (\"Charney\"), had purchased a cabin located at 54\n   Ranch Circle in High Valley, Idaho (\"High Valley Cabin\") from James Garske (\"Garske\"). Garske had a mortgage with Wells Fargo secured by the High Valley Cabin, which was serviced with the funds Charney paid to Garske. In April 2014, Tim began discussions with Charney about purchasing the High Valley Cabin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The agreement ultimately reached in 2014 listed Tim and Kim as \"buyers\" and Charney as \"seller.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties agreed to a purchase price of $225,000 and Debtors were to make $1,500 per month \"lease\" payments to Charney, several large \"annual interest payments,\" and a $35,000 balloon payment after 36 months (this last payment was to be used to pay the remaining balance of Garske's Wells Fargo loan). The agreement provided that \"[u]ntil such time as the Wells Fargo note is paid this agreement shall constitute a lease.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Despite listing Tim and Kim as the buyers, the agreement was signed by Tim and\n   <em>\n    Jeff\n   </em>\n   on April 21, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   Then, on May 22, 2014, Charney emailed the homeowners' association for the High Valley Cabin regarding the \"new owners at 54 Ranch Circle\" and he provided Debtors' contact information to the development's homeowners' association (\"HOA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   Shortly thereafter, the HOA sent an email to the various owners notifying them of an upcoming meeting. In response, Tim explained to the HOA that he would try to attend the meeting but Kim would not be able to attend; Tim did not mention Jeff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   On October 27, 2014, Jeff signed another lease/purchase agreement for the High Valley Cabin. Ex. 201.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   This second agreement is identical to the agreement signed by Tim and Jeff in April 2014, except that it lists Jeff alone as the \"buyer\" rather than Tim and Kim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   When filing their bankruptcy petition in April 2015, Debtors did not list the High Valley Cabin, or any interest therein, on their schedules. During their meeting of creditors, Debtors were specifically asked about any interests in real property they had in the prior 10 years. They made no mention of the High Valley Cabin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, at a minimum, Tim had a putative lessee interest, and a \"purchase\" right in the year prior to filing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The UST eventually became aware of the High Valley Cabin through legal counsel\n   for Idaho Trust Bank and began making specific inquiries regarding Debtors' interest. As part of the process, the UST indicated an intent to subpoena the HOA. In order to avoid the HOA being surprised by this request, Tim sent an email notifying the HOA that it would be receiving a subpoena for records and emails related to Debtors. In that email, Tim explained that \"Dennis Charney agreed to cancel our lease prior to our [bankruptcy] filing and my son Jeff wanted to start a new one with him[.]\" Tim told the HOA he had forgotten to forward Jeff's contact information to it earlier, and he provided Jeff's email address.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Analysis and disposition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The UST claims Debtors knowingly and fraudulently concealed the transfer of, and knowingly and fraudulently made material false oaths regarding, their interests in the High Valley Cabin. It is undisputed that both Debtors had knowledge of-at a minimum-a lease interest in the High Valley Cabin and failed to schedule such interest or disclose on the SOFA the transfer of such interest. It is also undisputed that Debtors failed to disclose the prior interest or its transfer when questioned at their \u00a7 341(a) meeting. The question is whether Debtors' conduct was done with fraudulent intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Debtors claim they had no fraudulent intent. Rather, Debtors claim they had only leased the High Valley Cabin and did not believe a lease was an interest that required disclosure-either in Debtors' initial schedules and SOFA or thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   While the agreement with Charney provided that it would remain a lease for a period of time,\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   the purchase provisions of the agreement undermine Debtors' claim that it was solely a lease. The agreement is a lease and purchase agreement listing Tim and Kim as \"buyers\" and Charney as \"seller\" of the High Valley Cabin. Its terms provided for a $225,000 purchase price, and required $1,500 monthly payments plus a $35,000 balloon payment. Debtors' claim that they \"only\" had a lease interest in the High Valley Cabin is not credible. Moreover, even a mere lease interest was within Trustee's questioning about \"any interest\" Debtors had in real property over the preceding ten years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   At trial, Tim stated that, at the time Debtors filed their petition, they no longer had any interest in the High Valley Cabin and, therefore, there was nothing to disclose. Tim testified he determined Debtors could not afford the High Valley Cabin, and Charney agreed to terminate the agreement. Jeff then signed a new agreement with identical terms except Tim and Kim were not parties. Thus, even in Tim's version, the joint interest in the cabin was transferred back to Charney about six months before bankruptcy. Tim knew this transfer occurred. And he knew when it occurred. The email to the HOA, Ex. 205, adequately reflects this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   However, contrary to Debtors' claim that they could no longer afford the High Valley Cabin and simply desired to be released from their obligation under the lease, the record indicates a transfer of Debtors' interest in the High Valley Cabin was contemplated even prior to entering into the original April 21, 2014 agreement signed by Tim and Jeff. On April 17, Charney suggested Tim move forward with signing the lease/purchase agreement and\n   that Jeff or a corporation could purchase the High Valley Cabin in the future in order to \"keep it under the radar,\" referring to shielding the High Valley Cabin from Debtors' creditors. Tim responded \"[y]ou are right on. Lets [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] write it up.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Debtors were asked at their \u00a7 341 meeting about a check in the amount of $111 for the purchase of a light for a cabin. In response, Debtors testified under oath that they were confused about the check and that they would not have purchased a light in Idaho and shipped it to a different cabin in California, which Tim admitted to holding through an LLC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   Kim said \"I don't know why I put cabin there either\" and Tim later responded \"[w]e only have one cabin, so,\" and laughed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   Again, Debtors had the opportunity to disclose their interest in, or transfer of, the High Valley Cabin, but they failed to do so. Trustee only learned about Debtors' interest in the High Valley Cabin several months later when she was contacted by legal counsel for Idaho Trust Bank. Adv. Doc. No. 72 at 595. At trial, Kim admitted she was aware of the High Valley Cabin at the time of Debtors' \u00a7 341 meeting and that the light was purchased for the High Valley Cabin. However, she claimed that she purchased the light \"for Jeff.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Debtors attempt to finesse the requirements of schedule and SOFA disclosures by focusing on the nature of the interest as a mere lease. Their interpretations are strained, and their justifications for nondisclosure are unpersuasive. Debtors' knowledge of the existence and subsequent transfer of their lease/purchase interest shortly before bankruptcy, the financial circumstances then existing, and the incomplete and evasive responses to inquiries at their \u00a7 341 meetings, support a finding that Debtors' concealment of the High Valley Cabin and its transfer was done with intent to hinder, delay, and frustrate Trustee's administration of the estate, and that Debtors' false oaths were made knowingly and fraudulently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   It would have been far easier, as well as more forthright, for Debtors to have simply explained the interest in the High Valley Cabin, their transactions with Charney, and their surrender of their interest in favor of Jeff's sole interest six months before filing. More importantly, it was required. The UST has met its burden of showing Debtors' discharges should be denied pursuant to \u00a7 727(a)(2) and (a)(4) as a result of concealment of, and false oaths made in connection with, interests in the High Valley Cabin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Bankruptcy debtors are required to make full and complete disclosure of all assets and liabilities at the time of filing and transactions and events regarding their assets for a significant period prior to filing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 521; Fed.

Using that approach, Debtors listed a $5,000 Rolex watch, a $2,500 woman's wedding ring, other watches valued at $1,000, a man's wedding ring worth $500, and miscellaneous costume jewelry valued at $250.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"17\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Ex. 118 at 4.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Exs. 120, 122.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    Ex. 122 at 7.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"20\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    Ex. 231 at 78-79. Debtors explained that in June 2012, Paula had gone through a divorce, was having financial difficulties, and began living in Debtors' guest house, which continued until January 2015. Kim and Paula both testified that in the latter part of 2012 Paula, given her financial circumstances, was contemplating selling a wedding ring that she had inherited from their mother (\"Paula's ring\"). Kim, wanting Paula's ring to stay in the family because of its sentimental value, offered to purchase it from Paula. According to Kim and Paula, they agreed to value Paula's ring at $25,000 (based upon sentimental value alone, since Paula's ring had not been appraised), and that Kim would make payments of $1,000/month ($250/week) until the ring was paid for in full. If Kim quit making payments, all sums paid to Paula would be forfeited. Kim made payments of approximately $11,000. However, when she determined she could no longer afford to make the payments, Kim returned Paula's ring to Paula and forfeited the $11,000. Thereafter a second agreement between Kim and Paula was signed on March 3, 2016, under which the ring was again sold to Kim for $25,000 with $250 payments required monthly rather than weekly.

Doc. No. 78 at 6. This is not entirely accurate. What Thompson did say was that platinum is anti-corrosive, and that it could be readily cleaned. When asked if the Ring was in a condition consistent with being in the water for two years, he agreed \"depending on how well it was cleaned up once it came out of the lake.\" On cross-examination Thompson was asked: \"And do you think you would be able to distinguish how a ring looked that had been submerged for six months as opposed to a year?\" He replied: \"I don't know if I could give you a definitive time frame saying this ring was in the water for six months or this one was in for a year, unfortunately.\" Adv.

It is not clear from the record whether the first agreement signed by Tim and Jeff was actually terminated. Tim, Jeff, and Charney all claim that Tim was released from the agreement, but the Court was provided with nothing to substantiate this claim. The parties appear to assert that the execution of the second agreement automatically terminated the agreement signed by Tim. For purposes of assessing Tim's intent, the Court will assume, without finding, that the agreement was terminated when Jeff signed the second agreement. It is clear the parties believed such was the case and Tim's intent was based upon such belief.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"40\">\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    Ex. 231 at 61-71.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"41\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    Ex. 205.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"42\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    As explained above, the agreement provided it would be a lease until the Wells Fargo note was paid.
