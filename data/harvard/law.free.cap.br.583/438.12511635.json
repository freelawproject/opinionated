Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case is before the Court on the motion filed by the Chapter 7 Trustee entitled \"Trustee's Motion for Approval of Sale Procedures and for Order Transferring Liens and Other Interests to Sale Proceeds\" (Docket # 336, the \"Trustee Sale Motion\"). The Debtor Glenn Underwood (the \"Debtor\"), timely filed an objection to the Trustee Sale Motion, on March 5, 2018 (Docket # 345, the \"Objection\"). No other party in interest has filed an objection to the Trustee Sale Motion, and the deadline for doing so was March 8, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the following reasons, the Court concludes that a hearing on the Trustee Sale Motion and the Debtor's Objection is not necessary, and that the Debtor's Objection must be overruled. That leaves no objections to the Trustee Sale Motion, and the Court will grant that motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Matters falling within this category in \u00a7 1334(b) are deemed to be core proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allard v. Coenen\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    In re Trans-Industries, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4130716\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/419/21/#p27\">\n    419 B.R. 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 27 (Bankr. E.D. Mich. 2009). This is a proceeding \"arising in\" a case under title 11, because it is a proceeding that \"by [its] very nature, could arise only in bankruptcy cases.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4130716\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/419/21/#p27\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4130716\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/419/21/#p27\">\n    at 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Trustee's Sale Motion seeks approval to sell the bankruptcy estate's real property located at 6185 &amp; 6085 White Lake Road, White Lake Township, Michigan (together, the \"Real Property\"), for $211,000.00 or for a higher amount, if any, that may be bid for the Real Property. The motion also seeks approval of procedures relating to the sale of the Real Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Debtor's Objection falls into two categories: (1) an argument that the Real Property has a market value higher than the proposed $211,000.00 sale price, and arguments made to support that conclusion; and (2) various arguments unrelated to the value of the Real Property or the Trustee's proposed sale procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As to the second of these objection categories, the Court must reject all the Debtor's arguments, because in making these arguments the Debtor is merely attempting to relitigate numerous issues that have already been conclusively decided by final orders that are no longer appealable. This the Debtor cannot do, under the doctrines of res judicata, collateral estoppel, the\n   <em>\n    Rooker-Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine, the law-of-the-case doctrine, and under the appellate mandate doctrine. This prohibition on relitigation has been explained several times, in the prior orders and opinions of this Court and of the United States District Court (in rejecting the Debtor's appeals).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As to the first of the above Debtor-objection categories, the Debtor asserts that the fair market value of the Real Property is $287,000.00. (Objection at 2). The Court construes this as an argument that the Trustee's proposed sale price of $211,000.00 (which is subject to possible higher bids), is unreasonably low, compared to the market value of the Real Property. The Court concludes that the Debtor lacks standing to make this objection, for the following reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Even if the Trustee was proposing to sell the Real Property for a price equal to what the Debtor says is its market value-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , $287,000.00-the Debtor would be no better off financially than if the Real Property sells for the $211,000.00 proposed amount. Thus, the Debtor has no financial stake in the outcome of his objection regarding the sale price of the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Court has previously discussed the concept of debtor standing to make objections in a Chapter 7 case, most recently in the case of\n   <em>\n    In re DiNoto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269355\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/576/835/\">\n    576 B.R. 835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. E.D. Mich. 2017). That case discussed the standing concept in the context of holding that a Chapter 7 debtor lacks standing to object to a creditor's proof of claim, unless the debtor shows that the case is likely to be a \"surplus\" case. The reasoning that leads to that conclusion applies equally to a debtor who tries to object to a Chapter 7 trustee's sale motion on the ground that the sale price is too low. In the\n   <em>\n    DiNoto\n   </em>\n   case, this Court explained the standing concept in this way:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The general rule is that a debtor in a Chapter 7 case does not have standing to object to a proof of claim. This is because, in the vast majority of Chapter 7 cases, it makes no financial difference to the debtor whether claims are paid by the Trustee or in what amount claims are paid.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), a proof of claim is deemed allowed unless a \"party\n   in interest\" objects.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3008. The Bankruptcy Code nowhere defines the term \"party in interest.\" The vast majority of courts have held that only a Chapter 7 trustee may file objections to a proof of claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    United States v. Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11110733\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/260/415/#p418\">\n    260 B.R. 415\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 418 (E.D. Mich. 2000) (collecting cases).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Generally, to have standing in a bankruptcy case, a person must have a pecuniary interest in the outcome of the bankruptcy proceedings. One rule that follows from this \"pecuniary interest\" standard is that an insolvent Chapter 7 debtor generally does not have standing to object to claims, because he is considered to have no interest in how his assets are distributed among his creditors and is held not to be a party in interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    In re Moss\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9027304\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/320/143/#p149\">\n    320 B.R. 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 149 (Bankr. E.D. Mich. 2005). \"In fact, almost every court that has dealt with the issue of a Chapter 7 debtor's standing to object, has held that unless there is going to be a surplus, debtors do not have standing to object to a proof of claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11110733\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/260/415/#p418\">\n    260 B.R. at 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is so because only when there is a surplus in the bankruptcy estate-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the assets in the estate exceed in value the amount necessary to pay all allowed administrative expenses and all allowed creditor claims in full with interest-will the debtor be entitled to any distribution from the estate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20726\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Further,\n   <strong>\n    in trying to demonstrate standing, \"the [D]ebtor cannot simply claim that there is a theoretical chance of a surplus in the estate, but must show that such surplus is a reasonable possibility.\"\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    Simon v.

Rather, the record shows that there is no possibility of a surplus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   If the Real Property were sold for $287,000.00, the proceeds of that sale first would be reduced by the required payment of approximately $22,000.00 in outstanding property taxes on the Real Property,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the normal costs of sale, including a standard 6% real estate commission.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Of these costs of sale, the 6% real estate commission alone would equal $17,220.00. Deducting only the property taxes and the real estate commission (a total of $39,220.00) brings the net proceeds of sale down to $247,780.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   From this amount, before the Debtor could receive any distribution, the Trustee would be required to make distributions that paid in full all of the creditors of the bankruptcy estate according to the priority rules of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20726\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -including first, full payment of allowed Chapter 7 administrative expenses (including a Trustee fee and allowed fees of the Trustee's counsel); second, full payment of all allowed Chapter 11 administrative expenses, if any; third, payment in full of all other allowed priority claims, if any; and fourth, full payment of all other allowed unsecured claims, plus interest on such claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20726\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) - 726(a)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In this case, the statutory fee for the Chapter 7 Trustee under the commission percentages provided in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20326\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and 330(a)(7), on distributions totaling $247,780.00, would be $15,639.00. The allowed amount of fees for the Chapter 7 Trustee's counsel remains to be determined. The amount of allowed Chapter 11 administrative expenses, if any, is not necessarily known yet. As for the other unsecured claims in this case, we know, at a minimum, that the allowed claim of the judgment creditors Patricia Selent, et al. is $200,823.00 plus interest,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Chapter 11 Liquidating Agent, Gene Kohut, reasonably estimated as of April 20, 2017, that the unpaid balance on that allowed claim is $266,744.09.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, the Claims Register and the proofs of claim filed in this bankruptcy case show that the unsecured claims other than the claim of the judgment creditors Patricia Selent, et al., total at least $62,730.35.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   From these numbers, it appears that a total of\n   <em>\n    more than\n   </em>\n   $345,113.44 ($15,639.00 + $266,744.09 + $62,730.35 = $345,113.44) would have to be paid by the Trustee to creditors in this case before the Debtor would be entitled to receive any surplus distribution under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20726\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6). But nothing close to this\n   amount would be paid by the $247,780.00 in maximum net sale proceeds,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   calculated above, that the estate would realize from a sale of the Real Property by the Chapter 7 Trustee,\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   the Real Property were sold for the $287,000.00 market value alleged by the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   From these numbers, it is clear that the Debtor has no financial stake in the outcome of the Trustee's Sale Motion, or in the outcome of his objection that the Trustee's proposed sale price is too low. And the Debtor's Objection does not demonstrate, or even allege, otherwise. Thus, the Debtor lacks standing to object to the Trustee's proposed sale of the Real Property on the ground that the price is too low. That objection by the Debtor to the sale therefore must be overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   For the reasons stated in this opinion, the Court will enter an order overruling the Debtor's Objection. Because no other objections have been filed, and because the Court finds that the Trustee Sale Motion is well taken and should be granted,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court instructs the Trustee to submit a proposed order granting his motion.
