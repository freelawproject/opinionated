Seibert (\"Seibert\") appeals the September 28, 2017 decision of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Minnesota (\"Bankruptcy Court\") in the matter of\n   <em>\n    Cedar Rapids Lodge &amp; Suites, LLC v. Seibert (In re Seibert)\n   </em>\n   , 16-BKY-41993, 16-ADV-4103, which granted summary judgment to Appellees Cedar Rapids Lodge &amp; Suites, LLC, James T. Rymes, Rhonda Coborn, Michael Coborn, Scott Shisler, and Julie Shisler (\"Appellees\") in their adversary proceeding against Seibert. The Bankruptcy Court held that certain judgment debt that Seibert owes to Appellees was excepted from discharge in his bankruptcy. For the reasons set forth herein, the Court affirms the decision of the Bankruptcy Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Seibert is a real-estate developer. He was involved in a hotel development project in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. After the development project failed, Appellees sued Seibert in United States District Court for the Northern District of Iowa.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See Cedar Rapids Lodge &amp; Suites, LLC v. JFS Dev't, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 09-cv-175 (LRR/JSS) (N.D. Iowa).) Appellees alleged that Seibert fraudulently induced them to invest in the hotel development project and then mishandled the financing, construction, and management of the project. (Tr. of Sept. 26, 2017 Hr'g [Doc. No. 12] (\"Tr.\"), at 43.) The complaint alleged several claims, including civil racketeering (\"RICO\") and fraud. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43-44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court accurately described the Iowa case as \"a lengthy and highly contentious lawsuit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) During two and a half years of litigation, the Iowa court ruled on many motions to compel and motions for sanctions. (\n   <em>\n    See Cedar Rapids\n   </em>\n   , No. 09-cv-175 [Doc. Nos. 95, 103, 108,\n   113, 171, 193, 216, 246].) Less than a year after the suit was filed, the Iowa court granted Seibert's attorney's motion to withdraw from the case for Seibert's failure to pay fees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. No. 95] (Ruling on Pretrial Motions, at 2-4).) After that, Seibert continued to participate in the litigation pro se. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr., at 44.) The Iowa court granted Appellees' motion to compel Seibert to produce certain computer systems and hardware, and it ordered Seibert to pay the cost of forensic computer examination. (\n   <em>\n    Cedar Rapids\n   </em>\n   , No. 09-cv-175 [Doc. No. 164] (Order dated Oct. 3, 2011, at 2-3).) When Seibert failed to pay the cost of the forensic computer examination, the Iowa court granted Appellees' motion for contempt of court. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Appellees moved several times for sanctions against Seibert, asking the Iowa court to enter a default judgment for Seibert's discovery violations. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. Nos. 105, 136, 204, 238].) The Iowa court consistently declined to enter default judgment as a sanction. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. Nos. 108, 193, 216, 246].) The court found insufficient proof of bad faith in Seibert's discovery and pretrial practices to justify the harsh penalty of default judgment. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. No. 216] (Order dated Jan. 18, 2012, at 3-4, 7-8).) The Iowa court did enter a sanction against Seibert for failure to comply with witness and exhibit disclosure deadlines. The court held that Seibert would not be permitted to present witnesses or exhibits at trial that had not been disclosed in compliance with pre-trial disclosure deadlines. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After his attorney withdrew, Seibert continued to actively litigate the Iowa case for some time, filing motions and briefs opposing Appellees' motions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. Nos. 109, 116, 140-41, 148, 165].) He filed a motion for sanctions against the Plaintiffs' attorney, which was denied. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. Nos. 166, 193].) In late 2011, Seibert was diagnosed with cancer. He filed a motion to continue the trial date, at his oncologist's recommendation, until 90 days after a scheduled surgery. The Iowa court granted the motion to continue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. Nos. 205, 216].) Five months later, Seibert filed a motion to continue the trial date for 90 additional days while he began radiation treatment, which was also granted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. Nos. 237, 246].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On August 20, 2012, two days before the final pretrial conference was scheduled to take place, Seibert sent the Iowa court a letter stating, \"due to my health I will not be attending the pre-trial or trial in the upcoming weeks. I had been hopeful that my condition would improve, however the effects and side effects of my treatments have not subsided.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. No. 253].) Seibert did not move for another continuance and did not submit any additional documentation from his oncologist. When Seibert did not appear at the final pretrial conference, Appellees moved for a default judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 55(a). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. No. 255].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Iowa court delayed ruling on the motion for default judgment and scheduled an evidentiary hearing to determine damages. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. No. 257].) Seibert moved to continue the evidentiary hearing. The court denied Seibert's motion, instructing him that he could appear telephonically to accommodate his cancer treatments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. No. 261].) Seibert did not appear, in person or remotely, at the evidentiary hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [Doc. No. 267] (Order dated Oct. 24, 2012, at 2).) The court issued an order granting a default judgment for Seibert's\n   failure to appear, and awarding $12,176,735.22 for Seibert's fraud and RICO violations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-10.) The Iowa court made no specific factual findings about Seibert's liability. Instead, the court stated that the \" 'facts alleged in complaint are taken as true, except facts relating to the amount of damages.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Everyday Learning Corp. v. Larson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11127155\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/242/815/#p818\">\n    242 F.3d 815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 818 (8th Cir. 2001).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On June 30, 2016, Seibert declared bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. (Tr., at 42-43.) Appellees filed an adversary action in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Minnesota, seeking a determination that Seibert's judgment debt from the Iowa case was not dischargeable in bankruptcy. (Appellant's App. [Doc. No. 16], Ex. 2 [Doc. No. 16-1] (Adv. Compl.).) Appellees moved for summary judgment, arguing that the debt was dischargeable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A), because it was a debt obtained by \"false pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud.\" Appellees asserted that the Iowa court's judgment collaterally estopped Seibert from contesting that his judgment debt was obtained by fraud. (Tr., at 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court agreed. The Bankruptcy Court held that the only contested issue was whether collateral estoppel is applicable to a default judgment like the one entered against Seibert. (Tr., at 51.) The Bankruptcy Court stated that \"courts agree that a default judgment can serve as a basis for applying collateral estoppel if the party against whom the judgment is used had a full and fair opportunity to defend the claims.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52 (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Bush\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6470405,7417854\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/62/1319/\">\n    62 F.3d 1319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 1995) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Brandl\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6109099\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/179/620/\">\n    179 B.R. 620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. D. Minn. 1995) ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court rejected Seibert's argument that he did not have a full and fair opportunity to defend the suit because of his cancer, noting that the Iowa court had \"follow[ed] the recommendations of Mr. Seibert's oncologist\" when it continued the trial twice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53.) Additionally, the Bankruptcy Court pointed to an admission that Seibert had made earlier in the adversary proceeding, acknowledging that his decision to take a default had been informed by his bankruptcy attorney's advice \"not to participate in trial, for legal and tactical reasons.\" (\n   <em>\n    See In re Seibert\n   </em>\n   , 16-ADV-4103 [Doc. No. 16] (Resp. to Mot. of Thomas F. Miller to Withdraw, \u00b6 3); Tr., at 53-54.) Ultimately, the Bankruptcy Court found that Seibert \"actively and substantially participated\" in the Iowa suit, had a full and fair opportunity to defend the suit, and \"specifically chose not to participate in the trial or damages hearing.\" (Tr., at 54.) The Bankruptcy Court held that collateral estoppel applied to bar Seibert from contesting summary judgment, stating, \"[c]ollateral estoppel cannot be avoided by failing to appear and plead, especially when the party has been actively involved in the lawsuit up until the final trial or hearing on damages.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court determined that the damages award and attorneys' fees award from the Iowa suit were excepted from discharge in bankruptcy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57-58.) It further determined that Seibert's debt from an earlier judgment in that litigation, holding Seibert in contempt for discovery violations, was discharged in bankruptcy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Seibert now appeals, arguing that collateral estoppel does not apply to default judgments. (Appellant's Principal Br. [Doc. No. 15], at 24-28.) Seibert further argues that his default judgment should not have preclusive effect, because the Iowa court heard no contested evidence on the issue of fraud, and because he did not act in bad faith in taking the default judgment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31-38.) Finally, Seibert asserts that the\n   Bankrupty Court erred by failing to consider the mitigating circumstances surrounding his default judgment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38-41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Seibert argues that no exception applies which would permit collateral estoppel based on his default judgment, because the Iowa court did not make any findings of fact about his fraud, and because it explicitly rejected any finding of bad faith. (Appellant's Primary Br., at 31-38.) But the exception does not require factual findings in the prior action in order to give a default judgment preclusive effect.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part II.B. What matters is that the party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted abused the litigation process, not that the prior court actually decided the issue in question.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Daily\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6120748,7409453\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/47/365/\">\n    47 F.3d at 368-69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[D]enying preclusive effect to the RICO judgment on the ground that the issues relevant to discharge were not fully tried in that proceeding would permit Daily to delay substantially and perhaps ultimately avoid payment of the debt by deliberate abuse of the judicial process.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Seibert is correct that the exception permitting a default judgment to have preclusive effect ought to apply only when there has been bad faith litigation conduct. Seibert argues that the Iowa court specifically rejected Appellees' arguments that he had acted in bad faith. (Appellant's Primary Br., at 15-17.) But these decisions by the Iowa court concerned Appellees' earlier motions for sanctions, based on Seibert's failure to comply with a motion to compel and his failure to make certain pretrial disclosures. (\n   <em>\n    See Cedar Rapids\n   </em>\n   , No. 09-cv-175 [Doc. No. 216] (Order dated Jan. 18, 2012, at 3-4, 7-10).) They do not foreclose the conclusion that, based on his entire course of conduct in the litigation, Seibert acted in bad faith. Further, the Bankruptcy Court held that Seibert's debt arising from those decisions was not excepted from discharge. (Tr., at 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court did not expressly consider whether Seibert obstructed or frustrated litigation of the Iowa case in bad faith. But the evidence on the record is sufficient for this Court to find as a matter of law that he did. Seibert does not allege that any of the Bankruptcy Court's findings were clearly erroneous, so the Court considers it admitted that Seibert \"actively participated in the Iowa lawsuit over a nearly three-year period of time,\" and that he \"admitted he made the decision not to participate in the trial and take a default judgment for legal and tactical reasons.\" (Tr., at 44, 53.) Seibert claimed that his health prevented him from attending the pretrial conference. But he had already obtained two continuances based on his oncologist's recommendation, and he made no attempt to obtain another before the final pretrial conference. The Bankruptcy Court also found that Seibert was traveling for personal and business reasons in Florida at the time he failed to appear telephonically for the post-default damages hearing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45.) The Bankruptcy Court gave no weight to this fact, but this Court considers Seibert's willful refusal to appear, even telephonically, when he was physically able to travel to be further proof of bad faith conduct during the Iowa litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Seibert's failure to appear for the final pretrial conference prevented Appellees from trying the case to its conclusion after they had expended significant resources to litigate the case for years. His actions are comparable to those of the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Kelley v. Ahern\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354334\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/541/860/\">\n    541 B.R. 860\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (W.D. Wis. 2015). In\n   <em>\n    Kelley\n   </em>\n   , the court noted that the defendant \"forced [the plaintiffs] to expend the time and resources necessary to litigate the case until the very end, defaulting only after the parties had been litigating for almost three years.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354334\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/541/860/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354334\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/541/860/\">\n    at 864\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court found a strong case for preclusion, even though the defendant's counsel had withdrawn for failure to pay fees, because the defendant continued to litigate pro se \"for almost two years\" before the default, making it \"difficult to see Ahern's decision to skip the trial as anything other than a tactical decision.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354334\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/541/860/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Here, like in\n   <em>\n    Kelley\n   </em>\n   , Seibert's tactical decision to take a default judgment on the eve of trial was intended to frustrate the legal process. His averments that his health prevented him from appearing are belied by his failure to move for a continuance, and by his admission that his decision was for \"legal and tactical reasons.\" Seibert must be bound by the Iowa court's default judgment. To hold otherwise would \"give litigants who abuse the process and dignity of the court an undeserved second bite at the apple.\"\n   <em>\n    Docteroff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"22552,11888170\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/133/210/\">\n    133 F.3d at 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court holds that the Iowa court's default judgment estops Seibert from contesting the dischargeability of his judgment debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Based on the foregoing, and all the files, records, and proceedings herein,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT\n   </strong>\n   the Bankruptcy Court's September 28, 2017 Judgment is AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    The Iowa case involved several additional plaintiffs and defendants whose involvement is not relevant here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Appellees presented evidence that Seibert was in fact traveling in Florida during the evidentiary hearing, for personal and business reasons, but the Bankruptcy Court gave this fact \"no weight\" in its decision.
