Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On or around September 19, 2007, Plaintiff executed and delivered to Defendant a note and mortgage (\"Mortgage Loan\") in order to refinance a home located at 145 Craig Drive, Thornville, Ohio 40376. On November 7, 2008, Plaintiff filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   . According to Defendant's proof of claim filed March 18, 2009, as of commencement of Plaintiff's bankruptcy case, the Mortgage Loan had a balance of $123,817.31, which included an installment payment arrearage of $7,564.95. Plaintiff's confirmed Chapter 13 Plan provided for regular monthly payments on the Mortgage Loan to be made by \"conduit\" through the Chapter 13 Trustee. Plaintiff successfully completed the Plan, and on June 19, 2013, upon motion by the Chapter 13 Trustee, the Court entered an order deeming the Mortgage Loan current as of May, 2013 (the \"Mortgage Order\"). The Mortgage Order also directed Defendant to adjust the Mortgage Loan balance to reflect the balance delineated in the original amortization schedule as of May, 2013, and ordered that any amounts in excess of that balance were discharged. Thereafter, Plaintiff made his monthly mortgage payment on the Mortgage Loan for the months of June 2013 through December 2013, which is undisputed by Defendant. Notwithstanding the fact that Plaintiff maintained his monthly payments to Defendant, Defendant sent letters and mortgage statements to Plaintiff indicating the Mortgage Loan was delinquent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 21, 2013, the Court entered an order granting Plaintiff a discharge under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201328\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (the \"Discharge Order\"), and the bankruptcy case was closed on September 23, 2013. Upon motion filed by Plaintiff, the Court reopened Plaintiff's bankruptcy case on May 12, 2015. On May 19, 2015, Plaintiff, purportedly on behalf of himself and others similarly situated, commenced this adversary proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff's Amended Complaint, filed November 3, 2015, contends that Defendant failed to treat Plaintiff's Mortgage Loan as current following entry of the Mortgage\n   Order and Plaintiff's discharge, and sets forth detailed allegations that Defendant attempted to collect, and actually collected, thousands of dollars in discharged fees from Plaintiff. The Amended Complaint further alleges that Defendant has a uniform set of policies and procedures for servicing mortgage loans, that Defendant has routinely failed to correct its records following a debtor's receipt of a Chapter 13 discharge, and that Defendant systemically collects and/or attempts to collect discharged debts from Chapter 13 debtors. Thus, Plaintiff seeks relief on behalf of a Southern District of Ohio districtwide class of debtors (the \"Districtwide Class\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On behalf of Plaintiff and the Districtwide Class, the Amended Complaint requests an order finding Defendant in contempt, and seeks, along with other redress, an award of compensatory and punitive damages for Defendant's alleged violations of the discharge injunction imposed by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20524\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiff's Motion requests this Court determine as a matter of law that Defendant attempted to collect a debt in violation of the discharge injunction. Defendant argues that the one way intervention doctrine prohibits this Court from making a merit-based determination before deciding a motion to certify the class. In addition, Defendant asserts that there are genuine disputes of material fact that require the Motion be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

One primary purpose is to promote judicial economy and efficiency by avoiding multiple adjudications of the same issues. From the plaintiffs' perspective, class actions afford aggrieved persons a remedy when it is not economically feasible to obtain relief through the traditional framework of multiple individual damage actions as, for example, when each claim involves only a small dollar amount. Thus, the class action device enhances access to the courts by spreading litigation costs among numerous litigants with similar claims. From the defendants' perspective, a class action provides a single proceeding in which to determine the merits of the plaintiffs' claims and, therefore, may protect defendants from repeated and potentially inconsistent adjudications.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   5 MOORE'S FEDERAL PRACTICE \u00b6 23.02 (3d ed. 2017) (footnotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   When an action is brought by or against a person as a representative of a class, the court must determine, by order, whether to certify the action as a class action.

The court must conduct a \"rigorous analysis\" into whether all the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) and (b) have been met before certifying the suit as a class action or denying certification. The court must make its certification decision \"at an early practicable time\" after the action is filed, and must announce its decision in a formal order that defines the class and the class claims and appoints class counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   5 MOORE'S FEDERAL PRACTICE \u00b6 23.80[1] (3d ed. 2017) (footnotes and citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(c)(1)(A) provides that \"[a]t an early practicable time after a person sues or is sued as a class representative, the court must determine by order whether to certify the action as a class action.\" Fed.

By allowing putative class members to wait while the merits of a claim are decided, these members are given the ability to watch the proceedings without any risk to their individual claims which would be precluded by an adverse ruling on the merits. For this reason, courts often look to see if defendants, the risk-bearers in this situation, have waived any right to have the certification motions decided first.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Hyman v.

In contrast, Plaintiff posits that Defendant waived the right to object to a merit-based determination because it failed to object to the Court's Order Setting Deadlines (Doc. 44) (the \"Scheduling Order\") that established deadlines for merit-based discovery and dispositive motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court concludes that it is appropriate in this case to decide the Motion prior to a determination of class certification for two reasons: First, the Court held a pretrial conference on May 18, 2016 (the \"Pretrial\") which was attended by counsel for both Plaintiff and Defendant. After the Court and the parties discussed the progress of the litigation, Plaintiff suggested that the Court set deadlines for only merit-based discovery and dispositive motions. As is normal for the Court, it asked the parties whether the proposed procedure was acceptable to the parties, and neither Plaintiff nor Defendant objected or otherwise expressed concern. Accordingly, this Court finds that Defendant implicitly waived its right to have a class certification motion decided first.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hyman v. First Union Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11880714\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/982/8/#p11\">\n    982 F.Supp. 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 11 (D.D.C. 1997) (concluding that the defendants implicitly waived their right to have the certification motion decided first and finding that \"both parties cooperated with this court, without raising any objections or concerns, so that the summary judgment papers would be ripe at the same time the court would be considering the class certification issues\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Caraluzzi v.

Plaintiff and Defendant both attended the Pretrial and neither expressed any disagreement with or concern regarding the proposal that a merit-based determination be made prior to class certification in this case. Indeed, for over a year now the parties have proceeded under this mutual understanding that the Court was going to make a merit-based decision before a motion to certify class would be filed. Presumably Plaintiff relied upon the Scheduling Order and has expended a significant amount of time and resources on seeking only a merit-based determination from this Court at this stage of the litigation. For the Court to determine now after the litigation has progressed for over a year that it must hold the Motion in abeyance until a determination regarding class certification would be inequitable and uneconomical. To be sure, the parties would have to engage in class certification-based discovery before a motion could even be filed if the Court decided to hold the Motion in abeyance, causing yet more delay in this litigation. Accordingly, this Court finds that fairness and economy dictate that it decide the Motion now, before class certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Plaintiff's December 2013 Mortgage Loan statement indicated amounts due for the following items: (1) monthly mortgage payment in the amount of $936.29; (2) past due payments in the amount of $2,821.74; (3) lender paid expenses in the amount of $4,137.01; (4) unapplied funds balance in the amount of $994.76; and the total amount due of $6,900.28. The mortgage statement also indicated there was an additional fee if the payment was not received by a date certain (i.e., January 11, 2014). Defendant provides no explanation in its Response as to why the December 2013 mortgage statement indicated the total amount due was $6,900.28 even after Plaintiff made all the monthly mortgage payments after entry of the Mortgage Order.\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    The Court can draw\n    no conclusion but that the December 2013 Mortgage Loan statement was an attempt to collect discharged debt and violated the discharge injunction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    <strong>\n     b. December 23, 2013 Telephone Conversation\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Plaintiff also complains that Defendant attempted to collect $11,787.32 on December 23, 2013 when a representative informed Plaintiff by telephone that this amount constituted back payments and delinquent fees. Defendant counters by indicating it was Plaintiff that initiated the telephone call to Defendant to obtain information regarding his account. Defendant argues that it advised Plaintiff of the status of his account, and once Plaintiff indicated he disagreed with the information Defendant provided, it noted Plaintiff's payment dispute and created a research ticket regarding same. Each party supported its version of the facts with affidavit testimony, therefore, whether this communication between Plaintiff and Defendant was an attempt to collect a debt or was merely a communication meant to only provide information constitutes a genuine dispute of fact. Accordingly, this Court cannot determine for purposes of summary judgment whether this communication violated the discharge injunction based on the record before it.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    <strong>\n     c. December 27, 2013 Telephone Conversation\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Plaintiff alleges that shortly after the above referenced telephone conversation occurred, on December 27, 2013, Defendant contacted Plaintiff again by telephone and demanded that he pay an additional monthly payment plus $4,137.01 in lender fees. Defendant disputes this, and instead contends that it initiated a telephone call to Plaintiff in response to his previously submitted research request. Defendant further alleges that the initial telephone call was disconnected, and it was Plaintiff that called Defendant back to discuss Plaintiff's payment dispute. Defendant asserts that it advised Plaintiff to send copies of his checks to the research department as evidence of payment. Each party supported its version of the facts with affidavit testimony. Therefore, similar to the previously discussed telephone call made on December 23, 2013, whether the telephone conversation on December 27, 2013 was an attempt to collect a debt or was merely a communication meant to only provide information constitutes a genuine dispute of fact. Accordingly, this Court cannot determine for summary judgment, whether this communication violated the discharge injunction based on the record before it.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    <strong>\n     d. Letter dated January 2, 2014\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Plaintiff received a letter dated January 2, 2014 from Defendant advising that the Chapter 13 Bankruptcy status on Plaintiff's account had been updated to reflect Debtor's discharge. The same letter also explained that the monthly payment amount would be increasing based on Defendant's escrow analysis. And finally, the letter advised Plaintiff that his account was approximately two payments delinquent and was due for December 1, 2013 (a date post-discharge and post Chapter 13). This letter, though it advised of the new monthly payment amount and that the account was delinquent, it did not indicate a late fee would be charged if the payment was not received by a certain date nor did it indicate what the past due amount was. Thus, the Court finds that this letter was not an attempt to collect a discharged debt\n    but instead was provided for informational purposes only.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    <strong>\n     e. Letter dated January 13, 2014\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    In contrast, however, the letter dated January 13, 2014, that Defendant sent to Plaintiff was an attempt to collect a debt in violation of the discharge injunction. That letter advised Plaintiff that he had not made payments on the Mortgage Loan since December 1, 2013, and the failure to make the payments was a default under the terms of the Mortgage Loan. The letter specified a past due amount of $3,580.16,\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n    and in order to cure the default, Plaintiff had to pay the total past due amount plus any other amounts that would come due. The letter provided a date certain by which the past due amount must be received in order to cure the default. The letter further described how Plaintiff could make the payment and what to expect when calling Defendant on the telephone to do so. The letter advised that Defendant was not obligated to accept less than the full amount owed. The letter informed Plaintiff of the ramifications if the default was not cured (i.e., acceleration of the debt, foreclosure and sale of the property). And finally, the letter instructed Plaintiff that the default and any legal action that resulted from the default may be reported by Defendant to one or more local and national credit reporting agencies. The Court notes that this letter did contain a disclaimer that stated if the account holder had received a discharge in bankruptcy, the letter is not an attempt to collect a debt from the account holder personally, but was provided for informational purposes. This disclaimer, however, does not neutralize the remaining provisions of the letter that were designed to encourage if not coerce payment from Plaintiff.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Bruce\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2000%20WL%2035934238\">\n     2000 WL 35934238\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *, 2000 Bankr. LEXIS 2210, at *7 (Bankr. M.D.N.C. 2000) (finding that the disclaimer language in the mortgage statement was insufficient to negate the demand for payment). In the instant case, the letter sent by Defendant clearly emphasized the consequences if Plaintiff did not cure the default and required action by Plaintiff to retain his property. The disclaimer language in the letter is not sufficient to overcome the payment demand. Therefore, the Court finds this letter was an attempt to collect a discharged debt in violation of the discharge injunction.\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    <strong>\n     f. Letter dated August 13, 2014\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Plaintiff received a letter dated August 13, 2014 from Defendant that acknowledged receipt of Plaintiff's payment in the amount of $993.10 and indicated that the total amount required to bring Plaintiff's\n    loan account current was $3,972.40.\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n    Plaintiff asserts that he was current with his mortgage payments to Defendant through July 2014, but when he attempted to make his mortgage payment in August 2014, it was returned with the letter. In the Motion, Plaintiff provided evidence of same. Defendant did not, however, refute this assertion nor provide any evidence to the contrary in the Response. Therefore, the Court can only conclude that Plaintiff was current on his mortgage payments when the letter dated August 13, 2014 was sent to him. And it follows, therefore, that the $3,972.40 must have included fees and costs that were discharged in the bankruptcy case. Accordingly, the Court finds that this letter was an attempt to collect a discharged debt in violation of the discharge injunction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    <strong>\n     g. August 2014 telephone conversation\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Plaintiff also alleges that he received a telephone call from Defendant in August 2014 informing him that he needed to pay $8,109.41 to bring his mortgage loan current. As previously discussed, Plaintiff was current with his mortgage loan payments as of August 2014, and the Defendant neither disputed this nor provided evidence to the contrary in the Response. For the same reasons as stated above, the Court can only conclude that the request for Plaintiff to pay $8,109.41 must have included fees and costs that were discharged in Plaintiff's bankruptcy case. Therefore, the Court finds that the August 2014 telephone conversation was an attempt to collect a discharged debt in violation of the discharge injunction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Having demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that Defendant attempted to collect a discharged debt in violation of the discharge injunction, Plaintiff must also prove that Defendant did so with knowledge that the injunction was in place.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    <strong>\n     2. Knowledge of the Discharge Injunction\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Defendant was an active participant in Plaintiff's Chapter 13 proceeding, and as a result, had actual knowledge of the discharge injunction when it sent the letters and mortgage statement to Plaintiff.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Martinez\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175460\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/561/132/#p168\">\n     561 B.R. 132\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 168 (Bankr.

S.D. Ohio 2008) (intimating that actual knowledge can be established using the \"mailbox rule\" which provides that a presumption of receipt arises upon proof that the item was addressed properly, had sufficient postage, and was deposited in the mail). In this case, Defendant asserts that it never received a copy of the Mortgage Order or the Discharge Order. Notwithstanding, Defendant was scheduled as a secured creditor in Plaintiff's Chapter 13 case which was filed on November 7, 2008. Only seven days after Plaintiff filed his bankruptcy case, attorneys for Defendant, Joe M. Lozano, Jr. and Tyler Jones, filed a Request for Service of Notice (Doc. 17) requesting that all notices be mailed to Defendant at the following address: P.O. Box 829009, Dallas, Texas 75382-9009 (the \"Noticing Address\"). On March 18, 2009, Defendant filed a proof of claim (the \"POC\") and again indicated it wanted to be served documents at the Noticing Address. According to the record in this case, both the Mortgage Order and the Discharge\n    Order were mailed to Defendant at the Noticing Address. The entity responsible for serving bankruptcy court documents, the Bankruptcy Noticing Center (the \"BNC\"), filed certificates of notice (Docs. 84 and 85) on June 22 and 23, 2013, declaring under penalty of perjury that both the orders were mailed to Defendant at the Noticing Address. Accordingly, it is presumed that Defendant received both orders and thus had actual knowledge of them.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    In addition to receiving a copy of the orders, Defendant acknowledges that on July 17, 2013, Plaintiff called Defendant and advised that he had received his discharge in bankruptcy. Moreover, the letter dated January 2, 2014, that Defendant mailed to Plaintiff specifically stated that it had updated Plaintiff's account file to reflect the discharge! Defendant attempted to collect a debt even after both of these events.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    <strong>\n     IV. Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that Defendant (i) violated the discharge injunction (and thus the order granting the discharge) when it sent the December 2013 Mortgage Loan statement, the letter dated January 13, 2014, the letter dated August 13, 2014 and made the August 2014 telephone call to Plaintiff and (ii) did so with knowledge that the injunction was in place. The Court will determine whether the December 23, 2013 and December 27, 2013 phone calls and the letters dated February 7, 2014 and February 20, 2014 were violations of the discharge injunction in addition to the damages at a separately scheduled hearing on the matter.

The order dismissing the joint debtor was entered by this Court on July 31, 2009. Defendant further indicates that Plaintiff's account was transferred back to its bankruptcy department on February 3, 2010. Even if the order dismissing joint debtor caused some confusion within Defendant's internal departments, it eventually must have reconciled Plaintiff's account because the Mortgage Loan was deemed current without objection by Defendant when the Mortgage Order was entered by the Court on June 20, 2013. This theory certainly does not excuse Defendant's violation of the automatic stay.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"7\">\n    <p id=\"p-80\">\n     The past due amount necessarily included discharged debt because the Mortgage Loan was deemed current as of May 2013 after Plaintiff completed his Plan, and Plaintiff made all subsequent monthly payments through December 2013. According to Plaintiff's December 2013 Mortgage Loan statement, the monthly mortgage payment at that time was $936.29; so even if Plaintiff had missed a payment, or even two, at the time the January 13, 2014 letter was sent, the past due amount specified well exceeded one or two monthly mortgage payment amounts. Consequently, the Defendant must have been attempting to collect discharged debt.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"8\">\n    <p id=\"p-81\">\n     In the Motion, Plaintiff mentions two other letters sent by Defendant, one dated February 7, 2014 and another dated February 20, 2014, that indicated Plaintiff's loan account was past due and delinquent in the amount of $5,951. Plaintiff's affidavit attached to the Motion, however, fails to attest to these facts. Accordingly, the record lacks sufficient evidence from which this Court can make a determination as to whether these two letters were an attempt to collect a discharged debt in violation of the discharge injunction.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"9\">\n    <p id=\"p-82\">\n     Defendant advised in the same letter that it was returning the funds, however, because the amount of the payment received was insufficient to bring Plaintiff's loan account current.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
