Wise, Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Parties who settled an adversary proceeding have asked the Court to restrict public access to settlement-related documents filed in the record because they agreed to keep their settlement terms confidential. In fact, they suggest that the settlement will \"blow up\" if the Court does not seal the documents. But the parties have failed to show that they are entitled to this extraordinary relief, and the Court rejects the proffered \"no seal, no deal\" position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Debtor Brittany R. Thomas filed a class-action lawsuit in this Court (Adv. No. 17-2024) against AT &amp; T Corp. and DirecTV, LLC (the \"AP Defendants\"). Debtor quickly settled her individual claims with the AP Defendants. Debtor then moved the Court in her chapter 13 bankruptcy case to approve the settlement under Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9019\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and provided a copy of the fully-executed Settlement Agreement to the Court for review. And, because the parties want to keep the terms of their settlement confidential, Debtor also filed two motions [ECF Nos. 32, 39) ] (the \"Seal Motions\") to seal the Settlement Agreement and a related explanatory memorandum in the record in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   As explained below, documents in a bankruptcy court's record are presumptively accessible to the public.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20107\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The parties have failed to establish a basis to seal the records at issue under \u00a7 107(b) ; therefore, the Seal Motions will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Co-Debtors Brittany Thomas and Andrew Thomas filed a chapter 13 bankruptcy petition on April 19, 2017. Just over seven months later, Debtor Brittany Thomas filed an adversary proceeding against the AP Defendants, alleging generally\n   that they engaged in a repeated course of conduct that violated the automatic stay under \u00a7 362:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendants purposely disregard the Bankruptcy Code and illegally collect or attempt to collect amounts from debtors, which they are prohibited from collecting. Defendants' routine and persistent attempted collection and/or collection of prepetition obligations from debtors, are an abuse of process and are in violation of the automatic stay provided to Chapter 13 Debtors by Section 362(a) of the United States Bankruptcy Code (\"Code\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [AP No. 17-2024, ECF No. 1 \u00b6 2.] Not only did Debtor seek to proceed on her own behalf against the AP Defendants, she filed her Complaint as a proposed class action on behalf of \"[a]ll persons who entered into contracts for telecommunication services or satellite television services, with [the AP Defendants] between April 19th 2012 and the present, who filed then filed\n   <em>\n    [sic]\n   </em>\n   a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in the Eastern District of Kentucky and who received documents which substantially conform to\" documents sent to Debtor. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   About seven weeks after Debtor filed her Complaint, however, the parties filed a Notice of Settlement in the adversary proceeding. In her chapter 13 bankruptcy case, Debtor filed her first Seal Motion [ECF No. 32] and filed the fully-executed Settlement Agreement in the record under a provisional seal for the Court's review; it reflects a settlement between the AP Defendants and Debtor individually respecting the claims in the adversary proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Shortly thereafter, Debtor filed a Motion to Compromise Controversy Under Rule 9019 with AT &amp; T Corp. and DirecTV, LLC [ECF No. 35] (\"Motion to Compromise\"). Stating that Debtor and the AP Defendants \"have entered into the Settlement Agreement and Release which will be filed under seal with the Court,\" Debtor asked the Court \"to approve the [Settlement] Agreement and retain jurisdiction to enforce its terms.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In other words, Debtor halted her class action lawsuit in favor of a quick settlement of her own claims. Because she sought to settle post-petition claims that are property of her chapter 13 bankruptcy estate under \u00a7 1306(a)(1), Debtor moved the Court to approve the settlement. Thus, the Court must \"determine if the settlement is fair and equitable based on the facts of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Equine Oxygen Therapy Res., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 14-51611,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201331540\">\n    2015 WL 1331540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2, 2015 Bankr.

Due to the confidential and sensitive nature of the Settlement Agreement, the Debtor respectfully submits that no alternative method would adequately protect the Settlement Agreement.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.] Debtor also reports that she \"has delivered copies of the Settlement Agreement to the Court for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review, and either have\n   <em>\n    [sic]\n   </em>\n   delivered, or will deliver the Settlement Agreement to the Chapter 13 Trustee on a confidential basis.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Importantly, Debtor's motion does not offer any evidence to show that the Settlement Agreement falls within a category of documents subject to protection from disclosure under \u00a7 107(b).

[ECF No. 32-1.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Following an initial review of the two motions and the Settlement Agreement, the Court entered an Order scheduling a hearing, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The proposed order tendered with the Seal Motion [ECF 32-1] provides that the Settlement Agreement will be sealed in perpetuity absent party consent to unseal or a subsequent Court order. The proposed order does not contain any findings and conclusions that justify nondisclosure to the public, even though the Sixth Circuit requires such findings and conclusions and has held \"[t]he public has a strong interest in obtaining the\n   information contained in the court record.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. v.

E.D. Ky. May 19, 2017).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   In addition, the Motion to Compromise does not discuss the terms of the Settlement Agreement-presumably because Debtor seeks to seal this document. The Court cannot discern from the Settlement Agreement, temporarily filed under seal in the record pending the outcome of the Seal Motion, pertinent terms of the settlement, including the total proposed compensation to Debtor. The Court further notes that the Complaint in the adversary proceeding to be compromised via the Settlement Agreement (No. 17-2024) requests class action certification, but the settlement does not purport to settle the claims in the Complaint on behalf of the proposed class.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [ECF No. 38.] The Court permitted \"any party in interest\" to \"file further information or supplement the record\" prior to the scheduled hearing. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After this Order's entry, Debtor filed the second Seal Motion [ECF No. 39] and filed under a provisional seal a Supplemental Memorandum in further support of the Motion to Compromise. Debtor explains her request to seal the Supplemental Memorandum as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Debtor submits that the Supplemental Memorandum in Support of Motion to Compromise, which by this motion she seeks to file under seal, is filed in\n   <em>\n    [sic]\n   </em>\n   to provide a further factual basis for the Motion to Compromise, but for the same reasons which she sought to seal the settlement agreement which forms the basis for the Motion to Compromise, this Supplemental Memorandum in Support of Motion to Compromise must also be sealed.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [ECF No. 39 \u00b6 7.] The legal argument in the second Seal Motion is virtually identical to that in the first Seal Motion. Debtor did not file any evidence with the second Seal Motion to establish that either the Settlement Agreement or Supplemental Memorandum may be sealed under \u00a7 107(b)(1). And, again, Debtor's proposed order (1) does not contain any findings of fact or conclusions of law, and (2) would seal the Supplemental Memorandum in perpetuity absent a subsequent Court order. [ECF No. 39-1.] The Supplemental Memorandum does supply information in response to the Court's questions about the proposed disposition of settlement funds and the fact that the settlement resolves Debtor's claims alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Shortly thereafter, the AP Defendants also filed a Supplement to the Seal Motions. [ECF No. 40.] Their Supplement states that \"[t]he Defendants are unwilling to enter into the Settlement Agreement unless the terms thereof remain confidential\" and \"allowing the Settlement Agreement to be filed under seal would promote the efficient disposition of this dispute and further the public policy favoring settlement agreements.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.] The Supplement cites\n   <em>\n    In re Hemple\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"312081\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/295/200/\">\n    295 B.R. 200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr.

The parties opted to stand on their papers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Seal Motions ask the Court to seal\n   <em>\n    entire documents\n   </em>\n   (i.e., the Settlement Agreement and the Supplemental Memorandum explaining the settlement) in the Court's record\n   <em>\n    in perpetuity\n   </em>\n   or until a subsequent order is entered unsealing the documents. Debtors offer no explanation in the Seal Motions why both documents must be sealed in their entireties, and why that seal never should expire. At the hearing, the parties' counsel both agreed that the only information that would need to be sealed is the settlement amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   While the Sixth Circuit has not evaluated a motion to seal a court record in connection with \u00a7 107(b)(1), there can be little doubt that it would find Debtor's requests to seal records to be extraordinary. Indeed, the long-standing maxim in the Sixth Circuit is that \"[t]he public has a strong interest in obtaining the information contained in the court record.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. F.T.C.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1866398\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/710/1165/#p1176\">\n    710 F.2d 1165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1180 (6th Cir. 1983). However, given that a specific section of the Bankruptcy Code governs restricting public access to documents in the record, it is the Code, and not the Sixth Circuit authority relating to non-bankruptcy motions to seal, that is the starting point for the Court's analysis of the Seal Motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Section 107 of the Bankruptcy Code Provides the Framework for Assessing Whether a Bankruptcy Court may Restrict Access to Public Records.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In bankruptcy matters, Congress has codified a strong presumption in favor of public access to all papers filed therein: \"Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) and subject to section 112, a paper filed in a case under this title and the dockets of a bankruptcy court are public records and open to examination by an entity at reasonable times without charge.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20107\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Section 107(b), however, identifies certain narrow categories of documents that, notwithstanding the presumption, may be entitled to protection:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   On request of a party in interest, the bankruptcy court shall, and on the bankruptcy court's own motion, the bankruptcy court may-\n   (1) protect an entity with respect to a trade secret or confidential research, development, or commercial information; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (2) protect a person with respect to scandalous or defamatory matter contained in a paper filed in a case under this title.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20107\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Only \u00a7 107(b)(1) is at issue here; the parties contend that the Settlement Agreement and its terms constitute confidential \"commercial information\" under \u00a7 107(b)(1). [ECF No. 40 at 4 (\"Bankruptcy Rule 9018 provides that on motion, with or without notice, the Court may make any order which justice requires to protect the estate or any entity in respect of confidential commercial information.\").]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \" 'Commercial information' has been defined as 'information which would cause an unfair advantage to competitors by providing them information as to the commercial operations of the debtor' \" or another party.\n   <em>\n    In re Frontier Group, L.L.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11170012\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/256/771/#p773\">\n    256 B.R. 771\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 773 (Bankr.

In short, Debtors and the AP Defendants want to keep the terms of their settlement confidential and, thus, included a confidentiality provision in their Settlement Agreement. In fact, Debtors and the AP Defendants essentially tell the Court that there will be no settlement in the adversary proceeding if the terms of settlement are not kept confidential.
