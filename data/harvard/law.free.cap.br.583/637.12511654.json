Claims Against the Debtors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At the time the Renco Group commenced this adversary proceeding, hundreds of claims had been filed against the Debtors. The principal liabilities included the Bond Claims and various unliquidated environmental claims (collectively, the \"\n   <em>\n    Environmental Claims\n   </em>\n   \") asserted by,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\"\n   <em>\n    EPA\n   </em>\n   \") and the Department of Interior (the \"\n   <em>\n    DOI\n   </em>\n   ,\" and together with EPA, the \"\n   <em>\n    Government\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See Twenty-Seventh Interim Status Report of Chapter 7 Trustee\n   </em>\n   , filed on May 10, 2016 (the\n   <em>\n    27th Interim Report\n   </em>\n   \") \u00b6 52 [Case No. 01-14312, ECF No. 708].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Bond Claims arise out of a $150 million public bond offering by Metals in 1996 pursuant to the Indenture (the \"\n   <em>\n    1996 Bond Offering\n   </em>\n   \"), the obligations under which were guaranteed by MagCorp.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wilmington Trust Proofs of Claim \u00b6\u00b6 8-14; Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 12-20. According to the Wilmington Trust Proofs of Claim and the Complaint, as of the Petition Date, the aggregate amount owing to the Bondholders under the Indenture totaled $150 million in principal and nearly $19.6 million in interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wilmington Trust Proofs of Claim \u00b6 8; Compl. \u00b6 19.

This amount included,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the two Bond Claims and multiple claims filed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. It did not include the Environmental Claims which were significant, but unliquidated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   27th Interim Report \u00b6 52.

Fraudulent Transfer Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On July 31, 2003, the Trustee, on behalf of the Debtors, commenced a fraudulent transfer action (the \"\n   <em>\n    Fraudulent Transfer Litigation\n   </em>\n   \") against,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the Renco Group and its majority shareholder, Ira\n   Rennert (\"\n   <em>\n    Rennert\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   (the \"\n   <em>\n    Fr. Transfer Compl.\n   </em>\n   \") [Adv. Pro. No. 03-06559, ECF No. 2]. The action arose out of the 1996 Bond Offering and sought to recover certain dividend payments made to,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the Renco Group and Rennert that allegedly were avoidable under the Bankruptcy Code and under New York state law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fr. Transfer Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 115-50, 527-32, 609-14, 615-32, 639-43. The Fraudulent Transfer Litigation was first brought as an adversary proceeding before the Bankruptcy Court (Adv. Pro. No. 03-6559 (MKV) ), and thereafter, the District Court granted a motion to withdraw reference to the Bankruptcy Court.\n   <em>\n    See Order\n   </em>\n   [Adv. Pro. No. 03-06559, ECF No. 207].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Fraudulent Transfer Litigation was subsequently assigned to, and presided over, by the Honorable Alison J. Nathan (Case No. 13-cv-7948), who ultimately conducted a month-long trial. On February 27, 2015, the jury returned a verdict in the Trustee's favor, consisting of,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , a $101 million damages award against the Renco Group and a $16.2 million damages award against Rennert. On March 16, 2015, Judge Nathan issued a Memorandum and Order awarding the Trustee pre-judgment interest at the rate of 6%\n   <em>\n    per annum\n   </em>\n   from the Petition Date.\n   <em>\n    See Memorandum and Order\n   </em>\n   [Case No. 13-cv-7948, ECF No. 342]. The pre-judgment interest increased the overall judgment in that action to $214,697,948.44 (the \"\n   <em>\n    Fraudulent Transfer Judgment\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Renco Group and Rennert appealed the Fraudulent Transfer Judgment to the Second Circuit, and on March 8, 2017, the Second Circuit issued an order,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , denying the appeal and affirming the Fraudulent Transfer Judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Buchwald v.

The Renco Group's February 2015 Motion for Leave to Object to Creditors' Claims in the Debtors' Bankruptcy Cases\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   While the Fraudulent Transfer Litigation was pending in the District Court, the Renco Group began taking steps to challenge claims asserted against the Debtors. On December 30, 2014, the Renco Group sent a letter to the Trustee demanding that the Trustee begin bringing objections to claims, alleging,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that: (i) all of the claims asserted against Metals are subject to disallowance for a variety of reasons and (ii) expungement of the claims would have a significant impact with respect to the Fraudulent Transfer Litigation.\n   <em>\n    See Motion for Leave to Object to Creditors' Claims\n   </em>\n   (the \"\n   <em>\n    Standing Motion\n   </em>\n   \" or \"\n   <em>\n    Standing Mot.\n   </em>\n   \") Ex. C [Case No. 01-14312, ECF No. 681]. The Trustee responded by letter dated January 9, 2015 stating,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that: (i) the estates lacked the sufficient funds to litigate objections and (ii) he believed that the Renco Group's demand that he file certain objections was part of its litigation strategy designed to undermine the then pending Fraudulent Transfer Litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Standing Mot. Ex. D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Following its unsuccessful efforts to persuade the Trustee, the Renco Group sought leave from the Bankruptcy Court for standing and authority pursuant to section 502(a) of the Bankruptcy Code to object to, and file motions with respect to, claims filed or otherwise asserted against the Debtors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Standing Mot. The Renco Group argued,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that by refusing to object to claims, the Trustee had refused to fulfill his responsibilities with respect to claims administration in the bankruptcy cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Standing Mot. \u00b6\u00b6 14-17. The Renco Group further contended that the Trustee's refusal stemmed from a \"litigation-driven concern\" that, if all of the claims against Metals were disallowed and/or expunged, the Trustee would lose the derivative standing necessary to continue to litigate the Fraudulent Transfer Litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Standing Mot. \u00b6\u00b6 17-19. The Renco Group argued that, due to the Trustee's inaction, the Renco Group, as a \"party in interest\" pursuant to section 502(a), should be permitted to take action to determine the validity of claims asserted against Metals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Standing Mot. \u00b6\u00b6 20-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In response, the Trustee argued that because he was not unreasonably failing to object to claims, the Standing Motion should be denied.\n   <em>\n    See Response of Chapter 7 Trustee to Motion of The Renco Group, Inc. for Leave to Object to Creditors' Claims\n   </em>\n   (the \"\n   <em>\n    Response\n   </em>\n   \" or \"\n   <em>\n    Resp.\n   </em>\n   \") \u00b6 19. [Case No. 01-14312, ECF No. 684]. The Trustee explained (as he had in his January 9, 2015 letter) that because the estates were administratively insolvent, unsecured creditors would not receive a distribution, and therefore, \"the Trustee should not waste time or money on a detailed analysis of claims or objections thereto.\" Resp. \u00b6 19. The Trustee further argued that the Renco Group was \"acting solely in its own self-interest, seeking to knock out claims to try to deprive the Trustee of standing to recover the fraudulent conveyances ....\" Resp. \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On February 10, 2015, Judge Gerber held a hearing on the Standing Motion (the \"\n   <em>\n    February\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    2015 Hearing\n   </em>\n   \" or \"\n   <em>\n    Feb. 2015 Hr'g\n   </em>\n   \") at which he stated that \"[t]he only difficult issue ... is whether this motion should be denied without prejudice out of concerns for judicial restraint, or whether it should be denied with prejudice given how outrageous it is.\" Feb. 2015 Hr'g Tr. 25:18-21 [ECF No. 695]. Judge Gerber found that the Standing Motion was \"tactically driven to affect the [then] ongoing [Fraudulent Transfer Litigation]\" and essentially was nothing more than \"a blatant heavy handed and bad faith effort to affect the proceedings in that trial ....\" Feb. 2015 Hr'g Tr. 25:21-23; 25:23-26:1. Judge Gerber further found \"the Renco Group to be guilty of both laches and bad faith ... [as] [t]he claims Renco Group wishe[d] to expunge were filed 12 years [before the Standing Motion and] ... [i]f Renco Group had any legitimate basis for the relief it now seeks, it could have sought it in the nearly 13 years before it filed its [Standing] [M]otion.\" Feb. 2015 Hr'g Tr. 35:1-6. Ultimately, Judge Gerber denied the Standing Motion \"without prejudice to renewal (A) after the conclusion of the [Fraudulent Transfer Litigation then] pending before Judge Nathan, and (B) after Renco Group ... comes into the money and has a legitimate interest in the disallowance of other's [sic] claims by reason other than its desire to prevail in a wholly separate judicial proceeding.\" Feb. 2015 Hr'g Tr. 26:5-10 (hereafter, the \"\n   <em>\n    2015 Standing Ruling\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Renco Group Adversary Proceeding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The Complaint\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Shortly after the Debtors' cases were reassigned upon Judge Gerber's retirement,\n   in May 2016, the Renco Group again sought to object to the Bond Claims by commencing this adversary proceeding. In its Complaint, the Renco Group asserts four causes of actions allegedly supporting disallowance of the Bond Claims: (1) equitable disallowance; (2) quasi estoppel; (3) unjust enrichment; and (4) disallowance under section 502(d) of the Bankruptcy Code. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 31-54. The Renco Group ultimately seeks full disallowance of the Bond Claims and to ensure that Wilmington Trust, as indenture trustee, cannot recover on either of the Bond Claims \"because the [B]ondholders, directly or through their predecessors in interest, ratified the payment of [the] Renco[ ] [Group's] dividends through their participation in a [the 1996] [B]ond [O]ffering that was expressly initiated and consummated to fund one of those dividends ....\" Compl. \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Renco Group alleges in its Complaint that it has standing to commence this action \"as the sole shareholder of ... Metals.\" Compl. \u00b6 11 \"[I]f, and to the extent, the proceeds of the [Fraudulent Transfer] Judgment are paid to the Chapter 7 trustee, the Debtors will enter the zone of solvency and, under such circumstances, [the] Renco [Group], as the Debtors' residual equity holder, would benefit from any disallowance of the Bond Claims.\" Compl. \u00b6 3. The Renco Group further maintains that the 2015 Standing Ruling does not preclude it from commencing this action since that ruling \"was issued\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the Chapter 7 trustee obtained the [Fraudulent Transfer] Judgment, and was predicated upon the Debtors' then administrative insolvency, which, according to the Court, meant that [the] Renco [Group], as a shareholder, was not a 'party in interest' of the Debtors' estates under [s]ection 502(a) [of the Bankruptcy Code].\" Compl. \u00b64 (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The crux of the Complaint rests on the allegation that the Bondholders knew or should have known that one of the main purposes of the 1996 Bond Offering was to facilitate the payment of dividends by Metals to the Renco Group. Specifically, the Renco Group alleges that the 1996 Bond Offering prospectus explicitly disclosed that \"one of the main purposes of the [1996] Bond Offering was to facilitate\" payment by Metals of dividends to the Renco Group. Compl. \u00b6 15. The Renco Group also alleges that (i) prior to the 1996 Bond Offering, Metals had made a $13.9 million dividend payment to the Renco Group, which was also disclosed in the prospectus,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 19, and (ii) in July 1996, using the proceeds from the Bond Offering, Metals made another $75.7 million dividend payment to the Renco Group.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 18. From that point through October 1998, according to the Renco Group, Metals made additional dividend payments totaling approximately $14 million.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 18.

The Renco Group's Alleged Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In light of the fact that the Renco Group's previous Standing Motion was denied, albeit without prejudice, this Court has concerns regarding the Renco Group's commencement of this adversary proceeding. Based on the record of the February 2015 Hearing, and Judge Gerber's 2015 Standing Ruling, the Court finds that, in denying the Standing Motion without prejudice, Judge Gerber allowed the Renco Group to renew its previous Standing Motion, or if subsequent events warrant, to file a new motion seeking similar relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Instead of renewing its Standing Motion, shortly after Judge Gerber retired, the Renco Group challenged the Bond Claims by commencing this adversary proceeding. By that time, the Fraudulent Transfer Litigation had concluded in the District Court and the Fraudulent Transfer Judgment was affirmed by the Second Circuit. However, for the reasons discussed below, the Complaint fails to allege sufficient facts to state a facially plausible claim that the Renco Group will receive a distribution on account of its equity interests as a result of the Fraudulent Transfer Judgment, such that it would have standing to assert the claims it now pleads in the Complaint. As such, and in line with Judge Gerber's prior ruling, if the Renco Group had sought to renew its Standing Motion, granting leave would have been unwarranted. But, instead of renewing its Standing Motion or filing a new similar motion, the Renco Group attempts to sidestep this requirement by objecting to the Bond Claims by means of an adversary proceeding, which in many ways appears to be an attempt to circumvent Judge Gerber's 2015 Standing Ruling. Notwithstanding its serious concern with the Renco Group's tactics, the Court turns to the merits of the standing issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Renco Group's Alleged Standing as a Shareholder\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In its Complaint, the Renco Group contends that, \"as the sole shareholder of ... Metals, [it] is a 'party in interest' \" under section 502(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. Compl. \u00b6 11. Section 502(a) provides that \"a claim or interest, proof of which is filed under section 501 of this title ... is deemed allowed, unless a party in interest ... objects.\" The term \"party in interest,\" as used in section 502(a), is not defined in the Bankruptcy Code. In the Second Circuit, a chapter 7 debtor becomes a party in interest with standing to participate in litigation surrounding the assets of the estate \"\n   <em>\n    only if\n   </em>\n   there could be a surplus after all creditors' claims are paid\" pursuant to the distribution priorities set forth in the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <em>\n    In re 60 E. 80th St. Equities, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11205058,11192350\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/218/109/\">\n    218 F.3d 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 115 (2d Cir. 2000) (emphasis added) (citing COLLIER ON BANKRUPTCY , \u00b6 21.02[2] (15th ed. 1996) );\n   <em>\n    see cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Friedberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=634%20Fed.%20Appx.%20333\">\n    634 Fed.

Thus, according to Wilmington Trust, a total of only approximately $92.3 million would then be available for distribution to general unsecured creditors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wilmington Suppl. at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Next, Wilmington Trust points out that the total amount of outstanding claims,\n   proof of which are reflected on the Debtors' Claims Registers, exceeds $670 million, a fact with which the Renco Group agrees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 29. In addition, the Government asserts a variety of environmental liabilities,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Government Proofs of Claim, the total value of which remains unliquidated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wilmington Suppl. at 12-13; Compl. \u00b6 29. Wilmington Trust calculates the total value of all claims against the Debtors, including the Environmental Claims, as approximately $725 million.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wilmington Suppl. at 13. Wilmington Trust also contends that, even if the Bond Claims were disallowed in their entirety, \"a total of more than $450 million in claims ... are situated in front of any distribution to [the] Renco [Group].\" Wilmington Suppl. 13. Thus, according to Wilmington Trust, simple arithmetic makes clear that there is zero possibility that there will be a surplus available for distribution to equity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Renco Group, on the other hand, discounts the $670 million in claims reflected on the Debtors' Claims Registers and argues that the Claims Registers are vastly overstated and contain numerous duplicative claims. Compl. \u00b6 29; Renco Supp. \u00b6 7. Moreover, the Renco Group argues that the Court may only take judicial notice that the proofs of claim were filed, but may not take judicial notice of the validity, accuracy or the amount owing with respect thereto. Renco Suppl. \u00b6\u00b6 22-23. In support of its position, the Renco Group highlights that, in 2001, when the cases were initially filed, the Debtors' estimation of general unsecured claims against them totaled approximately $6 million. Compl. \u00b6 29; Renco Supp. \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Renco Group also discounts the magnitude of the Environmental Claims and makes the conclusionary allegation in its Complaint that \"[a]ny environmental remediation obligations, to the extent they are not undertaken by the current owner of the MagCorp property and assets, are likely to be immaterial.\" Compl. \u00b6 29. It also argues that \"Metals is unlikely to face\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   environmental liabilities because it is merely the holding company of MagCorp ....\" Renco Suppl. \u00b6 10 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   also Compl \u00b6 11.

Based on these assertions, the Renco Group argues that if the relief requested in the Complaint is granted and the Bond Claims are disallowed, Metals will have sufficient\n   assets to pay the remaining creditors in full and make a distribution to the Renco Group on account of its equity interest, thereby giving the Renco Group standing to object to the Bond Claims in this adversary proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Renco Suppl. \u00b6 22-23\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Court finds that the inferences which the Renco Group asks the Court to draw from its allegations in support of its claim (that there will be a surplus of assets available for distribution to equity) are not reasonable. The Renco Group's Complaint asserts conclusions regarding legal issues that are without support and as such, its claim of entitlement to a distribution as a shareholder is not plausible on its face. First, and most obvious, the Renco Group fails to account for the litigation costs associated with obtaining the Fraudulent Transfer Judgment (totaling approximately $120 million) and costs the Trustee will incur in negotiating and/or litigating the Environmental Claims, which under the Bankruptcy Code indisputably are afforded priority over creditors and equity holders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20726\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Second, the Renco Group's allegation concerning the value and/or legitimacy of the Environmental Claims are interwoven in legal conclusions that the Court is \"not bound to accept as true.\"\n   <em>\n    Papasan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206610\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/265/#p286\">\n    478 U.S. at 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206610\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/265/#p286\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986). Third, the Renco Group asks the Court to infer from the allegations in its Complaint that if the Bond Claims were disallowed, the total value of all claims (other than the Environmental Claims) against Debtors' estates will be reduced from approximately $670 million to $0.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 30; Renco Supp. \u00b6 7. Even if the Court were to draw an inference that (i) as in many large commercial bankruptcy cases, creditors file duplicate claims that ultimately are disallowed during the claims resolution process, and (ii) if the Renco Group were to be successful in this adversary proceeding, resulting in the disallowance of the Bond Claims, there would be a dramatic reduction in the value of all outstanding claims against the Debtors by approximately $340 million (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the $170 million bond claim in each of the Debtors' cases), it is nonetheless not plausible that the Renco Group would be impacted pecuniarily by pursuing the relief sought in the Complaint.

In support of its argument that it has standing to pursue this action without first seeking leave for the Bankruptcy Court, the Renco Group relies on a decision by Judge Bernstein, in\n   <em>\n    In re Ampal-Am.

However, that case is clearly distinguishable. There, although the Court acknowledged the majority rule, it did not need to decide whether the majority rule applied because the chapter 7 trustee in that case did not oppose the creditors' efforts to disallow or reduce the claims, and did \"not intend to file his own objection\" to the claims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4051122\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/545/802/#p808\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4051122\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/545/802/#p808\">\n    at 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, however, the Renco Group has failed to allege any facts in its Complaint that it first requested that the Trustee investigate and object to the Bond Claims.

Here, the Renco Group and Wilmington Trust disagree as to whether the Renco Group qualifies as a creditor pursuant to section 502(h). Because this issue is not properly in front of the Court at this time, the Court must refrain from deciding it. For the purposes of the Motion to Dismiss, the Court notes that the Renco Group did not plead in the Complaint that is has standing as a creditor.
