INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Generally, when a company wants to challenge a finding of employment by the Texas Workforce Commission (the \"\n   <em>\n    TWC\n   </em>\n   \") under the Texas Unemployment Compensation Act, the company follows a statutorily prescribed administrative appeals process. Once the TWC renders a final decision, the company may still then appeal the decision to a court of competent jurisdiction to review the agency's decision. Here, however, the parties never engaged in the statutorily prescribed administrative appeals process regarding the employment status of certain truck drivers who provide services to Pioneer Carriers, LLC (the \"\n   <em>\n    Debtor\n   </em>\n   \") and, thus, the TWC never rendered a final decision on the issue. Instead, as detailed more fully below, the issue of whether the truck drivers who provide services to the Debtor are the Debtor's employees or are independent contractors was brought before this Court via proofs of claim filed by the TWC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 17, 2017, the TWC filed a proof of claim in the amount of $26,100.92 for alleged pre-petition unpaid unemployment taxes (\"\n   <em>\n    Claim No. 8\n   </em>\n   \"), owed by the Debtor, one of the debtors in this jointly\n   administered Chapter 11 case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Claim 8-1]. On August 21, 2017, the TWC filed a second proof of claim in the amount of $1,267.10 for alleged unpaid post-petition taxes due under the Texas Unemployment Compensation Act (\"\n   <em>\n    Claim No. 14\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Claim 14-1]. On November 6, 2017, the Debtor filed separate objections to Claim No. 8 and Claim No. 14 (the \"\n   <em>\n    Objections\n   </em>\n   \"), arguing that it has no employees, that all individuals providing services for the Debtor are independent contractors and, thus, the Debtor does not owe any amounts to the TWC for employee-related charges. [Doc. Nos. 169, 172]. On November 21, 2017, the TWC responded to the Objections, asserting that those individuals who provide services for the Debtor are in fact employees and not independent contractors and therefore the TWC's claims are valid. [Doc. Nos. 185, 186]. On April 10, 2018, this Court held a hearing (the \"\n   <em>\n    Hearing\n   </em>\n   \") on the Objections. The only person to testify at the hearing was Pedro Lagos, the sole owner of the Debtor. The Court admitted exhibits A-N submitted by the TWC and exhibits 1-7 submitted by the Debtor. After listening to the testimony, reviewing exhibits, and hearing closing arguments, the Court then took the matter under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Pursuant to Federal Bankruptcy Rules 7052 and 9014,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court now issues these Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law explaining its decision to sustain the Objections. To the extent that any Finding of Fact is construed to be a Conclusion of Law, it is adopted as such; and to the extent that any Conclusion of Law is construed to be a Finding of Fact, it is adopted as such. The Court reserves the right to make additional findings and conclusions as it deems appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FINDINGS OF FACT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   1. The Debtor is a privately-held company owned 100% by Pedro Lagos (\"\n   <em>\n    Lagos\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   2. The Debtor was founded in 2014 and its headquarters are located at 724 E 19\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Street, Houston, Texas 77008. The Debtor is in the business of transporting crude oil from sites to pipelines by contracting with individual truckers who operate the Debtor's fleet of trucks and trailers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   3. The Debtor owns 16 trucks and 26 trailers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   4. Lagos negotiates with individual truckers to transport crude oil for the Debtor's customers. There are no written contracts signed between the Debtor and the individual truckers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   5. Once Lagos receives a request from the Debtor's customers, Lagos notifies truckers in the industry and waits for responses. Once he receives responses, he negotiates the terms for that particular load. The individual who accepts the assignment informs Lagos when he will perform the task; Lagos does not give him specific instructions about when he should perform the task so long as this task is done by whatever deadline the customer has imposed. The Debtor's customers typically give the Debtor 24 hours to complete the load; thus, as long as the load is delivered within the 24 hour time period, how and when to deliver the load is up to the truck driver who has accepted the job.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   6. The Debtor provides no training to the individuals who drive the Debtor's trucks in transporting the crude oil for the Debtor's customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   7. There is no question that without the Debtor's use of these truck drivers, the Debtor's operations could not be carried out. Stated differently, the Debtor's success depends upon these individuals delivering the crude oil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   8. Once Lagos negotiates with an individual for a specific job, that individual is allowed to assign this task to another individual so long as that individual (a) is properly licensed under applicable state and federal law to operate a truck; and (b) has previously transported oil for the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   9. The individuals whom Lagos retains to deliver crude do not supervise any helpers; rather, they operate the trucks by themselves without assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   10. Since its inception, the Debtor has always experienced a high turnover rate among the individual truck drivers it has used. Indeed, Lagos testified at the Hearing that the Debtor's biggest challenge is driver retention. Stated differently, the truck drivers that the Debtor has used do not constantly work for the Debtor, but rather come and go and drive routes for other companies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   11. The individuals who deliver crude for the Debtor work on their own time and set their own schedules for driving the trucks to deliver the crude. The Debtor does not set their schedules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   12. The individuals who deliver crude for the Debtor do not devote full time service to the Debtor exclusively. Rather, they enter into agreements with other companies to drive their trucks as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   13. The truck drivers who enter into agreements with the Debtor to deliver crude oil choose when to do so and also choose what routes they want to drive. Very infrequently, about 2% of the time, a customer will have a specific need on the sequence of the loads. When this occurs, the Debtor contacts the driver assigned to the load to check whether the customer's needs align with the sequence the driver is willing to undertake. If the driver does not want to follow the sequence set out by the customer, then the Debtor must find another driver who is willing to follow the sequence as requested by the customer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   14. The Debtor does not require that the individuals who deliver crude submit regular oral or written reports about the work in progress. Stated differently, these individuals are not required to notify the Debtor how many hours they have been on the road and how many hours they still have to be on the road to deliver the crude.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   15. The Debtor pays the individuals who deliver the crude by invoice. Stated differently, these individuals receive payment only after they have actually delivered the crude and the Debtor has received payment from the customer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   16. The Debtor does not pay the travel expenses of the individuals who deliver the\n   crude to the Debtor's customers. For example, if a truck driver from New Orleans enters into an agreement with the Debtor to deliver crude from Houston to McAllen, Texas, the Debtor does not pay the costs for that driver to travel from New Orleans to Houston to undertake the job. Further, the Debtor does not pay for any hotel expenses if a trucker needs to stay the night (or nights) in a hotel during the course of a job. The Debtor does pay for the fuel for the truck once the job begins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   17. The Debtor does not provide individual truckers with the clothing and accessories required by applicable law, such as hard hats, fire retardant clothing, steel-toed boots, and safety glasses. The truck drivers must provide these items by themselves or purchase such items from the Debtor. For those individuals who are not owner/operators (i.e., who own their own trucks), the Debtor does supply one of the trucks from its own fleet for the individual to deliver the crude.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   18. The individuals who make deliveries for the Debtor, but who do not own their own trucks, have no investment in the Debtor's business in general or in the job assignment in particular. Conversely, the owner/operators who make deliveries for the Debtor do have a significant investment insofar as they own the truck that makes the delivery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   19. The individuals who make deliveries for the Debtor can either realize a profit or suffer a loss on each job, depending upon how they manage their expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   20. The individuals who make deliveries for the Debtor do not provide such services solely for the Debtor, but rather provide the same or similar services for other companies. The only prohibition in place is that an individual making deliveries for the Debtor on any particular day may not provide services on that same day for another company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   21. Individuals who make deliveries for the Debtor hold separate licenses to drive a truck and make their services available to the public at large, as opposed to just the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   22. If the individual who is delivering crude for the Debtor fails to actually do so, or fails to return the Debtor-owned truck to the Debtor, then the Debtor will hold back the payment that it would otherwise pay to this individual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   23. If the work relationship between the Debtor and an individual driver becomes unworkable, the Debtor can terminate the work relationship with the driver. If this happens, the driver will have no legal recourse against the Debtor. Conversely, if a driver decides to walk away from the job that he has agreed to undertake for the Debtor, the Debtor does not have any recourse against the driver. In the words of Lagos, \"it is a mutually agreeable relationship ... until it's not.\" [Tape Recording, Apr. 10, 2018, Hrg. at 3:01:00-3:01:11 P.M.].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   24. The Debtor provides no health insurance, no medical benefits, and no retirement accounts to any of the individuals with whom it enters into agreements to deliver crude to the Debtor's customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   25. The Debtor pays for insurance on the trucks that it owns; the individuals who drive the Debtor's trucks to deliver crude to the Debtor's customers do not pay any portion of this insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   26. The individuals who drive the Debtor's trucks do not have any ownership interest in these trucks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   27. When the Debtor first started its operations in 2014, it did hire some individuals as employees of the Debtor to serve as truck drivers. For purposes of the Debtor's tax liability, the relevant time period is the third and fourth quarters of\n   2014. Pursuant to a stipulation made in open court by the TWC, the tax amounts of $4,009.50 for the third and fourth quarters of 2014 must be reduced (at this point in an unknown amount) because the TWC agrees that the mechanics who repaired the Debtor's trucks were not employees of the Debtor, but rather independent contractors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CREDIBILITY OF WITNESSES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Lagos was the only person who testified at the Hearing. The Court finds that Lagos testified forthrightly and the Court finds his testimony to be very credible. The Court therefore gives his testimony substantial weight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Marshall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450496,4332163\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/462/\">\n    564 U.S. 462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450496,6049563,4332163\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/131/2594/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12450496,4332163\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/462/\">\n    180 L.Ed.2d 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011), this Court is required to determine whether it has the constitutional authority to enter a final order in any matter brought before it.

Because\n   <em>\n    Stern\n   </em>\n   is replete with language emphasizing that the ruling is limited to the one specific type of core proceeding involved in that dispute, this Court concludes that the limitation imposed by\n   <em>\n    Stern\n   </em>\n   does not prohibit this Court from entering a final order here.

In\n   <em>\n    Stern\n   </em>\n   , the debtor filed a counterclaim based\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   on state law, and the resolution of this counterclaim did not resolve the validity, or invalidity, of the claim held by the defendant. The dispute at bar, on the other hand, despite requiring application of state law, arises from an express Code provision and an express Bankruptcy Rule: \u00a7 502(a) and Rule 3007.

For its part, the TWC did not introduce any evidence and therefore did not meet its burden to prove the validity of its claims-i.e., that the truckers are the Debtor's employees. Thus, the TWC did not ultimately carry its burden. As \"a substantial majority of the relevant factors,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   indicate that the truck drivers are independent contractors, the Court finds that the individuals who have driven the Debtor's trucks are not employees of the Debtor, but rather are independent contractors.

The evidence introduced by the Debtor reflects that 14 of the 19 applicable factors reflect that these drivers are independent contractors, and that only 5 of the 19 factors support a finding that they are employees. This Court finds that the existence of 5 out of 19 factors does not constitute the \"substantial evidence\" necessary to find that the truckers are employees. Other courts that have reviewed the issue of whether workers are employees or independent contractors for purposes of TUCA after the administrative process has been exhausted have found that the substantial evidence burden has been met when 10 to 15 of the applicable factors have weighed in favor of employee status; here, similarly, this Court finds that the Debtor has met its burden of showing that the TWC's decision to categorize the truckers as employees was not supported by substantial evidence when only 5 of the applicable 19 factors weigh in favor of employee status (i.e., the other 14 applicable factors weigh in favor independent contractor status).\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harris Cty.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   For the reasons set forth herein, the Court sustains the Objections. Therefore, the amounts set forth in Claim No. 8 and Claim No. 14 are disallowed in their entirety. However, this does not bring complete closure to this matter. At the Hearing, counsel for the Debtor stipulated that when the Debtor first began operating in 2014, it did hire some individuals in the third and fourth quarter of 2014 who fall within \"employee\" status. [Finding of Fact No. 27]. Further, at the Hearing, counsel for the TWC stipulated that the tax amount of $4,009.50 for the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2014 must be reduced because the TWC agrees that the mechanics who repair the Debtor's trucks at that time were not employees of the Debtor, but rather were independent contractors. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. What the parties could not stipulate to at the Hearing was how much of a reduction of the $4,009.50 should be made. The Court therefore directs the Debtor and TWC to confer and determine if they can agree upon an amount. If they can, then they should submit an agreed motion and a proposed agreed order. If they cannot, then the TWC shall be allowed\n   to file a new proof of claim setting forth the amount that it believes is appropriate, and the Debtor shall be allowed to file an objection-in which event the Court will hold a separate hearing thereon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   An order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion will be entered on the docket simultaneously herewith.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    Transport Dry Freight, L.L.C. is the other debtor in this jointly administered case.
