For the reasons discussed below, we\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Stevenson filed a petition for chapter 7 relief on September 8, 2016. At that time, there was a summary process action pending against her in state court in which her landlord, TND Homes I, LP (\"TND\"), alleged nonpayment of rent in connection with her lease of a residential apartment (the \"Property\"). TND filed a motion for relief from the automatic stay (the \"motion for relief\"), seeking authorization to continue the summary process action. Stevenson opposed the motion for relief, accusing TND of \"erroneous billing practices.\" Following a hearing, the bankruptcy court denied TND's request for relief from the automatic stay, on the condition that Stevenson make certain rent payments to TND. In addition, the court directed TND to correct its electronic records to accurately reflect the amounts Stevenson owed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   TND subsequently moved to voluntarily dismiss the summary process action after\n   receiving full payment of the rent amounts due from Stevenson. Stevenson received a discharge on January 6, 2017, and her bankruptcy case was closed on February 14, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After receiving her discharge, Stevenson again stopped paying rent. According to TND, Stevenson also \"persisted in her refusal to complete recertification paperwork,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   failed to permit inspection of her unit, and violated her lease by keeping a dog on the Property. TND issued a 30-day notice to quit on February 24, 2017, and on April 10, 2017, commenced a new summary process action against Stevenson alleging that her tenancy had been terminated for cause. Stevenson filed an answer and counterclaim in the summary process action, asserting that the Property lacked heat and hot water. The state court scheduled the matter for a bench trial on April 20, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 21, 2017, Stevenson filed a petition for chapter 13 relief, thereby commencing the bankruptcy case that is the subject of this appeal. By letter dated May 3, 2017, TND notified the state court of Stevenson's bankruptcy filing and requested a stay of the summary process action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On her Schedule A/B: Property, Stevenson reported $30,000.00 worth of assets, $20,000.00 of which represented the surrender value of an insurance policy. She listed no creditors on Schedule D: Creditors Who Have Claims Secured by Property. On her Amended Schedule E/F: Creditors Who have Unsecured Claims, Stevenson listed only two creditors: Educational Credit Management Corporation (\"ECMC\"), with a claim of $15,000.00; and Navient, with a claim of $5,000.00.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On Schedule G: Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases, Stevenson identified the residential lease with TND.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On April 24, 2017, the bankruptcy court issued a notice stating that Stevenson was \"not entitled to a discharge in bankruptcy because of prior case filings.\" The bankruptcy court issued another notice on the same date, warning Stevenson that, as a \"repeat filer,\" her rights might be affected by \u00a7 362(c)(3)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and/or (4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter,\n   Stevenson filed a motion to extend the automatic stay pursuant to \u00a7 362(c)(3)(B). The bankruptcy court ruled that the motion was moot because the automatic stay was still in effect, explaining: \"Although [Stevenson] filed a prior case ... within the preceding [ ] year, that case was not dismissed and, therefore, [\u00a7] 362(c)(3) does not apply.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On June 2, 2017, TND filed a motion to dismiss Stevenson's chapter 13 case (the \"Motion to Dismiss\") pursuant to \u00a7 1307(c), asserting that \"[a] chapter 13 case can be dismissed for cause when it is demonstrated that the case was not filed in good faith.\" TND contended that Stevenson had not filed her petition in good faith but, rather, for the sole purpose of \"delay[ing] and frustrat[ing] TND,\" and preventing the prosecution of the summary process action. Arguing that Stevenson's bankruptcy case amounted to a two-party dispute, TND elaborated that she remained in violation of her lease, she had no debts to reorganize other than student loan debt, and her claims relating to the condition of the Property should be litigated in the state court summary process action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Stevenson objected to the Motion to Dismiss, insisting that: (1) her chapter 13 case was filed in good faith; (2) she proposed to pay all rent arrearages over a 36-month period in her chapter 13 plan of reorganization; and (3) TND had committed \"acts of intentional wrong doing\" by, among other things, retaliating against her for asserting her right to habitable premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On July 20, 2017, Stevenson filed her fifth amended chapter 13 plan of reorganization (the \"Plan\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   indicating that: (1) she intended to \"assume\" the lease of the Property; (2) she would pay lease arrears in the amount of $6,853.00 to TND through the Plan; (3) she owed TND an additional $28,391.00, which she characterized as a nondischargeable unsecured claim for rent; (4) ECMC held a nondischargeable unsecured claim in the amount of $70,240.96; and (5) general unsecured creditors would receive a dividend of \"0.70%\" of their claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Trustee filed an objection to confirmation, asserting that: (1) the Plan was not feasible; (2) Stevenson had overstated the amount of TND's claim and understated the amount of her student loan debt; (3) the Plan's liquidation analysis was incomplete; (4) Stevenson proposed to pay a dividend of .70% to the holders of unsecured claims totaling $105,484.96, which Stevenson calculated as $31,645.88, although\n   the Trustee's calculation was $73,839.47;\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (5) Stevenson had not filed her pre-petition state tax returns. ECMC also filed an objection to confirmation, arguing Stevenson had incorrectly listed her student loan debt as approximately $70,000.00, although it was actually about $147,000.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The bankruptcy court conducted a hearing on the Motion to Dismiss on August 3, 2017. At the outset, counsel for TND characterized Stevenson's bankruptcy case as a \"two-party dispute\" and an \"effort to ... continue to hamstring\" TND. He reiterated TND's contention that Stevenson's claims regarding the condition of the Property did not justify the filing of her chapter 13 petition, and added that Stevenson had filed six plans of reorganization, \"none of which ha[d] come within striking distance of being confirmable.\" He concluded by arguing that Stevenson was merely a \"month-to-month tenant,\" as her lease had terminated pre-petition due to the recertification issue. Stevenson, in turn, conceded that she was withholding rent because the Property lacked heat and represented that her goal was to \"resume\" her lease under \u00a7 365.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At the conclusion of the hearing, the bankruptcy court granted the Motion to Dismiss, explaining to Stevenson from the bench:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [Y]our lease is [ ] terminated. There's nothing that I could do to revive that lease. And you've been through a chapter 7.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   You've gotten a discharge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [Y]our problem isn't debt. Your problem [ ] is that you're in a continuing dispute with this landlord.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [A]nd the right place to [complain about uninhabitable conditions] is in state court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [W]e've done everything we can do here. I'm going to dismiss the case under [\u00a7] 1307 as unreasonable ... delay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Following the hearing, the bankruptcy court entered the Dismissal Order. On the same day, Stevenson commenced an adversary proceeding against TND with a complaint alleging that it had violated the Massachusetts \"anti-SLAPP\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   statute ( Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, \u00a7 59H ) by retaliating against her \"for complaining of [un]inhabitable conditions ....\" The bankruptcy court dismissed the adversary proceeding for lack of subject matter jurisdiction in light of its dismissal of Stevenson's main bankruptcy case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Stevenson appealed the Dismissal Order on August 11, 2017. She also filed a request for certification of the Dismissal Order for direct appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, which the bankruptcy court denied. Several months later, Stevenson filed a request for injunctive relief pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202283\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the \"Anti-Injunction Act\") and \u00a7 105, asking the Panel to stay the state court summary process action. The Panel denied her request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Stevenson\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On appeal, Stevenson presents five issues, namely, whether: (1) her lease \"was\n   unexpired and assumable\"; (2) \"the automatic stay precludes a state court from undertaking ministerial acts after a bankruptcy filing\"; (3) TND's summary process action was a \"[SLAPP] suit and abuse of process\"; (4) \"racial bias influence[d]\" the bankruptcy court's decision to dismiss her chapter 13 case; and (5) the bankruptcy court should have permitted her adversary proceeding to proceed. She asks the Panel for \"retroactive relief ordering the state court to dismiss the summary process\" action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    II. TND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   TND counters that there is no basis for reversing the Dismissal Order. Moreover, in response to Stevenson's claim that her lease was \"unexpired and assumable,\" TND contends the bankruptcy court correctly determined that TND had terminated Stevenson's lease prior to the filing of the chapter 13 case and that Stevenson had already received a recent discharge in her chapter 7 case. Thus, TND asserted, the bankruptcy court properly concluded \"there was no lease to be assumed and nothing further to be accomplished in the [c]hapter 13 [c]ase.\" As in the proceedings below, TND maintains Stevenson filed her chapter 13 case to resolve a two-party dispute, \"raising quintessentially non-bankruptcy issues which are [more properly] adjudicated in state court summary process actions ....\" In support, TND cites\n   <em>\n    Chertok v. Phelan (In re Phelan)\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:15-BK-04101 MDF,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20713570\">\n    2017 WL 713570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *[6] (Bankr.

The Standard Applied\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The record discloses that TND was Stevenson's only creditor besides ECMC and Navient. The record further establishes that Stevenson's relationship with TND was contentious. In 2016, TND commenced a summary process action against Stevenson. That action was followed by the commencement of Stevenson's chapter 7 case. In that case, TND filed a motion for relief from stay, which Stevenson opposed. Stevenson's relationship with TND remained antagonistic after she received her chapter 7 discharge. For example, she again withheld rent and still refused to participate in the recertification process. A second summary process action ensued, in which Stevenson raised a counterclaim against TND. On the day after trial was scheduled to begin in the summary process action, Stevenson filed the chapter 13 case which is at the heart of this appeal. During the pendency of the chapter 13 case, Stevenson commenced an adversary proceeding against TND asserting anti-SLAPP claims. Finally, in this appeal, Stevenson unsuccessfully sought to enjoin the state court summary process action under the Anti-Injunction Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Moreover, during the bankruptcy court hearing on the Motion to Dismiss, Stevenson identified no purpose for her chapter 13 filing beyond \"resum[ing]\" her lease. When the court stated, \"[T]here's nothing for me to do[,]\" she then attempted to justify her bankruptcy filing by responding: \"[T]he only reason I came here [is] because there is case law where a party can bring their lease, they can bring other debt, they can pay it off in a chapter 13.\" However, the suggestion that Stevenson had \"other debt\" to pay off is belied by her recent chapter 7 discharge, and by her own bankruptcy schedules, in which she failed to disclose any other debt to reorganize beyond her student loan debt. Furthermore, Stevenson's intention of \"resuming\" her lease reflects a fundamental misapprehension, as the record indicates that her lease was previously terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The foregoing chronology supports a conclusion that there has been \"unreasonable delay\" by Stevenson \"that is prejudicial to creditors.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201307\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1). Absent from the record-and from Stevenson's arguments on appeal-is justification for Stevenson's delay. Instead, this record suggests that Stevenson's chapter 13 filing was motivated by or targeted at a single creditor-TND-and that her filing was part of a pattern of conduct aimed at thwarting TND's eviction efforts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Bared Espinosa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%203898379\">\n    2006 WL 3898379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (dismissing chapter 11 case for unreasonable\n   delay that was prejudicial to creditors where the filing was tantamount to a two-party dispute).\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, when we consider Stevenson's stated purpose in filing her chapter 13 case (to \"pay ... off\" other debt), together with her filing of six chapter 13 plans and failure to confirm any of them over an approximate one-year period, there is more than ample support for the bankruptcy court's decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Col\u00f3n Martinez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3963248\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/472/137/#p145\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Addams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272459\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/564/458/#p466\">\n    564 B.R. 458\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 466-67 (Bankr.

None of Stevenson's arguments challenge the bankruptcy court's essential conclusion that there was unreasonable delay that was prejudicial to creditors. Furthermore, as TND correctly observes, a number of Stevenson's arguments raise issues beyond the scope of this appeal, including: (1) whether \"the automatic stay precludes a state court from undertaking ministerial acts\"; (2) whether TND's summary process action was a \"[SLAPP] suit\" or an \"abuse of process\"; and (3) whether the bankruptcy court should have permitted her adversary proceeding to continue despite the dismissal of the main case. Finally, Stevenson's claim that racial bias influenced the bankruptcy court's decision is without support in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   the Dismissal Order.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The factual background set forth in this opinion is gleaned from the record and the bankruptcy court's dockets.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     TD Bank, N.A. v.

However, as the record before us supports the bankruptcy court's decision to dismiss for unreasonable delay that was prejudicial to creditors under \u00a7 1307(c)(1), we need not address whether the record establishes that Stevenson lacked good faith when she filed her chapter 13 case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Stevenson has not argued that conversion would have been more appropriate than dismissal.
