(Doc. # 1-3, at 2.) In doing so, the bankruptcy court took judicial notice of the variables involved, apparently because it found the facts \"not subject to reasonable dispute.\" Fed. R. Evid. 201(b). The bankruptcy court explained that it \"fill[ed] the gap in Conniff's proof\" when it made this calculation because Ms. Conniff, who was not represented by counsel, could not competently submit the evidence needed to make this calculation. (Doc. # 1-3, at 2 &amp; n.2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Meanwhile, Ms. Conniff's student-loan creditor, Educational Credit Management Corp. (\"ECMC\"), argued that a much lower payment-$346 per month-was the benchmark. It explained that, if Ms. Conniff participated in an income contingent repayment plan (\"ICRP\"), her monthly payment would be $346, not $915. (Doc. # 1-3, at 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Disposing of ECMC's argument, the bankruptcy court found that similar arguments \"have been rejected both by the Eleventh Circuit and by this Court.\" (Doc. # 1-3, at 12.) The bankruptcy court string-cited four cases to support its contention that it need not consider what Ms. Conniff's payments would be were she to enroll in an ICRP.

Jan. 15, 2014).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Because this court previously resolved this case on\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   's second prong, it found it unnecessary to consider the first and third prongs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 21, at 13 &amp; n.7.) Now, on review of the bankruptcy court's decision, this court finds that the bankruptcy court committed errors of law and fact in its analysis of whether Ms. Conniff satisfied\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   's first prong. Those errors fall into three categories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The bankruptcy court's first error-a legal one, which this court reviews\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   -was its misapplication of the Eleventh Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Mosley\n   </em>\n   , and the non-binding lower-court decisions in\n   <em>\n    McLaney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Al-Riyami\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Bumps\n   </em>\n   to find that potential ICRP payments were not relevant to the court's analysis of the first\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   prong. The bankruptcy court failed to recognize that each of these cases\n   is distinguishable from the instant case. Three of the four cases, including\n   <em>\n    Mosley\n   </em>\n   , did not address the debtor's ICRP eligibility at the first\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   prong. In\n   <em>\n    Mosley\n   </em>\n   , the Eleventh Circuit considered the ICRP under the good-faith factor of the\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   test, rather than the minimal-standard-of-living factor. It noted that \"courts have rejected a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   rule that a debtor cannot show good faith where he or she has not enrolled in the [ICRP].\"\n   <em>\n    Mosley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047324,1090965\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/494/1320/\">\n    494 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1327 (citing\n   <em>\n    Educ.

Determining that Mosley had met the good-faith standard, despite his not applying for an ICRP, the Eleventh Circuit noted that his \"dire living conditions and persistent inability to obtain steady work\" were such that the ICRP would not have provided \"a realistic solution to his inability to pay.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"881122\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/433/393/#p402\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This court, in\n   <em>\n    McLaney\n   </em>\n   , made a similar determination, noting that \"declining to participate in a refinancing program when disposable income is insufficient to cover even the reduced payments is not indicative of bad faith.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675648\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/375/666/\">\n    375 B.R. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The facts of\n   <em>\n    Al-Riyami\n   </em>\n   are similar.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Al-Riyami\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%202800815\">\n    2014 WL 2800815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (determining at\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   's third prong that requiring the debtor to enroll into an ICRP would be a \"fruitless exercise\" and that the debtor's failure to participate in such a program did not preclude a finding of good faith). Hence, these decisions do not support the bankruptcy court's legal conclusion that the first\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   element does not permit consideration of a reduced payment plan under an ICRP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   There is an additional distinction shared by these cases that the bankruptcy court overlooked. The courts, including the Eleventh Circuit, considered the lower ICRP payments but then concluded that the lower payments still were so high as to pose an undue hardship on the debtor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mosley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047324,1090965\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/494/1320/\">\n    494 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1327 ;\n   <em>\n    McLaney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675648\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/375/666/\">\n    375 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   678 ;\n   <em>\n    Al-Riyami\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%202800815\">\n    2014 WL 2800815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bumps\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%20185336\">\n    2014 WL 185336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (noting that the debtor did not have enough disposable income to afford the reduced ICRP payment). Therefore, under the factual situations presented in those cases, the ICRP did not provide realistic solutions so that the debtors could have repaid their loans. Here, on the other hand, there is a factual finding that Ms. Conniff could eliminate her voluntary retirement contribution and possibly \"squeeze a couple of hundred more out of her budget.\" (Doc. # 1-3, at 11.) Ms. Conniff's voluntary retirement contribution is $220. If Ms. Conniff can \"squeeze a couple of hundred more out of her budget,\" it may be that she could reasonably make a monthly ICRP payment of $346. Accordingly, the bankruptcy court's reliance on these cases constitutes legal error because the court misapplied the law to the facts at issue.\n   <em>\n    Acosta-Conniff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=686%20Fed.%20Appx.%20647\">\n    686 Fed.Appx. at 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that \"a bankruptcy court's interpretation of any legal question pertinent to its fact finding\" is subject to\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The bankruptcy court's second error pertains also to\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   's first requirement and is closely related to its first error: The bankruptcy court failed to determine whether Ms. Conniff was eligible for an ICRP and, consequently, did not consider whether participation in an ICRP would affect Ms. Conniff's ability to maintain a minimal standard of living while making payments on her debt.

In\n   <em>\n    Wieckiewicz\n   </em>\n   , the Eleventh Circuit considered the district court's dismissal of a bankruptcy appeal. The appeal was dismissed because the debtor failed to comply with a bankruptcy court order to apply for a federal loan consolidation program.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=443%20Fed.%20Appx.%20449\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=443%20Fed.%20Appx.%20449\">\n    at 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Affirming the dismissal, the Eleventh Circuit held that the debtor's\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   eligibility under the [federal loan consolidation program] would play a substantial role in whether he would be able to show undue hardship under\n   <em>\n    Brunner.\n   </em>\n   If he qualified for the [program,] Wieckiewicz's loan payments could have been reduced to $0 per month, and eventually the loans would be forgiven.

Though the Eleventh Circuit did not explicitly sanction the consideration of ICRPs under\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   's first prong,\n   <em>\n    Wieckiewicz\n   </em>\n   's treatment of the issue suggests that this approach is proper, and this court finds that consideration of ICRP eligibility and payments is appropriate here. The bankruptcy court's failure to determine Ms. Conniff's eligibility for the ICRP was legal error. This legal error left the record bereft of essential factual findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   More specifically, the bankruptcy court's failure to develop the record and consider the relevant \"outcome determinative\" facts,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sublett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6124747,10540156\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/895/1381/\">\n    895 F.2d at 1384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , constitutes clear error that requires a remand for further findings of fact. As explained above, whether Ms. Conniff was eligible to participate in an ICRP may be outcome determinative under the first\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   prong; if she could afford an ICRP payment while maintaining a minimal standard of living,\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   's first requirement is not satisfied. Accordingly, on remand, the bankruptcy court must find whether Ms. Conniff is eligible to participate in such a program and, if she is, what the monthly payment would be.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Finally, the bankruptcy court's third error is that its calculation of Ms. Conniff's monthly expenses is clearly erroneous. There is no indication in the record that, when determining that Ms. Conniff could not maintain a minimal standard of living if forced to repay the loans, the bankruptcy court performed an itemized analysis of Ms. Conniff's budget to determine which expenses were reasonable and which were not. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 21, at 7 (\"The bankruptcy court did not indicate whether it had determined that all of the Schedule J expenses were reasonable and necessary for the support of Conniff and her two dependent sons.

Because this court cannot make those findings of fact and those findings are needed to decide\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   's first prong, the bankruptcy court must develop the record and make findings as to the reasonableness of Ms. Conniff's monthly expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Ultimately, consistent with the foregoing, the bankruptcy court must make specific\n   findings of fact and conclusions of law as to whether Ms. Conniff has met her burden of showing that she cannot maintain a \" 'minimal' standard of living for herself and her dependents if forced to repay the loans.\"\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1768176,6546370\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/831/395/\">\n    831 F.2d at 396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Additional Circumstances\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The second prong of the\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   test requires that additional circumstances exist such that the debtor's \" 'state of affairs is likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment period of the student loans.' \"\n   <em>\n    Cox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9106102\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/338/1238/#p1241\">\n    338 F.3d at 1241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1768176,6546370\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/831/395/\">\n    831 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   396 ).

Drawing conclusions from Ms. Conniff's testimony, this court made findings of fact where the bankruptcy court had not. Because this court cannot do so, the bankruptcy court must make findings of fact to support its conclusion with respect to\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   's second prong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In its opinion, the bankruptcy court cited almost no evidence to support its conclusion that Ms. Conniff bore her burden of demonstrating the requisite additional circumstances. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 1-3, at 13 (\"This was established by the evidence offered at trial.\").)

Therefore, on remand, the bankruptcy court should make findings including, but not limited to, Ms. Conniff's current and future childcare expenses; Ms. Conniff's current and future child support benefits; Ms. Conniff's ability to apply for higher paying jobs; the existence of annual pay raises; Ms. Conniff's decision to stay in the same geographical area; and Ms. Conniff's ability to pursue additional work alongside her current employment as a teacher.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Regardless of which facts the bankruptcy court finds on remand, it must recite the facts that support its legal conclusion-which \"additional circumstances,\" if any, indicate that Ms. Conniff's \"state of affairs is likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment period of the student loans.\"\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1768176,6546370\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/831/395/\">\n    831 F.2d at 396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
