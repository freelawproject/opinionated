The Trustee also filed his Brief in Support of Response on December 4, 2017 (ECF No. 105). The Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1334.

This matter is referred to this Court under the District Court's Order of Reference. For the reasons stated in this Order, the Court finds that CBC's Application is GRANTED, but its chapter 11 administrative claims are subordinated to all chapter 7 administrative expense claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Debtor filed its chapter 11 petition for relief on April 19, 2017. (ECF No. 1). Debtor's Schedules and Statement of Financial Affairs were filed on May 8, 2017. Debtor's Schedules indicate cash of $2,494.91, inventory consisting of frack sand with a stated value of $75,144.80, furniture and equipment with a stated value of $17,111.47, and two accounts receivables totaling $3,328,031.02. One of the accounts receivables is $3,304,350.11.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Debtor's counsel advised the Court that the large receivable is from an entity that is also in chapter 11 bankruptcy. Debtor has scheduled liabilities of $7,321,108.74. Notably, Debtor listed in its Schedule G (Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases) that it intends to assume its executory contract for a rail car lease with CBC. Debtor was in the business of selling frack sand to end users and leased railway cars to transport frack sand to its buyers. Like other similarly situated companies that were dependent on fracking activities in South Texas, when the price of oil dropped precipitously over the past few years, drilling activity ceased and vendors like Debtor could no longer sell its products to oil and gas companies. Debtor's Statement of Financial Affairs-Part 1-indicates that the Debtor had gross revenues in 2015 of $10.4 million; 2016 of $10.7 million; and revenues of $9,405.00 for 2017 through date of petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   CBC filed its Application for Allowance and Immediate Payment of Administrative Expense Claim (ECF No. 30) on May 30, 2017. The Application requested an administrative expense claim for the leasing and use of CBC's railway cars for the period\n   from date of petition (April 19, 2017) through May 1, 2017. (ECF No. 30, \u00b6 9). CBC asserted that it was entitled to be compensated for the rental fee per railway car of $600.00 per month, plus a fee for each car carrying tonnage, and a fee for sub-leasing the railway cars. (ECF No. 30, \u00b6\u00b6 4-8). CBC requested an allowed administrative expense claim of $89,640.00. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Debtor filed its Response on June 20, 2017 (ECF No. 33), generally denying the allegations of CBC's application and asserting a right to offset the amounts due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Prior to the Court's hearing CBC's Application for Allowance and Immediate Payment of Administrative Expense Claim (ECF No. 30), the United States Trustee filed her Motion to Convert Case to Chapter 7 on July 7, 2017 (ECF No. 39). CBC filed the instant Application on the same day. On July 12, 2017, the Court granted CBC's Application for Allowance and Immediate Payment of Administrative Expense Claim and the Court signed an order approving CBC's Application and granting CBC an administrative expense claim for $89,640.00 for the period of April 19, 2017, through May 1, 2017. The Court also considered the United States Trustee's Motion to Convert Case to Chapter 7 on July 12, 2017, and granted the Motion converting the Debtor's case to chapter 7 on July 18, 2017. (ECF No. 47).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Trustee filed his Motion to Reject Rail Car Lease Agreement on July 21, 2017. (ECF No. 52). The Motion requested,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , to reject the Lease Agreement with CBC. Trustee then filed his Response to Second Application by Caldwell-Baker Company (\"CBC\") for Allowance and Immediate Payment of Administrative Expense Claim and for Adequate Protection on July 28, 2017. (ECF No. 60). The Court granted Trustee's Motion to Reject Rail Car Lease Agreement, including the rail car lease with CBC, on August 2, 2017. (ECF No. 62).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Thereafter, Trustee filed his Motion to Enforce Order Converting Case to a Chapter 7 Case, asking that Debtor's counsel file a schedule of unpaid debt or a final report and account. (ECF No. 73).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Debtor filed its Schedule of Unpaid Debts on October 13, 2017, listing debts that were incurred between chapter 11 petition date and the date of conversion. (ECF No. 80). There is no indication of any debt owing to CBC during that period notwithstanding the Court's Order allowing an administrative expense claim to CBC. Debtor also filed its Final Report as Debtor in Possession that also indicated no post-petition claim for CBC. (ECF No. 81).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    PARTIES' CONTENTIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   CBC's Application seeks the following monetary relief:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (i) pursuant to section 365(d)(5) of the Bankruptcy Code, compelling the Debtor to immediately pay in full all obligations that accrued under the Lease Agreement first arising sixty days after the Petition Date (the \"Post 60-Day Period\") including to July 31, 2017, and requiring the Debtors to perform all obligations arising under the Lease Agreement during this period;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (ii) allowing an administrative expense pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20503\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) in favor of Caldwell-Baker with respect to all obligation[s] that accrued under the Lease Agreement for the period from Petition Date through the sixty days thereafter (the \"60-Day Period\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (ECF No. 41, p. 3).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   CBC argues that under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20365\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(5)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   , a debtor or a trustee must perform all obligations under an unexpired lease until such lease is assumed or rejected. CBC argues that because its lease with Debtor has not expired (at the time of the filing of the Second Application), and that Debtor has not returned any of CBC's leased rail cars, that Trustee must compensate CBC for the \"Post 60-Day Period\"- the unpaid lease amounts for that period. CBC asserts that Trustee is obligated to compensate CBC for the lost rental income over this time period and that CBC does not need to prove the requirements of \u00a7 503(b)(1),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   by demonstrating that the railway lease benefitted the estate. Stated differently, CBC asserts that its unpaid rent over the \"Post 60-Day Period\" is an automatic administrative expense claim for rental obligations and that CBC does not have to show how the railway lease benefitted the estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In the alternative, CBC argues that under \u00a7 503(b)(1)(A), Debtor's use or leasing of the railway cars to a sub-lessee qualifies as an administrative expense claim because CBC's railway cars provided \"actual, necessary costs and expenses of preserving the estate.\" Further, CBC maintains that if a debtor continues to receive benefits from the other party to an executory contract pending a decision to assume or reject the executory contract, then the party should be required to pay the reasonable value of those services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Trustee filed a Response to CBC's Application in the form of a general denial of CBC's claims (ECF No. 60). In the Trustee's Brief in Support of Trustee's Response, Trustee argues that once a case is converted to chapter 7, the post-petition rentals due under that rail car agreement (from chapter 11 petition date through conversion date) become pre-petition claims in the chapter 7 estate under \u00a7 348(d). As such, CBC's request that it has an allowed administrative expense claim is incorrect because its claims are no longer administrative claims, but rather pre-petition unsecured claims in Debtor's chapter 7 estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As to the July 2017 lease payment, Trustee argues that under the \"billing theory\" (the date on which payment under the lease is due) determines when a claim for administrative expense is incurred. The CBC lease with Debtor required Debtor to make lease payments on the first of each month; therefore, the July lease payment was due on July 1, 2017. Under the \"billing theory\" analysis, the July lease payment would be an administrative claim in the chapter 11 case. When the case was converted to chapter 7 on July 18, 2017, however, the July lease payment remained a chapter 11 expense claim that could then be treated as a pre-petition claim in the chapter 7 claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   CBC's request for an administrative expense claim under \u00a7 365(d)(5) requires the Court to conduct a statutory analysis of competing provisions of the Code. The Court must determine if CBC has a chapter 11 administrative expense claim, and, if so, is CBC's administrative claim subordinated to all chapter 7 administrative expense claims?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Section 365(d)(3) states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (3) The trustee shall timely perform all the obligations of the debtor, except\n   those specified in section 365(b)(2), arising from and after the order for relief under any unexpired lease of nonresidential real property, until such lease is assumed or rejected, notwithstanding section 503(b)(1) of this title. The court may extend, for cause, the time for performance of any such obligation that arises within 60 days after the date of the order for relief, but the time for performance shall not be extended beyond such 60-day period. This subsection shall not be deemed to affect the trustee's obligations under the provisions of subsection (b) or (f) of this section. Acceptance of any such performance does not constitute waiver or relinquishment of the lessor's rights under such lease or under this title.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Section 365(d)(5) states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (5) The trustee shall timely perform all of the obligations of the debtor, except those specified in section 365(b)(2), first arising from or after 60 days after the order for relief in a case under chapter 11 of this title under an unexpired lease of personal property (other than personal property leased to an individual primarily for personal, family, or household purposes), until such lease is assumed or rejected notwithstanding section 503(b)(1) of this title, unless the court, after notice and a hearing and based on the equities of the case, orders otherwise with respect to the obligations or timely performance thereof. This subsection shall not be deemed to affect the trustee's obligations under the provisions of subsection (b) or (f). Acceptance of any such performance does not constitute waiver or relinquishment of the lessor's rights under such lease or under this title.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Section 348(d) states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (d) A claim against the estate or the debtor that arises after the order for relief but before conversion in a case that is converted under section 1112, 1208, or 1307 of this title, other than a claim specified in section 503(b) of this title, shall be treated for all purposes as if such claim had arisen immediately before the date of the filing of the petition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Trustee notes that CBC filed its proof of claim (Claim No. 7-1) in the total amount of $9,479,232.00. This includes the amount requested in CBC's Application of $636,559.39. The railcar lease is attached to the proof of claim. Paragraph 4(a) provides that \"Lessee shall pay rent monthly in advance on the first day of each month without any deduction recoupment, setoff abatement, or alleged over-payment whatsoever.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Trustee argues that under \u00a7 348(d) that CBC's post-petition rentals (asserted as an administrative expense claim) became pre-petition claims upon Debtor's case being converted to chapter 7. In the alternative, Trustee submits that \u00a7 726(b)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   provides that in a case filed under chapter 11, but later converted to chapter 7, that administrative expenses in a chapter 11 case are subordinated to administrative expenses in the chapter 7 case. As such, under the\n   \"billing theory\", rental payments due under the rail car lease for July 2017 were due on July 1, 2017. Therefore, if CBC's claim is an administrative expense in the chapter 11 case, CBC's claim became subordinated under \u00a7 726(a) when the case was converted to chapter 7 on July 18, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The bankruptcy court for the Southern District of Texas considered this issue in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Simbaki\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201593888\">\n    2015 WL 1593888\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr.

In\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Simbaki\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the parties agreed that the lease payment was due on the first day of the month.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at *1.

However, this section only compensates for \"the actual, necessary costs and expenses of preserving the estate.\" In practical terms, the bankruptcy estate's liability for unpaid rent was limited to the reasonable value to the estate of the actual occupancy and use of the property.\n   <em>\n    In re Braniff Airways, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1543941,6127391\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/783/1283/\">\n    783 F.2d 1283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1286 (5th Cir.1986). Unlike other creditors, landlords often cannot choose to cease doing business with the debtor.

Rec. S8891, 599 (1984) (statement of Sen. Hatch).
