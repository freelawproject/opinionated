By letter dated October 14, 2016, Citi advised the Debtor of a proposed loan modification that would have reduced the Debtor's monthly mortgage and escrow payment from $3,044.32 to $2,721.96, with a corresponding reduction in interest rate from 5.5% to 3.75%.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    \u00b6 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Debtor argues that her personal liability\n   stemming from the note owned by Citi terminated when she received a bankruptcy discharge under \u00a7 524(a) of the Bankruptcy Code and Citi's subordinate note requirement in favor of HUD serves to reaffirm that discharged debt. Contempt Memo, ECF No. 16-10. The Debtor acknowledges that requesting an additional subordinate note or even a new mortgage is not itself a violation of the discharge injunction. Nonetheless, the present facts indicate that the Debtor would owe the principal sum of $102,551.13.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20105\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20105\">\n    \u00b6 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Citi Opp'n \u00b6 3, ECF No. 24. Citi further argues that the Debtor understates the amount owed to Citi and the Debtor's present motion reflects a misunderstanding of the partial claim process for a loan modification under HUD.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20105\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Citi points to the primary loan modification agreement in support:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (a) Not withstanding the foregoing, to the extent personal liability has been discharged in bankruptcy with respect to any amount payable under the Note, as modified herein,\n   <em>\n    nothing contained herein shall be construed to impose liability to repay any such obligation where any obligations have been so discharged\n   </em>\n   .

Contempt, Ex. C \u00b6 6(a), ECF No. 16-5 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Citi advises that the terms of the proposed loan modification agreement were realized using the partial claim program offered through HUD, which \"pays down\" a lender's first mortgage to bring it to an affordable level for the borrower. Citi Opp'n \u00b6 28, ECF No. 24. HUD's partial claim program offers to buy down a lender's loan by up to 30 percent of the unpaid principal balance. The \"partial claim defers the repayment of mortgage principal through an interest-free subordinate mortgage that is not due until the first mortgage is paid off.\" Citi Opp'n, Ex. A, ECF No. 24. Citi contends that the loan modification agreement's language releasing the Debtor from any and all personal liability extends to the subordinate note and subordinate mortgage that it is requiring the Debtor to sign. Citi Opp'n \u00b6 22, ECF No. 24. In the event that the Court finds Citi in contempt, Citi requests an opportunity for discovery under Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9014 and Local Bankruptcy Rule 9014-1 and an evidentiary hearing under Local Bankruptcy Rule 9014-2. Citi informs that such discovery would include document discovery and depositions from the Debtor's prior counsel who was involved in loss mitigation to determine what was understood about the HUD partial claim process and nonrecourse language of the loan modification agreement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20105\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20105\">\n    \u00b6 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In reply, the Debtor contends that there is no loan modification agreement provision stating that the new subordinate loan does not have to be repaid. On the contrary, the subordinate loan documents indicate that the deferred principal balance of $102,551.13 is to be repaid in 30 years or when the Property is sold. Opp'n Reply \u00b6 5, 8, ECF No. 26. The Debtor argues that Citi had knowledge of the Debtor's discharge in bankruptcy, yet Citi has demanded the reaffirmation of the discharged debt in the form of the subordinate note in violation of the discharge injunction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20105\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20105\">\n    \u00b6 16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court now considers whether Citi's demand for a subordinate note under HUD's partial claim program as a condition of a loan modification agreement post-discharge is a violation of the discharge injunction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20524\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Sections 524(a) and 727 of the Bankruptcy Code work in tandem to release a debtor from his or her personal liability on a debt or claim that existed at the time that the bankruptcy case was filed.\n   <em>\n    Green v.

This debt existed prior to the commencement of the Debtor's bankruptcy case that was filed on July 5, 2012, and as such, it was discharged upon the entry of the Discharge Order on October 11, 2012. The Court's Discharge Order clearly and unambiguously reads that \"[t]he Debtor is released from all dischargeable debts\" and that \"[a]ll creditors whose debts are discharged by this order ... are enjoined from instituting or continuing any action, employing any process or engaging in any act to collect such debts as personal liabilities of the Debtor(s).\" Discharge Order, ECF No. 9. While the Debtor's personal liability on the note ceased to exist upon entry of the discharge order, it is well settled that a creditor's right to foreclose on a mortgage survives or passes through bankruptcy.\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Citi Opp'n \u00b6 17, ECF No. 24. In this case, the unpaid principal was $341,837.12 and Citi would be able to offload up to $102,551.13 of the discharged debt through HUD's partial claim program.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6448672\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/185/139/#p142\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   By letter dated October 14, 2016, Citi offered a loan modification that required the Debtor to sign a subordinate note and subordinate mortgage in favor of HUD in the amount to be paid down, in this case $102,551.13.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. While the primary loan documents contain limiting language concerning the Debtor's personal liability on the modified loan, the subordinate note and subordinate mortgage in favor of HUD do not. Opp'n\n   Reply \u00b6 5, ECF No. 26; Citi Opp'n, ECF No. 24. On the contrary, a HUD \"partial claim\n   <em>\n    defers\n   </em>\n   the repayment of mortgage principal through an interest-free subordinate mortgage that is not due until the first mortgage is paid off.\" Citi Opp'n, Ex. A, ECF No. 24 (emphasis added). Simply delaying the Debtor's obligation to repay the deferred amount of $102,551.13 for thirty years is not the same as releasing the Debtor from any and all obligation to pay that debt-the same debt that has already been discharged in bankruptcy. Citi's argument that the release of personal liability contained in the primary loan documents extends to the subordinate loan fails for one reason-the primary loan documents do not make any reference to the HUD subordinate documents, other than listing the same new principal amount of $102,551.13. Citi Opp'n \u00b6 22, ECF No. 24. If Citi intended to release the Debtor from any and all personal liability on the modified loan and was not attempting to reaffirm a discharged debt, it could have easily included such language in the subordinate loan documents. Citi has failed to do so even after the Debtor voiced such objections and concerns. Mot. Contempt \u00b6 21, ECF No. 16-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   By filing for chapter 7, the Debtor chose to liquidate her assets for the benefit of her creditors-including the Property encumbered by Citi's mortgage. Citi's sole remedy to collect on the note\n   <em>\n    vis a vis\n   </em>\n   the Debtor was and is to foreclose on the Property. Citi may not demand any payment or remuneration from the Debtor as to the note. Nonetheless, \"a debtor may voluntarily pay any debt that has been discharged.\" Discharge Order, ECF No. 9. The key language here is \"voluntarily\" and defining that word is at issue in this case. To the extent the $102,551.13 subordinate note represents a portion of the discharged debt and as Citi had actual knowledge of the Debtor's bankruptcy case and discharge, Citi is in contempt of the discharge injunction for requiring a reaffirmation of a discharged debt and for attempting to offset the same as part of a post-discharge loan modification. Just as Citi is unable to coerce the Debtor into reaffirming a discharged debt, the Court cannot coerce Citi to execute a loan modification consistent with the Debtor's desired terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Citi's discovery requests are denied\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Court denies Citi's request to conduct depositions and discovery to determine what Debtor's prior counsel, Paulina Cardenas with the Fuster Law Firm, understood about the partial claim process and the nonrecourse language in the proposed loan modification agreement and how that information may have been communicated to the Debtor. Whatever the communications may have been between the parties during the loan modification negotiation process does not change the terms of the actual loan modification agreement proposed by Citi-which is the determinative issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Debtor is awarded attorney's fees\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Where a party violates a court order, such as the discharge injunction, civil contempt sanctions serve \"to coerce the contemnor into future compliance with the court's order or to compensate the complainant for losses resulting from the contemnor's past noncompliance.\"\n   <em>\n    New York State Nat.
