Thorne, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Introduction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Cleveland L. Carr (\"Carr\") and Antoinette L. Lindsey (\"Lindsey\") are both chapter 13 debtors who have proposed plans providing that their respective attorneys, Peter Frances Geraci Law, LLC (\"Geraci\") and The Semrad Firm, LLC (\"Semrad\"), be paid before their secured auto lenders. The chapter 13 trustee, Marilyn O. Marshall, has filed objections to each of their plans and to the applications to approve the compensation of each firm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The court has heard argument, read the submissions of the parties, and conducted its own independent research. Although these are two separate chapter 13 cases, the issues and points of law are nearly equivalent, and because these issues relate to a great many chapter 13 plans and fee applications presented to this court, the court will issue one decision ruling on both cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The court finds that the proposed plans are confirmable but will deny the applications for compensation without prejudice as explained in this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Cleveland L. Carr\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Carr filed a chapter 13 petition in September 2017. He has asked the court to confirm a plan which will require the chapter 13 trustee to disburse payments first to the trustee and second to his auto lender, Exeter Financial (\"Exeter\"), and to his attorney at the same priority.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other\n   words, Carr's attorneys' fees in the amount of $4,000.00, and Exeter's secured claim in the amount of $13,100.00, will be paid at $200.00 and $348.00 per month, respectively. To date, Exeter has not objected to the proposed $348.00 per month payment through the life of the plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In Carr's case, a fee application was filed a week after the petition seeking approval of $4,000.00 in fees. Along with the application, Carr's law firm, Geraci, filed a Court Approved Retention Agreement (\"CARA\") signed by Carr and one of Geraci's attorneys. The CARA was signed nearly two weeks before Carr's petition was filed. The CARA pertinently provided that the debtor would pay the filing fee of $310.00 and attorneys' fees of $4,000.00. It obligated the attorney to, among other things, \"[p]ersonally explain ... how and when the attorneys' fees and the trustee's fees are determined and paid.\" It also obligated the attorney to \"[p]ersonally review with the debtor ... the completed ... [chapter 13] plan.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During the briefing on this matter, a detailed affidavit signed by Carr was filed as an exhibit to one of the pleadings. The affidavit provided that before the filing of the petition, Carr was informed of the precise terms of Geraci's accelerated compensation under the plan as well as the detrimental effect it would have on the early plan payments to Exeter. Carr stated that before the filing of the petition, he was made fully aware by Geraci that an early dismissal in his case would result in it being much more difficult for him to keep his vehicle as a practical matter because he would be paying more to his attorneys at the beginning of the case and less to the auto lender until the attorneys' fees were paid in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Antoinette L. Lindsey\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The facts are much the same in Lindsey's case. Lindsey filed a chapter 13 petition in August 2017 and proposed a plan making payments in the amount of $590.00 per month for 60 months. During the early months of the case, the plan provides that the chapter 13 trustee will make adequate protection payments to the car lender, Regional Acceptance (\"Regional\"), in the amount of $25.00 per month. Regional has not objected to this amount of adequate protection. Starting in August of 2018, the payments to Regional increase to $500.00 per month. During the period of adequate protection payments, Lindsey's law firm, Semrad, will be paid over $500.00 per month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Just as with Carr's case, Lindsey and her Semrad attorney entered into the CARA, which set out the same basic obligations as in the Carr case. They first entered into the CARA on August 14, 2017 (a week before filing). They executed a new CARA on the date that Lindsey filed her petition, August 21, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   During the briefing in Lindsey's case, a set of disclaimers initialed by Lindsey and dated August 14, 2017 (a week before filing) was filed as an exhibit. The disclaimers indicate that Lindsey understood that Semrad would be paid before any of her creditors. A separate disclaimer indicated, however, that Lindsey understood that Semrad would be paid \"before all creditors unless otherwise agreed or ordered by the court.\" The disclaimers, however, do not show that Lindsey understood, for example, the practical difficulties an early dismissal would have on her ability to keep\n   her vehicle given the accelerated payment of Semrad's fees under the plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Trustee's Objections to the Plans and Applications for Compensation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In both cases, the trustee filed an objection to the attorneys' compensation and an objection to confirmation of the chapter 13 plan. The trustee objects to the following: (1) payments made to the secured creditors will not be in \"equal monthly amounts,\" since they receive only adequate protection for a certain amount of time, and only later do they begin receiving increased payments on their allowed secured claim;\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) debtors' attorneys in these cases have not shown that they have benefitted the estate; (3) the attorneys have breached their fiduciary obligations to the debtors by not disclosing to the debtors that they would be paid ahead of the debtors' other creditors, particularly the auto lenders; and (4) both attorneys violated Local Rule 2016-1 because both attorneys had come to an \"agreement\" with their clients concerning their compensation, and those agreements were never then reduced to writing, signed by both parties, and filed with the court pursuant to the requirements of Local Rule 2016-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   For the reasons discussed below, the chapter 13 plans in both cases will be confirmed. Compensation in both cases is denied without prejudice. Counsel may refile applications seeking approval of compensation in conformity with this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Is the Accelerated Payment of Attorneys' Fees in Chapter 13 Plans Permissible under the Bankruptcy Code in these Cases?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The court must decide whether section 1325(a)(5)(B)(iii)(I) applies where a secured creditor is not objecting to its treatment under the plan. Because the court concludes that it does not, the court does not reach the question as to whether or not that provision is violated when a secured creditor receives post-confirmation payments under the plan that are different in amount. For this reason, the trustee's objection to confirmation of the plan in Lindsey's case is overruled.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Relevant Statutory Provisions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Section 1325(a)(5) provides in relevant part that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   with respect to each allowed secured claim provided for by the plan- (A) the holder of such claim has accepted the plan; (B) ... (iii) if- (I) the property to be distributed pursuant to this subsection is in the form of periodic payments, such payments shall be in equal monthly amounts; and (II) the holder of the claim is secured by personal property, the amount of such payments shall not be less than an amount sufficient to provide to the holder of such claim adequate protection during the period of the plan; or (C) the debtor surrenders the property securing such claim to such holder ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5). For the court to confirm a chapter 13 plan, it must satisfy itself that one of section 1325(a)(5)'s three conditions has been met, since section 1325(a)(5) must be satisfied in order for a plan to be confirmed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v.

Section 1326(b) sets up a scheme by which administrative expense payments must be made either before or concurrently with payments to creditors; in other words, initial payments to administrative expense claimants cannot commence on a date later than the date on which initial payments to creditors begin.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Maldonado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4160084\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/483/326/#p337\">\n    483 B.R. 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 337 (Bankr.

First, the section references unpaid claims \"of a kind specified in section 507(a)(2),\" which in turn references the administrative expenses found in section 503(b), with those expenses including compensation and reimbursement awarded under section 330(a) of this title.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1), 507(a)(2), 503(b)(2). One type of compensation or reimbursement that may be awarded under section 330(a) is that for the services of a debtor's attorney in a case under chapter 13.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20330\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the approved compensation of a debtor's attorney in chapter 13 case may be paid under the chapter 13 plan out of the estate,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201306\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and that compensation must be paid under the plan in the manner provided by section 1326(b)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The question to be answered here is whether a chapter 13 plan may be confirmed where a secured creditor is to continue receiving adequate protection payments under the plan until the debtor's attorneys' fees are paid in full, after which time the payments to the secured creditor under the plan \"step up\" to an increased amount sufficient to pay off the creditor's claim in the time allotted under the plan. There is no doubt that, in isolation, section 1326(b)(1) allows for the payment of attorneys' fees prior to the payment of creditors. The difficulty arises where this type of arrangement causes the monthly payments made to the secured creditor under the plan to be unequal, potentially running afoul of section 1325(a)(5)(B)(iii)(I). A further wrinkle is added in these cases by the fact that no affected secured creditor has objected to the plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Should this Court Apply Section 1325(a)(5)(B) Where no Secured Creditor has Objected to Confirmation of the Plan?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   A threshold question to be answered, however, is whether the failure of a secured creditor to object to confirmation of the plan renders section 1325(a)(5)(A) satisfied in these circumstances. If it does, then section 1325(a)(5)(B) would not have any application,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Andrews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7418212,6118732\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/49/1404/\">\n    49 F.3d at 1409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting the disjunctive \"or\"), and the objection to the accelerated treatment of debtors' attorneys' fees under section 1326(b)(1) on the basis that such treatment causes the monthly payments to certain secured creditors to be unequal would have no merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   A majority of courts consider section 1325(a)(5)(A) to be satisfied as to the debtor's secured creditors where secured creditors have had proper notice and no secured creditor is objecting.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4060590\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/530/1284/#p1291\">\n    530 F.3d 1284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1291 (10th Cir. 2008) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Lorenzo\n   </em>\n   , No. BAP PR 15-011,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204537792\">\n    2015 WL 4537792\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (1st Cir.

D.S.C. 2017). The court finds that the secured creditors, in these cases the auto lenders, have had adequate notice of the debtor's plan in both cases, and neither has objected to the current plans being proposed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 1325(a)(5)(A) is therefore satisfied.

There is no\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   rule that a plan proposing to pay attorneys' fees ahead of the debtor's creditors\n   is a violation of section 1325(a)(3)'s good faith requirement.\n   <em>\n    In re Crager\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151354,3509663\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/691/671/\">\n    691 F.3d 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 675-76 (5th Cir. 2012). To the extent the trustee raises any breach of the attorneys' fiduciary duties with respect to her section 1325(a)(3) argument, the court notes that such breaches are more properly addressed by this court in ruling on the attorneys' applications for compensation.

The Attorneys' Fiduciary Duties, Local Rule 2016-1, and the Objections to Compensation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In her objection to compensation, the trustee has argued that the debtors' attorneys' compensation should be denied for essentially three reasons. First, she argues that they cannot show that they provided a benefit to the estate. Second, she argues that the attorneys breached their fiduciary obligations that they owe to their clients, the debtors, because they have not shown that they have adequately explained the terms of their compensation and the implications of that compensation on the interests of their clients. Third, the trustee argues that Local Rule 2016-1 was violated in both cases because the attorneys had an understanding with their clients as to the way in which the attorneys' fees would be paid, and this type of understanding is an \"agreement\" in the broad sense of that term as it is used in the Local Rule. This agreement, she argues, also pertains to compensation, and therefore falls within the Rule requiring its being reduced to writing, signed by both parties, and filed with the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Two local rules are considered in detail below in relation to the trustee's claim that one of these rules (Local Rule 2016-1) has necessarily been violated in these cases. Suffice it to say for now that this district still utilizes the same procedure described generally above by the court in\n   <em>\n    Brent:\n   </em>\n   if the attorney and debtor enter into the Court Approved Retention Agreement (and no other agreement), and if the attorney does not seek more than a $4,000.00 fee, then the attorney is presumptively entitled to the requested fee and does not have to submit a detailed fee application in order to be awarded the fee as an administrative expense to be paid out of the bankruptcy estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Fiduciary Duty Violations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The court begins first with the trustee's question as to whether or not the attorneys have violated any fiduciary obligations they owe to their clients in seeking payment of fees on an accelerated basis under their respective chapter 13 plans with the disclosures that were given in these cases. The court concludes that in these cases, since the cases are consumer chapter 13 cases where the attorney is to be paid at least partly over time pursuant to the chapter 13 plan, the attorneys had a minimum duty to disclose the negative ramifications of an early dismissal on the interests of the debtor prior to or simultaneously with entering into the retention agreement. Pertinently in these cases, this means that they had a duty to disclose that, because attorneys' fees would be paid ahead of or concurrently with the debtors' auto lenders, an early dismissal of the chapter 13 case might or would, depending on when exactly the dismissal happened, significantly impair each debtor's ability to keep his/her vehicle. Though this duty was imposed by Illinois law in these cases, its existence and breach is relevant only to this court's analysis of the attorneys' requests for compensation under Bankruptcy Code sections 329 and 330.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   As a threshold matter, the trustee is correct to look to Illinois law in raising this objection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v.

Prospective bankruptcy debtors are often anxious and desperate to retain houses, tenancies or leases, and automobiles. That these debtors later filed for bankruptcy is more evidence of their vulnerability and more evidence that the creation of the attorney-client relationship, assuming that event did not happen prior to the signing of the retention agreement, involved the client's placing a peculiar trust and confidence in the attorney. The law has long recognized the particular risk of attorney overreaching in the run-up to a bankruptcy filing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20329\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    In re Wood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3651444\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/210/246/#p253\">\n    210 U.S. 246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 253,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3651444\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/210/246/#p253\">\n    28 S.Ct. 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3651444\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/210/246/#p253\">\n    52 L.Ed. 1046\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1908) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Michaelson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1356169\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/222/595/#p597\">\n    222 B.R. 595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 597 (Bankr.

Ill. 1997).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Finally, even where a prospective principal is not vulnerable and unknowledgeable, there is a heightened reliance on fair dealing from a prospective agent in setting the terms of the compensation where the implications of the fee structure on the interests of the client can only be known based on information within the control of the prospective agent. Here, that heightened reliance on fair dealing is present because the implications of the attorneys' fees on the clients' interests could only be known by reference to the Bankruptcy Code's provisions for payment of attorneys' fees out of the estate and from the provisions of\n   the chapter 13 plan. This type of knowledge belongs peculiarly to the attorney and not at all to the client, since one part of the attorney's job is generally to understand the workings of the law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF AGENCY \u00a7 390 cmt. e (1958) (noting the significance of the prospective principal's reliance on fair dealing from the prospective agent);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Deborah A. DeMott,\n   <em>\n    Breach of Fiduciary Duty: On Justifiable Expectations of Loyalty and Their Consequences\n   </em>\n   , 48 ARIZ. L. REV. 925, 950 (2006) (noting the relevance of unique access to information). This type of reliance might not be present in a case where the attorney's fees are simply agreed to be paid as a lump sum up front before filing; there, the implications of the fee on the client's interests would appear to be quite clear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The court is well aware that the CARA already contractually obligates the attorney to explain how attorney's fees are determined and paid. To the extent the attorney fulfills the fiduciary obligation to ensure that the client understands the implications of the payment of attorney's fees, the attorney will more than likely simultaneously fulfill that contractual obligation. To the extent the attorney does not fulfill the fiduciary obligation in entering into the CARA, but later explains how the fees are paid and ensures that the client fully understands the implications of how those fees are paid, the client might be taken to have waived any breach of the attorney's fiduciary obligation in entering into the CARA by continuing the representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In sum, the court concludes that imposing on the attorneys a fiduciary obligation to deal fairly and make a full disclosure as to compensation prior to entering into the retention agreement is appropriate in these cases. Semrad has not shown that the implications of its compensation structure, in that an early dismissal would result in Lindsey being unable to retain her vehicle as a practical matter, were appreciated in all of their stark significance by Lindsey. Geraci, by contrast, has, since its detailed affidavit shows Carr understood, at least prior to filing,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   that an early dismissal would result in a practical inability to keep his vehicle. The court therefore sustains the trustee's objection as to Semrad and overrules it as to Geraci. Because Semrad's breach occurred before any services were provided, however, the court cannot find that the value of services provided to the debtor was diminished by the breach. Moreover, in light of Semrad's good faith throughout this process and the fact that it did make some disclosures to the debtor, the court declines to exercise its inherent power to deny compensation for an attorney's breach of a fiduciary duty. Both applications for compensation will instead be denied for having violated Local Rule 2016-1 as discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

The trustee is correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The rule reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   Every\n   <em>\n    agreement\n   </em>\n   between a debtor and an attorney for the debtor that pertains,\n   <em>\n    directly or indirectly\n   </em>\n   , to the\n   <em>\n    compensation\n   </em>\n   paid or given, or to be paid or given, to or for the benefit of the attorney must be in the form of a written document signed by the debtor and the attorney.

Every contract is an agreement; but not every agreement is a contract. In its colloquial sense, the term 'agreement' would include any arrangement between two or more persons intended to affect their relations (whether legal or otherwise) to each other. An accepted invitation to dinner, for example, would be an agreement in this sense; but it would not be a contract because it would neither be intended to create, nor would it in fact crate, any legal obligation between the parties to it. Further, even an agreement which is intended to affect the legal relations of the parties does not necessarily amount to a contract in the strict sense of the term. For instance, a conveyance of land or a gift of a chattel, though involving an agreement, is ... not a contract; because its primary legal operation is to effect a transfer of property, and not to create an obligation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611233,12611234,12611235,12611237,12611238,12611241,12611242\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/199/81/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting 2 STEPHEN'S COMMENTARIES ON THE LAWS OF ENGLAND 5 (L. Crispin Warmington ed., 21st ed. 1950) ). Thus, agreement is broader than contract: it means any mutual arrangement or understanding between two people that is intended to\n   alter or that has the effect of altering the relations between them, whether legal or otherwise, and whether or not the arrangement or understanding has the effect of creating binding legal obligations between them as a contract does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The understandings that existed in these cases surely fall within this definition. In disclosing to the debtors that the attorneys would be paid under the plan ahead of the debtors' creditors, and in the debtors' acknowledgement of that fact and subsequent acquiescence, there was a mutual understanding between the parties at least of the attorneys' rights going forward to the money that the debtor would be paying into the plan, and, in Geraci's case, of the actual effect of the debtor's future performance under the plan on the status of the debtor's other obligations owed to creditors. These understandings, then, were agreements, and they clearly pertained to compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Yet they were never signed by the attorney and the debtor in each case and filed with the court as required by the Local Rule. The attorneys' reason for not disclosing these agreements initially as required is roughly that, based on an interpretation of the Local Rules regarding nolook fees, the CARA is the only agreement required to be disclosed, and indeed that if they had filed any other agreement other than the CARA, they would have lost their ability to seek a nolook fee. They also reason in any event that these understandings were not separate agreements within the meaning of Local Rule 2016-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The attorneys are incorrect. Local Rule 2016-1 makes it clear by its terms that\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   agreement pertaining to compensation, including (but not limited to) the CARA, must be disclosed. These understandings are within the definition of agreement in Local Rule 2016-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Further, Local Rule 5082-2(C), which specifically governs the award of a no-look fee in chapter 13 cases, states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   (1) If debtor's counsel and the debtor have entered into the Court-Approved Retention Agreement, counsel may apply for a Flat Fee not to exceed the amount authorized by the applicable General Order [$4,000.00]. If the Court-Approved Retention Agreement has been modified in any way, a Flat Fee will not be awarded, and all compensation may be denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Did these understandings modify the CARA? Surely not. \"Modify\" is defined as \"[t]o make somewhat different.\"\n   <em>\n    Modify\n   </em>\n   , BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 1157 (10th ed. 2014). The understandings did not make the CARA different; the terms of the CARA remained the same as before. The mutual understandings in these cases regarded the attorney being able to seek payment on an accelerated basis out of the estate under the plan. These understandings did not change the parties' rights and obligations under the CARA, except insofar as the understanding may itself have come about by way of the attorney also fulfilling his/her explanatory duty under the CARA. In that sense, by explaining the terms of the compensation and coming to an understanding, the CARA was modified in that one of the duties it had imposed had been performed, but this did not work a change to its very terms. This is so even though an obligation created by those terms may have been satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Local Rule 5082-2(C) provides further:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   (2) If debtor's counsel and the debtor have not entered into the Court-Approved Retention Agreement, the Form Fee Application must be accompanied by a completed Form Itemization.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   This part has no application, since the attorney and the debtor did enter into the CARA in these cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The rule finally provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   (3) The Flat Fee will not be awarded and all compensation may be denied if, in addition to the Court-Approved Retention Agreement, the debtor and an attorney for the debtor have entered into any other agreement in connection with the representation of the debtor in preparation for, during, or involving a Chapter 13 case, and the agreement provides for the attorney to receive:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   (a) any kind of compensation, reimbursement, or other payment; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   (b) any form of, or security for, compensation, reimbursement, or other payment that varies from the Court-Approved Retention Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   It would be fair to conclude that the meaning of agreement in this Rule is the same as in Rule 2016-1. Therefore, the attorneys and debtors did enter into an agreement in connection with the representation of the debtor in these chapter 13 cases. That agreement was the understanding that they had regarding the manner in which the attorneys' compensation would be paid under the plan, specifically that it would or might be paid ahead of the debtor's creditors. In Geraci's case, the understanding also encompassed the specific implications of that fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Did this agreement also provide for the attorney to receive any kind of compensation, reimbursement, or other payment? No. In these cases, the only agreement that provided for the compensation of the attorney was the CARA. Since the CARA itself contractually allows the attorney to seek payment of the fees out of the bankruptcy estate pursuant to the Code-compliant provisions of the chapter 13 plan, any understanding between the attorney and the debtor regarding the mechanics of the compensation was just that: an understanding. Having that understanding might satisfy any fiduciary obligations that the attorney may owe in a given case when coming to an agreement on compensation, and/or it might satisfy certain contractual obligations under the CARA, but the understanding would in no way provide for what has already been established by the CARA itself.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The end result of this analysis is that any understanding that the attorney and debtor have regarding the precise manner of the attorneys' compensation under the chapter 13 plan, whether that understanding comes about (1) as a result of the attorneys' compliance with any fiduciary obligations that he/she may owe, and/or (2) as a result of the attorneys' compliance with the contractual provisions contained in the CARA, is subject to the requirements of Local Rule 2016-1. Compliance with this Local Rule protects both the client and the attorney in forcing them to reduce to writing their understanding and helps to avoid any future surprises as to the precise way in which fees are paid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Local Rule 2016-1 was not complied with in these cases. Though agreements existed, they were not disclosed. Because of this fact, the attorneys' certifications under Local Rule 5082-2(B)(2) were false and hence, under that rule, neither firm is entitled to have their compensation approved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The plans proposed in both cases are confirmable. The fee applications filed in both cases will be denied without prejudice and may be refiled subject to disclosure of the agreements between the debtor and counsel as to the compensation. Each fee application filed before this court, whether the fees are to be paid before the claims of creditors or simultaneously with the claims of creditors, must have attached to it the agreements required by Local Rule 2016-1.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    The last amended plan filed by Carr provided that his attorneys would be paid first while the auto lender received adequate protection payments.

The Rule, however, is concerned with \"other agreement[s]\" providing for compensation. The separate understanding, even if it satisfies a fiduciary obligation, would not,\n    <em>\n     on its own\n    </em>\n    , provide for the attorney's compensation, since that understanding simply cannot exist except by specific reference to the attorney's contractual right to compensation under the CARA.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
