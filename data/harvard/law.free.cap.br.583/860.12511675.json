(\"the Debtor\") has filed a complaint (\"the Complaint\"), seeking damages from Sundt/Layton, a joint venture, Sundt Construction, Inc., Layton Construction Company, LLC (collectively \"Sundt/Layton\") and the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (\"the CDCR\") based on alleged breaches of a construction contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Debtor also seeks recovery from Fidelity &amp; Deposit Company of Maryland, Zurich American Insurance Company, Federal Insurance Company and Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (\"the Sureties\") on a public works bond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Defendants have filed a Motion to Dismiss the Complaint (\"the Motion\"), asserting:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   1.

The Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss the Complaint under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) on September 29, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both sides filed a memorandum and supplemental memorandum in support of their respective positions, the last of which was filed on January 31, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
