On June 2, 2016, Debtor filed a petition (\"Petition\") for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. [Case No. 16-31836, Doc. # 1].\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the 341 hearing held on August 16, 2016, Defendant-Debtor revealed that he failed to schedule a number of assets and transfers. [Doc. # 19, Pl. Ex. 3]. Specifically, Mr. Beatty admitted that he had failed to disclose possession of a vehicle. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Initially, Defendant-Debtor asserted that the black Ford Mustang GT in his garage belonged to a friend. [\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1748005,6544269\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/828/249/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , pp. 16-18]. Upon further questioning by the Trustee, he admitted that he owned the Mustang. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Defendant-Debtor also admitted to owning various items of personal property not listed on the Petition, including an iPhone, a Wii game console, and an iPad. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 20-21]. A list submitted by Mr. Beatty at a Rule 2004 examination held on April 28, 2017 further disclosed that he owned two televisions, a sound bar speaker system, and a laptop. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Pl. Ex. 7]. None of these assets that were belatedly disclosed at the 2004 examination had been listed on Defendant-Debtor's bankruptcy Schedules. [Case No. 16-31836, Doc. # 1, pp. 10-16].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In addition, Defendant-Debtor identified some business interests and real estate transfers in Schedule A/B and his Statement of Financial Affairs, but not others. Specifically, he disclosed ownership interests in Trademark Roofing &amp; Remodeling, LLC, Broadview Construction, LLC, and Broadview Builders, Ltd. [Doc. # 1, pp. 10-16 &amp; 41], but did not include his membership interest in Beatty Enterprises, LLC, a real estate venture Defendant-Debtor entered into with his brother. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Pl. Ex. 4, p. 64]. Further, while Mr. Beatty listed an August 2015 transfer of a vacant lot located on Bellamy Road in Berlin Heights, Ohio [Case No. 16-31836, Doc. # 1, p. 39, Q. 18], he did not disclose other real estate transfers made within two years of his bankruptcy filing. Specifically, Defendant-Debtor had also transferred his ownership interests in two properties located in Sandusky to his brother in January of 2015. [Doc. # 19, Pl. Ex. 3, pp. 25-27; Pl. Ex. 4, pp. 11, 59]. Neither of the Sandusky transfers were listed on Defendant-Debtor's Statement of Financial Affairs in response to Question No. 18. [Case No. 16-31836, Doc. # 1, p. 39, Q. 18].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff also asserts that there is a substantial discrepancy between the minimal assets claimed on Defendant-Debtor's schedules and the sizable income reported in his 2014 and 2015 tax returns. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Pl. Ex. 8, 9, 10, 11]. In Schedule A/B, Defendant-Debtor listed assets consisting of $25.00 in cash, $400.00 in a checking account, and personal items with a total value of $4,525.00. [Doc. # 1, pp 12-14]. As recorded in PNC bank records authenticated by Defendant-Debtor at the Rule 2004 examination, Defendant-Debtor withdrew a total of $264,130.00 from Broadview Construction LLC and Broadview Builders Ltd. accounts during 2014 and 2015. [Doc. # 19, Pl. Ex. 4, p. 90; Pl. Ex. 8]. The Schedules reflect that Mr. Beatty had a 100% ownership interest in both \"Broadview Construction LLC\" and \"Broadview Builders Ltd\". [Doc. # 1, p. 14]. Mr. Beatty's 2014 and 2015 federal tax returns further indicate that Defendant-Debtor reported $302,408.00 in income during that two year period. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Pl. Ex. 4, p. 90-93; Pl. Ex. 10, 11]. Upon being questioned as to his various withdrawals and reported income during the Rule 2004 examination, Defendant-Debtor failed to provide any explanation as to where these monies had gone. [Doc. # 19, Pl. Ex. 4, pp. 102-106].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In its Motion, Plaintiff asserts that the Defendant-Debtor's aforementioned omissions and inability to account for the discrepancy between the assets listed on his bankruptcy schedules and his significant past income are a basis for the denial of discharge under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . [Doc. # 19]. First, Plaintiff argues that Defendant-Debtor's failure to disclose ownership of the Ford Mustang and the false assertion that it belonged to a friend constitutes an intentional or reckless omission that concealed an asset from the estate under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 45]. Second, Plaintiff argues that Defendant-Debtor's omissions and attempt at concealing the Mustang should be held to be a false oath or account under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 83]. Lastly, Plaintiff argues that Defendant-Debtor systematically withdrew large sums of money from owned business entities, Broadview Construction, LLC and Broadview Builders, Ltd., and he cannot satisfactorily account for the loss or deficiency of those funds. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 107]. Accordingly, Defendant-Debtor's discharge should be denied under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In response, Defendant-Debtor argues that his failure to properly list assets material to his bankruptcy case can be explained by the fact that the bankruptcy forms and schedules had been recently changed before Mr. Beatty filed his Chapter 7 case. [Doc. # 20, pp. 4-5]. Defendant-Debtor also maintains that his failure to mention recent transfers of real property ought not subject him to a denial of discharge because said transfers were of over-encumbered real estate with no equity. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 3]. Finally, in response to the assertion that Defendant-Debtor has not explained satisfactorily any loss of assets or deficiency of assets to meet the debtor's liabilities under Section 727(a)(5), counsel asserts that there is no evidence that Mr. Beatty's business records were deficient in comparison with \"others in his industry.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 4].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A review of the record shows that Defendant-Debtor has not amended his Petition or supporting documents to include the various alleged omissions delineated in Plaintiff's Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     LAW AND ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Summary Judgment Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, made applicable to this proceeding by Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7056, summary judgment is proper only where there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Particularly where there are no contradictory affidavits or citations to the record that raise a genuine issue of material fact, and where other omissions, such as Mr. Beatty's failure to list his interest in Beatty Enterprises, LLC and the two transfers of Sandusky real estate, make the bare suggestion of it all being a \"mistake\" untenable.

First, Defendant-Debtor omitted the Mustang from Schedules filed under penalty of perjury and provided testimony regarding the Mustang while under oath at the 341 hearing. [Doc. # 19, Pl.
