P. 16(f), 37, and 41(b) for Failing to Appear at Depositions and Other Violations\n   </em>\n   [Doc. No. 353] (the \"Dismissal Motion\"), as supplemented by Docket Nos. 354 and 378 (the \"Supplements\") filed by the City of Framingham (\"Framingham\"). No objection to the Dismissal Motion having been timely filed by Larry Francis Rogers (the \"Debtor\" or \"Mr. Rogers\") in accordance with the Order at Docket No. 355 establishing a response deadline of April 13, 2018; Framingham having filed a certification [Doc. No. 370]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   (the \"Certification\") that the Debtor did not pay the monetary sanction due in accordance with the Order at Docket No. 311 (the \"Sanctions Order\") entered with respect to a prior motion brought by Framingham under Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2) ; and after taking judicial notice of and considering the docket and record in this case, with due cause appearing, the Court hereby grants the Dismissal Motion and denies the Debtor's\n   <em>\n    Preliminary Motion for Contempt for Violation of Stay\n   </em>\n   [Doc. No. 20] (\"Preliminary 362(k) Town\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Motion\"), as supplemented by the filing at Docket No. 155 (collectively, the \"362(k) Town Motion\"). Mr. Rogers,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   failed to (i) appear at a deposition scheduled by order of the Court; (ii) appear at several hearings and case management conferences without being excused by the Court; (iii) pay sanctions or appear at a second deposition as ordered by the Court pursuant to the Sanctions Order, notwithstanding this Court's warning that failure to comply with the Sanctions Order would result in dismissal of Mr. Rogers's claims against Framingham; and (iv) file an opposition to the Dismissal Motion. As will be discussed in detail below, after considering the totality of the circumstances, denying the 362(k) Town Motion is the appropriate sanction to address Mr. Rogers's conduct in this contested matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND TRAVEL OF THIS CASE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Although the procedural history regarding the 362(k) Town Motion and Mr. Rogers's conduct in the context of that contested matter is central to the Court's determination of the Dismissal Motion, an overview of the history of this case is useful to understand the Court's consideration of the totality of the circumstances in determining an appropriate sanction for Mr. Rogers's failure to comply with discovery orders entered by this Court. Mr. Rogers's acts and omissions in this case demonstrate his willful evasion of, indifference to, or inability to comprehend the Court's role in adjudicating disputes among parties with respect to matters over which it has jurisdiction and the requirements imposed by the discovery process with respect to contested matters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On April 24, 2017, Mr. Rogers, along with joint debtor, Mae Encarnado Rogers (Mr. Rogers, together with Mrs. Rogers, the \"Debtors\") filed a petition under Chapter 7 of Title 11 of the United States Code,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.,\n   </em>\n   as amended (the \"Bankruptcy Code\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtors were granted a discharge on August 11, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 9, 2017, Framingham filed a\n   <em>\n    Motion for an Order that the Town is not Subject to (or, in the Alternative, for Relief from) Automatic Stay\n   </em>\n   [Doc. No. 14] (the \"Motion for Relief\"). The Court scheduled a hearing for June 14, 2017 (the \"June 14 Hearing\"). Through the Motion for Relief, Framingham sought a determination that it was \"not subject to the automatic stay for purposes of adjudicating and collecting fines issued pursuant to G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 21D and otherwise seeking enforcement remedies in connection with the violation of the Town's bylaws\" or, alternatively, relief from stay \"pursuant to 11 U.S.C. [\u00a7] 362(b)(4), to allow the Town to pursue such fines and enforcement remedies.\" Mot. for Relief 1. Framingham had issued violation notices, which amounted to approximately $600 in asserted fines when\n   interest was included, copies of which were attached to the Motion for Relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20101\">\n     id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. B. In the Motion for Relief, Framingham referenced a proceeding pending before the Framingham District Court against Mr. Rogers (the \"State Court Action\") relating to enforcement of pre-petition nuisance ordinance fines. Framingham represented in the Motion for Relief that there was a hearing scheduled in the State Court Action for June 22, 2017,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20101\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20101\">\n    \u00b6 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and sought relief from the automatic stay, to the extent necessary, to proceed with that matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Debtors filed a\n   <em>\n    Preliminary Objection to Emergency Motion By Town of Framingham, MA\n   </em>\n   [Doc. No. 19] prior to the June 14 Hearing and an objection in open Court at that hearing [Doc. No. 23] (collectively, the \"Objections\"). On June 13, 2017, the Debtors filed their Preliminary 362(k) Town Motion, which the Court scheduled for a preliminary status conference at the time as the June 14 Hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Status Conference at Doc. No. 21. Initially, the Debtors asserted that Framingham had commenced the State Court Action solely to collect a debt after it had received notice of the bankruptcy filing in violation of the automatic stay. The Debtors also asserted that Framingham violated the automatic stay by continuing a hearing in the State Court Action and by filing its Motion for Relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Debtors appeared at the June 14 Hearing on the Motion for Relief. Mr. Rogers took the position that there was no \"emergency\" that warranted Framingham being permitted on shortened notice to proceed with the State Court Action and that such proceeding was merely a collection action that was subject to the stay, as opposed to a \"police\" or \"regulatory\" action as to which the stay would not apply.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 362(b)(4). At the hearing, Mr. Rogers made clear that he believed that the State Court Action was part of an ongoing effort by Framingham's building inspection department to harass him. Eventually, as the case progressed, Mr. Rogers's harassment allegations expanded to include references to events that Mr. Rogers relates to allegations that he made in or about 2010 that he had been beaten while in custody by Framingham's police department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the June 14 Hearing, the Court declined to grant relief from the automatic stay on an expedited basis regarding the prepetition fines, agreeing with the Debtors that there was no good cause for expedited determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ord. at Doc. No. 28, \u00b6 4\n   <strong>\n    .\n   </strong>\n   The Court concluded that, until the purpose of the State Court Action could be more fully developed on the record, a further hearing would be necessary to consider whether the automatic stay provisions applied to the collection of the pre-petition fines.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court granted limited relief from stay to the extent necessary to permit Framingham to request a continuance of the scheduled hearing in the State Court Action.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    \u00b6 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court scheduled a further hearing to determine whether the automatic stay applied to the State Court Action and, if so, whether relief from the automatic stay should be granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    \u00b6 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; Ord. at Doc. No. 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In its order,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court also confirmed that, pursuant to \u00a7 362(b)(4), Framingham\n   could pursue state law remedies to enforce its nuisance by-laws for post-petition violations if acts were taken within its police and regulatory powers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ord. at Doc. No. 28, \u00b6\u00b6 1-3. At the June 14 Hearing, the Court attempted to simplify the issues before the Court and more clearly define or eliminate any pressing concerns relating to the \"police\" or \"regulatory\" aspect of Framingham's code enforcement actions by arranging for a voluntary inspection of the Debtors' property to ensure no continuing alleged violations of Framingham's nuisance by-laws. If those issues were addressed, the record would be clear that the Motion for Relief related solely to the collection or enforcement of fines in the State Court Action, which would be subject to the stay only if pecuniary in nature.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McMullen v. Sevigny (In re McMullen),\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9156330,9152395\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/386/320/\">\n    386 F.3d 320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 325 (1st Cir. 2004) (internal citations omitted) (holding that \"[C]ourts have devised two interrelated, fact-dominated inquiries-the so-called 'public policy' and 'pecuniary purpose' tests-for assessing whether a particular governmental proceeding comes within the subsection 362(b)(4) exception. These inquiries contemplate that the bankruptcy court, after assessing the totality of the circumstances, determine whether the particular regulatory proceeding at issue is designed primarily to protect the public safety and welfare, or represents a governmental attempt to recover from property of the debtor estate, whether on its own claim, or on the nongovernmental debts of private parties\");\n   <em>\n    Spookyworld, Inc. v.

Mr. Rogers declined to commit to a specific time for an inspection during the June 14 Hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court held a continued hearing on the Motion for Relief and the Preliminary 362(k) Town Motion on August 8, 2017 (the \"August 8 Hearing\"), at which hearing Framingham withdrew its Motion for Relief and stated on the record that it would be dismissing the State Court Action and it was not seeking to collect any prepetition fines from the Debtors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtor stated at the August 8 Hearing and subsequent hearings and in pleadings that further grounds existed for relief under 362(k), including for damages arising from an alleged police incident in June 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court established a deadline of August 31, 2017 for the Debtors to supplement their Preliminary 362(k) Town Motion to assert all alleged violations of 362(k) so that Framingham could respond and the Court could then schedule a case management conference,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ord. at Doc. No. 63, which deadline the Court later extended at the request of the Debtors,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Ord. at Doc. No. 78. The Debtors also filed an\n   <em>\n    Emergency Motion for Sanctions and Other Relief (Rule 9011)\n   </em>\n   [Doc. No. 61] (the \"Rule 9011 Motion\"), which the Court denied because of procedural defects, but reserved for future determination whether sanctions by the Court against Framingham might be appropriate after evidence was developed in connection with the 362(k) Town Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ord at Doc. No. 68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Before filing a supplement to the Preliminary 362(k) Town Motion, however, the Debtors filed numerous motions for discovery and clarification related to both the Preliminary 362(k) Town Motion and the order denying the Rule 9011 Motion. At one point, over the span of three business days, the Debtors filed ten motions, including multiple clarification requests of the Court's Order at Docket No. 68, almost all filed as requests for emergency determination that did not include allegations regarding the nature of the emergency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mots. at Doc. Nos. 71-77, 80-82; MLBR 9013-1(g). The Court admonished the Debtors for submitting duplicative requests for the same relief without clearly identified changed circumstances in the context of discovery related motions,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Ord. at Doc. No. 95, cautioning that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   While latitude has been given to the Debtors because they are\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   in order to permit them to come to an understanding regarding the requirements of notice pleading and appropriate timing for the potential to conduct discovery with respect to material facts that may be in dispute, the Court has previously explained that a discovery conference will be conducted when facts in dispute have been identified after the Debtors supplement their 362(k) Motion and a response has been filed by the Town. The Court will then hear the parties on the appropriate scope and timing of a discovery plan. The repeated requests for discovery at this juncture are premature because the deadline for the Debtors to supplement their 362(k) Motion is September 22, 2017 and the Town's response deadline regarding the supplement is October 6, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Ord. at Doc. No. 95, 1. The Debtors continued to resist the Court's procedural orders and admonitions at conferences and hearings that they must assert any further claims in a supplement to the Preliminary 362(k) Town Motion prior to commencing discovery on those claims so that the scope of discovery could be established and an appropriate case management order could enter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Ord. at Doc. No. 133\n   (denying Debtors' fifth motion for discovery).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Debtors also filed requests for summary judgment prior to filing their supplement to the Preliminary 362(k) Town Motion.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   Ord. at Doc. No. 147, 1-2 (noting that the summary judgment motion [Doc. No. 146] contained \"general allegations appearing to suggest to the Debtors that [Framingham] has engaged in a pattern of harassment perhaps 'targeting people that were found not guilty of... false charges' brought by the Town's police department [and] alleg[ing] instances of purported interference with mail and water meter equipment, police interactions with Mr. Rogers, and altercations with neighbors in a numbered list attached as an exhibit to the [motion].\"). The Debtors were reminded that, while they may \"believe the alleged violation of the automatic stay in relation to the Framingham District Court action is part of a broader pattern of harassment, [it also appeared] that the other alleged activities noted by the Debtors may relate to a pattern of general harassment as opposed to collection of a prepetition debt[,]\" and that \"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (k) affords relief in the form of damages for specific acts in violation of the automatic stay, not more generalized harassment or civil rights claims with respect to which this Court likely does not have jurisdiction and which should more appropriately be brought in a different forum.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    at 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Framingham dismissed the State Court Action and filed an affidavit at Docket No. 116 advising the Court. The service made upon the Debtors by e-mail regarding that affidavit apparently precipitated a series of e-mails from Mr. Rogers that resulted in the filing of Framingham's\n   <em>\n    Motion for Sanctions for Threat by Debtor\n   </em>\n   [Doc. No. 117] and the two supplements thereto [Doc. Nos. 122 and 123] (collectively, the \"E-mail Sanctions Motion\"), pursuant to which counsel to Framingham indicated he felt threatened by a statement in one of the emails from Mr. Rogers stating \"I'm coming to get you.\" The Court issued an order to show cause directed to Mr. Rogers [Doc. No. 119] (the \"Show Cause Order\") on September 22, 2017, whereby the Court ordered Mr. Rogers to show cause why this Court should not sanction him for his litigation conduct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtors sought\n   to strike the E-mail Sanctions Motion and asked the Court to \"reconsider and withdraw\" its Show Cause Order pursuant to an\n   <em>\n    Emergency Motion for Reconsideration\n   </em>\n   [Doc. No. 165], which was denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ord. at Doc. No. 185. Mr. Rogers failed to file a response as required by the Show Cause Order, but filed a\n   <em>\n    Motion for Sanctions (Rule 9011, Rule 11)\n   </em>\n   [Doc.

No. 219, 1, the Court issued an order providing that \"[t]o the extent Mr. Rogers sends or otherwise communicates to Attorney Mello any words or other gestures that the Court determines could be interpreted as a physical or other inappropriate threat, sanctions shall issue, including monetary sanctions per communication, or the Court may enter further orders providing other appropriate remedies, such as denial of the pending 362(k) [Town Motion].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    at 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   When the Show Cause Order issued, the Debtor, initially jointly with Mrs. Rogers, filed a number of requests that this Court recuse itself from hearing this matter.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Mots. at Doc.

No. 124, 2. The Debtors implied that the Court and Framingham should be involved in a \"negotiation\" with them and that the Debtors would \"harm\" the Court and Framingham by using \"leverage\" purportedly about \"the\n   process\" that the Debtors viewed as a \"bargaining chip with a short fuse.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    at 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On October 16, 2017, the Debtors filed a\n   <em>\n    Motion for Contempt for Violation of Stay\n   </em>\n   [Doc.

The Debtors also filed additional discovery motions related to their 362(k) Town Motion. In those motions, the Debtors alleged that Framingham (later with the purported assistance of the Court) was taking actions to harass and endanger the Debtors. The Court issued an order noting that the Debtors' allegations appeared \"to relate to potentially ongoing unlawful acts that should be reported by the Debtors to the postal inspector or other appropriate law enforcement agency.\" Ord. at Doc. No. 186, 1. The Court also reminded the Debtors that the Court \"is a Court of limited jurisdiction and criminal complaints cannot properly be pursued in this forum[,]\" and \"[f]or this same reason, the Debtors' references to 'warrants' that they hypothesize may have been issued by this Court are nonsensical.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (denying\n   <em>\n    Emergency Motion for (Immediate) Discovery\n   </em>\n   [Doc.

At that hearing, the parties addressed the parameters of proportional discovery in this matter for consideration by the Court, including document production and the scope of depositions to be taken and agreed to the bifurcation of the 362(k) Town Motion into liability and damages phases. The Court subsequently issued a\n   <em>\n    Scheduling Order Regarding Contested Matter\n   </em>\n   [Doc.

In that motion, Mr. Rogers asserted that he feared Framingham and its police department because of alleged harassment and retaliation and stated that he refused to attend any further Court proceedings in this matter, asking that \"the Court end this process entirely\" because of a perceived reluctance on the part of the Court to end harassment against the Debtors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Emergency Mot. for Relief at Doc. No. 315, 2. Mr. Rogers did not appear at the March 26, 2018 Conferences in person or by telephone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ord. at Doc. No. 317. At the March 26, 2018 Conferences, the Court rescheduled the deposition of Mr. Rogers for April 3, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. in the Courthouse (the \"Second Deposition\") by order at Docket No. 317.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Subsequently, Framingham filed a\n   <em>\n    Motion to Default Debtor and Dismiss Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(f) and 41(b) For Failing to Appear at Final Pre-Trial Conference and Other Violations\n   </em>\n   [Doc. No. 320] (the \"Second Rule 37 Motion\") on March 27, 2018, as supplemented by Joinder of Counsel [Doc. No. 322] and a Supplement [Doc. No. 326]. Through the Second Rule 37 Motion, Framingham and Counsel sought to dismiss both the Amended 362(k) Counsel Motion and 362(k) Town Motion for the Debtor's failure to appear at the March 26, 2018 Conferences. Per the scheduling order entered at Docket No. 321, the Court scheduled the Second Rule 37 Motion for hearing on March 30, 2018 as it related to the Amended 362(k) Counsel Request. The Court also scheduled the remainder of the relief regarding the 362(k) Town Motion requested by the Second Rule 37 Motion for a status conference on that date as well. Mr. Rogers was given opportunity to object to the Second Rule 37 Motion before and at the hearing, but he did not appear.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   When Mr. Rogers failed to appear\n   at the scheduled evidentiary hearing on the Amended 362(k) Counsel Request, the Court denied the Amended 362(k) Counsel Request,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Order at Docket No. 342, as such the Court did not need to reach the relief requested pursuant to the Second Rule 37 Motion. The Court reserved ruling on the Second Rule 37 Motion as it related to the 362(k) Town Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ord. at Doc. No. 343.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   After Mr. Rogers did not appear for his rescheduled Second Deposition on April 3, 2018, Framingham filed its Dismissal Motion, which incorporates and expands on the dismissal request pursuant to the Second Rule 37 Motion as it relates to the 362(k) Town Motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pursuant to its Dismissal Motion, Framingham seeks denial of the 362(k) Town Motion because of the Debtor's failure to comply with the Court's Sanctions Order. The Debtor failed to appear for his rescheduled deposition and failed to pay the monetary sanction of $1,315.00 to Counsel for reimbursement of assessed costs and fees related to the First Deposition. Framingham argues that its requested relief is further supported by the Debtor's failure to attend, without leave to do so in contravention of various Court orders, (i) the discovery conference and First Deposition scheduled for February 26, 2018; (ii) the March 26, 2018 case management conference regarding the 362(k) Town Motion and Final Pretrial Conference regarding the Amended 362(k) Counsel Request; (iii) the March 30, 2018 evidentiary hearing; and (iv) the Second Deposition. Additionally, Framingham asserts that the Debtor did not produce any discovery in this matter. The Court established a response deadline of April 13, 2018 to the Dismissal Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ord. at Doc. No. 355.

In subsequent motions, the Debtors again raised their unsubstantiated suspicions regarding\n    <em>\n     ex parte\n    </em>\n    communications. When Mr. Rogers was presented with an opportunity during a hearing on September 13, 2017 (the \"Sept. 13 Hearing\"), to identify a factual basis supporting the Debtors' assertions regarding purported\n    <em>\n     ex parte\n    </em>\n    communications by Framingham with the Court, Mr. Rogers declined to do so.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tr.

At the Sept. 13 Hearing in response to a question by the Court asking the Debtors if they had any factual basis for their assertions that there are\n    <em>\n     ex parte\n    </em>\n    communications in this matter, despite the Court's explanation in orders, including the Order entered at Docket No. 105, that such communications are only appropriate in very limited circumstances and that there had been none in this matter, Mr. Rogers responded: \"I don't have to state them. I've already stated evidence that-... I've already stated the evidence and I'm not going into a discussion with you about them.

The Supreme Court has held:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n    [W]hether a court has power to dismiss a complaint because of noncompliance with a production order depends exclusively upon Rule 37, which addresses itself with particularity to the consequences of a failure to make discovery by listing a variety of remedies which a court may employ as well as by authorizing any order which is \"just.\" There is no need to resort to Rule 41(b), which appears in that part of the Rules concerned with\n    <em>\n     trials\n    </em>\n    and which lacks such specific references to discovery.... Reliance upon Rule 41, which cannot easily be interpreted to afford a court more expansive powers than does Rule 37, or upon \"inherent power,\" can only obscure analysis of the problem before us.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    <em>\n     Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Internationale Pour Participations Industrielles Et Commerciales,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6161783\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/357/197/#p207\">\n     357 U.S. at 207\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6161783\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/357/197/#p207\">\n     78 S.Ct. 1087\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (citation omitted). Given the noncompliance of discovery orders and failure to appear discovery and case management conferences are covered by sanctions available under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 16(f) and 37(b), the Court denies the 362(k) Town Motion on that basis, but would also find, if it needed to reach the issue, that dismissal under 41(b) would be appropriate as well.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
