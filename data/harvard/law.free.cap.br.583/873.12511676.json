On her 2016 federal tax return, Ms. Parrish indicated that she owed an ISRP of $664.00, arising from her failure to obtain health insurance as required by the ACA. Based on the 2016 tax return, the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") assessed Ms. Parrish in the amount of $664.00, and filed a proof of claim in that amount. Claim No. 1-1. The claim indicates that it is for a tax or penalty owed to the government entitled to priority under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20507\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(8).

In\n   <em>\n    Sebelius\n   </em>\n   , the Court described the ISRP as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Beginning in 2014, those who do not comply with the mandate must make a \"[s]hared responsibility payment\" to the Federal Government. \u00a7 5000A(b)(1). That payment, which the Act describes as a \"penalty,\" is calculated as a percentage of household income, subject to a floor based on a specified dollar amount and a ceiling based on the average annual premium the individual would have to pay for qualifying private health insurance. \u00a7 5000A(c).

The Act, however, bars the IRS from using several of its normal enforcement tools, such as criminal prosecutions and levies. \u00a7 5000A(g)(2).

The Court reached two different conclusions. First, the Court determined that the ISRP is a penalty for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/\">\n    567 U.S. at 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and second, that the ISRP could reasonably be characterized as a tax for purposes of constitutionality.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/\">\n    567 U.S. at 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In short, the Court implicitly acknowledged that the same exaction can be construed as a tax for some purposes and a penalty for others. What the Court did not do, however, is construe the ISRP as either a tax or a penalty for purposes of the Bankruptcy Code. Thus, this court must consider whether the determination that the ISRP is a tax for constitutional purposes is necessarily a determination that it is a tax for bankruptcy purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In its consideration of the ISRP, the Court was first required to determine whether it had the authority to review the exaction under the Anti-Injunction Act. That Act would prohibit the review of any\n   <em>\n    tax\n   </em>\n   , but not the review of a\n   <em>\n    penalty.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sebelius\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/\">\n    567 U.S. at 543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The Anti-Injunction Act applies to suits 'for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any\n   <em>\n    tax.\n   </em>\n   ' [ 26 U.S.C.] \u00a7 7421(a) (emphasis added). Congress, however, chose to describe the '[s]hared responsibility payment' imposed on those who forgo health insurance not as a 'tax,' but as a 'penalty.' \u00a7\u00a7 5000A(b), (g)(2). There is no immediate reason to think that a statute applying to 'any tax' would apply to a 'penalty.' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Court concluded that for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act, the ISRP is a penalty, giving weight to the Congressional decision to label the ISRP as a penalty and not a tax:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Congress's decision to label this exaction a \"penalty\" rather than a \"tax\" is significant because the Affordable Care Act describes many other exactions it creates as \"taxes.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomas More [Law Center v.

Specifically, the IRS asserts that an \"income tax\" is calculated based on income, which the ISRP can be, and an excise tax is \"any tax imposed on a particular act, event, (non)occurrence, or exercise of a right or privilege.\" United States of America's Response to Debtor's Objection to IRS Claim, Dkt. 27 at 7 (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Rizzo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3824586,3898679\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/741/703/\">\n    741 F.3d 703\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 706 (6th Cir. 2014) ). \"Because the law at times imposes a fixed amount as the shared responsibility payment on individuals who elect not to purchase health insurance coverage, it also functions as an excise tax.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Of course, if simple reference to definitions resolved the issue, the complex case history would not exist. Thus, the court returns to the\n   <em>\n    CF &amp; I\n   </em>\n   characterizations of funding the government or penalizing an act or omission. Further, many exactions have characteristics of both a tax and a penalty, and the court must use some test to determine whether an exaction is\n   <em>\n    more like\n   </em>\n   a tax or more like a penalty. For that reason, the \"primary purpose\" of the exaction is informative if not determinative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As summarized above, the\n   <em>\n    Sebelius\n   </em>\n   Court identified several factors that make the ISRP \"look like\" a tax: (1) the ISRP is paid into the Treasury when taxpayers file their tax returns; (2) it does not apply to individuals who do not pay federal income taxes because their income is below the filing threshold; (3) the amount is determined by taxable income, number of dependents, and filing status; (4) the requirement to pay is in the Internal Revenue Code, is enforced by the IRS, and collected in the same manner as taxes; and (5) it produces some revenue for the government. However, even in\n   <em>\n    Sebelius\n   </em>\n   items one and four did not\n   <em>\n    mandate\n   </em>\n   a finding that the ISRP is a tax, as the Court cited guidance for how the assessment is to be collected as support for its finding that the ISRP is not a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   ... \"Assessment\" and \"Collection\" are chapters of the Internal Revenue Code providing the Secretary authority to assess and collect taxes, and generally specifying the means by which he shall do so.

Section 5000A(g)(1)'s command that the penalty be \"assessed and collected in the same manner\" as taxes is best read as referring to those chapters and giving the Secretary the same authority and guidance with respect to the penalty. That interpretation is consistent with the remainder of \u00a7 5000A(g), which instructs the Secretary on the tools he may use to collect the penalty.

Finally, the ISRP has a revenue-generating component only if the goal of the ACA-health care coverage for all-fails, such that the revenue impact (while possibly significant) is incidental. Taken together with the primary purpose of the ISRP, to encourage people to buy insurance by penalizing those who do not, the court determines that the ISRP is a penalty for purposes of \u00a7 507(a) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the debtor's objection to the claim filed by the IRS is ALLOWED.

And, in its analysis under the Anti-Injunction Act, the Court found that the ACA \"does not require that the penalty for failing to comply with the individual mandate be treated as a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act.\"\n    <em>\n     Sebelius\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/\">\n     567 U.S at 546\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/\">\n     132 S.Ct. 2566\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    That provision reads,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n    (G) Under sections 2704 and 2705 of the Public Health Service Act (as added by section 1201 of this Act), if there were no requirement, many individuals would wait to purchase health insurance until they needed care. By significantly increasing health insurance coverage, the requirement, together with the other provisions of this Act, will minimize this adverse selection and broaden the health insurance risk pool to include healthy individuals, which will lower health insurance premiums. The requirement is essential to creating effective health insurance markets in which improved health insurance products that are guaranteed issue and do not exclude coverage of pre-existing conditions can be sold.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
