BERNSTEIN, United States Bankruptcy Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   As great oaks from little acorns grow so too did the Defendants' accounts with Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (\"BLMIS\")-or so it seemed. During a twenty-five year period, the Defendants deposited roughly $5.4 million in their BLMIS accounts, withdrew nearly $154 million (the \"Transfers\"), and in 2009, filed net equity customer claims of approximately $839 million for the balance supposedly undrawn. Plaintiff Irving H. Picard, as trustee (the \"Trustee\") for the liquidation of BLMIS under the Securities Investor Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78aaa\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . (\"SIPA\") sued the Defendants to avoid and recover the value of the Transfers and disallow and equitably subordinate their net equity customer claims. (\n   <em>\n    See Second Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   , dated Sept. 29, 2017 (\"SAC\") (ECF Doc. # 143).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Defendants have moved to dismiss the SAC pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, made applicable to this adversary proceeding by Rule 7012(b) of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. For the reasons that follow, the motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Bernard Madoff, operating BLMIS first as a sole proprietorship and then as a limited liability company, ran a Ponzi scheme by which he induced investors to entrust their money with BLMIS for investment in the financial markets with the promise or expectation of significant returns regardless of the direction the markets took. (\u00b6 25.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, while the Ponzi scheme operated, Madoff did not invest any funds entrusted with him, and instead, used customer deposits to pay redemption requests made by other BLMIS investors. (\u00b6\u00b6 29, 32.) He was arrested in December 2008, (\u00b6 15), pled guilty in March 2009 and was sentenced to 150 years in prison. (\u00b6 25.) Other employees of BLMIS were also arrested and either pled guilty or were convicted after trial relating to their criminal activities perpetrated through BLMIS. (\u00b6\u00b6 26, 27, 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Magnify and Yair Green\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The origin of the Trustee's claims in this case begins with the Defendant Magnify Inc. (\"Magnify\"). Magnify, a Panamanian corporation, opened Account No. 1FN024 (the \"Magnify I Account\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   with BLMIS in 1983, depositing $3,136,150. (\u00b6 2; SAC, Ex. B, at 1 of 51.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Magnify was formed by Kurt Brunner, a Swiss attorney, who until April 2016, was listed as Magnify's Chairman and Managing Director, but Brunner did not exercise any actual control or decision-making authority over Magnify. (\u00b6\u00b6 39, 49-51.) Instead, Magnify's creator, Albert Igoin, a French banker who was one of Madoff's oldest and largest customers\n   as well as a social acquaintance, controlled Magnify, at least until December 1989. (\u00b6\u00b6 2, 48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Between the time of its creation and March 1989, the withdrawals from the Magnify I Account were not particularly significant compared to what came later. During these first six years, approximately $320,000 was withdrawn, leaving $2,816,661 of the original deposit still in the account. (SAC, Ex. B, at 5 of 51.) In the late 1980s, Igoin asked the Defendant Yair Green, an Israeli lawyer, to create and register an Israeli association to handle Igoin's planned charitable contributions in Israel. (\u00b6 53.) Green filed registration papers with the Israeli Registrar of Associations for the Defendant Yeshaya Horowitz Association (\"YHA\") on or around May 4, 1988. (\u00b6 53.) On March 17, 1989, Green opened Account No. 1FN037 (the \"YHA Account\") for YHA at BLMIS which was funded by an inter-account transfer\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   of $3 million from the Magnify I Account. (\u00b6 53.) As noted, the account contained only $2,816,661, and the balance of the transfer consisted of fictitious profits. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC, Ex. B, at 5 of 51.) As a result of the transfer, no actual cash remained in the Magnify I Account, and despite the significant withdrawals described below, no additional funds were ever deposited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   According to the SAC, Green assumed control of Magnify and YHA following a December 14, 1989 meeting with Igoin and Brunner. At the meeting, Igoin introduced Green to Brunner as \"the person that then would deal with the fate of Magnify.\" (\u00b6 56.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   At Igoin's direction, Brunner prepared board minutes and an \"Assignment of Transfer,\" transferring ownership of Magnify to YHA by delivering Magnify's bearer shares to Green. (\u00b6 56.) After that meeting, Brunner had no further contact with Igoin on any matter, and dealt only with Green concerning Magnify. (\u00b6\u00b6 56, 115, 121.) Green authored all corporate resolutions for Magnify, and Magnify's other nominal officers and directors prior to BLMIS's collapse had no function other than to sign corporate documentation when necessary, and they had no involvement with the Magnify Accounts (defined below). (\u00b6 121.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In addition to incorporating YHA, Green served as its \"legal representative\" or legal counsel from its inception. (\u00b6 55.) Green also held himself out as a co-founder of YHA, who \"guided the organization's activities and ... contributed significant sums for scientific and medical research\n   throughout Israel.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\u00b6 55.) Organizations would request funding from Green, and after YHA's board (Green was not a member) approved a request, Green negotiated and drafted the funding agreements over which he exercised total control. (\u00b6 142.) Green also signed many of the grant agreements, not in his capacity as YHA's attorney, but as the \"trustee\" for an anonymous donor, who had discretion over the terms and amount of the grant on the donor's behalf. (\u00b6 143.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Between the time of YHA's formation and the collapse of BLMIS, Magnify transferred over $120 million in fictitious profits to YHA\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   which YHA used to fund the beneficiaries of YHA's generosity including prominent hospitals, universities, and research institutions in Israel. (\u00b6\u00b6 5, 8.) For example, YHA gave Bar Ilan University and Ben Gurion University grants totaling more than $28 million. (\u00b6 8.) Green personally benefitted from YHA's largesse. In return, he received honorary doctorates from both institutions, and was appointed to Ben Gurion University's investment and management committees. (\u00b6 8.) In addition, Hebrew University, which employed two YHA board members, received $36 million from YHA. (\u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Green created several other entities that either held BLMIS accounts or benefitted from them. Over the years, he formed Defendants Premero Investments Ltd. (\"Premero\") and Strand International Investments Ltd. (\"Strand\"), and ultimately opened two BLMIS accounts for Premero (the \"Premero I Account\" and the \"Premero II Account,\" and together, the \"Premero Accounts\") and one for Strand (the \"Strand Account\"). (\u00b6 63.) Although Brunner was at all relevant times Strand's \"Sole Director,\" Green managed the Strand Account and dealt directly with BLMIS on all account activity. (\u00b6 117.) Green also opened bank accounts for Strand in Switzerland and Israel through which he diverted fictitious profits from BLMIS for his personal use. (\u00b6 117.) And in 1992, Green directed Brunner to create Defendant Express Enterprises Inc. (\"Express\"), and Express received $1 million directly from BLMIS in the form of redemptions from the Strand and Magnify Accounts. (\u00b6 64.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   One additional account was created. In September 1990, a second Magnify account (the \"Magnify II Account,\" and together with the Magnify I Account, the \"Magnify Accounts\") was created without any initial deposit or account opening documents such as a Customer Agreement, Options Agreement and a Trading Authorization Limited to Purchases and Sales of Securities and Options that other BLMIS customers typically executed. (\u00b6 80 &amp; n. 5.) Instead, BLMIS \"funded\" the Magnify II Account with a backdated trade of approximately $120 million, evidenced by fake trade confirmations. (\u00b6\u00b6 82-87.) The September 1990 monthly statement, which started with a zero balance, was funded with a sale of roughly $120 million of MCI stock in\n   <em>\n    May.\n   </em>\n   The monthly statement listed a host of other\n   <em>\n    May\n   </em>\n   purchases and two purchases of MCI stock in\n   <em>\n    October\n   </em>\n   . The trade confirmations indicate that Magnify purchased the stock (which it supposedly sold to fund the account) in October\n   <em>\n    1986\n   </em>\n   ,\n   or four years before the Magnify II Account was opened, and listed an address for BLMIS that it did not move to until 1987. (\u00b6 85.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Green Obtains Personal Benefits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As noted, Green garnered accolades and honoraria as a result of YHA's philanthropy. But he also benefitted in more concrete ways. After Igoin's death in January 1995, Green drafted an agreement (the \"Fee Agreement\") between himself and Magnify appointing himself the manager and supervisor of Magnify's investment portfolio, which consisted solely of the Magnify Accounts, in exchange for a percentage of Magnify's purported profits. At Green's request, Brunner signed the Fee Agreement on Magnify's behalf. (\u00b6 69.) Although the Fee Agreement was dated July 26, 1996, Green represented in the Fee Agreement that he undertook his duties \"as of January 1995,\" making the fees retroactive to that date. (\u00b6 69.) Green admitted to receiving a BLMIS transfer of $3.15 million in 2002 pursuant to the Fee Agreement. (\u00b6 71.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Green also withdrew approximately $15 million from the Magnify and Strand Accounts, and redirected the withdrawals to entities and individuals that benefitted himself, his family, and others having no relationship to YHA. These included nearly $1.5 million transferred from the Strand Account to his children, other individuals affiliated with Green in Israel, and an investment fund in the Cayman Islands. (\u00b6\u00b6 72, 119.) Green transferred almost all of the remainder of the $15 million to bank accounts in Magnify's and Strand's names in Israel and Switzerland, and Green made personal use of these funds, including the transfer of approximately $3 million to offshore investment funds, and hundreds of thousands of dollars to Green's children, his secretary (who was also the co-founder of Green's charitable foundation) and other affiliates. (\u00b6\u00b6 73, 119.) In addition, Green used Magnify's account at Bank Hapoalim as collateral for a personal debt, (\u00b6\u00b6 61, 120), and represented to HSBC that he was Strand's beneficial owner in order to obtain a mortgage to buy his daughter a home in Maryland. (\u00b6\u00b6 63, 120.) He also used a withdrawal from the Strand Account to buy an apartment in Israel for one of his business associates. (\u00b6 120.) Finally, between February of 1996 and May of 2000, Green periodically wrote to BLMIS requesting withdrawals totaling at least $1,070,000 from the Magnify Accounts to finance Magnify's \"ongoing activities,\" but Magnify, a shell investment vehicle with minimal operating expenses, did not need such funds to finance any ongoing activities. (\u00b6 74.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Accounts Reporting\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   BLMIS generated monthly customer account statements for the Magnify I Account when it was first opened, and generated a monthly statement for the Magnify II Account, at least for September 1990. Green also knew that other BLMIS customers, including YHA, received monthly customer statements detailing supposed trading information for that month. (\u00b6\u00b6 76, 106.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   By the early-1990s, BLMIS dispensed with monthly customer account statements for the Defendants' Accounts (other than YHA)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   , and instead, began providing Green with \"Portfolio Evaluations.\" (\u00b6\u00b6 90, 133, 136.) Unlike the monthly customer\n   statements, the Portfolio Evaluations were produced two times each year, dated \"as of\" June 30 or December 31 of each year. (\u00b6 92.) They contained no historical information or any transaction details for any security allegedly bought or sold during the relevant six-month period, such as trade dates, settlement dates or trade prices. (\u00b6 90.) During most of the 1990s, the Portfolio Evaluations itemized a list of various stocks similar to those supposedly traded in other customer accounts, but after 1999, the Portfolio Evaluations listed only holdings of U.S. Treasury Bills or Fidelity money market mutual funds and no stocks or other equities. (\u00b6 99.) BLMIS never provided the missing details or purported trading activity to Magnify, Premero or Strand, and the gains could not be explained by holding Treasury bills to maturity or investing in Fidelity mutual funds. (\u00b6\u00b6 100-01.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Portfolio Evaluations were also a collaborative work. By 1993, if not earlier, Green began meeting with Madoff personally two to three times each year to discuss Magnify's (and later Premero's and Strand's) Accounts and prepare and revise the draft Portfolio Evaluations that had been prepared prior to the meetings. (\u00b6\u00b6 92, 95, 116;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 133.) Upon Green's arrival, he would meet with Madoff and Frank DiPascali behind closed doors to agree on the rate of return, and DiPascali would emerge with revised Portfolio Evaluations which, the SAC alleges upon information and belief, were directed by Green. (\u00b6\u00b6 97, 98.) After the meeting, Madoff often directed Green to Madoff's secretary to dictate letters requesting withdrawals or transfers from the Magnify, Strand, and Premero Accounts. (\u00b6 98.) At Green's request, Madoff's secretary prepared letters of instruction to BLMIS and printed these documents on Green's law firm's own letterhead. (\u00b6 98.) The SAC alleges, on information and belief, that on at least one occasion, Green and Madoff agreed to backdate a letter typed by Madoff's secretary so that the letter would appear to pre-date their meeting. (\u00b6 98.) Madoff's secretary was then instructed to delete and leave no electronic record of these letters after they were generated. (\u00b6 98.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Portfolio Evaluations were the only records of the activity in and the value of these accounts after 1992, and although the Fee Agreement required Green to set investment policies and ensure their implementation, manage and safeguard Magnify's portfolio, and supervise the movement of funds, Green never examined-nor had the \"opportunity\" to examine-individual trades in the non-YHA Accounts. (\u00b6\u00b6 101-02.) Once the Portfolio Evaluations became the sole account records provided for the Magnify Accounts, Green never requested-and BLMIS did not provide-confirmation of any of the transfers or any other cash activity in these accounts. (\u00b6 103.) Finally, although BLMIS purported to make deductions for the payment of foreign withholding taxes on certain dividends for other customers, BLMIS eventually stopped reporting any dividend or withholding tax transactions to Green, stopped purporting to make payments to the IRS on Magnify's behalf for foreign withholding tax, and gave Green no records to assess Magnify's potential tax liability. (\u00b6 104.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Initial Transfers from BLMIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The following table summarizes the Transfers that form the basis of the Trustee's claims:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-32\"><strong>Account</strong> <strong>Account</strong> <strong>90 day</strong> <strong>Two Year</strong> <strong>Six Year</strong> <strong>Total</strong> <strong>No.</strong> <strong>Transfers</strong> <strong>Transfers</strong> <strong>Transfers</strong> <strong>Transfers</strong> 1FN024 Magnify I 0 700,000 2,450,000 7,603,549 1FN025 Magnify II 0 0 150,000 4,745,822 1FN037 YHA 1,900,000 24,000,000 77,580,000 126,489,846 1FN073 Premero I 0 2,500,000<sup>10</sup> 2,500,000 2,731,065 1FN097 Premero II 0 0 0 421,770 1FR051 Strand 0 2,600,000 4,800,000 11,730,019 <strong>1,900,000</strong> <strong>29,800,000</strong> <strong>87,480,000</strong> <strong>153,722,071</strong></pre>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [\n   <strong>\n    Editor's Note:\n   </strong>\n   The preceding image contains the reference for footnote\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (SAC, Ex. A.) In addition, in or around 1992, Express received $1 million directly from BLMIS as redemptions from the Strand and Magnify Accounts. (\u00b6\u00b6 64, 153(b), (c).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Against the $153,722,071 withdrawn, cash deposits totaled just $5,436,098. In addition to the initial, 1983 deposit that funded the Magnify I Account, $1,799,948 was deposited into the Premero Accounts between April 1995 and June 1998, (SAC, Ex. B, at 49-50 of 51), and $500,000 was deposited into the Strand Account on January 28, 2002. (SAC, Ex. B, at 51 of 51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The Defendants' Net Equity Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Green filed customer net equity claims with the Trustee on behalf of the Magnify I and II Accounts, the Premero I and II Accounts and the Strand Account, and Ayala Nahir, YHA's Treasurer (as well as Chairperson and Director of Magnify) filed a customer claim with the Trustee on behalf of YHA. The following table summarizes the claims:\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Each customer claim was denied by the Trustee, and each defendant objected to the Trustee's determination. (\u00b6\u00b6 165-68; SAC, Ex. C.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    F. The Trustee's Claims for Relief and the Motion to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The SAC asserts claims to avoid and recover the Transfers to Magnify, YHA, Premero, Strand and Express as actual fraudulent and constructive fraudulent transfers under the Bankruptcy Code and New York Debtor and Creditor Law and to disallow the customer claims pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) (Counts One through Seven). The Trustee also seeks to hold Green liable as the alter ego of Magnify and Strand for their debts. In addition to the fraudulent transfer claims, the SAC seeks to avoid and recover a preference from YHA (Count Eight) and to equitably subordinate the customer claims (Count Nine).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Defendants have moved to dismiss the SAC for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. They mainly argue that the SAC fails to adequately allege that they had actual knowledge that BLMIS was not engaged in trading securities or that they received the Transfers in bad faith. (\n   <em>\n    Defendants' Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   , dated Oct. 30, 2017 (\"\n   <em>\n    Defendants Memo\n   </em>\n   \"), at 11-43 (ECF Doc. # 152).) In addition, Premero argues that the intentional fraudulent transfer claim in Count One directed at the Premero I Account must be dismissed because the claim seeks to recover transfers of principal rather than fictitious profits. Because the SAC does not allege Premero's lack of good faith, it has a complete defense under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20548\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43-51.) Next, Green contends that the SAC fails to adequately plead alter ego liability for the transfers to Magnify and Strand. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51-65.) The Defendants also argue that the SAC fails to allege facts showing a partnership between Green and Igoin, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 66-68), an argument aimed at a statement in a single sentence in paragraph 2 of the SAC that is irrelevant to the claims asserted by the Trustee and will not be considered further. In addition, the Defendants maintain that claims based on transfers made prior to January 1, 2001, the date BLMIS converted from Madoff's sole proprietorship to a limited liability company, should be dismissed, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 68-69), but the parties have agreed to stay the litigation of this issue pending the Court's decision relating to the balance of the motion. (\n   <em>\n    See Stipulation and Order Modifying Scheduling Order\n   </em>\n   , dated Dec. 13, 2017, at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 5 (ECF Doc. # 155).) Finally, the Defendants argue that the SAC fails to\n   allege a legally sufficient equitable subordination claim.

He controlled the Magnify Accounts after December 1989 when Igoin introduced him to Brunner, he arranged the transfers from the Magnify Accounts to the YHA Account, and managed the $120 million in charitable contributions made by YHA. He also formed Premero, Strand and Express, for no apparent purpose except to provide cash when he needed it, and served as Express' \"Managing Director and/or authorized representative.\" (\u00b6\u00b6 43, 138 (quotation marks in original).) Finally, he alone met with Madoff and DiPascali regarding the accounts and participated in the revision of the Portfolio Evaluations to insure that they hit their mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In addition, the facts alleged in the SAC plausibly suggest that Green knew, at least by late 1989 or 1990, that the money in the Accounts could not have resulted from trading securities. After December 1989, Green managed the Magnify I Account, the only Account at the time. Although no additional cash deposits were made into the Magnify I Account, Green transferred tens of millions of dollars out of the account beginning in January 1990, including $47,650,000 to the YHA Account (No. 1FN037). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC, Ex. B, at 6-8 of 51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In fact, the sheer growth of the Magnify Accounts and the other accounts was mind-boggling. Over a twenty-five year period, the Defendants' Accounts grew from $5.4 million in deposits to nearly $1 billion based on the amounts withdrawn and the amounts supposedly still in the accounts according to the customer claims. This translates to a return of about 23%, compounded annually, for each of the twenty-five years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   If Green wondered where all the money was coming from, the circumstances surrounding the opening of the Magnify II Account (originally Account no. 1-05123-3) in September 1990 answered that question. Starting with a zero balance on September 1 (the statement says \"No Balance Forward\"), it grew to more than $100 million by the end of the month without a single deposit or inter-account transfer. Instead, the account was supposedly funded with a $120 million sale of MCI stock that occurred in May 1990, four months earlier. Moreover, according to the statement, the MCI securities sold in May 1990 were acquired in October, and the trade confirmations placed the acquisition in October 1986, four years before the Magnify II Account was opened. The statement also listed several other purchases that occurred in May 1990 before the account was opened. These were clearly fictitious transactions. The September 1990 statement coupled with the trade confirmations were bright red flags indicating fictitious trading activity, and it is not plausible that Green, the manager of the Magnify Accounts, missed them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Allegations relating to the Portfolio Evaluations and Green's semi-annual meetings with Madoff and DiPascali lend further support to the conclusion that Green knew that BLMIS was not engaged in the actual trading of securities. By 1992, BLMIS had dispensed with sending the usual monthly customer statements regarding the Magnify Accounts, and never sent any customer statements relating to the Premero or the Strand Accounts. Instead, BLMIS provided Green with semi-annual \"Portfolio Evaluations\" depicting the Defendants' Accounts' holdings (other than YHA) as of June 30 and December 31. Armed with draft Portfolio Evaluations, Green, Madoff and DiPascali met in private to discuss and revise the Portfolio Evaluations to reflect agreed upon returns. They would then arrange for fictitious letters of instruction on Green's letterhead requesting withdrawals and transfers from the accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The information provided by BLMIS made it impossible for Green to do his job, but he did not seem to care. Green was responsible under the Fee Agreement, effective January 1995, to set Magnify's investment policies, manage and safeguard the funds it invested, follow-up to ensure the actual implementation of those policies, examine Magnify's earnings and supervise the movement of funds in its portfolio. The Portfolio Evaluations did not reflect any trading activity or deposits or withdrawals, and Green never received monthly statements or evidence of the transactions that BLMIS was supposedly executing on behalf of Magnify. He was content with the Portfolio Evaluations he received twice a year that purported to show Magnify's positions without showing the trading that led to them. In short, it was impossible for Green to perform his duties under the Fee Agreement, for which he received over $3 million, in light of the information BLMIS was providing. A fair inference is that both he and Madoff knew that there was no trading activity to oversee, and disregarded even the semblance of any actual trading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In addition, BLMIS did not provide Green with the information necessary to prepare and pay the taxes on all of the profitable trades and dividend income that supposedly fueled the growth in the Accounts. Until 1995, BLMIS' records for the Magnify accounts reflected reductions for\n   the payment of withholding taxes on dividends, identifying the stock and the amount of taxes withheld. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC, Ex. B, at 1-7, 9 of 51.) No further deductions appear in the Accounts after 1995, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   SAC, Ex. B, 7-8, 9-10 of 51), and BLMIS never withheld taxes from the Premero or Strand Accounts. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC, Ex. B, at 49-51 of 51.) In contrast, BLMIS continued to deduct withholding taxes from the YHA Account which also continued to receive monthly customer statements until the very end, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   SAC, Ex. B, at 11-47 of 51), presumably to satisfy the reporting and oversight mandated by Israeli law. As a result, Green had no records to assess Magnify's potential tax liability. (\u00b6 104.) Once again, the plausible inference is Green didn't care about the details because he knew there were no details.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Defendants' opposition primarily focuses on the disposition of motions to dismiss in other BLMIS-related avoidance actions brought by the Trustee, and argues that this case is more like those in which the Court concluded that the Trustee had failed to allege actual knowledge than those in which the Court concluded that he did. (\n   <em>\n    See Defendants Memo\n   </em>\n   at 13-28.) Obviously, legal sufficiency must be judged on a case-by-case basis. As noted, the sheer magnitude of the withdrawals and untapped balances compared to the deposits, the creation of accounts with $120 million in overnight value generated by backdated trades and the lack of any information relating to trading activity or tax liability support the finding of actual knowledge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Furthermore, this is not a typical \"red flag\" case like others considered by the Court where the knowledge was supposedly acquired through a multi-year comparison of account statements with outside pricing and volume data or other information relating to Madoff's unusual operations, including his fee structure, insufficient support staff, strip mall accountants, self-clearing of trades and absence of real-time information.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Picard v. Legacy Capital Ltd.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    In re BLMIS\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4172903\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/548/13/\">\n    548 B.R. 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr.

S.D.N.Y. 2014). Here, Green and BLMIS dispensed with the fiction of monthly account statements or trading information which, considering Green's duties as Magnify's investment manager and Magnify's potential tax obligations, was itself a red flag.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Moreover, the SAC alleges circumstances relating to the funding of the Magnify II Account and the creation of the Portfolio Evaluations that suggest that Green and Madoff were manufacturing financial information to achieve predetermined results. Similar allegations of trading manipulation by Madoff and the defendant to reach predetermined results have led to the conclusion that the complaints in those cases adequately pled actual knowledge.\n   <em>\n    Picard v.

For this reason, the safe harbor,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20546\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e), does not apply, and the Trustee has adequately pleaded that these Defendants lacked good faith for purposes of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20548\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).

Green's Alter Ego Liability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The SAC asserts that Green is liable for the claims asserted against Magnify and Strand on a theory of alter ego liability, or piercing the corporate veil. \"The doctrine of piercing the corporate veil is typically employed by a third party seeking to go behind the corporate existence in order to circumvent the limited liability of the owners and to hold them liable for some underlying corporate obligation.\"\n   <em>\n    Morris v.

Magnify was formed in Panama and Strand was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (\"BVI\"). Green contends that his alter ego liability must be determined in accordance with the \"internal affairs\" doctrine under the laws of Panama and the BVI, respectively, and neither jurisdiction recognizes alter ego liability under the facts alleged in the SAC. The Trustee contends that New York substantive law governs the issue, and the SAC asserts a legally sufficient claim against Green.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both sides contend that New York's choice of law rules relating to alter ego liability determine which substantive law applies.

The plaintiffs argued that the laws of New York and Illinois, which had the most significant relationship to the breach of fiduciary duty claim, governed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4119862\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/998/157/#p179\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4119862\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/998/157/#p179\">\n    at 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Quoting RESTATEMENT \u00a7 309,\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   the District Court explained that the internal affairs doctrine created a presumption that the law of the state of incorporation governed, but the presumption could be rebutted by showing that another state had a more significant relationship with the parties and the dispute at issue.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4119862\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/998/157/#p179\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 179 ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Resolution Trust Corp. v.

The dispute centers on the withdrawal of more than $150 million of customer funds from BLMIS accounts located in New York. (\u00b6\u00b6 45 46.) Moreover, Green came to New York at least twice a year to meet with Madoff and DiPascali and evaluate the portfolios of the accounts other than the YHA account. Conversely, Panama and the BVI have no meaningful relationship to the fraudulent withdrawals. Their connection is limited to the fact that they are the jurisdictions where Magnify and Strand were incorporated.

Initially, there was no semblance of a corporate existence apart from Green. Although Magnify and Strand each had a registered agent in their respective jurisdictions, neither had employees, physical offices or actual places of business. (\u00b6 122.) Further, while Brunner was a titular managing or sole director of these entities, he was not involved in any decision making, and after Igoin withdrew from the business of Magnify in December 1989, Green was the only decision maker and ran the Defendants for his personal benefit. In addition, Green held himself out to HSBC as Strand's beneficial owner in order to obtain a mortgage to buy his daughter a home in Maryland, and pledged Magnify's bank account as collateral for a personal debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The capitalization of these entities was also inadequate. The only cash deposit made in either Magnify Account was $3,136,150 in 1983. A review of the Trustee's reconstruction of Magnify's deposits and withdrawals shows that Green \"transferred\" nearly $48 million in fictitious profits from the Magnify I Account to the YHA Account after the December 1989 meeting, (SAC, Ex. B, 6-8 of 51), and over $75 million in fictitious profits from the Magnify II Account to the YHA Account. (SAC, Ex. B, 9-10 of 51.) In addition, Magnify withdrew $12,349,371 in fictitious profits from the two Magnify Accounts. (SAC, Ex. B, at 8, 10 of 51.) Strand was funded with a single $500,000 cash deposit on January 28, 2002, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   SAC, Ex. B, at 51 of 51), but managed to transfer $11,730,019 in fictitious profits over the next six years. In fact, Strand withdrew $370,000 from its BLMIS account months before it was initially \"funded\" with a $5 million transfer of fictitious profits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The amount of capital invested in Magnify and Strand was plainly insufficient to sustain these withdrawals and inter-account transfers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The SAC also alleges that the funds were used for personal rather than corporate purposes; in fact, Magnify and Strand had no corporate purpose except, in the end, to fund Green's needs. After Igoin's death, Green entered into a Fee Agreement with Magnify which he had drafted, and collected $3.15 million for services he did not perform. He withdrew a total of approximately $15 million from the Magnify and Strand Accounts for his personal benefit including a $1.5 million transfer from Strand to his children, $3 million to offshore investment funds and hundreds of thousands of dollars to Green's children and his secretary and withdrew money from Strand's BLMIS Account to buy an apartment in Israel for one of his business associates. In addition, Green used the Strand Account as collateral for a mortgage to buy a home in Maryland for his daughter, and used Magnify's bank account at Bank Hapoalim as collateral for a personal debt. Finally, Green used the funds \"transferred\" from the Magnify Accounts to YHA to orchestrate YHA's $120 million in charitable contributions, enhancing his philanthropic profile in Israel and the honors that went with it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The SAC also alleges facts that satisfy the second and third elements of the alter ego test. As noted, the SAC sufficiently alleges that Green acted with actual knowledge that BLMIS was not engaged in trading securities. He nevertheless continued to withdraw the funds as part of his fraudulent scheme depleting the customer property estate by over $150 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Accordingly, the allegations in the SAC are sufficient to pierce Magnify's corporate veil (at least as of the time of the December 1989 meeting and thereafter) and Strand's corporate veil, and impose alter ego liability on Green for their fraudulent withdrawals of customer funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Count Nine\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Count Nine asserts a claim to equitably subordinate the approximate $839 million in customer claims filed by Magnify, YHA, Premero and Strand. The SAC alleges that their conduct \"enabled Madoff to prolong the Ponzi scheme that resulted in injury to the customers and creditors of the estate and ... conferred an unfair advantage on Magnify, Premero, Strand, and YHA,\" (\u00b6 233), misled the customers into investing in BLMIS based on a false impression of its financial condition, (\u00b6 234), and withdrew approximately $153,722,070 from BLMIS which would otherwise have been customer property available for distribution. (\u00b6 235.) The Defendants contend that the SAC fails \"to adequately allege 'actual knowledge,' 'bad faith,' or 'willful blindness' (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , reckless disregard) of the BLMIS Ponzi scheme,\" and the equitable\n   subordination claim must, therefore, be dismissed.
