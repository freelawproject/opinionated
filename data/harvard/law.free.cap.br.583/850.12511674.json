The bankruptcy court also concluded that Price satisfied her burden on the second element.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 27, 47-48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As discussed in more detail below, the court disagrees with bankruptcy court's conclusion on the second element.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   All three elements must be satisfied to establish undue burden.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Brightful\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476689,9498329\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/267/324/\">\n    267 F.3d at 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The bankruptcy court found that Price's \"unintended and involuntary underemployment, her marital separation and likely eventual divorce, and her obligations as the primary custodian of three (3) young children make it more likely than not that her present financial difficulties will continue-at least for some time.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476689,9498329\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/267/324/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In contrast to a relatively short discussion on the first part, the bankruptcy court spent over twenty pages discussing the second part of the second element, whether \"the duration of the debtor's financial hardship will continue 'for a significant portion of the repayment period.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23 (citation omitted);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-52.

(2) What is a 'significant portion' of that repayment period (sufficient to warrant discharge of the debtor's student loan)?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28. On the first inquiry, the parties expressed substantial disagreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-29. Price argued that the applicable repayment period is \"governed by her current loan contract, which is due to end in 2024\" (approximately seven years from the time the bankruptcy trial was held).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28. The DOE, on the other hand, contended that the applicable repayment period is \"twenty five (25) years, the longest repayment plan the Debtor may have under an available income contingent repayment program[ ].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29 (alteration to original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The parties' strenuous disagreement on this point is understandable. The length of the repayment period has serious implications for how demanding the second element is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-36\">\n   The longer the repayment period, the more difficult the Debtor's evidentiary burden. It also is possible that a debtor might establish that his or her financial difficulties will not abate for a finite period that constitutes a \"significant portion\" of the existing contractual repayment period, but that longer term prospects, within a \"significant portion\" of an available extended repayment period, are more favorable. Thus, the choice of repayment period is potentially outcome-determinative in this and other cases.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The court agrees with the bankruptcy court's observation that the Third Circuit has not yet addressed whether the repayment period referenced in\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   's second prong can be calculated on the basis of available extended-term repayment programs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 37 (\"My research has not uncovered any reported decision that has grappled squarely with the effect of an uninvoked, but available, extended repayment term in analyzing the second prong of\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   .\"). As the bankruptcy court noted, most courts that have addressed \"the consequences of [an] uninvoked extended, income-contingent loan term,\" have done so \"only in connection with the third prong of the\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   inquiry-'good faith.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The bankruptcy court, after discussing\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   's historical context and evaluating the parties' arguments, determined that the repayment period should be based on the original contract term.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44. Additionally, the bankruptcy court determined that five years constituted a \"significant portion\" of the seven years remaining on Price's original contract term.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47. The bankruptcy court then determined that it was more likely than not that\n   Price's current financial troubles would persist for five years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28, 47-50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The length of the repayment term as it relates to the second element of\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   is a difficult question. For purposes of this decision, however, the court does not need to resolve this issue. Even on the shorter time period-the one applied by the bankruptcy court-Price has not met her burden of showing that it is more likely than not that she will be unable to maintain a minimum standard of living.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The bankruptcy court hinged its favorable discharge determination with respect to the second element of\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   on three circumstances: (1) Price's employment situation,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the likelihood that Price will be unable to find full-time employment in her field in the next five years; (2) Price's childcare squeeze,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , if Price were to obtain additional hours of employment in another field, she would not significantly improve her financial situation because the additional income earned would be offset by the additional childcare expenses she would incur; and (3) Price's likely divorce,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Price may lose some of the support she receives from her estranged husband once they are divorced.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 47-52. The court will address each of these three circumstances in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The first circumstance is the most crucial one: whether or not Price will be able to find additional employment in her field in the future. On this point, the bankruptcy court did not fully analyze the likelihood of Price's ability to find employment for the next five years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 48. The bankruptcy court merely noted that the vascular sonography employment market is currently saturated and that the full-time sonographers at Main Line Health are not set to retire for eight years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48-49. These two facts are not enough to show that it is likely that Price will be unable to find full-time employment in her field in the future. On this record, the court is not persuaded that Price's current employment circumstances are likely to persist. The record is bereft of numerous facts that would be needed make that determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   For example, the record lacks any evidence of Price's chances of finding full-time employment with a different employer in the future. Price testified that there\n   are currently no open full-time positions at other employers because the market is saturated, but she did not provide any testimony regarding employment opportunities at these places in the future.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 16-22. Similarly, the record does not contain information regarding the level of saturation in the market or the likelihood that it will persist. The bankruptcy court seems to assume that because the vascular sonography employment market is currently saturated it will remain saturated for the next five years. This assumption is not supported by sufficient evidence in the record. Just because the market was saturated at the time of the trial, does not lead to the conclusion that it will be saturated over the next five years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The bankruptcy court faults the DOE for this information deficit in the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Op. at 51 (\"Finally, I point out that the DOE could have, but did not, offer any evidence to rebut the Debtor's testimony-particularly regarding the labor market restrictions in the sonography field that impair the Debtor's earning potential.\"). But the burden of persuasion is on Price. At the very least, it is her burden to persuade the court that it is more likely than not that her employment troubles are likely to persist. On this first circumstance, she has not shown a likelihood that she will be unable to find additional employment in her field for the next five years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The second circumstance is Price's childcare costs relative to additional hours she works. On this point, the bankruptcy court explained that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [e]ven if the Debtor were to obtain additional hours of employment outside the field of sonography, she barely moves the needle toward improving her financial situation. The Debtor has encountered a scenario evocatively referred to as the \"childcare squeeze.\" The \"squeeze\" occurs when parents, especially single mothers, \"find themselves 'squeezed out' of the job market entirely, unable to earn the additional income their family requires because they cannot find jobs that pay enough to offset soaring childcare expenses.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-47\">\n   The Debtor's childcare expenses are based on her half-time work schedule-meaning she will be off two and a half (2 \u00bd) days per week and, therefore, not needing childcare for those days. If the Debtor obtains supplemental employment outside her field, she is unlikely to earn a commensurate hourly rate, thus making the additional income for those extra hours a \"wash\" because it will be largely offset by the increase in childcare costs. In effect, the Debtor must remain underemployed because additional employment does not improve her net income or her ability to repay her loans-it merely takes her away from her children as her paycheck will go to the additional child care expenses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49 (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Unfortunately, the bankruptcy court's analysis on this point appears to be flawed. More specifically, the bankruptcy court does not fully consider how future circumstances may impact the childcare squeeze Price currently experiences. The extent of the bankruptcy court's analysis on this point is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-50\">\n   The immediate limitations on the Debtor's earning potential also put stress on the increase in child care expenses she certainly will see in the next two (2) years when her middle child and youngest child enter half-day kindergarten in 2017 and 2018. This shorter day in the public school will necessitate the Debtor to pay for \"before-care\" (care before the public school day begins) and extended \"after-care\" (child care for the time between the end of the \u00bd day public kindergarten program, as well as time after the regular public school day) on the days she is working. By 2019, all three of her children will be in full-time public school, so child care costs will decrease because the number of hours needed after school will fall back to the current level. At present, that cost is $500.00 per month, but in two years, it is possible the rate for after-care will increase.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50 (internal record citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   On this record, this court cannot conclude that it is likely that Price's current childcare squeeze will persist for the next five years. The bankruptcy court correctly notes that Price's childcare costs will rise until 2019 when all three of her children are in full time public school.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, in 2019, it is likely that the childcare squeeze Price was experiencing will diminish significantly. At the time of the trial, Price would have had to pay for an additional two-and-a-half days of childcare for her two youngest children if she worked full time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 33. Her two youngest children were not in school yet and\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   time that Price spends working is time that Price needs to find childcare for her two youngest children.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29-39. But in 2019, she will not have to pay for two-and-a-half days of childcare. She will only have to pay for childcare for the times on those days when her youngest children are not in full-time school.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38. Thus, if Price were to work full time in 2019, those additional employment hours would be offset by some childcare expenses, but not as many as they currently would. The bankruptcy court did not consider this in the analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Finally, the bankruptcy court concluded that \"the [d]ebtor's likely divorce in the foreseeable future also suggests that a deterioration, rather [than] an improvement in the Debtor's financial [ ] situation, is more likely.\" Op. at 50 (alterations to original). The bankruptcy court was concerned that Price's husband would cease his voluntary payments of just over $500.00 per month after he and Price are divorced.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 50-51. The court disagrees with the bankruptcy court's analysis on this point. The evidence does not show that the mere fact of divorce-which according to Price's testimony is likely no more than a formality at this point-will trigger a change in her husband's attitude toward supporting Price and their three children.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 11. Moreover, the burden is on Price to show that her difficult circumstances will persist or worsen and she has not offered sufficient evidence to show a likelihood that the voluntary payments she receives from her husband are likely to cease or significantly diminish.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Similarly, the bankruptcy court was concerned that if Price and her husband divorce, Price will lose the healthcare she currently receives from her husband.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Op. at 50-51. This concern is likely overplayed. If Price and her husband divorce, and if Price loses the healthcare she currently receives, she can get healthcare coverage through Main Line Health.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dep. at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Regarding the court-ordered payments of $1,400 per month in child support, the bankruptcy court was concerned that \"[i]f her husband obtains stable housing and sees the children more regularly, he can petition the state court for reduced support payments.\" Op. at 50 (alteration to original);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 44. But the bankruptcy court does not consider the offsetting positive effect that a change in the husband's housing would have on Price's financial situation. Specifically, if her husband obtains stable housing then her childcare costs will likely decrease. Thus, the childcare squeeze noted above would be even further reduced. Consequently, any concern that Price's child support payments may decrease is likely mitigated by the positive impact on her childcare payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Considering these facts as a whole, the court cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that Price will be unable to maintain a minimal standard of living for the next five years. There is not a likelihood that (1) she will be unable to find additional employment in her field; (2) her childcare squeeze will persist; or (3) the support she receives from her husband will cease or decrease. Instead, there are only\n   <em>\n    possibilities\n   </em>\n   that these situations could occur, and there is a very good chance, perhaps even a likelihood, that her childcare squeeze will\n   <em>\n    shrink.\n   </em>\n   These circumstances are insufficient to establish that it is more likely than not that Price's financial difficulties will persist for five years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Bankruptcy Code permits a bankruptcy court to discharge a student loan debt only if the debtor can show that repayment of the loan would cause her an undue hardship.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(8). Price recognizes that this is a \"heavy burden\" for her to satisfy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellee Kristin M. Price's Br. in Opp. to Reversing the Bankr. Ct.'s J. to Discharge her Fed.

It is Price's burden to persuade the court, by a preponderance of the evidence, of all elements of her case. The shortcomings in the record are more appropriately attributable to her failure to meet her burden than the DOE's failure to rebut.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    The court is doubtful that the bankruptcy court's use of \"more likely than not\" was correct.

This is a demanding requirement. As we indicated in\n    <em>\n     Faish\n    </em>\n    , it is not enough for Brightful to demonstrate that she is currently in financial straits; rather, she must prove \"a total incapacity ... in the future to pay [her] debts for reasons not within [her] control.\" In other words, \"dischargeability of student loans should be based upon the certainty of hopelessness, not simply a present inability to fulfill financial commitment.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476689,9498329\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/267/324/\">\n     267 F.3d 324\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 328-29 (2001) (citations omitted). It is difficult to read this passage as merely setting up a more likely than not standard. All of the language in this passage indicates that the likelihood must be high: \"this is a demanding requirement,\" \"total incapacity,\" \"certainty of hopelessness,\" etc. While the court anticipates that the Third Circuit will at some point define more precisely the level of likelihood required to satisfy the second element, the court does not need to resolve that question in this case. As explained below, Price has not met her burden, as formulated by the bankruptcy court, of showing that it is more likely than not that she will be unable to maintain a minimal standard of living for a significant portion of the repayment period.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    The court is skeptical of the bankruptcy court's findings regarding the vascular sonography employment market in the area.
