The Court concludes that there is sufficient clarity under Australian law-as described by the two experts-to reach this conclusion.

The Objecting Parties' expert does not present any reason-much less a persuasive one-why the same concerns about enforcement of a chose in action generally would not lead to exactly the same rule for a fiduciary duty claim.
