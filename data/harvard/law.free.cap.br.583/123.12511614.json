On October 13, 2017, Suneetha Nallaballi (\"Plaintiff\") started this adversary proceeding by filing a complaint requesting entry of a nondischargeable money judgment against the Debtor for an alleged debt that arose out of the Plaintiff's and the Debtor's involvement with GMGT Technologies, Inc. (\"GMGT\"). GMGT, now defunct, was a Michigan corporation formed in 2009 that provided software development, consulting and related services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On December 8, 2017, the Plaintiff filed a first amended complaint (\"Amended Complaint\"). The Amended Complaint contains one count that seeks a money judgment for a nondischargeable debt under \u00a7 523(a)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code. The Amended Complaint alleges that: the Plaintiff and the Debtor were shareholders of GMGT; the Debtor was the manager (\"Manager\") of GMGT under an operating agreement (\"Operating Agreement\") for GMGT made on February 1, 2009; the Debtor owed a fiduciary duty to the Plaintiff because of her relationship as a fellow shareholder and because of her position as Manager; the Debtor breached her fiduciary duty by knowingly making unjustified distributions to herself from GMGT and failing to make distributions to the Plaintiff; and the Debtor's conduct \"constituted a defalcation and misappropriation of the funds that were entrusted to her charge in direct harm to Plaintiff.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On December 22, 2017, the Debtor filed a motion (\"Motion\") to dismiss the Amended Complaint. The Debtor makes three arguments in the Motion. First, the Amended Complaint fails to state a claim for relief under \u00a7 523(a)(4) because it does not allege the existence of a trust, or that the Debtor ever held any funds in trust for the Plaintiff, as required to prove a fiduciary capacity for purposes of \u00a7 523(a)(4). Second, to the extent that the Debtor did owe any fiduciary duty, the Debtor owed such duty to GMGT, not to the Plaintiff, and therefore the Plaintiff lacks standing to claim damages from any breach of such duty. Third, the claims alleged in the Amended Complaint are based on Michigan law and are all time barred by applicable statutes of limitations in Michigan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Plaintiff filed a response to the Motion, the Debtor filed a reply and the Court held a hearing. The Motion is now ready for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Debtor brings her motion under Fed.

The fact that the Debtor was a \"fellow shareholder\" of GMGT along with the Plaintiff does not establish a trust under Michigan law and does not plausibly suggest a valid \u00a7 523(a)(4) claim against the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Debtor's position as Manager under the Operating Agreement requires more consideration. The Amended Complaint identifies six separate provisions in the Operating Agreement in support of the Plaintiff's contention that the Debtor's position as Manager of GMGT created a trust relationship: \u00a7\u00a7 2.3, 2.4, 4.1, 4.2, 5.4 and 7.1. Section 2.3 requires the Manager to provide financial reports to GMGT's shareholders. Section 2.4 requires the maintenance of separate capital accounts for each shareholder. Section 4.1 allocates profits and losses among the shareholders. Section 4.2 permits the Manager to make distributions to shareholders from time to time if the Manager determines that GMGT has sufficient cash to do so after paying all its bills. Section 5.4 allocates the shares of GMGT, including 1/3 to the Plaintiff and 1/3 to the Debtor. Section 7.1 provides that GMGT shall be managed by the Manager. The Amended Complaint alleges that the Debtor violated these provisions by failing to provide the Plaintiff with the financial information required by Section 2.3 and by making a distribution to herself under Section 4.2 without paying the Plaintiff an equal distribution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As it must, for purposes of the Motion, the Court accepts all of the Amended Complaint's factual allegations as true. They establish that the Debtor, as the Manager of GMGT, breached the Operating Agreement by failing to provide the Plaintiff with the financial information as required by Section 2.3 and by failing to distribute the Plaintiff's share of the profits of GMGT as required by Section 4.2. But neither these allegations, nor anything else in the Operating Agreement, establish an intention to create a trust, a transfer of property to one to hold for the benefit of another, or a definite beneficiary. To be sure, if taken as true, the allegations in the Amended Complaint establish that the Plaintiff and the Debtor entered into a contract regarding the management of GMGT, and a breach of that contract by the Debtor as the Manager of GMGT. But those facts are not sufficient to create a trust under Michigan law or establish a\n   preexisting express trust for purposes of \u00a7 523(a)(4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The facts alleged in the Amended Complaint do not plausibly suggest a valid claim for a nondischargeable debt under \u00a7 523(a)(4). Accordingly, the Court will grant the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Because the Amended Complaint does not state a claim upon which relief can be granted under \u00a7 523(a)(4), it is unnecessary for the Court to reach the Debtor's two other arguments for dismissal made in the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Court will enter a separate order consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    At most, the Amended Complaint could arguably be read as alleging that a trust arose when the Debtor diverted GMGT's profits and revenue. However, the Supreme Court and Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals have been very clear in holding that a\n    <em>\n     preexisting\n    </em>\n    trust is required under \u00a7 523(a)(4)'s exception to discharge. \"It is not enough that, by the very act of wrongdoing out of which the contested debt arose, the [debtor] has become chargeable as a trustee ex maleficio. He must have been a trustee before the wrong and without reference thereto.\"\n    <em>\n     Davis v.
