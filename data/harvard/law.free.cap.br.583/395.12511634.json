Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Each of the above-captioned adversary proceedings is a preference action arising out of the Chapter 7 bankruptcy case of Dearborn Bancorp, Inc. The Plaintiff Chapter 7 Trustee seeks to avoid pre-petition transfers the Debtor made to Defendant Jeffrey Karafa totaling $130,422.00 (Adv. No. 13-5094) and pre-petition transfers the Debtor made to Defendant Michael Ross totaling $228,344.00 (Adv. No. 13-5095). The Trustee seeks judgments for these amounts against the Defendants, plus interest. The Trustee also seeks disallowance, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), of each Defendant's claim filed in the Debtor's bankruptcy case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court granted partial summary judgment for the Plaintiff Trustee in each of these cases, and then held a joint bench trial. The parties then filed post-trial briefs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The trial focused on two of the statutory defenses to the avoidance of preferential transfers-namely, the \"contemporaneous exchange for new value\" defense under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1), and the \"subsequent new value\" defense under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Court has considered all of the arguments of the parties; all of the exhibits admitted into evidence at trial, namely Plaintiff's Exhibits 1-4 and 8-27, and Defendants' Exhibits C, D, F-1, F-2, G-1-D, G-4-A, G-4-B, I-1, I-2, J-3, K-2, L-2, L-3, O, and P, and each of the following Defendants' Exhibits for a limited purpose as stated during trial: J-1, M-1, M-2-A, M-3, M-4-B.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the Court has considered\n   all of the testimony that was admitted into evidence at trial, of the following witnesses: William Demmer, Defendant Michael Ross, and Defendant Jeffrey Karafa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This opinion constitutes a statement of the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law in these two adversary proceedings. For the reasons stated in this opinion, the Court will enter judgment in favor of the Plaintiff Trustee against each of the Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Background and facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The following quotation from Defendants' trial brief accurately states some basic background facts that are not disputed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Prior to the filing of its bankruptcy petition, Dearborn Bancorp, Inc. (\"Debtor\") was a publicly traded company with approximately 5,000 shareholders and was listed on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange. Debtor owned 100% of the stock of Community Bank of Dearborn, which later became known as Fidelity Bank (\"Bank\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Debtor employed Michael Ross (\"Ross\") as its President and Bank employed Ross as its President and Chief Executive Officer. Debtor employed Jeffery Karafa (\"Karafa\") as its Treasurer and Chief Operating Officer and Bank employed Karafa as its Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary, and Treasurer. Ross and Karafa oversaw the day-to-day operations of Bank and Debtor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   On or about March 30, 2012: (a) Bank was closed by the Michigan Office Of Financial And Insurance Regulation; (b) the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") was appointed to be Bank's receiver; (c) substantially all of the assets of Bank were sold to Huntington National Bank; and (d) all of the employees of Bank were terminated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   On or about March 21, 2012, Debtor entered into Consulting Agreements with Ross and Karafa.... [Under] the Consulting Agreements, Debtor retained Ross and Karafa to perform services in connection with the winding up of Debtor's business and affairs.... The Consulting Agreement with Ross was effective as of March 31, 2012 and the Consulting Agreement with Karafa was effective as of March 30, 2012. [Under] the Consulting Agreement with Ross, Debtor was obligated to provide the following to Ross in exchange for his performance of duties under the Consulting Agreement: (I) compensation of $6,867 [per week] paid weekly in advance; (ii) an allowance for health care benefits of $1,000 [per month] paid monthly on the first of each month; and (iii) reimbursement of expenses of $75 [per month] paid monthly on the first of each month. [Under] the Consulting Agreement with Karafa, Debtor was obligated to provide the following to Karafa in exchange for his performance of duties under the Consulting Agreement: (I) compensation of $3,846 [per week] paid weekly in advance; (ii) an allowance for health care benefits of $1,000 [per month] paid monthly on the first of each month; and (iii) reimbursement of expenses of $50 [per month] paid monthly on the first of each month.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Ross and Karafa performed the obligations required under their respective Consulting Agreements. Between April 7, 2012 and November 2, 2012, Debtor paid $228,344 to Ross and $130,422 to Karafa. Such payments were made in the amounts and at the times required under their respective Consulting Agreements. Both Ross and Karafa continued to perform services for Debtor pursuant to the provisions of the Consulting Agreements after Debtor ceased\n   paying them for services at the beginning of November 2012.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Debtor filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code on March 11, 2013. Ross filed a proof of claim, Claim No. 2, in the amount of $137,340 for services rendered pursuant to his Consulting Agreement subsequent to November 9, 2012. Karafa filed a proof of claim, Claim No. 5, in the amount of $76,920 for services rendered pursuant to his Consulting Agreement subsequent to November 9, 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiff Trustee's complaints\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Plaintiff Trustee's complaints in these two adversary proceedings are similar, and each complaint contains six counts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Count I of each complaint seeks to avoid the pre-petition transfers the Debtor made under the Consulting Agreements with Defendants-totaling $130,422.00 to Karafa and $228,344.00 to Ross-as preferential transfers under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Counts II through IV, which are no longer part of these cases, sought to avoid the same transfers, as fraudulent transfers under several provisions in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20548\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Count V seeks recovery of the avoided transfers from each Defendant, as an initial transferee, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20550\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court's summary judgment rulings and the trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Before trial, Plaintiff moved for summary judgment in each adversary proceeding. Plaintiff sought summary judgment on Count I (the preference claim), and also on Counts III and IV (fraudulent transfer claims) of his complaint in each case. Defendants opposed the summary judgment motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   After holding a hearing, the Court issued a bench opinion\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and entered an order in each adversary proceeding, granting Plaintiff's motions in part and denying them in part. The Court denied Plaintiff's summary judgment motions entirely with respect to the fraudulent transfer claims (Counts III and IV). But the Court granted partial summary judgment with respect to Plaintiff's preference claims in each adversary proceeding (Count I), as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   IT IS ORDERED that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   1. The Motion is granted to the following extent: Plaintiff is granted partial summary judgment on Count I ..., determining that the Plaintiff has established all of the necessary elements under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) for avoiding the transfers alleged and referred to in ... the Complaint ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   2.

Before trial, Plaintiff abandoned all of his fraudulent transfer claims, Counts II through IV in each case,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Court now will enter judgment dismissing those claims with prejudice. Trial was held on Plaintiffs preference claims under Count I, and the related claims that depend on Plaintiff's success in avoiding the transfers as preferences-Counts V (the \u00a7 550 recovery claim), and VI (the \u00a7 502(d) claim).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The transfers at issue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   It is undisputed that during the time period from April 1, 2012 to November 2, 2012, the Debtor made 32 weekly transfers to each of the Defendants. All of the transfers\n   were done by a check drawn on the Debtor's bank account at Fifth Third Bank. And all of the transfers were payments called for by the Consulting Agreement that each Defendant had made with the Debtor in March 2012. For each payment, Defendants would generate an invoice. Copies of all of the invoices and of all the checks that paid the invoices were admitted into evidence at trial as exhibits: PX-2 and DX-I-1 and DX-I-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The invoices and the payments followed the timing set out in each Defendant's Consulting Agreement. For example, the first invoice issued for Ross was dated March 31, 2012, addressed to the Debtor, for the following amounts: (1) $6,867.00 for \"Consulting Services for the week of April 1-7, 2012;\" plus (2) $1,000.00 for \"Allowance for Health Care Benefits for the month of April 2012;\" plus (3) $75.00 for \"Cell Phone reimbursement for the month of April 2012.\" The total of this invoice was $7,942.00. The invoice was paid by Check Number 1005 from the Debtor payable to Ross, dated April 1, 2012, in the amount of $7,942.00.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   And this payment is reflected in the Debtor's bank ledger, PX-1. The next invoice from Ross was dated April 9, 2012, and was for $6,867.00, for \"Consulting Services for the week of April 8-14, 2012.\" That invoice was paid by the Debtor's Check Number 1010 dated April 9, 2012. This was followed by weekly invoices and checks, in a similar pattern. The invoice at the beginning of each month included a weekly salary payment of $6,867.00, the monthly $1,000.00 allowance for health care benefits, and the monthly $75.00 cell phone expense amount. The other weekly invoices would include only the weekly salary payment for the specified week. Karafa's invoices and check payments followed the same pattern and timing, in the amounts specified by Karafa's Consulting Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The following tables list information about all the transfers at issue, and are based on information gleaned from PX-1, PX-2, DX-I-1, and DX-I-2. First, the transfers to Ross:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Second, the transfers to Karafa:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Some explanation of these tables is necessary. For each Defendant, the table shows the time period for which a particular invoice was issued, and the date of the check that paid each invoice. The amounts paid by the checks dated at the beginning of each month are broken out into the three components on two lines in the table (salary; health care; cell phone), but the check was in a single amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The date in the \"check date\" column is the date on the face of each check. This is not necessarily the date on which the Debtor's bank honored the check. For \u00a7 547(b) purposes, at least, a transfer by check is deemed to be \"made\" on the date the drawee bank actually honors the check by paying it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barnhill v.

At the summary judgment stage, for example, it was undisputed that the Defendants were insiders of the Debtor, and that the transfers at issue all were made within the applicable one-year preference period, and the Court so ruled in granting partial summary judgment for Plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   And for purposes of the Court's ruling on the Defendants' defenses, discussed below, it is immaterial whether the checks were honored on the dates written on the face of the checks, or within a day or two later. The Court will assume that each check was paid by the Debtor's bank on, or within a day or two after, the date of the check. This is what one would normally expect, and the circumstances in this case do not suggest anything else.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   There are two minor discrepancies in the evidence, as indicated by the tables above. First, each side's exhibits consisting of the invoices and check copies are missing the invoice and check copy for one weekly salary payment to Defendant Ross. That is the payment of $6,867.00 made by the check dated August 24, 2012, and it was the salary payment for the week of August 26 to September 1, 2012. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   the \"no invoice\" line for that week under the \"invoice date\" column in the table for Ross, above.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   But this payment to Ross is shown in the Debtor's ledger for this bank account, PX-1, Check Number 1062 dated August 24, 2012. So the Court includes this payment in the table for Ross, and includes this in the transfers the Court finds were made to Ross. By including this payment, the total of the transfers to Ross equals the $228,344.00 total the parties agree on.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   A second minor discrepancy is that for both Ross and Karafa, a few of the check dates shown by the check copies in each side's exhibits are different from the check dates for those checks that are shown in the Debtor's account ledger, PX-1. These different dates in PX-1 are shown in the\n   tables above in the \"PX-1 check date:\" column. The Court finds that the check dates shown in the Debtor's account ledger, PX-1, are incorrect with respect to these checks, because they do not match the actual dates written on the face of the check copies themselves. The correct check dates, for all checks reflected in each table above, are the dates stated in the \"check date:\" column.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

In granting partial summary judgment for Plaintiff on this element, the Court rejected Defendants' argument, and the Court reiterates that ruling now. In its summary judgment bench opinion, the Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   With respect to the [\u00a7] 547(b)(2) antecedent debt element, ... the [D]efendants argue that this element is not established with respect to the transfers at issue, the payments made to [D]efendants by the [D]ebtor under these consulting agreements because the payments ... were not due under the terms of those consulting agreements before\n   they were made by the [D]ebtor. The [D]efendants' concept ... of antecedent debt ... is that a debt is not incurred by a debtor until the debt is due to be paid-[until] payment is due. The [P]laintiff on the other hand argues that the [D]ebtor incurred a debt under each of the consulting agreement[s], ... when those agreements were made; that is, when each agreement was signed on March 21, 2012, even though the payments later made by the [D]ebtor to each of the [D]efendants ... were not due under the terms of those agreements to be paid until a later date.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   The Court has reviewed carefully the cases cited by each of the parties on this issue of antecedent debt, and the Court agrees with the reasoning and holding of the bankruptcy court in the\n   <em>\n    Enron\n   </em>\n   case relied heavily upon by the Plaintiff Trustee with respect to this antecedent debt issue. The\n   <em>\n    Enron\n   </em>\n   case is the\n   <em>\n    Official Committee [of Unsecured Creditors of Enron Corp. v.

And I agree in particular with the\n   <em>\n    Enron\n   </em>\n   court's reasoning expressed at 357 B.R. [at 47-48]....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   The consequence of this is that ... payments made on that debt at a later time are and must be deemed to be payment of an antecedent debt ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   Applying these concepts to this case, in this case the [D]ebtor's debt to each of the [D]efendants under their respective consulting agreements was incurred and arose and existed as soon as the [D]ebtor and each [Defendant] signed their respective consulting agreements, and in the case of each of these agreements that date was March 21, 2012 and that's not disputed.... This is so even though the payments due to the [D]efendants under these agreements did not become due until later dates. For example ..., as [D]efendants point out, the payment of their salary amounts were to be paid under these agreements ... weekly in advance. The ... [D]ebtor's debt ... under these consulting agreements existed ... as of March 21, 2012 even though as of that date it may have been contingent upon later performance of their duties under the agreement by the [D]efendants, and even though the debt did not mature or become due to be paid until later.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   It follows, therefore, that all of the payments made ... by the [D]ebtor to each of the [D]efendants under the consulting agreements, were ... transfers ... \"for on account of an antecedent debt owed by the [D]ebtor before such transfer was made,\" within the meaning of Section 547(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code.

For example, Defendants argue, there is no requirement that the new value be at least equivalent or reasonably equivalent in value to the amount of the transfer. Defendants argue that the Court need not measure or determine the\n   <em>\n    amount\n   </em>\n   of value provided by any given services they performed, as long as the services provided value of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   amount to the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Defendants make this argument only with respect to their contemporaneous new value defense under \u00a7 547(c)(1).

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   the first table in Part IV.A.1 of this opinion.) Under Defendants' argument, Ross does not need to prove that he performed services during the week of April 8-14, 2012 of a value which equaled or approximated at least $6,867.00. Rather, Defendants say, it is enough for Ross to prove that during that week he performed some services for the Debtor under his Consulting Agreement, which had economic value to the Debtor of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   amount, however small. If Ross proves that much, Defendants argue, he has demonstrated that he gave the Debtor \"new value\" that week, sufficient to support a complete defense to avoidance of any of the $6,867.00 transfer he received for that week. So even if the value of Ross's services for that week was only $100.00, he argues that he has a complete defense to avoidance of the entire $6,867.00 transfer made to him for that week, under \u00a7 547(c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   In support of their argument that the\n   <em>\n    amount\n   </em>\n   of the new value given is not important, for \u00a7 547(c)(1) purposes, Defendants cite two cases from 30 years ago, each decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit:\n   <em>\n    Kenan v.

The court held that the creditor's release of its lien on the debtor's well was \"new value\" given to the debtor under the \u00a7 547(a)(2) definition, because it was a \"release by a transferee of property of previously transferred to such transferee in a transaction that is neither void nor voidable by the debtor or the trustee under any applicable law.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1583389\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/792/125/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 127-28 ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) (quoted in full above).

The Court agrees with what now appears to be the unanimous view, as shown by the cases cited above, that a defendant asserting the contemporaneous new value defense under \u00a7 547(c)(1) must prove the amount of the value of any \"new value\" provided to the Debtor, and has no \u00a7 547(c)(1) defense beyond the amount of such value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Defendants make two primary arguments in support of their view of \u00a7 547(c)(1), both of which have been rejected by cases cited above. First, Defendants focus on the difference between the wording of \u00a7 547(c)(1) and the wording of \u00a7 547(c)(4), and argue that the difference in wording shows a Congressional intent that the\n   <em>\n    amount\n   </em>\n   of new value be relevant under \u00a7 547(c)(4), but not be relevant under \u00a7 547(c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   The difference in wording is in the placement of the phrase \"to the extent that\" in the two subsections. Section 547(c)(4) says in pertinent part that a transfer is not avoidable as a preference if\n   the transfer is \"to or for the benefit of a creditor,\n   <strong>\n    to the extent that\n   </strong>\n   , after such transfer, such creditor gave new value to or for the benefit of the debtor ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(4) (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants agree that under this wording, the defense is available only to the extent of the\n   <em>\n    amount\n   </em>\n   of the subsequent new value given to the Debtor. And Defendants agree that the purpose of \u00a7 547(c)(4) is, in effect, to credit a transferee who after the transfer gives unpaid-for new value to the debtor, because that transferee is considered to have replenished the bankruptcy estate to the extent of that new value given. Given this purpose, the\n   <em>\n    amount\n   </em>\n   of the subsequent new value is a critical limit on the defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   The phrase \"to the extent that\" also appears in \u00a7 547(c)(1), but in a somewhat different way than in \u00a7 547(c)(4). Section 547(c)(1) says:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-177\">\n   (c) The trustee may not avoid under this section a transfer-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-178\">\n   (1)\n   <strong>\n    to the extent that\n   </strong>\n   such transfer was-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-179\">\n   (A) intended by the debtor and the creditor to or for whose benefit such transfer was made to be a contemporaneous exchange for new value given to the debtor; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-180\">\n   (B) in fact a substantially contemporaneous exchange[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) (emphasis added). Defendants argue that under this wording the defense is not limited \"to the extent\" of the new value given by the creditor-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , to the amount of such new value given. Rather, Defendants say that here, the phrase \"to the extent that\" only applies to (1) the parties\n   <em>\n    intent\n   </em>\n   that an exchange be contemporanous; and (2) the exchange\n   <em>\n    being in fact substantially contemporanous\n   </em>\n   . According to Defendants, the phrase \"to the extent that\" does not apply to the \"new value\" given.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   The many cases cited and quoted above have rejected Defendants' interpretation of \u00a7 547(c)(1), and have held that the defense is limited to the amount of new value given to the debtor in exchange for a transfer. This Court agrees with those cases, and rejects Defendants' interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   One reason why this Court does so is that the phrase \"to the extent that\" in the beginning of \u00a7 547(c)(1) clearly applies both to the phrase in \u00a7 547(c)(1)(A) and to the phrase in \u00a7 547(c)(1)(B). Because it applies to the latter, \u00a7 547(c)(1) clearly includes the element that a transfer is unavoidable only \"to the extent that such transfer was ... in fact a substantially contemporanous exchange.\" But the question then is, a \"substantially contemporanous exchange\" for what? The clearly implied answer is, \"a substantially contemporanous exchange\" for \"new value given to the debtor\" (the phrase used in \u00a7 547(c)(1)(A).) From this, the Court infers that the phrase \"to the extent that\" at the beginning of \u00a7 547(c)(1) combines with the rest of that section's wording to mean, among other things, that the defense applies only \"to the extent that\" the transfer was an exchange for new value given to the debtor. As a result, the Court concludes that the \u00a7 547(c)(1) defense, like the \u00a7 547(c)(4) defense, is limited\n   to the\n   <em>\n    amount\n   </em>\n   of new value given to the debtor. And this clearly is the now-unanimous view taken by the cases summarized and quoted above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Defendants second argument is that the legislative history of \u00a7 547(c)(1) supports their interpretation of the statute. Defendants argue that the history shows a Congressional intent to protect from preference avoidance transactions that were intended to be essentially simultaneous exchanges, but which in fact turned out to be only substantially contemporaneous exchanges. Defendants point out that with an actual simultaneous exchange, there is no credit extended, and therefore there is no antecedent debt created that is paid by a transfer from the debtor. So with a simultaneous exchange, there is no preference avoidance possible, regardless of whether the exchange was one of equal or comparable value. Thus, for example, a sale of goods for cash paid by a debtor at the time of sale cannot be deemed a preferential transfer, even if the price paid by the debtor is much greater than the value of the goods received in exchange. Defendants argue that Congress intended the same result to occur for exchanges that were intended to be contemporaneous, but which turned out to be only in fact\n   <em>\n    substantially\n   </em>\n   contemporaneous. And, Defendants argue, this is so even if the debtor's transfer was greater in value than the value of what the debtor received in exchange.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit discussed the legislative history of \u00a7 547(c)(1), which the court described as \"sparse,\" in\n   <em>\n    Ray v.

Rather, it makes sense to hold, as this Court now does, that the contract price agreed to by a debtor for the services of an insider is,\n   <strong>\n    at most\n   </strong>\n   , merely one piece of relevant evidence of the value of the services. The contract price does not raise a presumption of the value, but rather,\n   <strong>\n    at most\n   </strong>\n   , it is merely some evidence of the value of the services, to be considered along with all other relevant evidence on the subject, and to be given whatever weight the trier of fact finds appropriate under all the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   Fourth, all of the cases Defendants cite in support of the alleged presumption are distinguishable from the case of insiders like Defendants Ross and Karafa. The Court agrees with the following arguments made by the Trustee, in distinguishing three of the four cases cited by Defendants:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-207\">\n   (a)\n   <em>\n    In re Jones Truck Lines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , involved a preference suit to recover contributions made to the Central States Pension Fund. The payment was made in exchange for continued services performed by approximately 2,300 unionized laborers. ... Further, the sole authority on which the\n   <em>\n    Jones Truck Lines\n   </em>\n   Court relies for the statement is\n   <em>\n    In re Pulaski Highway Exp., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6114272\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/57/502/#p510\">\n    57 B.R. 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 510 (Bankr. M.D. Tenn., 1986). However,\n   <em>\n    Pulaski\n   </em>\n   does not define such a general presumption, but rather states, without citation to authority, \"In the absence of evidence to the contrary, I find that the reasonable value of the services rendered to [the] estate equals the amount specified in the collective bargaining agreement.\" The facts of\n   <em>\n    Jones Truck Lines\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Pulaski\n   </em>\n   are very different from the facts of the present adversary proceedings. Indeed,\n   <em>\n    Pulaski\n   </em>\n   wasn't even a preference case but, rather, addressed whether a multiemployer pension plan's withdrawal liability claim is entitled to administrative expense priority.\n   <strong>\n    More importantly, both of these cases addressed unionized laborers (not insiders who had controlled the Debtor for nearly two decades), operating businesses (not a holding company with no substantial business operations) and complex, heavily negotiated contracts (unlike the Consulting Agreements which, Defendants acknowledge were not negotiated).\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Affidavit of Michael J.

Once again,\n   <em>\n    Nomus\n   </em>\n   has dramatically distinguishable facts. Unlike the present case, the preference defendant in\n   <em>\n    Nomus\n   </em>\n   was a non-insider crisis management firm that was retained to provide operational and financial consulting for a group of operating entities as a condition to forbearance by the debtor's secured creditor. There, it was undisputed that members of the crisis management firm were on the premises every day. Unlike the present case, the engagement letter for the crisis management firm was negotiated and set forth specific projects that the firm would perform.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   The fourth case relied on by Defendants, the\n   <em>\n    NETtel\n   </em>\n   case, likewise is distinguishable from this case. In\n   <em>\n    NETtel\n   </em>\n   , the preference defendant was a not an insider. Rather, it was an outside company that had sold certain computer equipment to the debtor, and which had a contract to provide the debtor with certain systems maintenance services and computer software licensing services. The defendant alleged that it provided the debtor with new value after receiving the debtor's allegedly preferential transfer.

In\n   <em>\n    Enron\n   </em>\n   , the preference defendant was the executrix of the estate of a deceased former corporate insider, and asserted a defense under \u00a7 547(c)(4), based on services the decedent provided to the debtor under a consulting agreement, for which he was not fully paid. The defendant argued that the monthly payments due under the consulting agreement established the amount of the value the decedent provided. The bankruptcy court denied summary judgment, however, finding that a genuine issue of material fact existed regarding the value of the decedent's services. While the court agreed that in general, a presumption exists that the value of services equals the contract price, it held that any such presumption was rebutted in that case.\n   <em>\n    Enron\n   </em>\n   distinguishes the case of an insider contract from a debtor's arms-length contract with an unrelated third party.

While the Court agrees that contractually-agreed upon payments can generally be presumed to equal the value of the services (or goods) provided, sufficient facts here exist to rebut that presumption. As the Committee notes,\n   <strong>\n    [Defendant's decedent] was a member of Enron's senior management just prior to signing the Consulting Agreement\n   </strong>\n   ; this is not slander, as [Defendant] protests, but simply a recognition that the Consulting Agreement was signed on the same day that [Defendant's decedent] resigned as Vice Chairman and Chief Strategic Officer.

They argue that the value of their services under the Consulting Agreements cannot be deemed to be\n   <em>\n    less than\n   </em>\n   the contract price the Debtor agreed to pay,\n   <em>\n    unless the Trustee successfully avoids the Debtor's obligation to pay under the Consulting Agreement as a fraudulent obligation\n   </em>\n   . (And that is something the Trustee did not seek to do in these cases.) Defendants argued this:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-219\">\n   In the\n   <em>\n    NETtel\n   </em>\n   case, the court queried as to whether the presumption can\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   be overcome\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     if\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   the contractual obligations were first set aside as fraudulent incurrences of obligations. See footnote 7 on page 295, wherein the court stated:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-220\">\n   \"For purposes of addressing the instant motion, the court will assume in Harris's favor that to the extent that Harris can demonstrate the contract price of the services, it measures the value. However, in some cases an issue may exist whether the contract price can be rejected under \u00a7 547(a)(2) as the \"money's worth\" of the services when the contract price is excessive in the market, and whether, alternatively, the excessive contract price can only be set aside under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20544\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (which addresses avoiding the incurring of an obligation via the trustee's invocation of certain actual or hypothetical creditors' rights under nonbankruptcy law) or\n   <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20548\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (which addresses avoiding the incurring of an obligation in exchange for less than reasonably equivalent value).\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-221\">\n   Such query should be answered in the affirmative .... Again, the valuation issue is relevant to a fraudulent transfer but not to a preference.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Litigating such issue in the context of a preference is simply an inappropriate end run around the fact that Trustee is not pursuing a fraudulent transfer action\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   The Court rejects this argument, for the following reasons. First, the\n   <em>\n    NETtel\n   </em>\n   case does not support Defendants' argument, but rather merely raises it as a question, which the court did not answer (and did not need to answer). Second, Defendants have cited no case that supports their argument. Third, there is no provision in the Bankruptcy Code that supports Defendants' argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   Fourth, the argument, as articulated by Defendants, is premised on there being a presumption-that contract price equals value of contract services. But that premise is false in a case like this one-this Court has held that no such presumption exists in an insider-preference case like this one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   Fifth, avoidance of a transfer as a preference under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 547 is a ground for avoidance that is separate from, and in addition to, avoidance of a transfer as a fraudulent transfer (or avoidance of an obligation as a fraudulent obligation) under Bankruptcy Code \u00a7\u00a7 548 or 544 (using state fraudulent transfer law).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   For all of the reasons stated above, Defendants bear the burden of proving the value of their services, without the aid of any presumption, in order to succeed on their new-value defenses under either \u00a7\u00a7 547(c)(1) or 547(c)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   <strong>\n    (e) Defendants failed to prove their \u00a7 547(c)(1) defense with respect to any of the transfers at issue.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   As shown in detail in the tables in Part IV.A.1 of this Opinion, Defendants Ross and Karafa each received 32 weekly payments from the Debtor during the time period April 1, 2012 through November 10, 2012. Each of these 64 payments was a separate transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   The Court concludes that each of the Defendants failed to meet his burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, any of the necessary elements to establish a defense under \u00a7 547(c)(1) with respect to any of the transfers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Defendants did not prove the intent element of \u00a7 547(c)(1)(A).\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   First, Defendants each failed to prove that any of the transfers were intended by both the Debtor and the Defendant \"to be a contemporaneous exchange for new value given to the debtor,\" as required by \u00a7 547(c)(1)(A). Each Defendant had to prove that both he and the Debtor had such intent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   discussion in Part IV.A.4(a) of this Opinion. At trial, Defendants presented no admissible evidence that the bankruptcy Debtor (Dearborn Bancorp., Inc.) had any such intent. And the Court finds that neither the Debtor nor the Defendants had any such intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   Defendants argue that such intent is shown by the terms of the Consulting Agreement that each of them signed with the Debtor. The Court disagrees, however, and finds that the Consulting Agreements show just the opposite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   The Ross Consulting Agreement was identical to the Karafa Consulting Agreement, except for some particular details\n   unique to each Defendant, such as the Defendant's title, duties, and the amount of payments to be made to the Defendant. The Ross Consulting Agreement (PX-3) stated that it was effective as of March 31, 2012; that the term of the agreement was one year, commencing March 31, 2012; and that during the term of the agreement Ross would serve as the \"President and Chief Executive Officer\" of the Debtor. The Ross Consulting Agreement stated the following with respect to Ross's duties:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-233\">\n   Consultant will be expected to perform such duties and responsibilities as are commensurate with the position of President and Chief Executive Officer and as are necessary and appropriate for the management and winding up of the business and affairs of the [Debtor].\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   The agreement further stated that Ross's relationship with the Debtor \"is that of an independent contractor and not an employee.\" In a section called \"Time Devoted,\" the agreement stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-235\">\n   Consultant shall be expected to devote such time to [the Debtor] as necessary to perform his duties and responsibilities hereunder. Nothing stated herein shall require him to work full time for [the Debtor] or shall preclude him from engaging in any other business ventures provided they do not interfere with his responsibilities hereunder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   The agreement contained an integration clause that stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-237\">\n   This Agreement contains the entire understanding between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supercedes any prior understandings, agreements, or representations, written or oral, relating to the subject matter hereof.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   The Ross Consulting Agreement stated that \"[t]hroughout the Term of this Agreement,\" the Debtor would pay compensation as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-239\">\n   Salary:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-240\">\n   $6,867.00 paid weekly in advance\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-241\">\n   Allowance for health care benefits:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-242\">\n   $1,000.00 paid monthly on the first of each month\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-243\">\n   Reimbursement of Expenses:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-244\">\n   $75.00 paid monthly on the first of each month\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   The terms of the Karafa Consulting Agreement (PX-4) were identical to the Ross Consulting Agreement in all respects described above, except Karafa's agreement defined his position as the \"Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of [the Debtor],\" and described Karafa's duties as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-246\">\n   Consultant will be expected to perform such duties and responsibilities as are commensurate with the position of Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer and as are necessary and appropriate for the management and winding up of the business and affairs of the [Debtor].\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   And Karafa's compensation was less than Ross's. The Karafa Consulting Agreement stated that \"[t]hroughout the Term of this Agreement,\" the Debtor would pay Karafa compensation as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-248\">\n   Salary:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-249\">\n   $3,846.00 paid weekly in advance\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-250\">\n   Allowance for health care benefits:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-251\">\n   $1,000.00 paid monthly on the first of each month\n   Reimbursement of Expenses:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-252\">\n   $50.00 paid monthly on the first of each month\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   Thus, the Consulting Agreements required each of the Defendants to be paid a regular weekly salary and regular benefits in the same specific amounts for each week and for each month, respectively, through payments made in advance, at regular weekly intervals. In exchange for those payments by the Debtor, however, the Consulting Agreements did not require either Defendant to perform any particular services at any particular time, let alone at any regular weekly or monthly intervals. In fact, with respect to any given week's payment by the Debtor, the Consulting Agreements permitted the Defendants to perform no services at all during that week. The Consulting Agreements did not require the Defendants to work full time for the Debtor, and expressly allowed the Defendants to engage in other business ventures. The Consulting Agreements stated, vaguely, that each Defendant was an independent contractor, and only required each Defendant \"to devote such time [to the Debtor] as necessary to perform his duties and responsibilities hereunder,\" which duties themselves were stated only vaguely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   It is clear from all of this that neither the Debtor nor the Defendants had any contractual intent under the Consulting Agreements that any of the weekly transfers by the Debtor be a\n   <em>\n    contemporaneous\n   </em>\n   exchange for any services to be given by the Defendants. To further illustrate the point, which applies to every transfer, consider the Debtor's check dated April 23, 2012 to Defendant Ross, in the amount of $6,867.00, listed in the table in Part IV.A.1 of this Opinion. According to Ross's invoice that was paid by that check, also dated April 23, 2012, that check was a salary payment for the week of April 22-28, 2012. Nothing in Ross's Consulting Agreement required Ross to perform any particular services for the Debtor during that week, or to perform any services at all during that week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   Thus, the unambiguous terms of the Consulting Agreements show a lack of any intent, by the Debtor or by either of the Defendants, that any of the weekly transfers to Defendants be given in exchange for services provided at or near the same time as the transfer. Instead of services being given on a weekly basis contemporaneously with the Debtor's weekly transfers to Defendants, the Consulting Agreements provided only that Defendants give their services as and when such services were \"necessary or appropriate for the management and winding up of business and affairs of [the Debtor].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   Defendants make much of the fact that the Consulting Agreements required Defendants' salaries to be paid \"weekly in advance,\" and that their health care benefit allowance and expense reimbursements be \"paid monthly on the first of each month.\" But this shows nothing at all-that is, it shows nothing about any intent that the Defendants' services be timed to coincide with the regular weekly or monthly payments from the Debtor. The only thing it shows is an intention about the timing of the Debtor's payments in relation to\n   <em>\n    the calendar.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   Thus, for example, the Debtor's first weekly salary payment to Defendants, for the first week after the March 31, 2012 effective date of the Consulting Agreements, was for the week of April 1-7, 2012, and was to be paid in advance of that week. And this is what was done-Karafa and Ross each received a check dated\n   April 1, 2012 for the time period April 1-7 with respect to salary, and for the month of April 2012 with respect to the health care and expense reimbursement portions of their compensation. Yet the Consulting Agreements did not require either Defendant to perform any actual services for the Debtor during the week of April 1-7, 2012. And, in fact, the actual practice of the parties under the Consulting Agreements was that the amount and timing of each Defendant's services varied considerably during the weeks between April 1, 2012 and November 10, 2012, when the Debtor was making its regular weekly and monthly payments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   For these reasons, the Court finds that Defendants have failed to meet their burden of proving the first necessary element of their affirmative defense under \u00a7 547(c)(1) -that any of the transfers were \"intended by the Debtor and the [Defendants] to be a contemporaneous exchange for new value [in the form of services] given [by Defendants] to the [D]ebtor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

First, Defendants claim that they provided services to the Debtor under their Consulting Agreements each week during the 32-week time period for which the Debtor made weekly payments to them (April 1, 2012 through November 10, 2012, the \"Payment Period\"). Second, Defendants also claim that they continued to provide services to the Debtor during the 17 weeks after that time period, when the Debtor no longer was paying them, until the Debtor filed its bankruptcy petition on March 11, 2013 (the \"Non-Payment Period\"). Third, Defendants also claim that they continued to provide services to the Debtor/bankruptcy estate after the bankruptcy petition was filed (the \"Post-Petition Period\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   Plaintiff argues, and Defendants do not dispute,\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   that any new value from services that Defendants provided during the Post-Petition Period does not count as new value under Defendants' \u00a7 547(c)(4) defense.

That is, the relevant time period begins immediately after the date of the Debtor's first transfers to each of the Defendants (April 1, 2012) and ends with the bankruptcy petition date (March 11, 2013). The 32 weeks of the Payment Period are relevant, even though the Debtor was making weekly payments to Defendants all through that period, because none of those transfers are \"otherwise unavoidable\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   within the meaning of \u00a7 547(c)(4)(B). That is so because all of those transfers\n   <em>\n    are\n   </em>\n   avoidable, except to the extent \u00a7 547(c)(4) shields them. Because the Court has rejected Defendants' defenses under \u00a7\u00a7 547(c)(1) and 547(c)(2), Defendants have no other defenses to avoidance left for any of the transfers, except \u00a7 547(c)(4). So for any given transfer to one of the Defendants, none of the transfers made to that Defendant thereafter can be deemed an \"otherwise unavoidable transfer\" that paid for any subsequent new value.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones Truck Lines, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11889228\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/130/323/#p328\">\n    130 F.3d at 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Under \u00a7 547(c)(4), \"subsequent new value cannot be offset or nullified by payments that are themselves avoidable preferences.\");\n   <em>\n    Phoenix Rest.

At some times during that same 32-week period, and then during the 17 weeks of the Non-Payment period, Defendants each performed some services under their Consulting Agreement. The question is: how much, if anything, in \"new value\"-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , in \"money's worth,\" meaning economic value-did each Defendant's pre-petition services give to the Debtor?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-278\">\n   Defendants each had the burden of proving the answer to this question, by a preponderance of the evidence, in order to succeed on their \u00a7 547(c)(4) defense. Not only that, but also each Defendant had the burden of proving the timing element of their defense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this case, the Debtor made a total of 64 transfers (32 transfers to each Defendant). To have a defense to the avoidance of any given transfer to a Defendant, that Defendant had to prove that he performed services for the Debtor\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the date of that transfer (and\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the bankruptcy petition date), which provided \"new value\" to the Debtor, and the\n   <em>\n    amount of the value\n   </em>\n   of such new value. If the Defendant proved all these things, he would have a defense to avoidance of the transfer at issue, to the extent of the amount of the value of such new value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-279\">\n   As the Court has discussed earlier in this Opinion, to show that any of their services provided \"new value\" to the Debtor, Defendants had to prove that the services\n   gave \"a direct or indirect economic benefit to the [D]ebtor viewed from the perspective of the [D]ebtor's creditors.\" This means that the services \"did any of the following: [ (1) ] brought in money to the [D]ebtor or the [D]ebtor's bankruptcy estate; ... [ (2) ] saved the [D]ebtor or the bankruptcy estate expense; or [ (3) ] reduced or eliminated or avoided liability for, or [reduced] liability for the [D]ebtor [ ]or the bankruptcy estate.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-280\">\n   And Defendants had to prove the\n   <em>\n    amount of the value\n   </em>\n   of such \"new value\" their services gave to the Debtor, with specificity. In this regard, the Court finds applicable the holdings of several of the court of appeals cases quoted earlier in this Opinion, in the context of discussing \u00a7 547(c)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   As those cases state, Defendants had the burden of proving \"the specific measure\" of the new value they gave to the Debtor (per the\n   <em>\n    Jet Florida\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Southmark Corp.\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   cases); or, in other words, the \"specific valuation\" of the new value (per the\n   <em>\n    Electronic Metal Products\n   </em>\n   case); or, in other words, to prove the amount of such new value \"with specificity\" (per the\n   <em>\n    Arrow Air, Inc.\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   cases).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-281\">\n   The Court finds that Defendants did not meet their burden of proof, to any extent, with respect to any of the 64 transfers that Defendants received. This is especially so under the specificity requirement just described, but is is so even without applying the specificity requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   In rejecting Defendants' presumption argument, in Part IV.A.4(d) of this Opinion, this Court held that the contract price that the Debtor agreed to pay Defendants for their services under the Consulting Agreements\n   <em>\n    may be\n   </em>\n   relevant evidence of the value of Defendants' services. As the Court held, earlier in this Opinion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-283\">\n   [T]he contract price agreed to by a debtor for the services of an insider is,\n   <strong>\n    at most\n   </strong>\n   , merely one piece of relevant evidence of the value of the services. The contract price does not raise a presumption of the value, but rather,\n   <strong>\n    at most\n   </strong>\n   , it is merely some evidence of the value of the services, to be considered along with all other relevant evidence on the subject, and to be given whatever weight the trier of fact finds appropriate under all the circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-284\">\n   In this case, the Court gives no weight to the contract price in the Consulting Agreements. There was no evidence that the Debtor agreed to pay Defendants the salary and benefit amounts that it did because of any view that the amounts represented the fair market value of the services to be provided. Rather, the salary amounts in the Consulting Agreements were simply\n   <em>\n    identical\n   </em>\n   to the salary amounts that Defendants had been receiving before the FDIC took over the Debtor's bank. Those salaries were paid to Defendants at a time when the Defendants were running an operating bank with $750-800 million in deposits, 15 branches, about 220 employees, and over 18,000 customers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   As soon as the FDIC took over the bank, the employees were terminated and the bank had no business to operate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants' services during the time they running an operating bank were quite different\n   in nature from Defendants' wind-down services under the Consulting Agreements, which were performed for a Debtor that no longer had any business or employees, and that was about to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation. There was no evidence presented at trial that in fact, or even just in the view of the Debtor, the fair market value of Defendants' wind-down services was at all comparable to the fair market value of Defendants' services when they were running the Debtor's bank as an operating business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-285\">\n   Nor did Defendants present any other evidence of the actual value to the Debtor that their services provided under the Consulting Agreements. Defendants testified at trial to their own views that their services provided actual value to the Debtor, but the Court finds that testimony unpersuasive, and the Court also finds that Defendants' testimony did not prove the amount of the economic value that their services gave to the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-286\">\n   In their post-trial brief, Defendants argued in detail what they contend the evidence at trial showed, about (1) the services they provided under the Consulting Agreements; and (2) the value of those services to the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-287\">\n   As to the what services the Defendants provided, Defendants argued as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-288\">\n   Ross testified that he performed the following services for Debtor pursuant to his Consulting Agreement: communications with regulatory people, shareholders and directors, management of Debtors' legal team relating to FDIC issues and IRS tax issues, directed and communicated with professionals, met with Karafa and communicated with Karafa, spoke to the Chairman of the Board multiple times per week, and provided written correspondence no less than quarterly to the Board. Ross also testified that there were discussions with the Board not reduced to writing. Ross testified that the time Defendants expended working for Debtor pursuant to the Consulting Agreements fluctuated, and that Defendants performed services every week. Some weeks they were very busy, some weeks they were slow, and there were no weeks that Defendants did nothing for Debtor. Ross testified that he considered himself on call and available to Debtor \"24/7.\" Ross also participated in discussions and reviews of pleadings relating to Debtor's bankruptcy filing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-289\">\n   Ross also testified that he was very involved in resolving the problem of the FDIC freezing $7 million in 401K funds which belonged to former employees of the Bank. Ross testified that he had numerous communications with former Bank employees because they had no access to their 401K funds and that this situation continued for in excess of 6 months, until Ross found an FDIC representative in Dallas, Texas, and \"convinced them to do their job.\" ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-290\">\n   Karafa testified that ... he performed the following services to wind down Debtor's business: (1) winding down of [a] regulatory relationship with Federal Reserve Bank; (2) winding down of relationship with Securities Exchange Commission; (3) winding down of relationship with Computershare, Debtor's transfer agent; (4) ensuring that IRS and State of Michigan tax returns for 2011 and 2012 were prepared and finalized; (5) shutting down of Debtor's website; and (6) canceling insurance policies. Karafa also scanned, stored and maintained Debtor's books and records.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-291\">\n   Karafa testified that he handled Debtor's checkbook, and reviewed and paid all invoices directed to Debtor, including Dickinson, Howard &amp; Howard, Computershare, and S &amp; L (Debtor's website).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-292\">\n   After the closing of the Bank, Karafa participated in discussions with Debtor's legal counsel relating to taking action against the State of Michigan and the FDIC relating to the wrongful takeover of the Bank. Karafa testified that ... both Karafa and Ross engaged in conversations, emails and conferences with counsel....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-293\">\n   Karafa testified that he assisted Debtor's accountants, BKD, relating to contesting the State of Michigan's business tax assessments. Karafa received all of the tax notices from the State of Michigan, communicated with Doug Born of BKD relating to the assessments and directed the actions of the accountants. [Footnote 19: Karafa testified that dealing with the State of Michigan tax issues was part of the services he rendered for Debtor pursuant to the Consulting Agreement, and that he generally received tax notices from the State on a monthly basis....] Karafa also testified that he was Debtor's primary contact relating to IRS issues, and that he coordinated and attended meetings with the IRS, Ross and Dickinson.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-294\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-295\">\n   Karafa testified that as part of his duties to Debtor he discussed with counsel at Howard &amp; Howard whether there was insurance coverage for Debtor under Debtor's D &amp; O policy. Karafa also testified that he shut down Debtor's relationship with Computershare, its transfer agent, which eliminated a monthly liability. Karafa also performed services relating to recovery of insurance premium refunds, and personally handled turnover to the FDIC of insurance premiums refunds which belonged to the Bank.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-296\">\n   Karafa testified that he met with Ross in person or by phone weekly to discuss the business of Debtor. During these conferences Ross and Karafa discussed what both of them had done during the last week, what had been resolved, what still needed to be done, invoices from outside vendors, and Debtor's general finances. In addition, Ross and Karafa generally spoke every other business day. Karafa was also principally in charge of assisting Dickinson with the preparation of Debtor's bankruptcy filings. Karafa testified that although the Consulting Agreement did not require him to expend any set amount of time for Debtor, on average he spent 10-15 hours per week working on Debtor's matters, some weeks more, and that there were no weeks where he didn't perform services for Debtor....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-297\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-298\">\n   Ross testified that after Debtor ceased paying him for his services under the Consulting Agreement in November, 2012, he provided services to Debtor and expended substantial time relating to the IRS tax appeal. Ross testified that pre-petition the IRS was asserting a claim against Debtor for in excess of $10 million. Ross testified that he also assisted with the preparation of Debtor's bankruptcy filing (and that he and Karafa provided information to Trustee which assisted him in recovering retainers paid to professionals pre-petition)....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-299\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-300\">\n   Karafa testified that he met with Ross and counsel at Dickinson to review the information required to prepare the bankrutpcy pleadings, and that he had the majority of the information needed to prepare the bankruptcy pleadings. Karafa testified that he worked on gathering the information for the bankruptcy filing. Karafa also testified that Debtor did not immediately file for bankruptcy in November, 2012, because Dickinson advised\n   that it would be best to wait for a final ruling on the IRS issues before moving forward with bankruptcy. Karafa further testified that preparation of the bankruptcy schedules and pleadings was a work in process, not done all at one time, and that he received emails from Dickinson requesting additional information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-301\">\n   As to the actual\n   <em>\n    value\n   </em>\n   of these services to the Debtor, Defendants argued as follows in their post-trial brief:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-302\">\n   Ross testified that ... Defendants' services under the Consulting Agreements resulted in the following tangible benefits to Debtor: (1) recovery of insurance premium refunds in the gross amount of $52,811.55, with a net recovery for Debtor of $22,619.17; (2) no claims were filed in Debtor's bankruptcy case by either the FDIC or the IRS; and (3) [the] State of Michigan withdrew the claims it had filed in Debtor's bankruptcy case based upon Defendants' prepetition efforts. [Footnote 16: The State of Michigan was listed with an unliquidated, disputed claim of over $405,000 in Debtor's Schedule F. See Trustee's Exhibit 14. The State of Michigan filed Claim 10-1 on 6/25/13 in the amount of $434.735.13; Claim 10-2 on 10/4/13 in the amended amount of $582,245.73; Claim 10-3 on 6/16/14 in the amended amount of $212,768.45; Claim 10-4 on 12/17/14 in the amended amount of $21,338.32; and then on 12/19/14 filed a document (Docket No. 94) withdrawing all of its claims.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-303\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-304\">\n   Karafa testified that he provided value to Debtor through his services, including obtaining the insurance premium refunds, ending of service agreements and Debtor's website, elimination of the Michigan business tax claim, and providing information that resulted in the IRS not filing a claim in Debtor's bankruptcy case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-305\">\n   Defendants also established that the services rendered by Defendants were needed by Debtor as, upon advice of counsel, Dickinson, Debtor needed to wrap up certain business matters, including outstanding tax issues, before filing for bankruptcy. Further, the services rendered by Defendants could not have been performed by just anyone. Both Ross and Karafa had significant banking experience and thorough familiarity with Debtor's business, making them uniquely qualified to do the work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-306\">\n   [T]he services provided new value to Debtor, including, but not limited to, the orderly wind down of Debtor's business, recovery of insurance premiums, reduction of operating expenses, and the reduction of claimed tax liabilities. Defendants' efforts resulted in the recovery of funds, resulted in no claim being filed by the IRS, and resulted in claims being withdrawn in the bankruptcy proceeding by the State of Michigan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-307\">\n   The Court finds that Defendants failed to meet their burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, either of the following: (1) that Defendants' services provided any economic value to the Debtor or the bankruptcy estate; and (2) in any event,\n   <em>\n    the amount\n   </em>\n   of any of the alleged economic value to the Debtor or the bankruptcy estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-308\">\n   Furthermore, the Court agrees with Plaintiff's argument that Defendants failed to prove a causal link between any of their\n   pre-petition services and the specific forms of economic benefit that Defendants allege. In this regard, the Court finds that Defendants failed to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that any of their pre-petition services actually caused, or contributed in a material way to causing, any of the following: (1) the Debtor's recovery of the insurance premium refunds ($30,192.38 of which went to the FDIC rather than the Debtor; $22,619.17 of which went to the Debtor); (2) the fact that neither the FDIC nor the IRS filed claims in the Debtor's bankruptcy case; or (3) the fact that the State of Michigan ultimately withdrew the claim it filed in the Debtor's bankruptcy case.
