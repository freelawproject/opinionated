Plaintiff, while lawfully using the sidewalk, caught his foot in a hole in the grating over a celler opening belonging to appellants\u2019 property, and his leg was fractured and broken to such an extent as to cause great bodily pain, and he alleged that he suffered an irreparable injury. Appellee obtained a judgment for $1,000.

When the injury is occasioned by gross negligence the injured party may not only recover for the remote consequences of the wrong, actual damages, but is allowed such punitive or exemplary damages as not only to punish in some degree the wrongdoer, but to have a salutary influence in preventing others from perpetrating similar wrongs.

That instrument does not show any direct evidence as to the pecuniary condition of plaintiff, but it does show evidence as to the number of plaintiff\u2019s children, and that in reply to a question: \u201c To whom does your family look for a support and maintenance?\u201d plaintiff answered: \u201cI have to support them.\u201d It also appears in the statement of facts that this evidence was objected to as irrelevant. We think that this substantially supports the bill of exceptions. Such evidence would convey to the minds of the jurors the idea that the pecuniary circumstances of the plaintiff and his family were such that they were dependent on his earnings for a support. The City of Chicago <em>v. </em>O\u2019Brennan, 65 Ill., 143, cited by appellants, is in point. In a similar action the plaintiff was asked by his counsel to state what family he had, and over objection he was allowed to answer: \u201c I had a wife, seven young daughters and two sons. They were in Ireland at that time, and I was their supporter as a lecturer.\u201d The case, like the present, was one in which only actual damages were recoverable, and the court held the' evidence irrelevant and its admission to be erroneous. They treat it as indirect evidence of plaintiff\u2019s pecuniary circumstances, and ask: \u201c Would appellant\u2019s counsel contend that it was competent for him to give direct evidence of his client\u2019s poverty?\u201d Where the question is one of actual damage, irrelevant evidence calculated to excite the sympathy of the jury should be carefully excluded. We do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>think this case was one for exemplary damages, and, indeed, on the trial it seems that none other than actual damages were claimed. If, as urged by counsel, the mental suffering of the plaintiff might be considered in estimating actual damages, it was only mental suffering on account of Ms own condition, not on account of the condition of others, which might be looked to.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">We think it proper to notice that the statement of facts in this case consists of the stenographer\u2019s report, giving in full every question and answer, and even the remarks of counsel on questions of evidence. The result is that it covers over seventy pages of the record, whereas the facts of the case are few and simple, and might well have been stated in one-tenth of the space. This is in violation of the rules laid down on this subject from the earliest decisions down to the rules of court now in force. Kemper <em>v. </em>Corporation of Victoria, 3 Tex., 140; Wright <em>v. </em>Wright, 6 Tex., 3; Hanks <em>v. </em>Lee, 22 Tex., 544; Rules of District Court, 71 to 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">The statute authorizing the employment of a stenographer to take down the testimony in a cause does not authorize the incorporation of the testimony so taken down into the statement of facts. R. S., arts. 1295, 1296. The facts established by the evidence should he stated, and the testimony of the witnesses should only be inserted where there is a reasonable doubt of the sufficiency of the evidence to constitute proof of a fact. Rules of District Court, 71, 72. The adoption of the stenographer\u2019s report as the statement of facts is an abuse which the district court should not allow, and -which this court will discourage by the use of such means as may be found proper and effectual to that end.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The judgment is reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">BbVERSED ' AND REMANDED.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">[Opinion delivered April 28, 1882.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
