Cities and towns.\u2014 The city council o\u00a3 Brenham, acting under a general law, assumed control of the public schools within its limits by resolution adopted April 26, 1875; having thus assumed control, the city had authority to submit to a vote of the property tax-payers of the city, the question whether or not there should be raised by taxation such an amount, in addition to the amount received from the state, as would be necessary to conduct the public free schools of the city for ten months in the year; such amount not to exeeed one-half of one per cent.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>2. Action \u2014 Same.\u2014 Such an election having been held, the returns canvassed by the city council, and the result declared that the tax had been carried by the requisite two-thirds vote, in the absence of a proper proceeding to contest the election, or to revise the determination of the result thereof, it was not competent to have such result inquired into and the declaration of the result revised, on the suit of a tax-payer, seeking to enjoin the collection of the tax.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b254-5\">3. Taxation.\u2014 The city of Brenham had authority, by virtue of statutory provisions and a vote of its property tax-payers, to levy a tax not to exceed one-half of one per cent, to support its public free schools for ten months in the year; and although the amount levied and raised for that purpose proved to be greater than was required, the discretion of the city council in fixing the amount will not be revised.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b254-7\">4. School houses \u2014Same.\u2014After the city of Brenham assumed control, in pursuance of law, of its public free schools, its public school houses became public buildings in contemplation of law, and the city could impose a tax of one-fourth of one percent. for their erection.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b254-9\">5. City bonds \u2014 Parties.\u2014 The validity of a city tax, legally levied, to pay i nterest on city bonds, which were issued under power conferred by charter, cannot be affected by the fact that the money borrowed on the bonds was misappropriated; nor can the collection of a tax to pay bonds be enjoined, on the ground that the bonds are invalid, unless the bondholders be made parties.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b254-11\">6.

Same.\u2014 Under the city charter of Brenham, when the property owner once inventories and values his property, and the valuation is agreed to by the assessor, it cannot afterwards be disturbed; the action of a tribunal created by the city, and known as the committee on assessments, which sought after such valuation and agreement to change the assessment, was illegal and void.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b254-15\">Appeal from Washington.

The act of April 24, 1874, entitled \u201cAn act to provide for the amendment of town and city charters,\u201d was an attempt by the legislature to delegate the law-making power vested in it by the constitution of the state, and was therefore unconstitutional; and the amendment of the city charter, adopted by the city council, and submitted to and ratified and adopted by the votes of a majority of the qualified electors of said city, at an election held for that purpose, under the provisions of said act, is null and void.

Brenham is a city of less than ten thousand inhabitants, and by the provisions of the constitution, taxation is limited to \u201c one-half of the state tax, except for the payment of debts already incurred, and for the erection of public buildings not to exceed fifty cents on the one hundred dollars in any one year;\u201d and the tax to defray the current expenses of the local government of said city \u201c shall never exceed, for any one year, one-fourth of one per cent.\u201d Taxation beyond these limits, and for other purposes than those mentioned, being expressly prohibited, the action of the city council, in ordering an election to determine whether a tax should be levied for the support of said schools, in declaring the result of said election, and in levying said tax of one-half of one per cent., cannot be sustained under articles 3785-3787 of the Revised Statutes, the same being in direct violation of the provisions of the constitution of the state; and the said action of the city council is therefore null and void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-7\">\u25a0 III. The question submitted at the election of July 27, 1880, was &lt;e whether or not there shall be raised by taxation such an amount, in addition to the school fund received from the state, as may be necessary to conduct the public free schools for ten months in the year, not to exceed one-half of one per cent,\u201d and the city council could not legally levy a greater tax than reasonably appeared to be necessary for that purpose; and it appearing that the tax of one-half of one per cent, was not only greatly in excess of what appeared to be needed, but sufficed to raise more than double the sum required for the scholastic year beginning September 1,1880, or for any previous year, said tax was excessive and void. Cooley on Taxation, 296, 297; Burroughs on Taxation, 376.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-8\">IY. The constitution requires that \u201c taxation shall be equal and uniform,\u201d and the fund for the support of public schools being included in the tax levied for general purposes, no extra or additional tax for that object can be legally levied by counties, cities or towns; and the school tax on city property should not exceed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>paid by tax-payers in the country.

The court erred in deciding that the correctness of the action of the city council, in canvassing the returns, and announcing the result of the election held on the 27th of July, 1880, cannot be inquired into in this suit, and that the action ef said council is conclusive.

The charter of the city of Brenham contains no provision for taxation for the erection of school houses, and the amendment to the charter, enacted by the city council and adopted by a vote of the people, in 1875, is a nullity, and affords no justification for the levy of the tax of one-fourth of one per cent.

The city council had the right under its charter to regulate the manner and mode of making out tax lists or inventories, and the appraisement of property therein, and to create a committee on assessments; and the acts of said committee in raising said assessment were legal and binding.

The plaintiff having failed to appeal to the board of appraisement from the action of the committee on assessments, he is '\u25a0 now estopped to inquire into the action of said committee; and said action cannot be attacked in this collateral proceeding. Cooley on Taxation, 528-9; id., 534, 540; Burroughs on Taxation, p. 238.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b258-4\">Gould, Chief Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AFB\">Most of the questions presented in this case are settled by the decision in the case of The City of Fort Worth <em>v. </em>Davis <em>et al., </em>and our conclusions may be briefly stated as follows: 1st. The city council of Brenham, actingunder \u201c An act to authorize the cities of Texas to maintain public schools,\u201d by resolution adopted April 26, 1875, assumed control of the public schools within its limits. It has not been found necessary to inquire whether the proceeding in September, 1875, to amend the city charter, was valid or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">2d. The city having thus assumed control of its public schools, the council had authority on July 27, 1880, to submit to a vote of the property tax-payers of said city, the question whether or not there should be raised by taxation such an amount, in addition to the school fund received from the state, as may be necessary to conduct the public free schools of said city for ten months in the year, not to exceed one-half of one per cent.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">3d. Said election having been duly held, the returns canvassed by the city council, and the result declared to be that said tax had been carried by the requisite two-thirds vote, and no proceeding having been instituted to contest said election, or to have the determination of the result thereof revised, it was not competent to have said result inquired into or said determination revised in this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">4th. The city council, by virtue of this vote of the tax-payers, and of the statutory provisions to that effect, had authority to levy a tax not to exceed one-half of one per cent, for the support of public schools for ten months out of the year, and although the amount levied and raised proves to be greater than was required for that purpose, the discretion of the council in fixing the amount will not be revised.</p>\n<p id=\"AH5\">5th. The city having assumed control of its public schools, public school houses within the city became public buildings within the meaning of the law, and a tax of one-fourth of one per cent, for the erection of such school houses was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">6th. It appears from the agreed statement of facts and the ordinance set out therein, that the city of Brenham, under its charter, had authority to borrow money for general purposes, and did so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>borrow, by selling its bonds, to the amount of $15,000. The validity of a tax levied to pay the interest on said bonds is not affected by the subsequent appropriation of the money borrowed to an alleged unauthorized purpose. Nor is it competent to enjoin the collection of said tax, on the ground of the invalidity of the bonds, without making the holders of those bonds parties to the suit. Board <em>v. </em>Texas &amp; Pac. R'y, 46 Tex., 316. So far as it appears from the agreed statement, the tax of one-eighth of one per cent, to pay interest and raise a sinking fund for the payment of said bonds was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">7th. The ordinances of said city creating a board of assessment to examine and revise the lists of property, after the same had been duly rendered to and accepted and entered as satisfactory by the assessor and collector, were without authority and illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The charter creates\" the office of assessor and collector, makes it the duty of all property owners within the corporation to render to said assessor a complete inventory of their property subject to taxation, and plainly indicates that the value of the property inventoried is to be fixed by the property owner and the assessor. Special Laws of 1873, p. 3, art. I; art. X, sec. 1, p. 12; p. 24, art. III, sec. 1; p. 25, art. IV, sec. 1. See, also, City Ordinance 306. \u201c Whenever the party rendering property for assessment and the assessor cannot agree on the valuation of such property,\u201d the valuation is referred to a board-of appraisement, appointed by the council, and composed of three commissioners, who are to be persons not connected with the city government, qualified voters, and the owners of real estate in the city to the value of $3,000. Special Laws of 1873, p. 25. The charter makes the action of this board in appraising property final, but secures to the property owner the right of ' being heard before said board. In pursuance of this plainly marked out system, ordinance 306 of the city required the person rendering an inventory to \u201c affix to each item of property his valuation thereof, and if the same is satisfactory to the assessor and collector, he shall so render the inventory and enter said valuation upon the assessment roll; but if said valuation is not satisfactory, he shall value the property and set his valuation in a column opposite the other, and refer both to the board of appraisement, who shall make a valuation thereof.\u201d In June, 1879, however, an intermediate tribunal, styled the \u201ccommittee on assessments,\u201d was organized under an.y ordinance of the council, whose duty it was made, after published notice of their time of meeting, to revise the list of the property of each person, \u201c and to fix the fair market value of the property on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>the list.\u201d The ordinance provides that the assessor shall enter on his rolls the valuation of property by this committee, and thereafter Z&gt; gives the property owner dissatisfied with this valuation a right of \"appeal to the board of appraisement. Appellant Dwyer inventoried and appraised his property in due form at $44,600, and that valuati on was agreed to and received by the assessor. \u25a0 Afterwards the committee of assessments, composed of two of the city council, without the actual knowledge of Dwyer, increased the valuation of his property to the aggregate sum of $74,120.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">It is claimed that the power of the council was sufficient to the creation of this committee, and reference is made to several sections of the charter, viz.: One empowering the council \u201c to provide by ordinance for the assessing and collecting of the taxes aforesaid,\u201d etc. Special Laws of 1873, pp. 22-3. Another authorizing them to \u201c make all such rules and regulations,, and ordain and pass all ordinances as they may deem necessary to the levying, imposing, assessing and collecting of.any of the taxes herein provided.\u201d Laws of 1873, p. 24. Another authorizing them \u201cto regulate the manner and mode of making out tax lists or inventories, and the appraisement of property therein,\u201d etc.; \u201c to fix the duties and define the powers of the assessor and collector, and adopt such measures as they may deem advisable to secure the assessment of all property within the limits of said city and collect the tax thereupon.\u201d These powers must be construed so as to be consistent with the system of assessment and appraisement marked out in the charter. The obvious design of the charter is that where the owner inventories and values his property, and that valuation is agreed to by the assessor, it shall not afterwards be disturbed. The creation of a committee Ao revise the valuation thus agreed to is wholly irreconcilable with the positive directions of the charter, conferring the power of revision on the board of appraisement, and upon them only, in case the party rendering the property and the assessor cannot agree on the valuation. Even the board \u2022 of appraisement would have no jurisdiction to raise the valuation, except in case of disagreement. Like the board of equalization acting under the laws in force in 1876. the board of -appraisement- had no general authority to change valuations. I. &amp; G. N. R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Smith, 54 Tex., 1-12. See opinion of attorney general and circular from comptroller\u2019s office, copied in the opinion of the court in that case. See, also, Burroughs on Taxation, p. 374, citing Placerville <em>v. </em>Wilcox, 35 Cal., 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Our opinion is that the action of the committee of assessments was illegal and void. The proper valuation of appellant\u2019s property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>was that affixed by him' and accepted and agreed to by the assessor. The increased valuation of his property by the committee of assessments, amounting to $29,520, and the taxes assessed and collected of him on that sum, were illegal. The judgment will be reversed, and, in accordance with the agreement of the parties, judgment will be here rendered in favor of the plaintiff Dwyer and against defendant Hackworth and his sureties on his refunding bond for the amount of taxes so yvrongfully assessed and collected, with interest from July 9, 1881, at eight per cent, per annum, and for all costs of suit in this court and in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Reversed and rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">[Opinion delivered June 9, 1882.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
