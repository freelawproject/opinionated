Wherefore and by reason of all which, it was prayed that a decree should be rendered forfeiting the charter of the defendant company, and relieving the state of Texas from all obligations- to grant any lands to the said defendant company for any portion of its road save and except that for which lands had already been granted and received by the 'defendant; and also that a decree be rendered releasing the state from any further obligation to exempt defendant from taxation, and enjoining defendant, its successors, officers, etc., from exercising or enjoying any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises or immunities granted in the said charter or the acts amendatory thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-8\">Which defendant, by its second amended original answer, in lieu of all former pleadings, denied generally and specially, alleging that the act of the 10th of March, 1875, which modified its original charter, and under the terms and provisions of which it has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>since acted, was intended to substitute, according to the supreme power and grace of the state, terms less onerous to defendant and preferred by the state to those contained in its original charter, and Avas of a highly remedial character, and should receive the liberal and favorable construction of the court, if in anywise necessary for defendant\u2019s protection; alleging, also, a full compliance on its part with the terms of said act of March 10, 1875, and a non-compliance therewith on the part of the state on all that portion of defendant\u2019s road lying west of the city of Austin; that it is now entitled, to land certificates from Austin to Laredo, a distance of two hundred and forty miles, and to exemption from taxation on that portion of its road and property in like manner as it is entitled from Longview to Rockdale and Austin, and to all the rights and privileges granted, by its original charter and the said amendment, and that the same are \u201c contracts protected against violation by the constitution and laws of the state of Texas and by the constitution of the United States; \u201d that this suit was brought without ground in law or equity therefor, and before the expiration of the time granted defendant within which to build and complete said railroad and perform all the terms of its charter and the amendment thereto,concluding with a prayer for the dismissal of the suit for the want of any equity therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-5\">This cause Avas tried by the court without the intervention of a jury, and the conclusions of fact and of law applicable thereto Avere found separately by the court, and it was decreed by the court that the defendant company had and by said judgment should forfeit its right to the land grant under the act of the 10th of March, 1875, as to all of its road not completed at the date of the filing of this suit on the 4th of May, 1880, that is to say, from Austin to Laredo, and from a point to which it Avas completed a few miles north of Longview to Jefferson, and that as to these two sections of its Toad said company was not entitled to said land grant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-6\">That as to all other matters in the state\u2019s petition complained of, and all other relief therein asked, the prayer of petitioner be denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-7\">To Avhich judgment of the court the attorney general, on behalf of the state, excepted, gave notice of appeal, assigned errors, and has brought the cause here for revision.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-8\">Statement of the Facts and Points of Law Found bt Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-9\">The evidence on the trial is given below.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-10\">1. \u201c An act to incorporate the International Eailroad Company and to provide for the aid of the state of Texas in constructing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>same,\u201d approved August 5, 1870.

Hardeman, inspector appointed by the governor, showed that since the filing of this suit the defendant company has constructed the road from Austin to San Antonio (eighty miles), thence to Laredo (one hundred and fifty-four miles); total about two hundred and thirty-three miles. \u25a0 The report shows that the road is well built, furnished, etc., in accordance, as to work, etc., with its charter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-11\">18. The executive officers of the state have refused to issue land certificates for the road completed beyond Austin; and, on the ap-; pointment of Hardeman to inspect, it was known that such inspec-' tion was not to be considered a basis for claiming certificates. <em>\u00a1</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-12\">19. The distance from Jefferson to Longview is about sixty miles, thence to Rockdale two hundred, thence to Austin about sixty-one miles, thence to San Antonio eighty miles, thence to Laredo about one hundred and fifty-four. Of the route from Longview to Laredo about three hundred and fifty miles constituted the contemplated road to be built March 10, 1875, when the land grant was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-13\">There being no dispute as to the facts, it devolves upon the court to ascertain the law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-14\">The \u201c Act for the relief of the International Railroad Company,\u201d etc., approved March 10,1875, expressly repeals \u201c all other laws and parts of laws inconsistent with \u201d it. No question, therefore, of im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>plied repeal arises to control the full effect of every part of this compromise act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-5\">The land grant of twenty sections per mile for the road between Jefferson and Laredo is substituted instead of the bonds granted in the original charter. Total and complete exemption from taxation extending to the lands granted for twenty-five years is given instead of for five years. The character of road to be constructed is defined by reference to the general railroad laws. The lands are to be sold within fifteen and twenty years, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-6\">Section 4 of the act of March 10, 1875, is as follows: \u201cThat if said company shall fail to complete the construction of said railroad from the city of Jefferson to the terminus of said railroad on the Rio Grande at the rate of at least forty miles each year, or of eighty miles every two years, counting from the' 1st day of July, 1875, they shall forfeit all rights to the lands by this act granted upon that portion of said railroad which they shall thus fail to construct.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-7\">This fourth section of the relief act works material changes in the original charter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-8\">1.

In altering the rate of construction per year to forty miles, or eighty miles every two years, between Jefferson and Laredo.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-10\">3. A penalty is fixed upon the failure to construct at the <em>new </em>rate, of forfeiture of all right to lands, granted by the relief act, upon that part of the road not so constructed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-11\">The thirteenth section of the original act is superseded as to the northern terminus, and in the rate of construction, and in the character of road to be constructed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-12\">The fifteenth section, so far as it refers to the thirteenth for the time within which the railroad shall be completed, is altered, and inasmuch as another penalty is imposed upon the failure to construct upon the new rate, such new penalty is incurred upon the breach of the conditions imposing it. The new penalty and conditions are inconsistent with the original; the original are therefore not, in effect, repealed by the express terms of the relief law. The court therefore holds:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-13\">1. The failure to construct the forty miles of completed road from Palm\u2019s Valley, near Round Rock, within one year, or eighty miles within two years, from July 1, 1876, is a cause of forfeiture <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>of certain rights of the defendant company existing at the filing of this suit. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-4\">2. That the question has been decided by the executive officers, so far as to determine their own action, in view of\" the fact that such action does not bind future or incoming officials, does not present a reason why the state should not have the same or like judicial action upon it. Eor does it matter that pending the suit the value of the rights in controversy have become but nominal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-5\">3. The extent of the forfeiture must be determined by the statute. In it it is declared that the owners of the franchise \u201c shall forfeit all right to the land by this act granted upon that portion of said railroad which they thus fail to construct.\u201d The court cannot do otherwise than declare this result as applying to the facts in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-6\">4. Eor is this' loss in any part or to any extent regained by the speedy construction of the road, as shown by the pleading and evidence, after suit was brought to enforce the forfeiture.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-7\">5. The exemption from taxation is expressly granted in the first section of the act of March 10, 1875.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-8\">The original rate of construction in thirteenth section of the act of August 5, 1870, being superseded by the rate of forty miles in one year, or by eighty miles in two years, the penalty affixed in section 15 of the original charter, based upon the repealed rate of construction, no longer remains in force.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-9\">Eor can the penalty in the fifteenth section attach to a failure to build upon the new or substituted rate, for to that failure a definite penalty is affixed in the act of March 10, 1875, which penalty has been fully suffered, since the forfeiture of the land grant upon the road not constructed upon the new rate is declared against the defendant company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-10\">This exemption could not be allowed unless, as here, it is expressly \u25a0and clearly given. It is conceded that the grant of exemption should be strictly construed. But finding it .clearly given, and nothing to defeat it, it must be recognized.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b548-11\">6. Eor is there anything in the charter as amended taking from the company the right to construct the railway between the points (Jefferson and Laredo) upon the mere failure to construct \u25a0 at the rate prescribed as a condition of receiving the land grant. The purpose of the subsidy (both bonds and lands) was \u201cto promote the rapid construction of the said railway,\u201d etc. The time for the entire work under the computation in the amended charter has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>elapsed. The route not built upon March 10,1875, was about three hundred and fifty miles between Jefferson and Laredo. At the rate of forty miles each year, -ss5\u00fc\u00b0-=8 years were regarded as the proper time in which to build the entire road. This extends to July 1, 1883. The road has been further advanced toward completion than the rate of construction in the law requires. Only about fifty miles of the route remains unbuilt. There can be no complaint at this time of non-user of the franchise. But none is alleged in the petition merely as such.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-6\">7. The state will not be without remedy for non-user should the defendant company fail to construct the road upon the remaining fifty miles such as the charter requires and within a reasonable time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-7\">8. The charter, original and as amended, treats the franchise as susceptible of limitation to that part of the route upon which the road shall be completed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-8\">9. Even if a different rule as to exemption from taxation could apply to the lands granted, the holders not being before the court their rights cannot be determined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-9\">10. The grant of lands for the line from Rockdale to Palm Valley was saved by the ordinance of the constitutional convention. The legislature adjourned August 21st; the section of the road was completed by July 15,1876.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-10\">11. The land grant for the twenty-one miles from Palm Valley to Austin is within the terms of the law. The road was built by December 28, 1876, and within one year after July 1, 1876.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b549-11\">The law authorized the issuance of certificates upon completion of sections of ten miles.

The court erred in its conclusion of law that no question of implied repeal arises to control the full effect of every part of the compromise act for the relief of the International Kailroad Company, approved March 10, 1875. A later statute repeals a former by implication, when the one is inconsistent with the other, and this principle is in no way changed when the repealing clause of the later statute expressly mentions \u201c such parts of the charter as are inconsistent with this act,\u201d as is done by section 8 of the compromise act.

From its very language, section 8 of chapter 49 of Special Laws of 1875 (the compromise act of the 10th of March, 1875) only repeals such parts of the (International charter) act of August 5, 1870, as are \u201c inconsistent with the provisions \u201d of the compromise act, and this it would have done whether it contained a clause to that effect or not, and <em>\u201c </em>the question of implied repeal \u201d does arise, and must be considered.

To repeal a statute by implication there must be such a positive repugnancy between the new law and the old that they cannot stand together, or be consistently reconciled. There should be a manifest and total repugnancy in the provisions of the new law to lead to the conclusion that the later law abrogated or was designed to abrogate the former. Pacific R. R.

The court erred in its conclusion of law that inasmuch as another penalty is imposed by the said compromise act upon the failure to construct upon the new rate, such new penalty only is incurred upon the breach of the conditions imposing it; and that the new penalty and conditions being inconsistent with the original, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>the original are no longer in effect, but were repealed by the express terms of the relief act. Where, as in this case, the two penalties are for different defaults, and can both be enforced without the one interfering with the other, there is no inconsistency between them, and both stand in force.

The court erred in its third conclusion of law, in so far as it declared no other result as applying to the facts in this case than a forfeiture of the land granted by the compromise act upon that portion of the railroad which the owners of the franchise failed to construct in accordance with the requirements of said act. The facts having shown that a forfeiture of the land grant had inured under the fourth section of the compromise act <em>a fortiori, </em>had a forfeiture accrued of <em>\u201c </em>all further rights and privileges under the \u2022 charter,\u201d the time for construction allowed in the first case being much longer than in the second.

As deduced from -the briefs and argument of counsel, the two principal questions presented for our decision are:</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\"><em>First. </em>Whether the act for the relief of the consolidated International &amp; Great Northern Railroad Company, approved March 10, 1875 (2d sess. 14th Leg., 69), ivas so far inconsistent with the original act incorporating the International Railroad Company, passed August 5, 1870 (called session, 12th Leg., 104), as to operate as a repeal of the same to the extent that it prescribes a new and different condition as ground for declaration of forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\"><em>Second. </em>If so, then what was the effect of a failure, under section 4 of the act last passed, to build forty miles of road each year, or eighty miles every two years <em>% </em>Did it forfeit the charter of the company, or simply the land grant ? And if the latter, then was it forfeited for that portion only of said v road which it thus failed to construct, or for the whole extent of the road not then completed ?</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">I. As to the repeal of the original act by the subsequent relief or compromise act, as it is generally called.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>This last named act provides, in express terms, that it repeals so much of the original act as is inconsistent with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Section 13 of the original charter is as follows: \u201c Said company shall commence work upon its railroad within six months after the passage of this act, and shall complete at least fifty (50) miles of said main trunk within eighteen months after the passage of this act, and annually thereafter seventy-five miles, or one hundred and fifty miles every two years, on all said lines east of San Antonio, and west of that point to the Rio Grande river forty miles annually, or shall complete the same 'within four years after reaching said city of San Antonio from the east. The railroad of said company shall be thoroughly and substantially built, and fully equal to the standard of first class railroads in the United States. Its iron rails shall be of weight not less than fifty pounds to the lineal yard, of approved pattern and good quality. It shall provide a good and sufficient amount of rolling stock for the prompt and efficient operation of its road, and shall establish depots and stations at such places as shall be conducive to the interests of the people and to the proper transaction of the business of the company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Section 4 of the relief act reads: \u201cThat if said company shall fail to complete the construction of said railroad from the city of Jefferson to the terminus of said railroad on the Bio Grande at the rate of at least forty miles each year, or of eighty miles every two years, counting from the 1st day of July, 1875, they shall forfeit all right to the lands by this act granted upon that portion of said road which they fail thus to construct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">. Section 15 of the original charter is as follows: \u201c Any failure on the part of said company tos complete its railroad within the time as stated in this charter, shall work a forfeiture of all further rights and privileges under the same, provided that such failure on the part of said company be not caused by domestic violence, epidemics, floods, or other acts of God. In case the company chartered in this act shall at any time fail to construct the length of railroad as hereinbefore specified, then the governor is authorized to contract with any other corporation or company for the continued construction thereof, under the terms of this charter, for such part of said railroad as may not have been completed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">The authorities are numerous that constructive repeals, or repeals by implication, are not to be favored; but even in such cases it is the general rule, that a subsequent statute, which as to a certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>subject matter of a previous one creates a new, entire and independent system respecting this subject matter, will be held to repeal by implication, without express words to that effect, so much of the prior statute as is inconsistent therewith. Stirman <em>v. </em>The State, 21 Tex., 736, and authorities cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">But when, as in the present case, express words of repeal, so far as the two statutes are inconsistent, are contained in the subsequent statute, then there is no room for construction, <em>save as to the qioestion of conflict; </em>and in so far as the two statutes do materially conflict, the latter must prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">The inconsistencies between the two acts are shown in the findings of the court below. Also by the brief of counsel for appellee, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">1. In the western terminus of the road. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">The charter, section 2, requires the company to build \u201cto. the Bio Grande at some point' at or near Laredo, as the company may select as affording the best facilities for a continuation of the road to the city of Mexico, and thence to the Pacific Ocean at or near San Bias or Mazatlan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">The relief act required the western terminus to be fixed within one mile of the court-house at Laredo.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">2. In the line of location.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">The charter required the road to be built via the cities of Austin and San Antonio only.

In the time for completion.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-14\">The charter required seventy-five miles- each year, or one hundred and fifty miles every two years, to be completed after the first eighteen months from date of the charter, to San Antonio; and forty miles annually on from San Antonio west, or to complete it between San Antonio and Laredo within four years.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-15\">The relief, or compromise act, \u201c at the rate of at least forty miles each year, or eighty miles every two years,' counting from the 1st of July, 1875.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-16\">4.

In the character of the road to be built.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The charter required it to be thoroughly and substantially built, and \u201c fully equal to the standard of first class roads in the United States.\u201d The compromise act required it to be built \u201c in a substantial manner and in accordance with the requirements of general railroad law of the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">6. <em>In the penalty for failu/re in the time of </em>building, the charter provided that a \u201c failure to complete the road within the time therein stated should forfeit all further rights and privileges under the charter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">It further provides: Section 15. \u201c In case the company chartered in this act shall at any time fail to construct the length of railroad as hereinbefore specified, then the governor is authorized to contract with any other corporation or company for the continued construction thereof, under the terms of the charter, for such part of said railroad as may not have been completed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">The amended act contains no authority for construction otherwise than by the company, and takes away the \u201c terms of the charter,\u201d which also provides that if the company \u201cfail to complete the construction of said road from the city of Jefferson to its terminus on the Eio Grande, at the rate of at least forty miles each year, or of eighty miles every two years, counting from the 1st of July, 1875, they shall forfeit all right to the lands by this act granted, upon that portion of said railroad which they thus fail to construct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">It is a well known fact that this relief act was one of compromise. This is fully indicated by the preamble, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-10\">\u201c Wiiebeas, On the 5th day of August, A. D. 1870, the legislature of the state of Texas passed an act, entitled \u2018An act to incorporate the International Railroad Company, and to provide for the aid of the state of Texas in constructing the same; \u2019 and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-11\">\u201cWiiebeas, By the 9th section of said act, it is claimed the state of Texas obligated itself to donate and grant to the said company the bonds of the state of Texas to the extent and amount of ten thousand dollars per mile for each mile of railroad constructed under said charter; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-12\">\u201cWhereas, The said railroad company has already constructed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>about two hundred miles of railroad, in accordance with the provisions of its charter; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-5\">w i' if # \u00edi if \u00ed? vi w *ir</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-6\">\u201c Whereas, Questions have arisen between the state of Texas and said company as to the legal liability of the state to deliver said bonds to said company; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">\u201cWhereas, It is important both to the state and said company that these questions should be definitely settled by a just and reasonable compromise, therefore for that purpose; \u201d therefore, be it enacted, etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">The terms and provisions of this act were subsequently accepted by the company. This legislative proceeding and its acceptance therefore partake more of the nature of a contract between the state and the company than a mere <em>ex parte </em>legislative act; in fact, by section <em>7 </em>of the act its binding force was made to depend upon this acceptance; in which event, it was declared to be an irrepealable contract between the state and the company. Hence, wherein they may differ, the rules which govern the construction of contracts should apply, rather than those which govern the construction of statutes. The end to be obtained, however, is the same\u2014to ascertain, if possible, the true intention of the parties. One of these rules is, that acts of compromise, in which mutual concessions are made, should receive a liberal construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">Under the original act the road was required to be built with much more than ordinary rapidity, and as an essential aid to this, the state had obligated to issue bonds to the amount of $10,000- to the mile. These were considered more salable and valuable in the market than the land certificates substituted therefor by the relief act; \u2022 otherwise the people would not have demanded nor the legislature have passed the act of substitution. This benefit having been given to the state, the corresponding benefit was given to the company to build a less number of miles within a given period.\u2014it being required to build only forty miles each year, or eighty miles every two years, by the relief act, whereas, by the original act, it was required to build annually seventy-five miles, or one hundred and fifty every two years. It is not reasonable to suppose that the legislature would have arbitrarily deprived the company of very material aid promised in the original act, and that, too, after the company, on the faith of it, had built two hundred miles of its road, and which aid, doubtless, was one of the main inducements to enter upon the construction, and still hold the company to the strict letter of the original contract as to the rapidity with which the road should be built. Neither is it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>reasonable to suppose that the state intended to say to the company, that you shall have a certain donation o\u00ed land, and which shall be paid for every completed section of ten miles, if you will build forty miles of road each year; and yet when the company has done this, then not only to forfeit this promised aid already earned, but also the very corporate existence of the company itself, because it had not built seventy-five instead of forty miles of road. Certainly such double forfeiture could not have been intended; and if only one of the two forfeitures could be demanded, it must be that, contained in the compromise act, .and which in express terms repealed the original so far as they were inconsistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">The law does not favor forfeitures. The wise policy of Texas has ever been to foster and encourage railroad companies, and it is \u2022not her true policy, any more than that of the law generally, to forfeit their charters for a mere technical failure to comply with \u25a0the letter, when the spirit of these charters have been complied with. Although they should be held to a reasonably strict accountability to carry out faithfully the purposes and objects of their creation, yet, unless it clearly appears that they have forfeited their charters, the courts should give that construction to the law which would keep alive, rather than that which would kill. A learned text-writer deduces from the authorities the following general rule on this subject: \u201c The non-performance of the conditions of the act of \u25a0incorporation is deemed <em>per se </em>a misuser sufficient to forfeit the grant on proceedings by information, and in determining whether such a departure from the-provisions of the act of incorporation has been made as to w'ork a forfeiture, the same general principles of construction are applicable which govern valuable grants to individuals upon conditions subsequent or precedent.. In all such cases a substantial performance of the conditions according to the intent of the charter is all that is required, and slight departures are overlooked.\u201d High on Ex. Leg. Bern., \u00a7 651.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">We are of the opinion that section 4 of the compromise act repealed section 13 of the original act, and was substituted therefor, so far as they pertained to the time within which the road should be built. That under the law as it now stands, it was not intended that the failure of the company to build at least forty miles of road every year, or eighty miles every two years, should work a forfeiture of its charter, but of the land grant only. Whether, under section 15 of the original act, the company would not forfeit its charter in the event it should fail to construct its entire line of road within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>the whole time allowed by the compromise act, is not now before us, and no opinion is intended to be intimated upon this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">II. The second question is presented by the following cross assignment of errors by appellee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">\u201c The court erred in adjudging as forfeited the defendant\u2019s right to lands granted under the act of the 10th of March, 1875, on such of its road as was not completed at the time of filing this suit, say from Austin .to Laredo, and from a point north of Longview to Jefferson. Because the proof showed, and the court found, that the time has not yet expired within which the defendant had-the right to build only eighty miles every two years. And that the road is now completed from Austin to Laredo, and the proof did not show that the state. had sustained loss or damage by the failure to construct any part of its road from the 1st of January, 1877, to January, 1880. And because the proof did show that defendant constructed its road from Austin to Laredo, a distance of two hundred and thirty-four miles, between the 1st of January, 1880, and the 15th of December, 1881.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">The proposition contained in this assigned error is by no means free from doubt, and we admit that, after a careful consideration of it, we are not clear that the conclusion reached is the proper one. The statute is ambiguous, and would admit both the construction placed upon it by the court below and that by counsel for appellee. To enter upon a discussion of the question would extend this already too lengthy opinion. In view, however, of the fact that it is but reasonable to presume the legislature intended that the road should be built continuously, so as to give, as soon as practicable, its benefits along the whole line; and the further fact that the court below has adjudged that the failure to build as much as eighty miles of road within any two consecutive years would forfeit the land grant upon all the line of road not then built, and that it does not clearly appear that this judgment is erroneous, we hold that this assigned error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">This disposes of the two principal questions in the case, and virtually all the assigned errors, except perhaps the seventh, which is that \u201c the court erred in its eleventh conclusion of law, in holding that the land grant from Palm Valley to Austin-is within the terms of the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">An ordinance to the constitutional convention of 1875 provided that, <em>\u201c </em>Be it ordained by the people of Texas in convention assembled, that in view of the financial misfortunes now existing, no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>railroad company chartered or holding grants under this state, which has heretofore organized and commenced work in good faith, shall be considered as having lost any of its rights, privileges or grants prior to the close of the session of the next legislature of this state, by virtue of the lapse of time between now and that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">The next succeeding legislature adjourned August 21, 1876.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">In this eleventh conclusion of law complained of, the court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">\u201cThe land grant for the twenty-one miles from Palm Talley to Austin is within the terms of the law. The road was built by December 28, 1876, and within one year after July 1, 1876. The law authorized the issuance of certificates upon completion of sections of ten miles. The forfeiture for not completing the forty miles would not destroy the right to the land upon that part upon which the road had been constructed within the terms of the law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">We are of opinion that, under the law and facts of the case, this finding was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">There being no error apparent in the judgment below, the same is affirmed.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-10\">[Opinion delivered June 2, 1882.]</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">Note.\u2014This case should have appeared with cases decided at the Austin Term, biit the record was mislaid.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
