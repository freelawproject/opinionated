In their complaint, Prairie Central and Penn Central ask this Court to approve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>their continued operation of the line in dispute. We dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Section 201(a) of the Rail Act created the United States Railway Association (USRA), a government corporation responsible for preparing a Final System Plan (FSP) to restructure certain railroads in reorganization. including the Penn Central, into a financially self-sustaining rail service system. Under the FSP, which became effective on April 1, 1976, the portion of USRA Line No. 609 connecting Decatur and Paris, Illinois, including the three-mile segment of line between Decatur Junction and Decatur at issue in this suit, was mentioned as being available for public subsidy under \u00a7 304 of the Act. These three miles are owned by Illinois Central Gulf, with trackage rights granted to Penn Central under a 1928 joint facilities agreement, partially amended and superseded by a contract entered into between Illinois Central Gulf and the trustees of Penn Central on April 1, 1976. The modified agreement recognized the obligation of the trustees to permit Penn Central\u2019s rights between Decatur Junction and Decatur to be used by an operator designated by the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT), and it authorized the trustees to allow ConRail, or any other operator that the State of Illinois might designate, to use the three-mile segment in serving Line 609. The agreement provided that the trustees could not allow other railroads to use the facilities, that the contract could be terminated upon one year\u2019s notice, and that the trustees could not assign Penn Central\u2019s interest under the agreement without the written consent of Illinois Central Gulf.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Beginning in April 1976, Penn Central leased the line to IDOT, which first designated ConRail and later Wabash Valley Railroad to conduct rail freight services from Paris to Decatur. In March 1981, the State of Illinois discontinued its subsidy payments, and Wabash Valley ceased operations. One month later, Illinois Central Gulf gave Penn Central one year\u2019s notice that it would terminate the trackage rights over the last three miles of the line. Subsequently, Penn Central leased the entire line to Prairie Central, which has conducted freight services from Paris to Decatur since July 9, 1981. Penn Central did not seek Illinois Central Gulf\u2019s written consent to the assignment of the three miles of track-age rights, nor did IDOT designate Prairie Central as operator of the line. On April 22, 1982, one day after Illinois Central Gulf terminated Penn Central\u2019s trackage rights, the Interstate Commerce Commission granted Prairie Central a certificate of its status as designated operator along Line No. 609, including Penn Central\u2019s \u201crights over [Illinois Central Gulf] tracks\u201d between Decatur Junction and Decatur.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">In March 1982, Penn Central and Prairie Central brought this action to prevent Illinois Central Gulf from terminating Prairie Central\u2019s operation over the track and facilities between Decatur Junction and Decatur. The plaintiffs argue that the termination is contrary to the policy of \u00a7\u00a7 304(c) and (d) to preserve service over lines not conveyed to ConRail, and they ask this Court to approve their operation of the line, to enjoin Illinois Central Gulf from interfering with the operations of Prairie Central or the trackage rights of Penn Central, and to award \u201csuch damages caused the Plaintiffs by the unlawful conduct of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">The plaintiffs contend that Prairie Central, as an offeror of a rail service continuation payment under section 304(c) and as a designated operator under section 304(d) of the Act, has the right to operate over the entirety of USRA Line No. 609 as described in the Final System Plan, including th\u00e1t portion of the line between Decatur Junction and Decatur owned by Illinois Central Gulf, as long as Prairie Central continues to pay subsidies to itself. Section 304 of the Rail Act governs abandonment or discontinuance of services on rail properties of reorganized railroads. These properties are defined under \u00a7 102 to include \u201cassets or rights owned, leased, or otherwise con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>trolled by a railroad\u201d in reorganization. Section 304(c)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provides that such properties may not be abandoned, and that service may not be discontinued if a \u201cfinancially responsible person (including a government entity)\u201d offers a subsidy designed to offset losses incurred in continuing the service. Section 304(d)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the Act governs who may provide the services to be sustained by continuation subsidies, and when a \u201cdesignated operator\u201d may decline to participate in providing these services.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-16\">Although the question the plaintiffs ask us to examine requires an interpretation and application of a provision of the Rail Act, our reading of the provisions of the Act conferring jurisdiction convinces us that the present action is not properly before this Court. Section 209(e)(1) does not confer exclusive jurisdiction over every suit requiring an interpretation of the Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>The statutory language on its face is clear that there must be a challenge to Association action or inaction, or to a provision of the Act. No designation or conveyance of property under \u00a7 206(c) or USRA action or inaction authorized by the Act is involved in this case. And the plaintiffs do not challenge the Act, but are bringing suit under it. Nor do we find that the action falls within \u00a7 209(e)(2),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a provision which, as the legislative history reveals, applies only to \u201cdisputes concerning the meaning and implementation of [the special court\u2019s] conveyance orders\u201d. S.Rep. No. 781, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. at 187. This is not a suit \u201cto interpret, alter, amend, modify or implement any of the orders entered by such court pursuant to section 303(b) of this Act in order to effect the purposes of this Act or the goals of the final system plan.\u201d Rather than dealing with an order entered by this Court to implement the FSP, any claims Prairie Central and Penn Central might have derive from the provisions of the Act relating to properties not designated in the FSP. As the FSP makes clear, we have entered no order with respect to USRA Line No. 609:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-4\">This portion of the Peoria Secondary Track is <em>not </em>designated for transfer to Consolidated Rail Corp. and is \u00e1vailable for subsidy pursuant to section 304 of the Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-10\">It is recommended that this line be considered for inclusion in a fossil fuel rail bank. Public officials also have recommended that certain rail rights-of-way be used for other public purposes if rail service is discontinued.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">II FSP at 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-12\">Reliance on \u00a7 209(b) is similarly misplaced. That provision states, in relevant part, that \u201c[t]he special court shall have the power to order the conveyance of rail properties of railroads leased, operated, or controlled by a railroad in reorganization in the region.\u201d Although the three-mile line between Decatur Junction and Decatur was operated by Penn Central, \u201ca railroad in reorganization in the region\u201d, we conclude that \u00a7 209(b) does not authorize this Court to issue orders for the conveyance of rail properties operated by the bankrupts when ever such orders might appear to be called for in other provisions of the Act. The intent of Congress was that we be empowered to issue orders for conveyance under the FSP. As the Senate Report states, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>\u201c[t]hese powers [granted by \u00a7 209(b)] enable the special court to effectuate the transfers or conveyances <em>mandated in section 303(b)\u201d </em>(emphasis added). S.Rep. No. 601, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. at 29, U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1973, pp. 3242, 3270.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The dispute between Penn Central and Prairie Central on the one hand, and Illinois Central Gulf on the other, does not involve or affect any of the \u201ccentral functions\u201d of this Court. As we observed in <em>Consolidated Rail Corp. v. State of Illinois, </em>423 F.Supp. 941, 948 (Sp.Ct.R.R.R.A.1976): \u201cIt is not every challenge relating to the Act that Congress brought within our exclusive province but only those where the critical nature of the determination demands the consistent interpretation possible only when review is concentrated in a single court .... Congressional concern focused on providing for exclusive jurisdiction where the Special Court\u2019s central functions under the Rail Act were concerned while narrowing the exclusive jurisdiction to oust problems which could be effectively dealt with by other courts.\u201d The conclusion that we do not have jurisdiction to hear this action is supported by the fact that when \u00a7 304 was enacted in 1976, Congress adopted a special jurisdictional grant, \u00a7 304(d)(3),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> providing that the district courts enforce it. We have held that we are not a district court within this provision. <em>Schuler v. Patton, </em>416 F.Supp. 1252, 1257 (Sp.Ct.R.R.R.A. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">Accordingly, judgment will be entered dismissing the complaint for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b469-16\">.
