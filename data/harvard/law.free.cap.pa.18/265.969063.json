Rut if the deed executed by Mrs. Wetherill in 1840, passed this estate, it was a conveyance to other uses and other persons. In that case, the judgment <em>quod partitio fiat </em>is erroneous, for the parties <em>do not hold together. </em>There are, therefore, two questions to be considered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-13\">1. Whether the deed of 1834 created a power in Mrs. Wetherill to dispose of the estate conveyed, which in equity she could execute without the intervention and concurrence of the trustee ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-14\">2. Whether the deed executed by Mrs. Wetherill in 1840, was in point of fact.an execution of that power?</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b268-15\">On the first question: The power given in the deed of 1834, is in form a power to the trustee to sell the land at the request of Mrs. Wetherill, and to appropriate the <em>proceeds </em>according to her direction. This, it is submitted, is in equity a power in Mrs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Wetherill to appropriate the <em>land itself. </em>It is a doctrine of equity which seems to be well settled in the English courts, that a power over a fund directed to be raised, extends to the object from which it is to be created: 17 <em>Ves. Jr. </em>101, Pearson <em>v. </em>Lane; 17 <em>Ves. B. </em>471; 5 <em>Ves. Jr. </em>445; 6 <em>Id. </em>793 ; 2 <em>Vern. </em>80; 2 <em>Ball &amp; B. </em>28; 1 <em>Sug. on Pow. </em>538; 3 <em>Whart. </em>62; 3 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>223; 7 <em>Barr </em>287, Willing <em>v. </em>Peters; 1 <em>Harris </em>292, Costen\u2019s Appeal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-7\">The remainders to the children vested subject to being divested by the execution of the power; 4 <em>Cruise </em>16\u00cd.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-8\">As to the second question: If Mrs. Wetherill could in equity execute the power over the proceeds by a disposition of the land itself, the deed of 1840 was an equitable execution of the power which passed the \u00e9state. In determining whether a power has been exercised, the <em>intention </em>governs: 1 <em>Sug. on Pow. </em>373; 8 <em>Ves. Jr. </em>616; 13 <em>Id. </em>415; 1 <em>Rawle </em>247; 7 <em>Barr </em>530. The deed of Mrs. Wetherill was made for settling and assuring <em>all the estate mentioned in it; </em>and then all the estate'she is <em>interested in or entitled to </em>under the will of her husband, <em>and otherwise hpwsoever. </em>She professed to act in virtue of <em>all </em>her estates, interests, and powers. The intention to execute the power reserved to her by the .deed of 1834 was sufficiently apparent: 1 <em>Sug. on Pow. </em>375-7-9; Id., 386 ; 1 <em>Sim. </em>&amp; <em>Stu. </em>477. There is no other subject than that of the trusts of the deed of 1834, to which the words \u201cpower,\u201d and <em>otherwise howsoever, </em>can so well apply.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b269-9\"><em>Ludlow </em>for defendant in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUC\">The power contained in the deed of 1884, was not exercised by virtue of the legal or equitable operation of the deed of 1840, because there is in it no reference to the power, either express or implied. There is no <em>express </em>reference; and if there be an implied reference, it is by the construction of the word <em>powers, </em>in the deed of 1840. It has been held that a will cannot operate as an execution of a power, unless it refer to the power or the subject of it, or unless the will can have <em>no </em>operation \u2022without supposing an execution of the power: 6 <em>Rep. </em>17, Clere\u2019s ease; 1 <em>Sim. </em>28; 1 <em>Swanst. </em>66., Jones <em>v. </em>Curry; 7 <em>Man. &amp; Gr. </em>1047; 13 <em>Sim. </em>523. But Mrs. Wetherill had by the will of her husband a power to dispose of the property referred to in that will.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-10\">To give effect to the expression, <em>otherwise howsoever, </em>it may be observed, that Mrs. Wetherill, at the execution of the deed in 1840, was entitled in remainder <em>to other property </em>than that devised to her by her husband. See the case stated. Thus these words may be satisfied without reference to the deed of 1834: 6 <em>Bro. P. C. </em>193.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b269-11\">If a will does not refer to a pourer or the subject of it, and if the words of the will may be satisfied without supposing an intention to execute the power, then, unless the intention to execute the power is <em>clearly expressed, </em>it is no execution of it: 3 <em>John Ch. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>551; 1 <em>Story </em>420 ; 4 <em>Russ. </em>76; 3 <em>Sim. </em>275; 5 <em>Id. </em>108 ; 2 <em>Nev. Man. </em>821; 2 <em>Bing. </em>497; 4 <em>Barn. &amp; Cress. </em>720.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-7\">A discretionary power of sale existed in Wikoff, and he was never applied to by Mrs. Wetherill to sell.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b270-8\">The principle contended for that a power to appoint the money produced by the sale of an estate, is a power to appoint the estate itself (2 <em>Ves. I. </em>589; 1 <em>Ves. &amp; B. </em>477), appears to have been overruled in the case of Wood\u2019s estate: 1 <em>Barr </em>368.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b270-9\"><em>Or. W. Biddle, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3c5\">The deed of 1840 should not be confined in its operation to the execution of the powers created <em>by the will, </em>when it professes to be a conveyance of <em>all </em>her estate, and when made in pursuance \"of <em>all </em>her powers. It was not simply discretionary in the trustee to convey. If the power is one which it is the duty of the party to execute on request, he is a bare trustee, and has no discretion whether to exercise it or not. A Court of Equity may coerce him: 8 <em>Ves. </em>574; 2 <em>Sug. on Pow. </em>174; <em>Id. </em>177.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AQQ\">April 12,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b270-10\">The opinion of the Court was delivered, by</p>\n<author id=\"b270-11\">Lewis, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AnW\">\u2014The case of Birdsall <em>v. </em>Richards, just decided, was determined upon the principle that where <em>the settlor </em>has a qualified fee, and a power of appointment appendant to the estate, he may, at his election, pass the estate by an instrument which operates by the interest and not by the power. Ip. that case the interest remained with the holder of the power, and the residuary clause was held to pass that interest- without special reference to the power. In the case now before us, according to our construction of the deed of 15th October, 1834, Martha Wetherill had no interest in the remainder in fee, which is the subject of controversy in this action. In regard to that estate her power is not appendant, because the execution does not \u201c fall -within the compass of her estate,\u201d which was but for life. It is simply a power in gross, because the execution \u201cfalls out of the compass of her estate.\u201d If this view of the nature of her estate and authority be correct, she could do no act to divest the qualified fee of her children, except in pursuance of the power. In the execution of a power in gross, no terms, however comprehensive, although sufficient to pass every species of property, freehold or copyhold, real or personal, will execute a power, unless they demonstrate that the power was in contemplation, and that there was an intention to execute it: 2 <em>Bing. </em>497, 504.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-12\">By the deed of 1834, the whole <em>legal </em>estate is vested in George Harrison Wikoff in fee, and the <em>equitable </em>interest in Martha Wetherill for life, the remainder in fee to her children. The power to sell was vested in Wikoff, in whom the legal estate resides, and not in Mrs. Wetherill. It was lawful for him to sell \u201c at her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>request\u201d and \u201cwith her consent,\u201d but her wishes were not imperative. The proceeds were to be received by him, and, if paid out under her direction, the purchasers are declared to be free from liability for a \u201cnon-application or a misapplication.\u201d To construe this power as vesting the fee in her, would be to divest the estate conveyed to the children by a previous -clause in the deed, and to invert the rule for the construction of deeds, in cases of repugnancy; which is to give effect to the first clause, and not to the last. But an instrument ought to receive that construction which places its several provisions in harmony with each other, if the language will fairly admit of it. The whole deed must be taken into consideration, and not detached portions. Where there was an intention to vest an <em>interest </em>in Mrs. Wetherill, the deed contains apt words for the purpose, and expressly directs the proceeds to be paid <em>into her hands \u201cfor her own separate use\u201d </em>or into the hands of such agents as she shall appoint by writing under \u201c <em>her own hand.\u201d </em>This was the language used in creating her life estate. But no such words are used in directing the appropriation of the proceeds arising from the sale of the whole estate. There, the language used is indicative of an intention to grant nothing more than a power to exercise her judgment in the distribution of the proceeds, after sale, among the parties who were entitled to the property before. The provision which was designed to relieve the purchasers from liability for a <em>non-application </em>or a <em>misapplication </em>would be absurd, if applied to a payment made to the party entitled as owner, or under her direction. Other suggestions might be presented to show that there w7as no intention, in the creation of the power of sale, to divest the estate of the children, or to increase that granted to the mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Having then but a naked power, so far as regards the particular estate in controversy, can her conveyance of the 12th February, 1840, operate upon that estate ? Three classes of cases have been held to be sufficient demonstrations of an intention to execute a power: \u2014 1st. Where there has been some reference to the <em>power </em>in the instrument of execution. 2d. Where there has been a reference to the <em>property </em>which was the subject on which it -was to be executed. 3d. Where the instrument of execution would have no operation whatever, except as an execution of the power. These cases have been determined upon the application of these <em>rules </em>of <em>intention. </em>Lord Chief Justice Best, in reference to this question, remarked, in Roake <em>v. </em>Derire, 4 <em>Bligh N. S. </em>22, that \u201c rules with respect to <em>evidence </em>of <em>intention, </em>are bad rules, and he trusted he should live to see them no longer binding on the judges.\u201d But even according to these rules of intention, there is nothing in the deed of 1840 which evinces an intention to execute the power. It cannot be said that this deed would he inoperative, except as an execution of the power, because <em>the will </em>of her husband gave both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>an estate and a power coupled with an interest upon which tho deed may operate. She ha.d also a life estate under the deed of 1834, upon which it operated, and both these estates are referred to in the deed of 1840, the one by a reference to the estate acquired under the will, and the other by reference to her interests \u201c otherwise\u201d acquired. The words in the preliminary part of the deed, in which she proposes to act \u201cby virtue of her estates, interests, and powers,\u201d <em>may </em>be construed to refer to the estates which were her own, and to the powers coupled with an interest which she held under the will, and not to the estate of her children ; and these words <em>must </em>be so construed, when taken in connection with the granting clauses of the deed, which are clearly and expressly confined to her own estates and interests, and do not purport to pass the vested estates of others. There is no reference to the estate of the children, or to the particular property in dispute; and we have already seen that there is no reference to the instrument creating the power.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">But the rule of construction in these cases, which involves all others, is, that the intention to execute the power must be so clearly manifested in the act of execution, that it is impossible to impute any other: Andrews <em>v. </em>Emmott, 2 <em>Brown\u2019s Ch. Rep. </em>297; Nowell <em>v. </em>Roake, 2 <em>Bingh. </em>497. And we do not see how it is possible to impute to Mrs. Wetherill an intention to disturb a settlement made in favor of her children, by herself and her husband, and which, by the terms of that settlement, was not to be disturbed, except by Wikoff, the trustee, upon her request. If the intention was to execute the power, her course was to make the request, in pursuance of the terms and restrictions under which it was created. To construe the deed of Mrs. Wetherill of 1840, which purported to act upon <em>her own estates alone, </em>as amounting to a request obligatory upon the conscience of Wikoff, to hold that he ought to have sold by reason of such a constructive request, and to make this structure the foundation for the presumption that he has sold, and has thus parted with the legal estate and divested the equitable interests of the children, would be utterly indefensible, and contrary to the clearly expressed intention of the parties to the deeds of 1834 and 1840.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">The judgment of the Court below was correct, and is to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
