There was an agreement endorsed, by which Clay agreed to make no demand for the balance of the note for a year from the date thereof, viz., August 26, 1840, and a memorandum signed by <em>Oaldwell, </em>that the note was to bear interest from that date.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-13\">Defendants plead non assumpsit and payment with leave.

Caldwell died during the pendency of the suit, and it was tried against Cottrell alone.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-14\">From March, 1838, till February, 1839, Caldwell &amp; Cottrell were partners in carrying on \u201cMatilda Furnace,\u201d in Mifflin county. In October, 1838, Caldwell was in partnership with Clay in section 8 on the Gettysburg Railroad. In the fall of 1838, the supervisor of that road paid to <em>Oaldwell </em>$8000 on the joint contract. The one-half of this belonged to Clay, and Caldwell gave to Clay the note in suit, signed Caldwell &amp; Cottrell, for $4000, Clay\u2019s half of the amount received by Caldwell from the supervisor. Cottrell was not present at the time. In August, 1840, Clay and Caldwell had a settlement relative to their railroad contract, by which settlement $2322163 was due by Clay to Caldwell, and that amount was then credited on the note for $4000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-15\">It did not appear distinctly <em>when </em>the note was transferred to Pollard; but it was stated by the Court, that it would appear from the endorsements on the note and the proof in the cause, that it was transferred to him after it was due.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-16\">It was testified that Clay, in the fall of 1838, said that he had received no part of the $8000; that Caldwell had received it to pay his private debts; that he still held the note, and expected Caldwell to pay it out of the first estimate on their work on the Gettysburg road; that that was their understanding at the time the note was given. This conversation took place shortly after the $8000 had been received by Caldwell.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number><em>B. </em>Smith, <em>on part of-defendant, </em>testified that he was appointed by Caldwell &amp; Clay, to receive and distribute money coming to them after the suspension of the work on the railroad, and that he received and distributed between eighteen and nineteen thousand dollars.

The bills awere rendered by Caldwell on 28th December, 1838, and their amount was credited to Caldwell by Evans the clerk. The bills for the store goods were dated from the 24th to 29th October, 1838.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-8\">The partnership in the furnace between Caldwell &amp; Cottrell, was dissolved on 20th February, 1839. On that day Cottrell paid Caldwell aboVe $2000 in notes of the Bank of Middletown, which Evans testified that he and Rogers, who paid the furnace hands and other people on the same and next day, supposed to be the same money which was paid by Cottrell to Caldwell.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-9\">Evans also testified, that about two months <em>after </em>the dissolution between Caldwell &amp; Cottrell, he heard Cottrell say, that Caldwell had given the firm note to Olay to the amount of $4000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-10\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel offered to prove the same thing by Rogers.

The note being given by James Caldwell, in the name of \u201c Caldwell &amp; Cottrell,\u201d for his own <em>private </em>debt, <em>not </em>in the ordinary course of business, and without the knowledge or consent of Cottrell, as John Clay, the payee, well knew, Cottrell would not be liable in law or equity: 2 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>152; 4 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>397; <em>Collier on Partnership </em>279, 80, 81; 4 <em>Johns.

Every contract in the name of the firm, in \"order to bind the partnership, must not only be within the scope of the business of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>partnership, but it must be made with a party who has no knowledge or notice that the partner is acting in violation of his obligations and duties to the firm, or in fraud of the firm. Clay had such <em>knowledge </em>at the time of accepting said note. It was a fraud upon Cottrell, and nothing but his subsequent <em>assent </em>and <em>approbation </em>could give it vitality as against him. <em>Story on Partnership </em>208, top page, section 128, 2d <em>ed.; </em>3 <em>Hill R. </em>279; <em>Story on Agency </em>125, 165; 3 <em>Kent, Lect. </em>43, 4th <em>ed.; Gow on Partnership, </em>pages 42, 49, 56, 3d <em>ed.; Collier </em>261, 2d <em>ed.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b412-6\">There was no evidence to prove that the $4000, or any part of it, went into the firm at Matilda Furnace.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b412-7\"><em>Cooper, </em>for plaintiff, in reply.</attorneys>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AH0\">June 10,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b412-8\">The opinion of the Court was delivered, by</p>\n<author id=\"b412-9\">Woodward, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ayj\">That Clay lent the money to Caldwell, not for the purposes of the firm of Caldwell &amp; Cottrell, but for Caldwell\u2019s own personal use, was a fact fully proved on the trial, and found by the verdict of the jury. A consequence of this fact is, that the use of the firm name in the note was a fraud on Cottrell, and imposed no liability whatever on him: Baird &amp; Cochran <em>v. </em>Dowling, 4 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>398; Noble <em>v. </em>McClintock, 2 <em>W. Sp Ser. </em>155; Heller <em>v. </em>Brights, 4 <em>Harris </em>399; Evergheim <em>v. </em>Ensworth, 7 <em>Wend. </em>326; Rogers <em>v. </em>Batcheler, 12 <em>Peters </em>230.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">But it was attempted to show that the money, whatever the purpose for which it was lent, actually went into the firm of Caldwell &amp; Cottrell, in payment of their hands and in replenishing their store at Matilda Furnace. The Court instructed the jury that even if this were the ease, Cottrell would not <em>be </em>bound unless the money went into the firm with his \u201cknowledge and consent,\u201d and this direction is assigned for error. In Jaques <em>v. </em>Marquand, 6 <em>Cowen\u2019s R. </em>497, it was held that a partner holding money in trust could not subject the firm to an action for the money by applying it to the use of the firm without the knowledge and privity of the other members of the firm; but that the firm would be liable if the money was so applied with their knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-11\">In the case of the Onondaga Bank <em>v. </em>DePuy, 17 <em>Wendell, </em>47, the general doctrine was asserted that all the members of the firm are liable where money is borrowed by one member on the credit of the firm, whether the money be applied to the business of the firm, orbe misappropriated; \u201cbut,\u201d said Bronson, J., \u201cif this had been the individual debt or transaction of DePuy, the judge would have been right in saying that the plaintiffs could not recover without proving the money went into the business of the firm with the knowlege and assent of his copartners.\u201d In Holemes <em>v. </em>Burton, 9 <em>Vermont Rep. </em>252, one of three partners purchased a horse for his individual note, the avails of which horse wont <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>into the partnership, but the firm were held not liable. In Graeff <em>v. </em>Hitchman, 5 <em>Watts </em>454, the money was obtained on the individual credit of one of the partners; but it was held not to become a partnership debt by being applied to partnership purposes. Though the name of the firm was used in the case before us, it was still, in point of law, the individual note of Caldwell. Caldwell and Clay being partners on the Gettysburg Railroad, and Caldwell having drawn $8000 from the superintendent, Clay told the witness, Henry J. Shreiner, \u201cthat he had received no part of this $8000, that it was received by Caldwell; and that he, Caldwell, got it to pay his private debts, and that he had taken a note from Caldwell for the one-half of it, which he still held; and that he expected Caldwell would pay the note out of the final estimate to be made them on the work; that <em>was their understanding at the time the n\u00f3te was given.\u201d </em>The .use of the firm name under such circumstances was a nullity. It was the note of Caldwell for all intents and purposes; and if he brought the money into the firm at Matilda Furnace, the authorities I have cited show that it did not become a firm debt. The Court were right, therefore, in instructing the jury that the knowledge and assent of Cottrell would be necessary to bind him. The only circumstance in proof to affect Cottrell with notice was the credit taken by Caldwell on the books of the firm, five days after the date of the note, for sundry bills of goods, amounting, in the aggregate, to $3761.72. Whilst this entry could not logically or legally be notice to Cottrell of the source from whence Caldwell had derived the funds wherewith to purchase the goods, it was evidence that the firm used the goods as creating a debt to Caldwell and not to Clay. It was in fact an investment of so much capital by Caldwell for which he was <em>entitled </em>to a credit on the firm books; but it raised no obligation, in morals or'law, on the part of Cottrell, to reimburse the creditor who had loaned this capital to his partner: see Greene <em>v. </em>Tanner, 8 <em>Metcalf </em>411; Ostram <em>v. </em>Jacobs, 9 <em>Metcalf 454; </em>Thorn <em>v. </em>Smith, 2 <em>Wendell </em>365.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Clay having no right of action against Cottrell, it follows that Pollard, his endorsee, stands in no better condition; for we are to take it that the note was overdue when transferred to him, and the endorsee of overdue paper takes it subject to all the equities which arise out of it, as between the original- parties: Snyder <em>v. </em>Riley, 6 <em>Barr </em>164; Lancaster Bank <em>v. </em>Woodward, decided at the present term.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">It is unnecessary to discuss the bills of exception to evidence, for they do not affect the conclusions which have been stated, and which are decisive against the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover. It may be added, however, that they have been considered, and no error found in them.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
