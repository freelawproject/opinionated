The furs were carried from Cincinnati to Pittsburgh in the steamboat Defiance, which ran upon a snag, and the furs became wet and were injured. The defendants admitted that they were carriers upon the canals and railroads of Pennsylvania, between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, but they denied that they were carriers on the Ohio river; they alleged that in order to secure freights, they had agents at Cincinnati, and other points on the Ohio river, whose duty it was to receive goods at those points and ship them by the boats running on the Ohio, to D. Leech &amp; Co., at Pittsburgh, who thence carry them in their own boats and cars to Philadelphia. They were not the owners of the steamer Defiance.

That John F. Foster &amp; Co., on the 26th of June, 1845, at Cincinnati, caused to be delivered to the defendants, and the defendants accepted certain packages, &amp;c., to be safely and securely carried by defendants from Cincinnati to New York, and there safely delivered to plaintiffs for a certain reward. Yet the defendants not regarding their duty, but contriving, &amp;c., did not safely carry the same and safely deliver to the plaintiff's ; but, on the contrary, so carelessly and negligently behaved, &amp;c., that by their carelessness, &amp;c., the said packages were injured, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-13\">The second count set forth, that the defendants were carriers from Pittsburgh to New York; that certain Irwin &amp; Foster, on July 27, at Pittsburgh, caused to be delivered to defendants, and defendants received whilst they were common carriers, &amp;c., certain packages, &amp;c., to be by defendants safely carried from Pittsburgh to New York, and there safely delivered to plaintiffs, &amp;c., as in first count.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-14\">The third count alleged that on 27th June, 1845, John F. Foster &amp; Co., at special instance, &amp;c., of defendants, at Philadelphia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>aforesaid, delivered to defendants divers goods, &amp;c., to be carried to New York, to be delivered to plaintiffs, for a certain freight (the dangers of railroads, and canal and river navigation, fire, leakage of merchandise, and unavoidable delay, excepted), and defendants then and there received the same, and it became their duty to take good care of same; yet not regarding their duty, &amp;c., took so little care of said goods and the carriage thereof, that the same, by reason of said improper care, and not by reason of said excepted causes, were greatly injured, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-6\">On the trial, Win. F. Leech was examined on the part of defendants, and testified: \u2014 Furs when sent for carriage are placed in packs, the fur side in, and bound round with cords. They are not put in canvas or cloth of any kind. The inner side of the hide or skin is packed outside, which, in warm weather, is always greasy, and would not retain the water; Leech &amp; Co., at Pittsburgh, could not tell from the outside of the packs that they had been in water; could only have found it out by opening the packs; D. Leech &amp; Co. were not owners of or interested in the steamer Defiance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-7\">Question by defendant\u2019s counsel: Were D. Leech &amp; Co. at any time common carriers on the Ohio river from Cincinnati to Pittsburgh? Question objected to by plaintiffs, and overruled by the judge. Defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-8\">Question: Between what points were D. Leech &amp; Co. carriers ? Also objected to, overruled by Court, and exception by defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-9\">Question: What were the powers of Irwin &amp; Foster, as agents of defendants, and what was the extent of their agency? Objected to by plaintiffs, overruled by the Court, and exception by defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-10\">On the part of <em>the defendants </em>it was contended, on the trial, that the defendants were not carriers <em>on the Ohio </em>river, but were merely such on the state works between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. That they had an agent at Cincinnati, whose duty was to receive goods at that place, and forward them to Pittsburgh, to defendants, to be by them carried to Philadelphia, and forwarded (in this case) to New York. That these goods were in fact carried up the Ohio by the owners of the steamer Defiance, who were, so far, responsible as the carriers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-11\">That, therefore, for an injury done on the river, the defendants were not responsible <em>as common </em>carriers, but only as agents for the plaintiffs for the -shipping of the goods to Pittsburgh, as to which they were hound to use ordinary care in the protection of the goods while in their agent\u2019s hands at Cincinnati, and the selection of a proper boat to take them to Pittsburgh. No damage occurred at Cincinnati, and the boat selected was the one the plaintiff\u2019s consignors had chosen to bring the furs to that point. That damages could not be recovered against the defendants as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>such agents, for want of proper care in the shipment to Pittsburgh, inasmuch as no count averred such a case. That there was no evidence of such want of care, and the burthen of proof was on the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-6\">Again: That if the defendants were to be considered as common carriers on the Ohio river, the stipulation in the Cincinnati bill of lading, <em>that defendants\u2019 responsibility should not commence until the shipping of the plaintiffs\u2019 goods at Pittsburgh, </em>discharged the defendants from all responsibility for the carriage of the goods to that place.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-7\">And again: That the damage to the goods having been caused upon the river, by one of the dangers of the river navigation excepted in the bill of lading, the defendants were not liable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-8\">The case was tried before Rogers, J., who, <em>inter alia, </em>charged the jury as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-9\">\u201c The defendants contend that they are not liable, because it appears on the bill of lading, that the responsibility is to commence only upon the shipment of the goods from Pittsburgh. If that be so, there is an end to the plaintiff\u2019s case, because the injury having been done to the goods between Cincinnati and Pittsburgh, there was no responsibility resting on the defendants, except to select a competent person to carry the goods to Pittsburgh; and, consequently, they were not liable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-10\">\u201c Is it not more reasonable, as plaintiff says, to suppose (as I submit this question to you), that this has arisen from an omission to strike out of the bill of lading the words \u2018 the responsibility of the line to commence upon the shipment of the goods from Pittsburgh?\u2019 You will ask whether the bill of lading was not intended for the meridian of Pittsburgh? \u2018Pittsburgh\u2019 is stricken out, and \u2018 Cincinnati\u2019 inserted; and they have neglected, not intentionally, I am convinced, to strike out the words ruled in the printed form. On this part of the case the burden of proof is on the plaintiffs. They must satisfy you of the mistake in the bill of lading. In that case the defendants would be agents for transmission merely, and, of course, not liable for the misconduct of the captain of the steamboat. If these words do not form part of the contract, the defendants are common carriers, and are liable as such.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-11\">\u201c This part of the case is submitted to you. If you believe the parties intended to limit the responsibility of Leech &amp; Co., so that they should not be answerable until the goods reached Pittsburgh, your verdict will be in favor of the defendants. But if you should be of a different opinion, then you have another point to consider.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-12\">\u201c Did the defendants, or their agents, exercise ordinary care and diligence in preserving the goods committed to their charge ? This is a question for you. I instruct you that when goods and mer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>ehandise (as here), received by a common carrier, to <em>he </em>delivered in good condition, \u2018 the dangers of the river excepted,\u2019 get wet in consequence of accident, and no exertion is made by the carrier to dry them, and they are damaged, in such a case the carrier is liable. He is bound to use at least some exertion to prevent the effects of the injury, as long as it will probably avail anything. And for this purpose he would be right to open the packages in which the furs were contained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-6\">\u201c It cannot be the laAV that when a shipper\u2019s property, in the custody of a common carrier, is injured by inevitable accident, that the carrier is at liberty to abandon it altogether. It is the duty of the carrier to use ordinary exertions to lessen, if not altogether prevent the effects of the accident. Common sense Avould lead us to the conclusion that he should use at least the same care and diligence as if the goods were his own.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-7\">\u201c This is a question of fact for you. Did the defendants or their agents use proper skill and diligence in respect to the goods after the accident ? If they did, your verdict will be in favor of the defendants, because, as was before observed, the accident occurred from the boat running against a snag, Avhich is one of the perils in the navigation of the Ohio. The jury will then observe that they have tAVO points to determine:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-8\">\u201c 1. Was it <em>the </em>intention of the parties in the contract at Cincinnati, that the responsibility of the defendants should not commence until the goods were shipped at Pittsburgh? If so, as I have before remarked, there is an end of this case, and your verdict must be in favor of the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-9\"><em>\u201c </em>2. Was due diligence used and proper care taken of the goods after the 30th of June, 1845, when the accident occurred, by the defendants or their agents? If you are of opinion that proper diligence was used and due care taken of the goods after the accident, your verdict will be in favor of the defendants. In considering this case, you must recollect that the acts and omissions of the agents are the acts and omissions of the principals.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-10\">\u201c But if you should believe that the responsibility of defendants, as common carriers, commenced at Cincinnati, and that proper care AA'as not taken to preserve the goods from damage after the accident, then your verdict Avill be in favor of the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b229-11\">\u201c In that case you will have to assess the damages, about which you can have no difficulty. The measure of damages will be the injury that the goods have <em>sustained; the </em>difference between a sound and unsound or deteriorated article; deducting therefrom the freight from Cincinnati to New York. You may also add interest on the balance from the time of the arrival of the furs at New York, until your verdict is rendered.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b229-12\">Verdict AA\u2019as rendered for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>On the part of Leech &amp;\u00b0Co. it was assigned for error: 1. That the judge charged that the captain of the steamer Defiance was the agent of the defendants, and that they were liable for his acts and omissions as common carriers. 2. In directing the jury to find whether the clause in the Cincinnati bill of lading, \u201c The responsibility of the line to commence upon the shipment of the goods from Pittsburgh,\u201d was inserted by mistake, when there was no evidence of such mistake. 3. In directing the jury to find what was the contract as set out on the bill of lading, and to construe it. 4. In charging that the defendants, as common carriers, were bound to open the bales of furs and dry and repack them. 5. In refusing to permit W. E. Leech to answer the question, viz. \u201cWere D.

Leech, viz. \u201cBetween what points were D. Leech &amp; Co. carriers.\u201d 7.

The Defiance was not owned or controlled by defendants. The defendants carried only from Pittsburgh, and this was known. Their agent at Cincinnati was employed to secure contracts for carriage of goods from Pittsburgh eastward, for the accommodation of owners of goods, and to secure freight; he, in addition, agreed to receive the goods at Cincinnati, and use proper care in shipping them to defendants at Pittsburgh. When he had done this, the defendants\u2019 duty and responsibility were at an end, and the owner must look to the actual carriers, the steamer\u2019s owners, for damages done on board of it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-7\">Defendants, on shipping the goods on the Defiance, took a bill of lading from her captain for delivery of the goods at Pittsburgh, on which suit should have been brought.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-8\">Defendants were plaintiffs\u2019 agents to ship to Pittsburgh. They had a <em>contract </em>with the owners of the steamer, that the latter should carry safely, which was for plaintiffs\u2019 benefit, and is different from employing the steamer as agent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b230-9\">That the clause in bill of lading from Cincinnati, \u201c The responsibility of the line not to commence until the shipment of the goods at Pittsburgh,\u201d was conclusive upon this subject. That it showed that the defendants were not expected to carry up to that point, by themselves or their agents, because in either case the clause would have been absurd. That the other party knew that defendants neither carried themselves, nor were accustomed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>carry by others. Defendants got no reward for carrying on the Ohio. The steamer was the carrier, received the freight, and was responsible.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b231-6\"><em>W. B. Bleed </em>and <em>H. M. Phillips, </em>were for Chouteaux and others.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9a\">The plaintiffs in the suit were the owners and consignees of the packages of furs, which were delivered to the agents of the defendants at Cincinnati, for transportation and delivery to the plaintiffs at New York. The goods were put on board of the steamer Defiance, the packages got wet, and nothing was done towards drying them. They were injured, and the amount of their injury was agreed upon and a verdict rendered for the plaintiffs. It was contended that the defendants were common carriers, and the clause in the bill of lading could apply to no other <em>river </em>than the Ohio.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-7\">As to the 5th, 6th, and 7th assignments, the question as to whether the defendants were common carriers did not depend on the opinion of the witness, but on the construction of the contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-8\">As to the 2d and 3d assignments, there was evidence on which the jury could find that the retention of the word \u201cPittsburgh,\u201d in the bill of lading, was <em>ly mistahe.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b231-9\">As common carriers, the defendants were bound to have had the bales opened and dried, and repacked: 1 <em>Missouri </em>81, Bird <em>v. </em>Cromwell; 3 <em>Id. </em>264; 5 <em>Id. </em>36; 6 <em>Id. </em>372; 2 <em>Bailey\u2019s Rep. </em>157 ; 4 <em>Harrington </em>448, McHenry <em>v. </em>Railroad; <em>Angell on Carriers </em>282; 5 <em>Bing. </em>217; 8 <em>Barr </em>479; 3 <em>Story </em>349.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AjO\">The evidence which the Court in the 5th and 6th assignments of error is complained of for rejecting, was intended to prove that the defendants were not common carriers west of Pittsburgh; in other words, that they were not accustomed to carry goods for hire for all who chose to employ them on the Ohio river. But the evidence was properly rejected, because the right of the plaintiff to recover, &amp;c., depended on the obligation created by the particular contract on which the suit was founded. If they bound themselves on this occasion to the duty of common carriers, it is no defence to say that they had never done so before, or that it was not their direct or principal business: 1 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>285; 7 <em>Yeager </em>340; 4 <em>N. H. </em>304.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-12\">In the 7th specification, it is said the judge erred because he refused to permit the defendants to ask the question, \u201c What were the powers of Irwin &amp; Foster, and what was the extent of their agency?\u201d When an agent is appointed, a contract made with him about the business to which the agency relates is a contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>with the principal, and the validity of the contract is not affected by a limitation of the agent\u2019s authority, of which the other contracting party had'no notice. This would have been.enough to make the exclusion of the proposed evidence perfectly proper. But there was another reason. The defendants did not assert in the <em>Nisi Prim, </em>nor was it any part of their argument here, that' the agents had not authority to do what they did. Now if the acts done by them exposed their principals to the risks of common carriers on the Ohio, the principals cannot, of course, clear themselves from responsibility by showing that though they authorized the act, they did not intend that its legal effects should follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">'The greatest pressure of the defendants\u2019 argument was on the exception to that part of the charge which submits to the jury the question whether the words, \u201cThe responsibility of the line to commence upon the shipment of the goods from Pittsburgh,\u201d were or were not inserted in, or rather left unerased from, the bill of lading by mistake. It is contended that there was no evidence of such mistake. But we think otherwise, for reasons which may be stated very briefly. A mistake like the one alleged here can be proved as any other fact is proved, by circumstantial as well as by positive evidence. There are several facts from which it may be inferred. The printed bill of lading was manifestly intended to be used at Pittsburgh. In order to make it answer for Cincinnati, it was obviously proper to strike out Pittsburgh wherever the word occurred, and insert Cincinnati. It was so altered in the date, and the omission to do so at the other place certainly looks more like an accident than anything else. It is not certain, but it is probable, that the object of having the contested clause in a Pittsburgh bill was to prevent the responsibility of the defendants from commencing when the goods were received at their warehouse, instead of attaching only from the time of their actual shipment. The dangers of the river navigation are excepted, and this by plain construction makes them liable for the other dangers which are not excepted. They received the full freight from Cincinnati to New York, and this is wholly inconsistent with the notion that they were mere agents for the shipment of the furs, and not carriers from Cincinnati to Pittsburgh, as well as on all other parts of the route. Other facts might be mentioned, but these are enough to show that there was some evidence of mistake, and the judge was right in submitting it to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">It is of the utmost importance to the commerce of the country that carriers should be held to strict accountability. Gross wrongs would be practised every day if the laws on this subject were relaxed. Slight evidence ought to be sufficient to set aside any special provision in the bill of lading, which is intended to relieve the carrier from his ordinary legal responsibility. And this not only because public policy requires that carriers should have the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>strongest interest in the performance of their duties, but also on account of the manner in which such stipulations are generally made. Goods are commonly sent by the owner to the carrier\u2019s place of business, where they are received, and the bill of lading made out by the carrier or his clerk. It is often not seen by the owner until it is too late to insist on a change in the terms. It can hardly be called a contract, for a contract requires the assent of both parties.
