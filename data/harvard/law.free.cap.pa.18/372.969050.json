The Court appointed commissioners, who in November, 1851, made report accompanied with a plot or draft of a division line.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-7\">To the report a number of exceptions were filed. Accompanying the exceptions, a number of petitions were filed, praying for the appointment of new commissioners, to review and make report, &amp;c. These petitions were more numerously signed than the original petition, by citizens of Penn township. A number of depositions were also taken; but, after argument, the Court overruled the exceptions and refused to appoint new commissioners; \u201c believing that the Act of Assembly does not authorize them to make such an appointment.\u201d A <em>certiorari </em>was taken, and exceptions were filed, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-8\">1. The commissioners did not view the -line of division as reported by them to the Manheim township line.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-9\">2. The commissioners disregarded the wishes of the majority of the tax-payors and inhabitants of that part of Penn township pro-' posed to be, and reported by the commissioners as proper \u201c to be annexed to Warwick township.\u201d At least three-fourths of the inhabitants aforesaid are opposed to such annexation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-10\">3. The commissioners disregarded the wishes of the citizens of Penn township, and the tax-payers thereof, in making such report of annexation, the majority of whom are opposed to such division of their territory, and to annexation to Warwick township.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-11\">4. If the said report is confirmed, it will deprive the said Penn township of a school-house, and place another in such a position as to be almost, if not wholly, useless.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b373-12\">5. The Court erred in not appointing new commissioners as prayed for, and in holding that they had no power to appoint them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b373-13\"><em>Ford, </em>for exceptants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGz\">The township of Penn, as it remains after the piece annexed to Warwick is taken off, does not correctly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>appear from tbe draft returned.

In short, they may \u201c take such order thereupon as to them shall appear just and reasonable.\u201d But it is left to their discretion to do one or the other, or neither, and of course their action, whatever it may be, cannot be reviewed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">Order affirmed.\u2019</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
