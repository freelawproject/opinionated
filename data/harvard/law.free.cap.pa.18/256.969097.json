It was a bill in equity, filed by Gideon Birdsall, and Palmyra his wife, and others, being of the half-blood to Nathan Dunn, deceased, for an account, &amp;c., of moneys received by the defendants, Richards, Smith, and Brown, as trustees, from the interest of Nathan Dunn in the Laurel Hill Cemetery, on the ground that Nathan Dunn died intestate as to that interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b256-11\">It was stated in the bill, that Nathan Dunn, on the 26th February, 1836, purchased the Mansion House and tract of land called Laurel Hill, and afterwards, by indenture of May 30th, 1839, reciting that his object in purchasing the same was to appropriate it for the purpose of a cemetery; that a charter of incorporation had been granted to the Laurel Hill Cemetery Company, and the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>chase-money and all expenditures connected therewith, had been contributed in equal parts by the said Nathan Dunn, Benjamin W.

It was alleged that the domicil of Nathan Dunn was in Philadelphia, and that he died on the 19th September, 1844.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-8\">The said Nathan Dunn made a will, dated on the 7th March, 1840, whereby he devised the interest, dividends, and income which might proceed from his- one-fourth interest in the Laurel Hill Cemetery, to the trustees of the Chin\u00e9se Collection, to be applied and used by them as directed in the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-9\">It was further provided in the will as follows: \u201c I desire and direct that all the property and estate, real and personal, which I may own or be in any way entitled to, at the time of my decease, shall be considered as fully disposed of by this will, whether it be hereafter acquired or now owned by me. All the rest, residue, and remainder of my estate and effects, real and personal, I give, devise, and bequeath to my executors, in trust, to convert the same into money, and to apply the same in such amounts and proportions, and to such charitable and literary institutions as they, my executors, may select and prefer.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-10\">By a codicil to this will, dated 13th July, 1841, the said Nathan Dunn revoked and made null and void the bequest contained in his will of his Chinese Collection, and all the trusts, directions, &amp;c., growing out of the bequests of the Chinese Collection, and every part thereof.- And in another provision in his said codicil, he provided as follows: <em>\u201c </em>I hereby confirm my said will which <em>bears </em>date the 7th March, 1840, in all respects whatever, except so far as the same is altered and revoked by this codicil. And I do declare this codicil, and such parts of my said will as are not hereby altered and revoked, to be my true and only last will and testament.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-11\">Brown and Collins were appointed executors in the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-12\">Separate answers by the trustees and executors were filed. The receipt by the trustees of moneys from Dunn\u2019s one-fourth interest in the Cemetery was admitted, but it was alleged in their answer that they had been advised that the revocation by the codicil of the bequest of the Chinese Collection did not affect or alter the bequest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>of <em>the residuary estate </em>to the executors, but that such residuary bequest included the testator\u2019s interest in the Cemetery, and that the same passed to the executors upon the trusts therein expressed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-6\">Coulter, J., in the <em>Nisi Prius, </em>declared his opinion to be that the property in question \u00abpassed to the executors by the residuary clause in the will, <em>which will </em>operated and must be construed as it stood at the date of the last codicil; at which time the specific disposition of the property was revoked, and it was governed by the codicil which revived the residuary clause as to this property, and which declared that the will, except the parts revoked by the codicil, shall stand as the will of the testator.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b259-7\"><em>McOall </em>was concerned for complainants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqf5\">It was contended \u2014 \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AdV\">1.

That on such failure of execution, under the deed of trust of 9th March, 1841, his next of kin -of the whole and half blood were equally entitled: <em>Intestate Act of 8th April, </em>1833, <em>sec. 5. </em>As to the <em>first </em>point: As the absolute owner of the estate, Nathan Dunn had the right to settle it as he pleased. By his deed of 9th March, 1841, he conveyed the fee to the trustees, and reserved only a power of appointment to himself; and he could not after-wards exercise any control over it, <em>except throughthe power reserved: </em>9 <em>Ser. $ B. </em>179, Slifer <em>v. </em>Beates.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b259-11\">As to the execution of a power, reference was made to 2 <em>Sug. </em>94; 9 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>181; 4 <em>Kent </em>334-5, and note a; 2 <em>Bro.

The testator declared his will to be, that all the property owned by him at his decease should be disposed of; and he made a residuary devise and bequest of all not expressly given away. When he revoked the bequest of the Chinese Collection, and, by necessary implication that of the Laurel Hill property, he republished the will in terms, and with it, of course, the residuary devise or bequest. That the will speaks <em>from the date of the codicil, </em>and the Laurel Hill property not being expressly disposed of, passed to the executors under the residuary clause: 10 <em>Barn. </em>&amp; <em>Cress. </em>895, Doe <em>v. </em>Marchant ; 6 <em>Man. &amp; Gran. </em>813; 46 <em>Eng.

We are not inclined to disregard the principles established in this case. They were settled upon great consideration, and we do not think that they have been overthrown by the numerous decisions which have since taken place.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">In the case before us, it is plain that the deed from Nathan Dunn of the 9th March, 1841, was but a conveyance in trust for his own use. The proceeds were to be paid over to him quarterly as long as he lived; and if he died intestate, they were to'go to such persons as would be entitled to his personal estate in ease of intestacy; but if he made a will, they were to go to such uses as he by his last will should direct and appoint., This is precisely the estate and control which the law gives to every one in and over his personal estate. Conceding that he had a <em>power </em>as well as an <em>estate, </em>the residuary clause in his will is sufficiently comprehensive to carry the estate, and the will is an election to devise as owner, and not to appoint by virtue of the power. The revocation of the devise of this particular estate, and the republication of the residuary clause in his will, was an indication of his intention that the property in question should fall into the residuary clause. It is no new principle that a man shall be presumed to intend to accomplish all the natural and necessary consequences of his acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">The decree of the Court, of Nisi Prius dismissing the bill is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">Tecree affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
