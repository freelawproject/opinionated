The trial judge stated that \u201cthere was never any acceptance by\u201d the plaintiff. We summarize the evidence most favorable to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">The town of Springfield, Vermont (the town), issued a \u201cContract Document for Furnishing and Laying Water Mains\u201d and called for bids to be opened at 2 p.m. on May 8, 1970. The general specifications in the contract document required that butterfly valves have \u201coperators . . . of the enclosed worm gear type,\u201d but this requirement was omitted from the detailed specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">The defendant, a supplier of materials, on May 4,1970, sent to the plaintiff and twenty-one other possible general contractors a document entitled \u201cQuotation,\u201d referring to \u201cSpringfield Vermont Contract C Water Main\u201d as the \u201cJob Name,\u201d and stating \u201cDelivery: As Required; Terms: Net 30 Days.\u201d The body of the quotation consisted of a list of more than fifty items of materials, one of which was \u201c34 12\" Mechanical Joint Dresser #450 Butterfly Valves With Boxes\u201d at a unit price of $250.75. The list was based on the contract document, and the defendant knew that general contractors relied upon it to refer to materials complying with the specifications. As the defendant knew but the plaintiff did not, the type of valve described in the quotation did not have an \u201cenclosed worm gear operator,\u201d although it could be modified to contain one for about $50 a valve.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">Relying upon the defendant to supply complying materials, the plaintiff submitted a bid including thirty-four twelve-inch butterfly valves at $310 a valve. About two and one-half hours before the bid opening, a representative of the town informed the defendant that its valves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>did not comply with the specifications because they did not contain enclosed worm gears. The plaintiff was awarded the general contract at the bid opening, and thereafter learned for the first time that the valves were noncomplying.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The plaintiff made several phone calls to the defendant for the purpose of accepting the defendant\u2019s bid to supply valves, if acceptable to the town\u2019s engineer, but no oral acceptance took place during these calls. The defendant\u2019s sales manager did not return the calls because the defendant had determined several months before not to solicit business from the plaintiff. In a conversation on the street about a week after the bid opening the plaintiff\u2019s office manager expressed to the defendant\u2019s salesman a desire to buy the valves from the defendant if they were approved by the town\u2019s engineer. The defendant\u2019s salesman knew of the defendant\u2019s policy not to solicit business from the plaintiff but said he did not know why the plaintiff\u2019s calls were not returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">The plaintiff bought conforming valves from another supplier at a higher price, and on June 25, 1970, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney sent the defendant a letter demanding payment of the difference. On September 22, 1970, the defendant wrote to the plaintiff revoking the quotation, \u201cInasmuch as we have received no order or acceptance to date for any item contained in the quotation and the item\u201d of thirty-four valves \u201cwas specifically rejected by your attorney\u2019s letter dated June 25,1970.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">The plaintiff contends that the defendant\u2019s quotation could be found to be an offer to sell complying valves, qualifying as a \u201cfirm offer\u201d under G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-205, and that the plaintiff could be found to have accepted the offer by its course of conduct in trying to reach the defendant\u2019s sales manager and conversing with the defendant\u2019s salesman, citing G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 \u00a7 2-204 (1), 2-206 (1) (a), and 2-207 (3). It also suggests in oral argument that the defendant is bound by estoppel, citing <em>Crane Co. </em>v. <em>Park Constr. Co. Inc. </em>356 Mass. 13, 17. See Restatement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>2d: Contracts (Tent. draft No. 2, April 30, 1965) \u00a7 89 B (2), and illustration 6. Compare <em>Union Tank Car Co. </em>v. <em>Wheat Bros. </em>15 Utah 2d, 101, 104-105.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">We need not pass on these contentions, since we think there was no evidence that any offer, firm or otherwise, was made by the defendant. The defendant\u2019s letter of May 4,1970, was not an offer but a quotation of prices, a request or suggestion that an offer be made to the defendant. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Gowdy, </em>8 Allen, 566, 567. <em>Mellen </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>322 Mass. 236, 238-239, and cases cited. <em>Kuzmeskus </em>v. <em>Pickup Motor Co. Inc. </em>330 Mass. 490, 493. Restatement 2d: Contracts (Tent. draft No. 1, April 13, 1964) \u00a7 25, and comment c. The defendant\u2019s subsequent references to acceptance and rejection of an \u201citem,\u201d although they might help to resolve an ambiguity, could not convert a price circular into a collection of offers.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
