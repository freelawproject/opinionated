L. c. 21, \u00a7\u00a7 26-50, inserted by St. 1966, c. 685, \u00a7 1, as amended through St. 1967, c. 873, enforcing an order of the Division of Water Pollution Control (the division) that the town construct a sewage treatment system in order to abate the pollution of a waterway.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">The Massachusetts Clean Waters Act was enacted in response to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U. S. C. \u00a7\u00a7 1151 et seq. (1970), inserted by 62 Stat. 1155, as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 903. See the Clean Water Restoration Act of 1966, 80 Stat. 1246, and the Water Quality Improvement Act of 1970, 84 Stat. 91. See also Hines, Controlling Industrial Water Pollution: Color the Problem Green, 9 B. C. Ind. &amp; Commercial L. Rev. 553, 569-584, 594-596; Man-aster, The Development of Federal Water Pollution Control: The Present and the Future, 1971 U. of Ill. L. Forum, 36, 38-39. Under the Federal statute, Federal grants are authorized for the construction of municipal treatment works for sewage, if the project has been approved by a State water pollution control agency and is included in a comprehensive program. If the State agrees to pay twenty-five per cent of the costs and if enforceable water quality standards have been established for waters into which the project discharges, the Federal grant may amount to as much as fifty per cent of the estimated reasonable costs of the project. 33 U. S. C. \u00a71158 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">The Massachusetts statute vests in the division the power to prepare and keep current a comprehensive plan for the abatement of water pollution, to adopt water quality standards, and to administer and enforce the laws relative to water pollution control. G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 27. The division was also authorized to approve applications for Federal grants either by water pollution abatement districts created for the purpose or by existing governmental units, and to make available matching grants by the Commonwealth. G. L. c. 21, \u00a7\u00a7 30A, 33; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>St. 1966, c. 687, \u00a7 1, as amended by St. 1967, c. 873, \u00a7 13. The statute contemplates the cooperation of Federal, State and local agencies to a common end.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">The present proceeding was brought pursuant to G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 49 (repealed and replaced by G. L. c. 21, \u00a7\u00a7 44-46, St. 1970, c. 704, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 5) : \u201cThe division may require by order a . .. town . . . maintaining a sewerage system .. . to provide and operate such treatment facilities as are in its opinion necessary to insure adequate treatment prior to discharge to any watercourse. The supreme judicial court or the superior court shall have the jurisdiction in equity to enforce any such order.\u201d The trial judge made findings, rulings and an order for decree, and the evidence is reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">We summarize the findings. The town maintains a sewerage system which discharges raw sewage into the Mumford River thereby reducing the quality of the water below the standards adopted by the division. On July 19, 1968, the division issued an order establishing a schedule for planning and constructing a sewage treatment system. On July 22, 1968, at a meeting of a majority of the board of selectmen, upon motion duly made and seconded, they assented to and signed the order, expressly waiving the public hearing contemplated by G. L. c. 21, \u00a7\u00a7 45, 46. The town did not seek judicial review under G. L. c. 30A, as required by G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 47. On the basis of his findings, the judge ordered a decree enforcing the order of the division. The decree as entered established a new schedule calling for the completion of construction nearly four years after the date set in the consent order.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">1. The town contends that its board of selectmen had no authority to assent to the order of the division or to waive the public hearing contemplated by G. L. c. 21, \u00a7\u00a7 45, 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">The statute provided for \u201cwritten notice to the alleged violator,\u201d who may \u201cappear in person or by his attorney before the director or his duly authorized agent.\u201d In the present case the \u201calleged violator\u201d was the town, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>and the statute does not specify who is to receive notice on behalf of the town. In this situation we think notice is sufficiently given if it is served in the manner provided for the service of process. See G. L. c. 223, \u00a7\u00a7 28, 36, 37. Under G. L. c. 223, \u00a7 37, service in an action against a town is to be made upon \u201cthe treasurer thereof, or if no treasurer is found, upon . . . the town clerk or one of the selectmen,\u201d or, if there are no such officers, \u201cupon one of the inhabitants of the . . . town.\u201d Consent of the selectmen by vote at a meeting was the equivalent of such service. Compare <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Newbury, </em>128 Mass. 321, 325 (notice to one selectman); <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Woburn, </em>130 Mass. 494, 496 (notice to one selectman); <em>Wormwood </em>v. <em>Waltham, </em>144 Mass. 184, 185-186 (notice to city clerk through board of aldermen); <em>Garvey </em>v. <em>Revere, </em>187 Mass. 545, 546 (filing with selectmen when not in session) ; <em>Bauer </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>247 Mass. 522, 526 (service on county commissioners) ; <em>O\u2019Connell </em>v. <em>Cambridge, </em>258 Mass. 203, 204-205 (notice to city solicitor fails where contrary to statutory provision); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>315 Mass. 335, 338 (filing of brief by town counsel); <em>O\u2019Shea </em>v. <em>Holyoke, </em>345 Mass. 175, 178-179 (presentation to the board of aldermen through city clerk) ; <em>Hirshfeld </em>v. <em>District of Columbia, </em>254 F. 2d 774, 775-776 (D. C. Cir.) (notice improperly addressed to city engineering department but still good as actually received by proper city office). The town was therefore properly notified of its right to claim a fair hearing and waived that right. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 10. <em>Brockton Hosp Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>346 Mass. 742, 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">2. All orders of the division were subject to judicial review as provided in G. L. c. 30A. G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 47 (repealed and replaced by G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 46, St. 1970, c. 704, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 5). A petition for review must be filed within thirty days after receipt of notice of the final decision of the division. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (1). Since the town did not seek review within the time allowed, the only issue before the Superior Court was whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>administrative decision was within the agency\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare </em>v. <em>Billerica, </em>350 Mass. 56, 57. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Health </em>v. <em>Board of Health of Tewksbury, </em>350 Mass. 507, 508. The judge was not authorized to hold an evidentiary hearing or to make findings with respect to the fact of pollution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See <em>Duato </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>359 Mass. 635, 639.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">3. There was no showing that the town had authorized anyone to exercise the powers of a board of sewer commissioners under G. L. c. 83, \u00a7 1, as appearing in St. 1964, c. 736, \u00a7 2. The town introduced evidence that the board of selectmen had never been so authorized, and now argues that the board of selectmen therefore had no authority to waive a hearing, that \u201conly the town itself could conceivably be authorized to assent to the order through a town meeting and this was not done.\u201d This contention resembles that rejected in <em>Commonwealth v</em>. <em>Hudson, </em>315 Mass. 335, 343-349, and is equally without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">4. The town claims that G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 49, was invalid as repugnant to the so called home rule amendment, art. 2 of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth, as supplanted in 1966 by art. 89. Section 8 of the amendment authorizes the enactment of \u201cgeneral laws which apply alike to all cities, or to all towns, or to all cities and towns, or to a class of not fewer than two.\u201d In our opinion the Clean Waters Act is such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>general law. See <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>356 Mass. 761, 766-768; <em>Opinions of the Justices, </em>356 Mass. 775, 787-788; <em>Opinion of the Justices, </em>357 Mass. 831, 834-835.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b607-10\"> Nevertheless, we think it appropriate to say that in our opinion the evidence before the judge warranted his finding that the town\u2019s discharge of raw sewage into the Mumford River reduced the quality of the water below the standards adopted by the division. The division\u2019s expert testified that the division had classified the river as Class B, \u201csuitable for bathing and recreational purposes including water contact sports, accessible for public water supply with appropriate treatment, suitable for agricultural and certain industrial cooling, excellent fish and wildlife habitat, and excellent esthetic value.\u201d He also testified that there were twelve individual criteria or limits, that it was a violation to exceed any one limit, and that the town \u201cdefinitely\u201d was still polluting the river at the time he testified, nearly three years after certain tests about which he had testified in detail.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
