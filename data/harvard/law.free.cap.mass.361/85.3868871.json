The defendants asserted that the employee had filed a claim for workmen\u2019s compensation more than six months after the injury and that her action was therefore barred by G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15, as appearing in St. 1943, c. 432. The judge made written findings of fact pursuant to a stipulation that his findings would be final. After verdicts for the plaintiffs had been returned under leave reserved, the judge allowed the defendants\u2019 motion for the entry of verdicts in their favor. The case is here on the plaintiffs\u2019 exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>We summarize the findings. The employee was injured on June 14,1965. On June 21, the workmen\u2019s compensation insurer of her employer, Superior Shoe Company, mailed compensation forms to her. On July 7 her attorney sent the insurer a report of injury and a certificate of dependency status. On July 27 the attorney wrote the insurer that he represented the \u201cemployee in her claim for personal injuries,\u201d and this letter constituted a \u201c[c]laim for compensation.\u201d On August 12 a claims adjuster for the insurer notified her of an appointment for a medical examination on September 7. During August the insurer obtained a statement from a witness to the injury, and the employee was examined by a doctor on behalf of the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">On May 13,1966, about eleven months after the injury, the attorney sent a request for hearing to the Industrial Accident Board, with a copy to the insurer. The board replied noting that the file did not contain a \u201cformal claim for compensation,\u201d and no \u201cformal claim for compensation\u201d was made until a formal claim was executed by the employee on July 18, 1966, and sent to the board on July 21, 1966, with a copy to the insurer. The writ in the present action was issued on April 7, 1967, about one year and ten months after the injury and about eight and one-half months after the filing of the formal claim. The insurer was not prejudiced by want of notice of injury or by failure to file a formal claim within six months. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 41, 44, 49. During 1967 the board held a hearing and filed a decision on the claim for compensation, and some time after November, 1967, the insurer paid workmen\u2019s compensation benefits to the employee and medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The defendants rely on what we said about G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15, as appearing in St. 1943, c. 432,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in <em>Leist\u2019s Case, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>350 Mass. 465, 468: \u201cIf the employee does not make claim or receive compensation under the act within the time fixed by the act, but does make claim or receive compensation thereafter, he is thereby precluded from commencing an action at law against the third party tortfeasor.\u201d They further contend that the letter of the employee\u2019s attorney on July 27, 1965, was insufficient as a \u201cclaim\u201d of compensation, since it did not manifest a binding election to surrender to the insurer the cause of action against the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">1. The plaintiffs argue with some force that the attorney\u2019s letter of July 27, 1965, was a sufficient \u201cclaim\u201d of compensation, made within six months of the injury, to satisfy G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 15, since it adequately informed the insurer of the claim and would have been a sufficient basis for voluntary payment of compensation by the insurer. If such a payment had been made, any failure to give formal notice of claim would have been cured under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 49. <em>Kareske\u2019s Case, </em>250 Mass. 220, 227. The employee would then have been bound by an election to surrender to the insurer the cause of action against the defendants. But we need not decide this question, since we decide for the plaintiffs on a broader ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">2. Section 15 was amended by St. 1939, c. 401, to permit the employee, after claiming compensation under the act within six months after the injury, to proceed to enforce the liability of a third party if the insurer does not. It is no longer accurate to say, as we said in <em>Furlong </em>v. <em>Cronan, </em>305 Mass. 464, 467, that the employee who has elected to claim compensation has \u201cpermanently lost all interest in the cause of action\u201d against the third party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>\u201cexcept the possibility of sharing\u201d in any recovery in excess of compensation paid. We overstated the case when we said in <em>Leist\u2019s Case, </em>350 Mass. 465, 468, that \u201cthe statute preserves the cause of action at law for the sole benefit of the insurer.\u201d The cause of action is now preserved for the benefit of both the employee and the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">The interest of the third party in protection against stale claims is adequately served by the two year statute of limitations for actions in tort. G. L. c. 260, \u00a7 2A. See <em>Broderick\u2019s Case, </em>320 Mass. 149,152-153. The six month limitation in \u00a7 15, like the similar limitation in \u00a7 41, is for the benefit of the insurer, not the third party. The third party has a legitimate interest in not being subjected to two actions for the same cause of action, but no such problem is presented here. If it were, we think it should be raised by motion before trial, not saved by leave reserved for a ruling after trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">3. Our conclusion that the defendants here cannot assert a defence based on \u00a7 15 is fortified by \u00a7 49: \u201c. . . Failure to make a claim within the time fixed by section forty-one shall not bar proceedings under this chapter... if it is found that the insurer was not prejudiced by the delay. ...\u201d We are here concerned with the six months fixed by \u00a7 15 rather than the six months fixed by \u00a7 41, and an action in tort is not \u201cproceedings under . . . [chapter 152],\u201d but it would be anomalous to permit the employee to proceed against the insurer on the basis of a late claim and at the same time to forbid her to proceed against the third party because of the same lateness. Compare <em>Berthiaume\u2019s Case, </em>328 Mass. 186; <em>Leist\u2019s Case, </em>350 Mass. 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">4. At the argument we were informed that the same insurer which provided workmen\u2019s compensation coverage for the employer also provided liability coverage for the defendants. It was suggested that the attorney\u2019s letter of July 27, 1965, might therefore have been ambiguous and might have been read by the insurer as asserting a tort claim rather than a workmen\u2019s compen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>sation claim. The letter stated that the attorney represented the \u201cemployee in her claim\u201d and referred to an accident that occurred \u201cin the parking lot of Superior Shoe Company,\u201d the employer. We fail to see the ambiguity. It may be, however, that the identity of insurers helps to explain the failure of the workmen\u2019s compensation insurer to assert the third party claim. Compare <em>Burke </em>v. <em>Atlantic Research Corp. </em>358 Mass. 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AsM\">\n<em>Judgments for the plaintiffs on the verdicts returned by the jury.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b100-6\"> General Laws c. 152, c. 15, reads in part: \u201cWhere the injury for which compensation is payable was caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in some person other than the insured to pay damages in respect thereof, the employee may at his option proceed either at law against that person to recover damages or against the insurer for compensation under this chapter, but, except as hereinafter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>provided, not against both. If compensation be paid under this chapter, the insurer may enforce, in the name of the employee or in its own name and for its own benefit, the liability of such other person, and if, in any case where the employee has claimed or received compensation within six months of the injury, the insurer does not proceed to enforce such liability within a period of nine months after said injury, the employee may so proceed. In either event the sum recovered shall be for the benefit of the insurer unless such sum is greater than that paid by it to the employee. If the insurer brings the action four fifths of the excess shall be paid to the employee, and if the employee brings the action he shall retain the entire excess.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
