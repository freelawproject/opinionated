On June 20, 1964, Wheatley sustained personal injuries while a passenger in his own car which was being operated with his consent by Peirce. Norfolk learned of the accident upon receipt of an accident report (dated June 26, 1964) from Wheatley\u2019s insurance agent on or about June 30, 1964. Wheatley brought suit against Peirce by writ dated September 1, 1964, and returnable the first Monday of October, 1964. Peirce\u2019s motor vehicle policy issued by Transamerica had a $100,000/$300,000 coverage. Wheatley had similar coverage with Norfolk. Transamerica mailed the summons served on Peirce to Norfolk. In turn, Norfolk mailed the summons back to Transamerica, together with a letter, dated October 16, 1964, stating its position that Wheatley\u2019s Norfolk policy was not valid and collectible insurance as to Peirce; that Norfolk would not enter an appearance in the suit; and that Transamerica might want to enter an appearance in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>order to avoid a default being entered against Peirce. Transamerica defended the action against Peirce and a verdict was returned for Wheatley in the amount of $18,000. After exceptions taken by Peirce were overruled in the Supreme Judicial Court <em>(Wheatley </em>v. <em>Peirce, </em>354 Mass. 573), Transamerica satisfied in full the execution issued against Peirce for $22,693.23 and also paid $2,453.67 for legal services.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Norfolk raises three contentions on appeal: first, that the named insured, Wheatley, may not recover from his own insurer; second, that its coverage is not primary in reference to Transamerica\u2019s coverage;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and third, that Peirce did not comply with \u201cnotice\u201d requirements of its policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">1. Norfolk relies on <em>McBey </em>v. <em>Hartford Acc. &amp; Indem. Co. </em>292 Mass. 105, and <em>Oliveria </em>v. <em>Preferred Acc. Ins. Co. </em>312 Mass. 426, to support its contention that there can be no recovery against it by Wheatley, its named insured. In these cases, however, this court was construing the language of coverage A (compulsory motor vehicle insurance) rather than the language of coverage B (noncom<em>pulsory </em>insurance) involved in the instant case. <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The language of coverage A follows the statutory language of the Massachusetts compulsory liability insurance statute. G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A. \u201cIn [the] <em>MacBey . . . </em>[easel we held after careful consideration that a motor vehicle liability policy as defined in . . . [this statute] did not cover liability for bodily injuries suffered by the named assured himself through the operation of the vehicle by another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>with the named assured\u2019s consent. We there pointed out that this statute disclosed an intent to draw a sharp line of distinction between the assured himself on the one hand and \u2018others\u2019 to whom damages are to be paid on the other hand. The assured himself does not belong to the class of the \u2018others\u2019 against whose claims the company has agreed to provide protection.\u201d <em>Oliverio, </em>v. <em>Preferred Acc. Ins. Co., supra, </em>at p. 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">In our view, the words \u201cby any person\u201d in coverage B indicate an intention on the part of the insurer to provide broader coverage than is available under the more restrictive words \u201cto others\u201d in coverage A. This construction is in accordance both with the plain and ordinary meaning of the words and with authority in other jurisdictions. <em>Bachman </em>v. <em>Independence Indem. Co. </em>214 Cal. 529 (construing words, \u201cto any person or persons\u201d). <em>Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Waugh, </em>159 Maine, 115 (construing words, \u201cby any person\u201d). See <em>Chicago Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>American So. Ins. Co. </em>115 Ga. App. 799, 800-802 (policy covering \u201c \u2018bodily injury,\u2019 sustained by any person\u201d ), and cases cited therein. Compare <em>Frye </em>v. <em>Theige, </em>253 Wis. 596 (construing policy with exclusionary clause, \u201cThis policy does not apply ... to bodily injury to . . . any person who is a named insured\u201d). Furthermore, in contrast to the language of coverage A, the language of coverage B is not required by statute but was selected by the insurer itself. It is well established that, where an insurer drafts the policy, the language is strictly construed and all ambiguities are resolved against the insurer. <em>Edward Rose Co. </em>v. <em>Globe &amp; Rutgers Fire Ins. Co. </em>262 Mass. 469, 473. <em>Lustenberger </em>v. <em>Boston Cas. Co. </em>300 Mass. 130, 134-135. <em>Schroeder </em>v. <em>Federal Ins. Co. </em>343 Mass. 472, 475. This rule of construction, combined with \u201cthe fact that if coverage in such [a] case were not intended, the insurer could have readily so declared by the addition of an express exclusion in the policy to that effect,\u201d confirms our conclusion that \u201cby any person\u201d includes the insured. Couch, Insurance (2d ed.) \u00a7 45:483. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number><em>Iowa Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Meckna, </em>180 Neb. 516, 525. See <em>Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Waugh, </em>159 Maine, 115, 119-120.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">2. The trial judge ruled correctly that Norfolk\u2019s coverage was primary while Transamerica\u2019s was for excess only. We adopt the rule of the majority of jurisdictions. Where, as in the instant case, the driver does not own the vehicle he was driving in the accident, the coverage on the car is primary while the coverage of the driver is excess as between two automobile insurers whose policies contain identical \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>American Auto. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Republic Indem. Co. </em>52 Cal. 2d 507, 511-513. <em>Chicago Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>American So. Ins. Co. </em>115 Ga. App. 799, 802-803. <em>Schweisthal </em>v. <em>Standard Mut. Ins. Co. </em>48 Ill. App. 2d 226, 230-231. <em>Maryland Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>American Family Ins. Group, </em>199 Kans. 373, 384-385. <em>Zurich Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co. </em>239 Md. 421, 427-429. <em>Fidelity &amp; Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Western Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>337 S. W. 2d 566, 574-577 (Mo. App.).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Couch, Insurance (2d ed.) \u00a7 62:81. Norfolk\u2019s reliance on <em>Beattie </em>v. <em>American Auto. Ins. Co. </em>338 Mass. 526, for a contrary view is misplaced. The Transamerica policy issued to Peirce in the present case provides that <em>\u201cthe insurance with respect to </em>temporary substitute motor vehicles as defined in Condition 5 or <em>other motor vehicles under Insuring Agreement IV shall be excess insurance over any other valid and collectible </em>insurance\u201d (emphasis added). Since Peirce had permission to operate Wheatley\u2019s car, the car <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>was a covered motor vehicle under Insuring Agreement IV,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the excess insurance provision applies. In the <em>Beattie </em>case, <em>supra, </em>at 530, however, there was no applicable contractual provision in either policy \u201cmaking any relevant coverage under one policy \u2018excess\u2019 to any coverage under the other.\u201d While it is true the policies in the <em>Beattie </em>case contained \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses such as the one involved here (see p. 528, n. 2), the excess insurance provision in neither clause applied because the vehicle in the case, a truck leased by the named insured and regularly used in his business, was neither a \u201ctemporary substitute motor vehicle\u201d nor a motor vehicle covered under Insuring Agreement IV (pp. 528, 530).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">3. We deal last with the judge\u2019s rulings on the \u201cnotice\u201d issue. Wheatley\u2019s insurance policy required that notice of an accident be given <em>\u201cby or for the insured </em>as soon as practicable\u201d and that <em>\u201che [the insured] </em>. . . forward to the company every . . . summons . . . received by him\u201d (emphasis supplied). The court was correct in its ruling that there was proper notice in the circumstances of the instant case <em>(Western Freight Assn. </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>255 F. Supp. 858, 861-862, affd. 371 F. 2d 541 [3d Cir.]; <em>Simmon </em>v. <em>Iowa Mut. Cas. Co. </em>3 Ill. 2d 318, 321-322; <em>Monguso </em>v. <em>Pietrucha, </em>87 N. J. Super. 492, 496; <em>Helvy </em>v. <em>Inland Mut. Ins. Co. </em>148 W. Va. 51, 60-61) <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and also in its ruling that the forwarding of the summons by Transamerica to Norfolk sufficiently met the requirements of Norfolk\u2019s policy <em>(Lee </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co. </em>184 Atl. 2d 636, 638-639 [D. C. Mun. Ct. App.]; see <em>Ameri</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number><em>can Fire &amp; Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Collura, </em>163 So. 2d 784, 787-788 [Fla.]). Transamerica\u2019s <em>action in </em>forwarding the summons, in any event, did not prejudice Norfolk\u2019s ability to defend against Wheatley\u2019s suit (Couch, Insurance [2d ed.l \u00a7 51:120) nor did Norfolk raise this issue in its letter to Transamerica as a ground relieving it of liability (see Couch, Insurance [2d ed.] \u00a7 71:43; Annotation, 18 A. L. R. 2d 443, 492-494). There was no error in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b160-6\"> Norfolk\u2019s coverage of $100,000 was more than ample to cover the loss and therefore Transamerica\u2019s coverage, which was ruled to be \u201cexcess\u201d coverage, was not needed to satisfy the execution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b160-7\"> Coverage A in both policies provides: \u201c[I]ndemnity for or protection to the insured and any person responsible for the operation of the insured\u2019s motor vehicle . . . against loss by reason of the liability to pay damages <em>to others </em>for bodily injuries\u201d (emphasis added). Coverage B, in contrast, provides: \u201cThe company will pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury .. . <em>sustained by any person </em>caused by accident and arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the motor vehicle\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b162-5\"> The policies of both Norfolk and Transamerica contain the following \u201cother insurance\u201d clause: \u201cIf the insured has other insurance against a loss covered by this policy the company shall not be liable under this policy for a greater proportion of such loss than the applicable limit of liability stated in the declarations bears to the total applicable limit of liability of all valid and collectible insurance against such loss; provided, however, the insurance with respect to temporary substitute motor vehicles as defined in Condition 5 or other motor vehicles under Insuring Agreement IV shall be excess insurance over any other valid and collectible insurance.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b162-6\"> One jurisdiction, perhaps the only one, which does not give effect to an excess insurance clause over another insurance clause is Oregon. <em>Lamb-Weston, Inc. </em>v. <em>Oregon Auto.
