The declaration was in four counts. Two counts were against Produce and two counts were against Boston Market Terminal Company (Boston). During the course of the trial the plaintiff discontinued his action against Boston. We are here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>concerned with two counts against Produce of an amended declaration. One count essentially alleges that the plaintiff\u2019s fall was on an \u201cartificial and unnatural accumulation of snow and ice\u201d negligently permitted to exist upon the above mentioned platform. The other count essentially alleges that the plaintiff\u2019s fall was on a \u201ccollection of ice\u201d negligently allowed to remain on the platform. At the conclusion of the evidence, the trial judge allowed Produce\u2019s motion for directed verdicts. The case is before us on the plaintiff\u2019s exception to the allowance of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">We summarize the evidence most favorable to the plaintiff. There was testimony from one James T. Hayes, the treasurer of both Boston and Produce, that Produce was a wholly owned subsidiary of Boston. In 1966, Produce \u201cowned, controlled and maintained\u201d a certain property in South Boston known as the \u201cBoston Market Terminal\u201d (Terminal). \u201cThe Terminal was then a market facility maintained by Produce for the exclusive use and convenience of about forty or forty-five produce companies which were licensed members of the Terminal organization. The [T]erminal consisted of three long freight houses with six platforms, one along each side of the houses, plus one platform at the end of one of the houses called the house eleven platform. The Terminal entrance was marked by a sign, Boston Market Terminal, and the houses were approachable on train tracks or on macadam and cobblestone roadways. Above the freight houses, connected by an overhead bridge, there were office spaces which Produce orally leased to various member companies. Sawyer &amp; Company [Sawyer], the employer of the plaintiff, was a member company, which also leased office space under a tenancy at will. . . . Boston . . . occupied office space as a tenant of Produce, and paid Produce rent based in large part upon the unit charges Boston levied upon member companies, determined by the number of train or truck units that used the platforms for loading or unloading. Only trucks owned or controlled by member companies could use the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>Terminal facility, with the exception of a very few trucks sent there on consignment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">Hayes also testified that Boston was not responsible for maintaining the facility. Produce\u2019s maintenance crew had the responsibility to maintain all three freight houses and their platforms, which included the shoveling, salting and sanding of all platforms. \u201cThe maintenance crew . . . would watch the storm elements and when a storm was subsiding or ending, they would go out and clear the platforms. The house eleven platform, being open to the elements on all sides was used less frequently in winter; however it was available for use by any member company at any time. This particular platform which was eight feet wide and 280 feet long, had a fiberglass roof, fastened by nails to wooden supports which resulted in roof leakage. The roof leakage was repaired at some time by replacing the nails with special type washers with calking.\u201d Hayes \u201cdid not know whether the roof was repaired in the winter of 1966.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">The plaintiff testified that he worked as a delivery clerk at the Terminal for Sawyer. His duties \u201cincluded the delivery of samples of produce, from . . . [Sawyer\u2019s] trucks on the various platforms, to the freight house, where he would set the samples up on display for sale; after which he would return the samples to the truck.\u201d On Wednesday, February 3, 1966, he began work at 4 A.M. He was instructed by his foreman, one Horace H. Henry, to deliver samples of cabbage to the freight house from a truck at house eleven platform. The platform had thirty truck stalls, fifteen located on each side. The cabbage truck was parked at number twelve stall. At 4 A.M. with the assistance of a flashlight, he walked out onto the platform, climbed aboard a side truck and rode to the cabbage truck at number twelve stall. While he was on the house eleven platform, he observed that the center of the platform was covered with \u201cwavy ice\u201d about \u201csix inches thick.\u201d He walked on the edge of the platform where he observed no ice. When he returned Henry told him to stand by in case further samples were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>required from this or other trucks that might come to that platform. At about 7:30 A.M., Henry told the plaintiff to deliver more samples from the cabbage truck. At this time, the plaintiff observed \u201cthat the middle of the platform was covered with thick wavy ice, that that ice was dangerous, but that there was a space along the edge of the platform where there were clear spaces without ice.\u201d The plaintiff stated, \u201cI was walking where I knew there was no danger, where I knew there were no spots of ice.\u201d This clear space was about twelve inches wide and it appeared to the plaintiff to exist along the entire edge of the platform. In walking along this space at about 7:30 A.M., the plaintiff \u201cwore rubbers, and watched carefully where he placed his feet.\u201d When he reached stall eleven, about fifteen or twenty feet from the cabbage truck in stall twelve, he \u201cslipped on ice, fell and broke his ankle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Prior to the date and time of his fall the plaintiff observed that there had been no snow fall or precipitation for several days. He further observed that \u201cthe roof of this house eleven platform leaked in the summer when it rained, and that it leaked in the winter when there was any snow resting and melting on it. On February 3, 1966, there was snow accumulation of several inches on the ground from a snow storm several days earlier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">The plaintiff further testified that there was no sand or rock salt on the ice on the platform, and that he had never seen any sand or rock salt there even though he had seen ice and snow there before.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">One Joseph A. Locke, a maintenance man for Produce, who supervised a crew of between three and six, testified that he and his crew had the responsibility to salt, sand and shovel clear the various platforms in the winter of 1966. Locke or one of his assistants would inspect the condition of the platforms. Upon such inspection, or upon receiving any complaint from the member companies, Locke\u2019s crew would clear up, sand, or salt the platforms.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">There was also testimony from Henry that there were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>leaky spots in the roof over the house eleven platform, that these \u201cspots were observable by walking down the platform, looking up and seeing the holes right through the roof\u201d and that the icy condition of the platform was much the same as the day before the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">1. We first consider the question whether adequate notice of the time, place and cause of the plaintiff\u2019s accident was sent by the plaintiff. The plaintiff\u2019s notice, addressed to \u201cBoston Market Terminal, 31 Hs Fargo Street, Boston, Massachusetts,\u201d was admitted in evidence at the trial without objection in so far as the record indicates. The notice could be reasonably construed as notice to Produce in view of the fact that Produce maintained the market facility known as \u201cBoston Market Terminal\u201d and indicated by a sign bearing that name.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">General Laws c. 84, \u00a7 21, as appearing in St. 1965, c. 378, \u00a7 3, provides, in part, that \u201cno . . . notice shall be invalid by reason of any inaccuracy or misstatement in respect to the owner\u2019s name if it appears that such error was made in good faith and did not prevent or unreasonably delay the owner from receiving actual notice of the injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">Although Produce was the actual owner of the facility where the accident occurred, Boston was the parent company of Produce, and maintained office space in the facility as a tenant of Produce. Hayes was the treasurer of both corporations. Even if it should be construed that the notice was addressed to Boston, we are of opinion that there was a sufficient nexus between Boston and Produce so that, within G. L. c. 84, \u00a7 21, notice to Boston constituted notice to Produce as a matter of law. Cf. <em>W. W. Britton Inc. </em>v. <em>S. M. Hill Co. </em>327 Mass. 335, 339. See generally <em>Blanchard </em>v. <em>Stone\u2019s Inc. </em>304 Mass. 634, 637-638; <em>Powers </em>v. <em>John C. MacInnes, Inc. </em>343 Mass. 773.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">2. Produce owned, controlled, and maintained the Terminal facility for the exclusive use of member companies. It owed to Sawyer, a member company, a duty to exercise reasonable care to maintain the premises in a safe condition. This is so whether we regard Sawyer\u2019s status on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>the premises as that of a tenant <em>(Gilroy </em>v. <em>Badger, </em>301 Mass. 494, 496)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or of a business invitee <em>(Delano </em>v. <em>Garrettson-Ellis Lumber Co., ante, </em>500).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This duty extended to the plaintiff as an employee of Sawyer. <em>Dreher </em>v. <em>Bedford Realty, Inc. </em>335 Mass. 385, 388, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">The jury would have been warranted in finding that snow melted and flowed through the holes in the roof over the house eleven platform which Produce negligently had failed to repair and thus created an unnatural accumulation of ice resulting in the plaintiff\u2019s fall. Alternatively there was evidence which would have warranted the jury in finding that the ice accumulation \u201cwas in plain view for sufficient time to enable the defendant and his servants, in the exercise of reasonable care, to make . . . [the platform] safe [for travel]. <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>Goodall, </em>138 Mass. 533. <em>Frost </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>200 Mass. 445. <em>Erickson </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>230 Mass. 467. <em>Allan </em>v. <em>Essanee, Inc. </em>309 Mass. 1.\u201d <em>Mansfield </em>v. <em>Spear, </em>313 Mass. 685, 687.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">3. Produce argues that the plaintiff assumed the risk of a fall and was contributorily negligent. In its argument Produce appears to rely on the following dialogue which occurred during cross-examination of the plaintiff:</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Counsel for the defendant : \u201cOkay. You were just as careful the second time as you were the first time, and you had the benefit of your experience in walking over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>this dangerous condition once before. That\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">The judge: \u201cThe answer is yes or no. You see, the stenographer has to take your answer. You just can\u2019t nod your head.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">The plaintiff : \u201cWell, I took a chance, that\u2019s all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Counsel for the defendant: \u201cYou took a chance?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">The plaintiff: \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">Counsel for the defendant : \u201cYou took a chance to go out there hoping you wouldn\u2019t fall, is that right?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">The plaintiff : \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t look at it that way.\u201d The plaintiff also testified, \u201cI was walking where I knew there was no danger, where I knew there were no spots of ice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">Any inconsistency in the plaintiff\u2019s testimony was for the jury to resolve. <em>Delano </em>v. <em>Garrettson-Ellis Lumber Co., ante, </em>500, 502, and cases cited. Produce had the burden of proving the affirmative defences of contributory negligence and assumption of risk <em>(Manning </em>v. <em>Prouty, </em>260 Mass. 399, 402). We rarely are able to hold, as matter of law, that this burden has been sustained. <em>Halley </em>v. <em>Hugh Nawn, Inc. </em>356 Mass. 28, 30. <em>Sweenor </em>v. <em>162 State St. Inc., ante, </em>524. We perceive no reason for doing so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-11\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b758-7\"><em> </em>The jury could have inferred that the letting occurred before the dangerous condition arose. Moreover, the cases cited by Produce for the proposition that a landlord owes no duty to remove <em>natural </em>accumulations of snow and ice in the absence of an express or implied agreement to do so <em>(Carey </em>v. <em>Malley, </em>327 Mass. 189; <em>Spack </em>v. <em>Longwood Apartments, Inc. </em>338 Mass. 518) are not in point.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b758-8\"> There was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that Sawyer was a business invitee. Boston, the parent company of Produce, levied unit charges upon member companies according to the number of trains or trucks using the platforms. The rent which Boston paid Produce to occupy office space was based \u201cin large part\u201d upon these unit charges. Thus, it could have been found, Sawyer\u2019s presence was induced by and of economic benefit to Produce. See <em>Sweeney </em>v. <em>Old Colony </em>&amp; <em>Newport R.R. </em>10 Allen 368, 373; <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Shea, </em>326 Mass. 681, 683.
