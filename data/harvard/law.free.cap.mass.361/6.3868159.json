L. c. 272, \u00a7 19,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in using an instrument upon the body of a woman (the young woman) with intent to procure an abortion. On February 26, 1970, a Superior Court judge (the motion judge) denied a substitute motion <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to dismiss the indictment. He heard medical evidence concerning (a) current methods of accomplishing abortions and (b) the greatly increased safety of certain types of abortion. There was also testimony about somewhat varying medical views on abortion. The judge declined to receive evidence concerning (a) the alleged interference of \u00a7 19 with the practice of religion, (b) the background of \u00a7 19, (c) the experience of certain psychiatrists, sociologists, and others based on this statute and similar statutes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>(d) the restraints on medical prescription and treatment <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> imposed by the statute, (e) the statute\u2019s effect on privacy, and (f) the statute\u2019s vagueness.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AjJ\">A second Superior Court judge, who presided at trial (the trial judge) reaffirmed the denial of the motion to dismiss. A jury found Brunelle guilty. He appealed. The case is before us under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 \u00a7 33A-33G, on assignments of error based on rulings both of the motion judge and of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">The jury could have found the following facts. On May 1, 1969, the young woman went with two friends to Brunelle\u2019s house in Chelmsford. She was pregnant and desired an abortion. She had been \u201cupset\u201d but was not mentally ill or emotionally disturbed. Brunelle told her that he would perform an abortion, \u201ca D &amp; C\u201d (dilation and curettage), and that the operation \u201cwas illegal, and ... no one should be told about it.\u201d He said that \u201che would insert certain instruments into her\u201d and that \u201ca complete abortion would be performed.\u201d The young woman lay on an examining table and Brunelle inserted the instruments into her vaginal area. She \u201cfelt them . . . being inserted.\u201d Afterward he gave her some medication and told her that she \u201chad completely aborted.\u201d A male friend of the young woman paid Brunelle $600. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Later that evening the young woman was examined by a physician at a suburban hospital. He found \u201cseveral.. . fragments . . . lying free in the vagina\u201d and reported that she was passing \u201csmall amounts of blood.\u201d He concluded, however, that an abortion had not taken place. She had further treatment at another hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-4\">1. At the hearing on the motion to dismiss before the motion judge, Brunelle\u2019s counsel in effect conceded that Brunelle (although \u201cthe possessor of a medical doctor\u2019s degree\u201d) was not \u201ca licensed practitioner.\u201d The assistant district attorney asserted that Brunelle was not a licensed physician in Massachusetts or any State. In any event, the motion to dismiss did not allege Brunelle to be a licensed physician, and the evidence at trial tended to show that he was not licensed.</p>\n<p id=\"A_c\">In this prosecution under c. 272, \u00a7 19, Brunelle had the burden of coming forward with evidence that he, in some circumstances, might have (a) a defence or justification for acting in apparent violation of the broad prohibition in \u00a7 19 (as, for example, showing, that he had a license to practice medicine in Massachusetts; see G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 7) and (b) the benefit of an exception from criminal liability under c. 272, \u00a7 19 (under prior judicial decisions such as <em>Kudish </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Medicine, </em>356 Mass. 98, 99-100). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>354 Mass. 685, 688, fn. 3; <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>359 Mass. 758; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>United States, </em>138 F. 2d 81, 82-84 (D.C. Cir.), discussed in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vuitch, </em>402 U. S. 62, 68-69. Brunelle did not sustain that burden. Accordingly, we deal with the motion to dismiss on the basis that Brunelle has not shown himself to be a physician licensed to practice in Massachusetts.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">2. Where one performing an abortion \u201cis not a physician the mere proof of his act ordinarily would be sufficient to establish its unlawfulness.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number><em>Brunelle, </em>341 Mass. 675, 678.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> An abortion (or attempted abortion) performed by one who is not a licensed physician is unlawful without regard to any principles affording a defence with respect to an abortion performed by a licensed physician. It constitutes a significant surgical or medical procedure, forbidden in any event to one not a licensed physician. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 112, \u00a7 6. <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A holder of a medical degr\u00e9e whose license has been revoked, as Brunelle\u2019s seems to have been (see the earlier <em>Brunelle </em>case, 341 Mass. 675), is subject to the provisions and prohibitions of c. 112, \u00a7 6, as fully as any other unlicensed person.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">3. Brunelle is not in a position now to assert that a statute, valid in its application to an abortion not performed by a licensed physician, is unconstitutional merely because of contentions that (as applied to a licensed physician in like circumstances) it might or would be unconstitutional. \u201cA statute may be unconstitutional as applied to some states of fact, but constitutional as applied to others.\u201d <em>Bowe </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>320 Mass. 230, 246. Only persons whose interests are affected by a statute may assert that it is unconstitutional. See <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Bowker, </em>333 Mass. 455, 459; <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination </em>v. <em>Colangelo, </em>344 Mass. 387, 390-391; <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>348 Mass. 671, 674; <em>Peterson, petitioner, </em>354 Mass. 110, 114; <em>Kudish </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Medicine, </em>356 Mass. 98, 100. See also <em>Ashwander v</em>. <em>Tennessee Valley Authy. </em>297 U. S. 288, 347 (Mr. Justice Brandeis concurring) ; <em>Alma Motor Co. </em>v. <em>Timken-Detroit Axle Co. </em>329 U.S. 129, 136-137; <em>Rosen</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number><em>berg </em>v. <em>Fleuti, </em>374 U. S. 449, 451. Compare <em>Flast </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>392 U. S. 83, 101-106 (taxpayers\u2019 effort to question Federal expenditure). Because c. 272, \u00a7 19, constitutionally may be applied to Brunelle, we do not consider contentions about its alleged general invalidity.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">4. In the circumstances, it was within the discretion of the trial judge to refuse to put special questions to prospective jurors in addition to those questions required by G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 28. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ricard, </em>355 Mass. 509, 510-511. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>357 Mass. 168, 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-10\">5. In the course of his charge, subject to Brunelle\u2019s exception, the trial judge stated that the \u201cintent and purpose\u201d of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 19, \u201cis to prevent attempts to destroy unprotected human beings in the womb of the mother.\u201d Brunelle contends that this statement, not only was inaccurate, but also was prejudicial as bringing into the case an \u201cemotionally charged\u201d issue about which many sincere and conflicting views are entertained. The statute was first enacted over 125 years ago (St. 1845, c. 27). Although the legislative purpose does not appear from the legislative documents in the State Archives, at least one reason for its enactment may have been the desire to protect women from the risks of what was then a dangerous surgical procedure.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b26-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>A judge may inform a jury about the legislative purpose of a statute, if he does so accurately. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sansone, </em>252 Mass. 71, 75. The purpose behind this statute, on its original enactment, is not certain and some reasons for continuing it have become increasingly controversial. The trial judge would have been wiser to have avoided entirely the risk of prejudice from a wholly unnecessary remark. \u201cThe test of the charge,\u201d however, \u201cis the impression created by it as a whole.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>359 Mass. 77, 92. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pinnick, </em>354 Mass. 13, 15. So viewed, and in the context of otherwise proper instructions on relevant legal issues, the remark was harmless in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">6. After deliberating for four and one-half hours, the jury asked the judge for further instructions on two issues. The judge answered these questions and the jury conferred for about an hour more. The jury then again appeared before the judge (we assume at his request). He suggested that they were perhaps having difficulty agreeing upon a verdict and read them the charge in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tuey, </em>8 Cush. 1, 2-4. The jury returned ten minutes later with a verdict of guilty. The use of the <em>Tuey </em>case charge necessarily is a matter which rests largely in the sound discretion of the trial judge. We perceive no special circumstances which made its use inappropriate in the present case. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>354 Mass. 630, 636-638.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b21-13\"> General Laws c. 272, \u00a7 19, reads: \u201cWhoever, with intent to procure the miscarriage of a woman . . . unlawfully uses any instrument or other means whatever, or, with like intent, aids or assists therein, shall ... be punished . . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b21-14\"><em> </em>The motion alleged c. 272, \u00a7 19, to be unconstitutional (1) as expressing in a statute a \u201csolely moral judgment peculiar to one religion,\u201d (2) as \u201cnot suited to achieve any valid legislative\u201d purpose in view of the absence of evidence that medically supervised miscarriages constitute a threat to health, (3) that the statute goes beyond protecting against dangers to the public health, safety, or morals, (4) that, on moral grounds, the statute \u201cinterferes with the free exercise of [a] doctor\u2019s medical judgment and with the rights of the patient to health and happiness,\u201d (5) that \u00a7 19 \u201cdiscriminates against poor people\u201d who cannot afford to retain physicians and psychiatrists, forcing them \u201cto resort to . . . untrained, criminal abortionists,\u201d (6) that it compels citizens \u201cto complete an unwanted pregnancy,\u201d (7) that \u00a7 19 invalidly proscribes freedom of speech concerning abortions, (8) that \u00a7 19 imposes \u201ccruel and unusual punishment,\u201d (9) that it violates the right of privacy and freedom of choice in \u201cthe area of private morality,\u201d and (10) that \u00a7 19 is \u201carbitrary and vague.\u201d See, however, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Vuitch, </em>402 U.

These included the Right Reverend Anson Phelps Stokes, Episcopal Bishop of Massachusetts; Rabbi Sanford Seltzer of Brook-line; Dr. Robert West, President of the Unitarian Universalist Association; the Reverend Edward Wright, Jr., Acting Dean of Students, Harvard Divinity School; the Reverend Armand Morissette, Rector of St. Jean the Baptist Church, Lowell; Rabbi David Feldman; Algernon D. Black, Senior Leader of the New York Society for Ethical Culture; and Professor Joseph Fletcher of the Episcopal Theological School, Cambridge. Each of these witnesses was prepared to testify, among other things, (a) in effect that the principles expressed in c. 272 \u00a7 19, concerning abortion were in substantial conflict with religious, moral, and sociological views entertained by them, their respective coreligionists, and others, and (b) that \u00a7 19 was a serious obstacle to advising persons turning to them for pastoral or professional advice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b23-7\"> See discussion in Am.
