The taxpayers seek to compel certification that a bond order measure described below, approved by the city council, was disapproved by the voters because \u201cit failed to carry by [affirmative vote of] at least one-third of the total registered voters.\u201d A demurrer was sustained. The taxpayers appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">The second case is a bill in equity by the same taxpayers against the same defendants, and also against the mayor, the city treasurer, the city auditor, and the Peabody Redevelopment Authority (the Authority). The bill seeks injunctive relief against the issue and sale of bonds and also asks declaratory relief in general terms. The Authority\u2019s demurrer and the separate demurrer of all the other defendants were sustained. Leave to amend was denied. The taxpayers appealed from the interlocutory decrees sustaining the demurrers and from a final decree dismissing the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"ADz\">The Mandamus Proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-11\">The mandamus petition alleges the following matters among others. The city council on March 31, 1970, adopted a bond order appropriating $1,500,000 and authorizing the borrowing of that sum to defray the costs of an industrial park project. A referendum petition, protesting the vote, was filed by'a sufficient number of voters on April 13, 1970. The city council reconsidered the vote (see the Peabody city charter, Sp. St. 1916, c. 300, \u00a7 48, fn. 2, <em>infra) </em>but did not annul or rescind it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>The charter provisions are discussed below (see fns. 1-5 and related text of this opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">A special election was called for and held on June 16, 1970. After recount, it appeared that 5,561 voters had voted for the measure and 5,336 voters had voted against it. One-third of the whole number of Peabody\u2019s registered voters on the date of the election was 7,639. The taxpayers contend that the measure is void because it received affirmative votes of less than one-third of the total number of registered voters (see charter, \u00a7 52, fn. 4, <em>infra). </em>They allege that the respondents have treated the bond order as approved by the majority vote alone and intend to sell the bonds. The taxpayers ask that the respondents be ordered to issue election certificates declaring the bond order ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">As we read the Peabody charter, it treats (a) proposed measures based upon an initiative petition on a different basis from (b) measures originated by the city council concerning which a referendum may be had. If an initiative \u201cproposed measure\u201d under \u00a7 47 of the charter,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is not passed within twenty days by the city council it must be submitted to the voters, but only at the next regular election. A referendum (\u00a748) takes place concerning \u201cany measure\u201d finally passed by the city council upon the filing of a protest signed by at least the necessary number of registered voters.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This may be as to a \u201cmeasure or any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>part thereof.\u201d This referendum petition suspends the measure. If, upon reconsideration by the city council, the \u201cmeasure or any part\u201d is \u201cnot entirely annulled,\u201d the matter goes to a referendum vote \u201ceither at the next regular city election, or at a special election.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The measure (\u00a7 48) will become \u201cnull and void unless\u201d approved by a majority of the voters voting on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">Section 48 contains no reference to obtaining \u201cthe affirmative votes of at least a third of the whole number of registered voters.\u201d This provision, found only in \u00a7 52,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we think relates only to a \u201cproposed measure,\u201d a term applied to proposals by initiative petitions. See \u00a7 47 (fn. 1) and \u00a7 46 (fn. 3).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Each \u201cproposedmeasure\u201d presented by initiative petition, of course, never has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>reached the stage of a \u201cfinal passage.\u201d There is obviously a more compelling reason for requiring affirmative approval (by a minimum number of voters) of such a \u201cproposed measure,\u201d than there is with respect to a \u201cmeasure\u201d (as to which a referendum is sought under \u00a7 48) which already has received \u201cfinal passage\u201d by the city\u2019s legislative body.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">In the light of the foregoing considerations we conclude that \u00a7 52 of the charter does apply to proposed measures presented by initiative, but has no application to referenda under \u00a7 48. As to a \u201cmeasure\u201d which has been passed finally by the city council, operation is only suspended pending approval of a majority of the registered voters participating in the referendum. The suspension ends, we rule, once the measure has been approved by a majority of the voters caring enough about the subject matter to vote in the referendum. If the 1916 Legislature had intended the result for which the taxpayers contend, a precise provision easily could have been inserted like that in the Lynn city charter set out in the margin. <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The taxpayers refer us to no authority which supports their position. <em>Gorman </em>v. <em>Peabody, </em>312 Mass. 560, 568, does not discuss \u00a7 48 with respect to the present issue.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">\n<em>Order sustaining demurrer affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b715-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>The Bill in Equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">The bill in equity makes somewhat confused and prolix allegations. Among these are the following: The city council rezoned an area (the locus) from Residential A-l to Industrial A-2. Opposition to this was at least relaxed by alleged misrepresentations by city council members that this rezoning \u201cmeant no takings by eminent domain in the future.\u201d During the period of this discussion of rezoning, the city \u201cset in motion ... [a] so-called blighted open land program under\u201d G. L. c. 121 and c. 121A. Notice by publication (in two newspapers of local circulation) of a public hearing before the city council to be held on June 26,1969, was given on June 13 and June 20. The public hearing was held. The notice given did not comply with the twenty day notice requirement of G. L. c. 121, \u00a7 26P (now found in substance in G. L. c. 121B, \u00a7 47, inserted by St. 1969, c. 751, \u00a7 1. This 1969 statute was approved on August 21, 1969, and was not effective when the approvals hereinafter mentioned were given by the city council). The Authority, on August 4, 1969, declared the locus a \u201cdecadent and blighted open area.\u201d No notice of such determination has been given as required by \u00a7 26P, nor has there been notice of \u201ca public hearing to determine whether the . . . [locus] meets the requirements of\u201d G. L. c. 121, \u00a7 26J, \u201cas a blighted open area.\u201d On August 5,1969, the city council approved the Authority\u2019s \u201copen blighted program\u201d and the city and the Authority have entered into a cooperation agreement. The Commonwealth\u2019s Department of Community Affairs, on a date not specified in the bill, has \u201capproved the [Authority\u2019s] plan . . . for a state-aided Urban Renewal Industrial development of\u201d the locus under cc. 121 and 121A, \u201cas amended to\u201d G. L. c. 121B. The locus \u201ccould and would be developed by private enterprise, and does not conform to any of the conditions defining a blighted open area under\u201d c. 121, \u00a7 26J. Private \u201cdevelopers in cooperation with present land owners are presently planning to develop and market a portion of\u201d the locus \u201cas a private industrial park.\u201d Then follow allegations con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>cerning the city council bond order very much like those in the mandamus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">1. It is far from clear on precisely what grounds the taxpayers seek relief. An effort to obtain relief under the city charter against the city council because of its bond order is joined with an attempt to have a remedy against the city council and the Authority for alleged violation of the provisions of G. L. c. 121 and c. 121B. To some extent the theory of the bill may be that of a ten taxpayers\u2019 suit. See <em>Povey </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Medford, </em>333 Mass. 70, 72. There are vague, general, and unsupported allegations, amounting at most to mere conclusions, not only that the\u201d action of the Authority and various Peabody officials denied the taxpayers due process of law, but also that provisions of G. L. cc. 121, 121A and 121B are unconstitutional. The Attorney General has not been joined as a party. See G. L. c. 231A, \u00a7 8. The vague allegations of misrepresentation or fraud are not admitted by demurrer. See <em>J. J. Gordon, Inc. </em>v. <em>Worcester Tel. Pub. Co. Inc. </em>343 Mass. 142, 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">In the circumstances the bill is subject to demurrer on general grounds. It is not one concerning which a declaration of the rights of the parties is required. See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Neelon, 335 </em>Mass. 357, 361; <em>Picard </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>338 Mass. 644, 647. See also <em>Cary Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Chelsea, </em>345 Mass. 769; <em>Johnson Prod. Inc. </em>v. <em>City Council of Medford, </em>353 Mass. 540, 545-546; <em>Poremba </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>354 Mass. 432, 434-435.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">2. Although the demurrer was properly sustained on general grounds, we mention briefly issues which the taxpayers attempt to raise for decision on the merits. They rely mainly on the Authority\u2019s and the city council\u2019s alleged failure to comply with the notice and hearing requirements of the last paragraph of G. L. c. 121, \u00a7 26P.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>The defendants in effect contend that \u00a7 26P was not applicable to this project at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">We find it unnecessary now to deal with this issue and with other questions, involving the interpretation of various sections of G. L. c. 121 and c. 121B, as amended.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The existing statutes were much rearranged by St. 1969, c. 751, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2, which became effective after many of the events alleged in the bill. The Attorney General and various State agencies concerned with those statutes have not been heard in this case and such questions preferably should be dealt with in proceedings in which they are parties or interveners.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">3. The taxpayers attach to their brief a copy of a city council resolution adopted August 5,1969, and a notice of a public hearing to be held on June 26, 1969. They request leave in their brief to amend their bill by including these documents in the bill. That motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">In considering the demurrers, we do not go beyond the allegations of the bill. <em>Siegel </em>v. <em>Knott, </em>316 Mass. 526, 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">\n<em>Interlocutory decrees affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">\n<em>Final decree affirmed with costs of appeal.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b712-6\"> Section 47 of the charter provides for initiative petitions \u201cby at least eight per cent but less than twenty per cent of the total number of registered voters\u201d for a measure which if not passed \u201cwithin twenty days by the city council . . . then <em>such proposed measure, </em>without alteration, shall be submitted by the city council to a vote of the registered voters of the city at the next annual city election\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b712-7\"> Section 48 of the charter reads (emphasis supplied): \u201cIf within twenty days after the <em>final passage </em>of any measure by the city council ... a petition signed by [at least twelve per cent of the total number of] registered voters ... be presented to the city council . . . protesting against such measure or any part thereof, the same shall thereupon ... be <em>suspended </em>from taking effect; and the city council . . . shall immediately reconsider such <em>measure or part thereof; </em>and if <em>such </em>measure <em>or part thereof </em>be not entirely annulled . . . the city council shall submit the same, <em>by the method herein provided, </em>to a vote of the qualified voters of the city, either at the next regular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>city election, or at a special election . . . and <em>such measure or part </em>thereof shall forthwith become null and void unless a majority of the qualified voters voting on the same at such election shall vote in favor thereof. The petition provided for by this section shall be termed a referendum petition. The procedure in respect to the referendum petition shall he the same as that provided by . . . [\u00a7 47] except that the words <em>\u2018measure </em>or part thereof <em>protested against\u2019 </em>shall for this purpose be understood to replace the word \u2018measure\u2019 in that section wherever it may occur, and that the word \u2018referendum\u2019 shall be understood to replace the word \u2018initiative\u2019 . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b713-7\"> Section 46 of the charter provides for an initiative petition, which (if signed by at least twenty per cent of the city\u2019s voters and if not passed by the city council without alteration) requires submission of the \u201cproposed measure\u201d to the voters at a special election unless a city election is otherwise to occur within ninety days.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b713-8\"> Section 52 reads: \u201cThe ballots used in voting upon any such <em>proposed measure </em>shall state the nature thereof in terms sufficient to show its substance. No <em>measure shall go into effect </em>unless it receives the <em>affirmative votes of at least a third, </em>of the whole number of registered voters\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b713-9\"> The term \u201cproposed measure\u201d (as used in \u00a7 52) also, perhaps, may apply to matters submitted to popular vote by the council on its own motion under \u00a7 50 of the charter. That is a matter which we need not now decide. Section 50 (emphasis supplied) reads: \u201cThe city council may, of its own motion . . . submit to a vote of the registered voters of the city for adoption or rejection at a general or special city election any <em>proposed measure, </em>or a proposal for the annulment, repeal or amendment of any <em>measure, </em>in the same manner and with the same . . . effect as are hereby provided for submission on petition.\u201d The term \u201cproposed measures\u201d also appears in a context likely to have significance only with respect to matters presented by initiative petition, in \u00a7 51, which reads (emphasis supplied) : \u201cIf two or more <em>proposed measures </em>passed at the same election contain conflicting provisions, that one of the <em>measures </em>which received the larger number of affirmative votes shall take effect and the other to the extent of the inconsistency, shall be void.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b714-7\"> Special Statute 1917, c. 340, \u00a7 54, the Lynn charter (nearly contemporary with the Peabody charter), expressly stated in the provision for a referendum that the \u201cmeasure or part thereof shall . . . become . . . void unless a majority of the qualified voters voting on the same . . . shall vote in favor thereof, <em>and unless it receives the affirmative vote of at least a third of the whole number of registered voters\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). It should be noted that no provision of G. L. c. 43, \u00a7\u00a7 37-44, as amended, requires a minimum number of affirmative votes with respect to a <em>referendum, </em>but \u00a7 40 requires that one-third of the whole number of registered voters approve an initiative measure proposed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b714-13\"> What has been said (on the merits of the taxpayers\u2019 contention) disposes of the mandamus petition. There is no occasion to consider objections by the respondents that, in any event, mandamus will not lie to compel some of the respondents to perform (a) duties in a particular manner, or (b) acts which they already have purported to perform in a manner different from what the taxpayers deem correct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b716-7\"> See the last paragraph of \u00a7 26P (inserted by St. 1961, c. 188, \u00a7 1, and as amended through St. 1968, c. 230). This paragraph as amended and the titles of the 1961 and 1968 statutes just mentioned suggest that \u00a7 26P may have a much more limited scope of application than that for which the taxpayers contend.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b717-9\"><em> </em>Among such questions are: (1) To what extent does \u00a7 26P relate only to situations where (a) an immediate eminent domain taking, or (b) borrowing from the Federal government, is involved? (2) Does \u00a7 26P have application to land assembly and development projects to be carried out (prior to the effective date of the 1969 enactment of c. 121B) under c. 121, part IV, \u00a7\u00a7 26JJ-26MM?
