Bern or his nominee. The buyer became Bern\u2019s nominee. An agreement of purchase and sale (the orig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>inal agreement) was executed on May 24, 1965.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A supplementary agreement, dated June 21, 1965, defined by metes and bounds the land to be excepted from the conveyance (the excepted parcel) and created certain easements in favor of the buyer as to the excepted parcel. Lorusso, Materials\u2019 president and treasurer (fn. 1), signed each agreement individually as well as for Materials. An auditor, who made findings described below, assessed damages, recoverable by the buyer, at $50,150. Subject to the defendants\u2019 exceptions, a Superior Court judge denied their motion to recommit the auditor\u2019s report, and allowed a motion for judgment for the buyer on the auditor\u2019s report. The case is before us on the defendants\u2019 bills of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">The land sold consisted of about seventy acres in Bridgewater. The excepted parcel contained about 6.2 acres. The original agreement (par. 2) provided that the \u201csale . . . shall include the sand and gravel plant ... on the [sold] premises, all equipment listed . . . and processed and unprocessed sand and gravel.\u201d It further provided (par. 3), after referring to the excepted parcel, \u201cAny sand and gravel removed from <em>this area </em>at any time after passing of papers, and any sand, gravel <em>or stone </em>stockpiled in this area at the time of passing of papers shall be the property of the [b]uyer, and the [b]uyer shall have the right to enter the area to remove it for a reasonable . . . time\u201d (emphasis supplied). The supplementary agreement of June 21, 1965 (probably executed on June 22), made a similar provision, in terms clearly applicable to the excepted parcel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Materials and Lorusso apparently as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>sume that papers passed on June 22, 1965, although this is by no means wholly clear from the auditor\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">The parties stipulated before the auditor that the original agreement and the supplementary agreement \u201cconstitute the <em>written </em>agreements between the parties.\u201d From oral testimony of \u201cwitnesses for . . . the plaintiff [the buyer] and the defendants [i.e. Materials and Lorusso] . . . attorneys and . . . accountants who drew both . . . agreements,\u201d the auditor found that the written agreements \u201cdid not constitute the <em>entire </em>agreement.\u201d He admitted parol evidence \u201cto determine the oral agreement and to explain some of the language and the terms used.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">The auditor found that \u201cstockpiles or inventory were to become the property of the . . . buyer\u201d when title to the real estate passed, \u201cincluding not only those stockpiles or inventory ... on the land that was sold but also including the stockpiles or inventory ... on the\u201d excepted parcel. The buyer \u201cwas to have ... [a] right . . . after title passed to enter upon\u201d the excepted land and remove the stockpiles as his own property. The auditor also found that on May 24, 1965, \u201cthere were . . . certain stockpiles of sand and stones on the land in question . . . examined together by\u201d the original purchaser Bern and by Lorusso for the seller (Materials) ; \u201cthat for the period between May 24, 1965,\u201d and the passage of title, \u201cit was agreed that the business of . . . [Materials] should continue ... as usual; [and] that . . . [Materials] could use the stockpiles ... in the usual course of business but would . . . replace . . . the same with like quantity\u201d so that \u201cwhen papers should pass the quantity . . . would be as close as possible\u201d to that on May 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">By June 22, \u201cthe stockpiles of stones\u201d were not up to the quantity seen and examined by representatives of the parties about May 24. Materials had sold and removed quantities from the stockpiles of stone, which the auditor concluded amounted (a) to a breach of Ma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>terials7 agreemenf to deliver the same -quantity of stone <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2022present on May 24, and .(b) to a conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">The auditor made findings concerning the quantity of the stone removed between May 24 (see fn, 2) and June 22, and its value, He fqund for the buyer in the aggregate sum of $50,15.9 op count 1 (breach of contract against Materials') and count 2 (breach of contract against Lorusso<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>), He found for Lorusso on count 4 alleging conversion of the stone, A motion for judgment in accordance with the auditor\u2019s report was allowed,</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">1. Materials and Lorusso contend that the oral contract, on the terms found by the auditor, was inconsistent with the written contracts and that admission of evidence concerning it constituted a violation of the parol evidence rule. There, of course, would have been such a violation if the oral agreement in fact had been inconsistent with the written agreements. <em>Schuster </em>v. <em>Baskin, </em>354 Mass. 137, 140-141, <em>Gifford </em>v. <em>Gifford, </em>354 Mass. 247, 249. Restatement 2d: Contracts (Tent. draft no. 5, March 31, 1970) \u00a7\u00a7 239-242.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">The original and supplementary agreements are somewhat ambiguous concerning the date as of which the stockpiles were to be sold and consequently concerning the right of Materials to use or remove materials from the stockpiles prior to passing papers. Uncertainty concerning the meaning of the written contracts is created in several respects; (a) An express provision of the original agreement (par. 7) gave to Materials, the seller, the right to remove the loam from one parcel. No similar written provision was made concerning the removal of stone, Uncertainty thus was created whether the seller was entitled to remove stone prior to passing papers. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>(b) Because the buyer would not own the excepted parrcel on which at least some of the stockpiles stood, there was a reason (wholly consistent with the asserted oral agreement) for providing in the original agreement that \u2018'stone stockpiled ... [on the excepted parcel] <em>at the time of passing of papers </em>shall be the property of the [b] uyer\u201d (emphasis supplied). The supplementary agreement was generally similar in form. The buyer obviously needed to have access to those stockpiles on another\u2019s land. The provision thus is not necessarily inconsistent with a separate oral agreement that Materials might use, in the course of its business, and replace stone from the stockpiles prior to the passing of papers. (c) The written agreements appear to be somewhat loosely drawn. They use the terms \u201csand and gravel,\u201d \u201csand, gravel or stone,\u201d and \u201csand and gravel stope\u201d in a confusing manner, The briefs of the parties refer to various engineering authorities and texts which show considerable flexibility in the meaning of the term \u201cgravel,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">The written agreements were sufficiently ambiguous to require explanation, We cannot say (especially without the evidence received by the auditor which is not before us) that the oral agreement, found to exist by the auditor, was inconsistent with the written agreements, or that the written agreements were so thoroughly integrated and free from ambiguity as to preclude the receipt of parol evidence. See <em>Carlo Bianchi &amp; Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Builders\u2019 Equip. &amp; Supplies Co. </em>347 Mass. 636, 643-644. See also <em>Imper Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Riss, </em>358 Mass. 529, 534-535.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">We perceive no basis for the contention of Materials that the oral agreement was superseded by the supplementary agreement dated June 21. We regard the oral agreement as relating to a collateral matter not covered by either the original agreement or the supplementary agreement. See <em>New England Factors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Genstil, </em>322 Mass. 36, 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">2. Materials contends that the oral agreement violates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>the statute of frauds found in G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 2-201<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (as appearing in St. 1957, c. 765, \u00a7 1). The buyer\u2019s declaration alleges that Materials received the full consideration from the buyer. Although the auditor does not expressly find this to be so, his report implies the payment of the whole purchase price , of $180,000. Accordingly, if the whole agreement (written and oral) required transfer of the stone stockpiles as they existed on May 24, 1965, and if they (as the auditor found) were not transferred, the provisions of \u00a7 2-201 (3) (c) are satisfied by the payment of the whole consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">In any event, it is far from clear that there was any separate oral agreement for the <em>sale </em>of stone. The auditor, in effect, has found that the oral agreement was on the basis that, \u201cin the usual course of business,\u201d Materials \u201ccould <em>use </em>the stockpiles\u201d but would <em>\u201creplace </em>or restore,\u201d them (emphasis supplied). This necessarily presupposes that the original written agreement, as explained by parol evidence, provided for the sale of all the stockpiles as they existed on May 24. If this was the case, then the oral agreement was merely that Materials would replace the portions of the stockpiles consumed by it, as a matter of business routine, prior to passing papers. Such a replacement provision concerning fungible goods hardly can be said to constitute a contract of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">In view of his finding about the arbitrary nature of the allocation of the price \u201cfor tax purposes\u201d (fn. 3), the auditor did not have to give controlling significance to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>the allocation provision of the supplementary agreement. What has already been said (in part 1 of this opinion) about the ambiguity of the written agreements justified the auditor\u2019s receipt of oral testimony to explain what stockpiles were sold (i.e. whether only those on the excepted parcel or also those on the land sold). Since the record does not contain the evidence before him, we are not able to say he wrongly concluded that all stockpiles (both those on the excepted parcel and those \u201con the land that was sold\u201d) were the subject of sale.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">3. Lorusso contends that judgment should not have been entered against him for the stone removed or withheld by Materials between May 24 and the passing of papers. In the original agreement (stated to be between Materials and Bern, who assigned his interest to his nominee, the ultimate buyer), only the original seller and the original buyer made any express promises to each other. Lorusso, as Materials\u2019 president and treasurer, warranted that he had no knowledge<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of any problem concerning the legal right to remove gravel from the premises. In the supplementary agreement (expressed as only between Materials and the ultimate buyer), Lorusso (by par. 4) joined in an agreement by Materials (a) not to build a concrete plant on the excepted parcel without the ultimate buyer\u2019s consent and (b) to obtain from any lessee or purchaser of the excepted parcel an agreement to buy from the buyer \u201csand and gravel stone\u201d used in the asphalt plant on the excepted parcel. The agreement bound Lorusso (as well as Materials) to this provision. Lorusso signed (without stating any express limitation on his contractual liability) not only the original agreement but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>also the supplementary agreement. It is left uncertain whether or to what extent the written agreements or the oral agreement bound him beyond the representations and covenants specifically made by him as stated above. The auditor found that there was \u201cno evidence whether . . . [Lorusso] controlled\u201d Materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">The auditor has not found subsidiary facts sufficient to permit an intelligent decision whether Lorusso was bound as surety or guarantor or was bound only by his specific undertakings, inasmuch as to most other provisions of the written agreements he could be found to have been acting as an agent or representative for a disclosed principal. Lorusso relies, in this aspect of the case, on <em>Blackmer </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>128 Mass. 538, 541-542 (distinguished in <em>Zussman </em>v. <em>Goldberg, </em>254 Mass. 486, 487-488). See <em>Porshin </em>v. <em>Snider, </em>349 Mass. 653, 654-655; <em>Henry B. Byors &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Water Commrs. of Northborough, </em>358 Mass. 354, 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">The question of the extent of Lorusso\u2019s liability was obscurely (but, we think, sufficiently) raised by the defendants\u2019 motion to recommit to the auditor (see fn. 7), and also by the buyer\u2019s motion for judgment on the auditor\u2019s report. Further findings only on this issue (of the extent of Lorusso\u2019s personal liability) remain appropriate. These further findings may be made by the trial judge or by recommittal of this question to the auditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">4. Lorusso\u2019s exception to the allowance of the motion for judgment is sustained, and his other exceptions are overruled. Issues concerning the extent of his liability are to be heard further in the Superior Court. Materials\u2019 exceptions are overruled and judgment in favor of the buyer is to enter against Materials on the auditor\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b824-5\"> The auditor referred in various places to this date as May 21, but it was agreed at the arguments that the correct date was May 24.
