(La Touraine) an abatement of its corporate excise tax for the calendar year 1964. The case was submitted to the board for decision on the basis of certain facts stipulated by the parties in writing plus six documentary exhibits which have been placed before us pursuant to a certification by the single justice under S. J. C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>Rule 1:06 (1), 351 Mass. 735. On request of the commission, the board made and filed a report of its findings of fact and its opinion based on the stipulation and exhibits. G. L. c. 58A, \u00a7 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">We summarize the pertinent facts. At all times material to this case La Touraine and Kennedy &amp; Co., Inc. (Kennedy) were corporations duly organized and existing under the laws of this Commonwealth. During each of the years 1962, 1963 and 1964, Kennedy conducted 13.4% of its business outside of the Commonwealth. From and prior to January 1, 1964, and until April 25, 1964, La Touraine owned all of the outstanding shares of stock of Kennedy. Sometime between January 1, 1964, and April 25, 1964, Kennedy paid La Touraine an \u201cintercompany dividend\u201d in the amount of $275,502.44. On April 25, 1964, La Touraine sold all of the shares of stock of Kennedy. La Touraine, Kennedy and two other subsidiaries of La Touraine \u201cparticipated in the filing of a consolidated return of income to the Federal Government\u201d (G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 32 [a] [2]) for the year 1964. The return included, on a consolidated basis, the income of Kennedy from January 1, 1964, through April 25, 1964, and the income of the other reporting corporations for the entire year 1964. The intercompany dividend paid by Kennedy to La Touraine was eliminated from the consolidated taxable income shown on the Federal return.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">La Touraine and its three subsidiaries seasonably filed (with the Commissioner of Corporations and Taxation [commissioner]) a consolidated Massachusetts corporation excise tax return for the calendar year 1964.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This return included the income of Kennedy from January 1, 1964, through April 25, 1964, and the income of La Touraine and its two other subsidiaries for the full calendar year 1964. The return did not include as in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>come the intercompany dividend of $275,502.44 paid by Kennedy to La Touraine.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">Thereafter the commissioner, acting under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 44, as amended through St. 1962, c. 756, \u00a7 10, decided that the intercompany dividend should have been included in the income reported on the consolidated corporation excise tax return filed by La Touraine and its three subsidiaries. He therefore assessed an additional tax based on his inclusion of the disputed amount as income. La Touraine paid the additional tax and applied to the commission for its abatement. G. L. c. 63, \u00a7\u00a7 48, 51. When the commission denied the application, La Touraine appealed to the board. After hearing, the board ruled that La Touraine and its subsidiaries were entitled (a) to file a consolidated return, and (b) to exclude the intercompany dividend from the income reported on the return. It then granted La Touraine an abatement of $20,508.86 based on a computation agreed to by the parties. On request of the commission the board made and reported its findings of facts after which the commission claimed the appeal which is now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">For the calendar year 1964, G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 32, as amended through St. 1962, c. 756, \u00a7 5,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> required the corporation excise tax to be computed on a formula based in part on the corporation\u2019s \u201cnet income determined to be taxable in accordance with the provisions of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>chapter.\u201d The same clause of the statute (\u00a7 32 [a] [2]) provided that: \u201cIf two or more domestic corporations participated in the filing of a consolidated return of income to the federal government, the portion of the excise computed under this clause may, at their option, be assessed upon their combined net income.\u201d The board relied on this statute in ordering the abatement. It said in its decision: \u201cChapter 63, \u00a7 32 (a) (2) provides for the determination of the income measure of the excise tax on the basis of the \u2018combined net income\u2019 of corporations filing a consolidated return with the Federal Government, \u2018at their option.\u2019 La Touraine did file a consolidated return with the federal government and opted for \u2018combined net income.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A9o\">The commission contends that \u00a7 32 (a) (2) does not apply and that the case is instead governed by former G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 63, \u00a7 38, cl. 6, as in effect in 1964, which contained a proviso that: \u201c[U]pon application by a corporation which owns or controls substantially all the capital stock of another corporation, or by the corporation so owned or controlled, the commissioner may impose the tax provided for by this chapter upon the income of the two corporations jointly in the same manner as though they were a single corporation, or may, in such other manner as he shall determine, equitably adjust the tax of the applying corporation.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Purporting to act under its rule making authority, the commission adopted \u201cCorporation Excise Ruling 1958-5\u201d which in part limited relief under \u00a7 38, cl. 6, to corporations (a) whose subsidiaries carried on no business outside the Commonwealth, and (b) which filed an application on a form prescribed by it asking for the elimination of dividends received by a corporation from its substantially wholly owned subsidiary. La Touraine did not file such an application. The commission contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>this failure is fatal. The board rejected that contention and held that La Touraine\u2019s failure to seek relief under \u00a7 38, cl. 6, did not affect its right to proceed under and obtain the benefit of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 32 (a) (2). The board\u2019s holding was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">La Touraine and its subsidiaries filed a consolidated Federal income tax return for 1964. By reason thereof, they were entitled \u201cat their option [to] be assessed upon their combined net income\u201d for Massachusetts corporation excise tax purposes. G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 32 (a) (2). The corporations effectively exercised this option by filing a single excise tax return which combined or consolidated income and other information on the business and operations of all of them. See <em>Felt Process Co. </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn. </em>339 Mass. 651. They required no prior approval of the commissioner to file such a return, and the commissioner had no power or discretion to deprive them of the benefits flowing from the filing of the return. By contrast, G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 63, \u00a7 38, cl. 6, contemplates that either a parent corporation or its subsidiary, not having filed a consolidated return, may apply to the commissioner to impose the excise tax \u201cupon the income of the two corporations jointly in the same manner as though they were a single corporation, or ... in such other manner as he shall determine, equitably adjust the tax of the applying corporation.\u201d The commission\u2019s adoption of the ruling prescribing the form of application and limiting it to corporations whose subsidiaries do no business outside of the Commonwealth does not affect the rights of La Touraine and its subsidiaries. They seek no relief or benefits under \u00a7 38, cl. 6, or under the commission\u2019s ruling, neither of which diminishes or otherwise affects their rights under G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 32 (a) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Because we hold that G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 63, \u00a7 38, cl. 6, is not applicable, we do not reach either (a) the commission\u2019s contention that La Touraine is not entitled to relief thereunder because Kennedy did 13.4% of its business outside of Massachusetts and the commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>sion\u2019s Corporation Excise Ruling 1958-5 limited relief to situations where the subsidiary \u201ccarried on no business outside of the commonwealth\u201d; or (b) La Touraine\u2019s contention that to interpret the statute in the manner urged by the commission would be in violation of various constitutional provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">Finally, the commission contends that if G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 32 (a) (2), permits the filing of consolidated corporate excise tax returns, its purpose \u201cwas to permit corporations, whenever practicable, to use the same material in preparing state excise returns as they used in preparing Federal income tax returns,\u201d but that it does not permit the exclusion of intercompany dividends in computing the combined net income of the affiliated companies. It bases this contention on (a) the absence from \u00a7 32 of any express authority for such exclusion, and (b) the fact that former G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 30, cl. 5, as appearing in St. 1933, c. 327, \u00a7 3, and as applicable to the calendar year 1964, defined \u201cnet income\u201d to mean: \u201cthe gross income from all sources, without exclusion, for the taxable year, less the deductions . . . other than dividends, allowable by the federal revenue act applicable for said taxable year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">The entire statute concerning excise taxes payable by corporations is found in G. L. c. 63, \u00a7\u00a730 through 52, inclusive. \u201cThe legislative intent is to be ascertained from the statute as a whole, giving to every section, clause and word such force and effect as are reasonably practical to the end that, as far as possible, the statute will constitute a consistent and harmonious whole, capable of producing a rational result consonant with common sense and sound judgment.\u201d <em>Haines </em>v. <em>Town Manager of Mansfield, </em>320 Mass. 140, 142. <em>Commissioner of Corps &amp; Taxn. </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>321 Mass. 31, 36. \u201cNone of the words of . . . [the] statute is to be regarded as superfluous, but each is to be given its ordinary meaning without overemphasizing its effect upon the other terms appearing in the statute.\u201d <em>Bolster </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>319 Mass. 81, 84-85. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Authy. </em>352 Mass. 617, 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">Even if read alone, that part of G. L. c. 63, \u00a7 32 (a) (2), which permits La Touraine and its subsidiaries \u201cat their option [to] be assessed upon their combined net income\u201d authorizes them to file a combined or consolidated excise tax return. For the purpose of such a tax return, an \u201cintercompany dividend\u201d stands on substantially the same basis as an intercompany transfer of funds, whether between any of its departments, branches or different business locations. The very words \u201ccombined net income\u201d as used in the statute negative the treatment of such intercompany transfers of funds as \u201cnet income\u201d for tax purposes. The statutory definition of \u201cnet income\u201d as including \u201cgross income from all sources . . . less the deductions . . . other than dividends\u201d does not require a different conclusion. The word \u201cdividends\u201d as used in that context does not preclude the elimination of \u201cintercompany dividends\u201d in the computation of \u201cnet income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">\u201cThe purpose of consolidated financial statements is to reflect the financial condition of a parent corporation and its subsidiaries as if they were a single organization. Thus, in a consolidated balance sheet, the parent corporation\u2019s equities in net assets of subsidiaries are substituted for its investments therein. The profit and loss statement is compiled on the same basis of consolidation, with the elimination of intercompany items.\u201d Hills, The Law of Accounting and Financial Statements (1957) \u00a7 1.9, pp. 36-39.
