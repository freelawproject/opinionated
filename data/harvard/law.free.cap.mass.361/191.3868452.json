The case is before us on Tempesta\u2019s bill of exceptions to rulings allowing an in-court identification by the victim, and to the admission of certain evidence. Facts which the trial judge could have found on the evidence are summarized.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>The victim was walking down the stairs at the Science Park Station of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (M. B. T. A.) on Sunday, March 2,1969, about 8:30 P.M. At a well lighted landing on the stairs, a white male pulled out a gun and ordered her to take off her clothes. She removed her parka. He pulled down her underclothes and had sexual intercourse with her. He was in her presence for a little less than ten minutes. She returned to her apartment, told her roommates she had been raped, and was taken to a hospital by the police for examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">On July 22, 1969, Tempesta at the same M. B. T. A. station was arrested on a charge of indecent exposure, by an M. B. T. A. police officer. It was then stated to him that, at an earlier date, a girl had been raped in the station and that he fitted the description. He was taken to Police Station No. 1 (Station No. 1) and placed in a cell. The arresting officer had given him the so called <em>Miranda </em>case (see 384 U. S. 436) warnings and these were read to him again by Detective McDonough \u201cwhen he first came to the station.\u201d Detective McDonough informed him \u201cthat he was going to be viewed and . . . that he had a right to an attorney at the viewing.\u201d He told him that \u201cwe were going to have a person come down and . . . look at him with regards to another incident and . . . that he had a right to counsel.\u201d Thereafter the victim viewed Tempesta, through a one-way window, in a room with several police officers, who could have been found to have been in civilian clothes, wearing white shirts. He had on a T-shirt. The victim recognized Tempesta. The judge (on a pre-trial hearing on a motion to suppress all evidence obtained by the identification process on July <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>22, 1969, and \u201cany subsequent identification\u201d thereby \u201ctainted\u201d), found that at Station No. 1 \u201cbefore he was looked at by... [the victim] he was notified [of his rights] again and knew what was going on\u201d and that he voluntarily waived the right to have an attorney. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">At trial, the victim was subjected to lengthy cross-examination. Although she testified that she could not specify any particular special feature (nose, mouth, teeth) of her assailant that was not ordinary, she could still identify Tempesta. There was no \u201cspecial facet\u201d of his appearance that made her testify Tempesta was her assailant, but she said \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anybody that looked like him.\u201d She referred to a habit of Tempesta of holding \u201chis head over to the side.\u201d When asked if he \u201ccocked his head,\u201d she said, \u201cYes.... I notice that he still does. And he did that night.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Upon the first remand of the case for further findings concerning the identification (see fn. 1, supra), the judge (1) stated that he was \u201cnot convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that . . . [Tempesta] understood that he . . . [could] have an attorney present during the viewing\u201d at Station No. 1 on July 22,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but (2) found that \u201cthe vic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>tim\u2019s in-court identification of . . . [Tempesta] was independent of her identification and viewing of . . . [Tempesta] on July 22 . . . and untainted and uninfluenced thereby.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">The further findings after the second remand differ from those made earlier, chiefly in minor detail, and in arrangement of the findings. They contain a detailed description of (a) the events of March 2, 1969; (b) the apprehension of Tempesta on July 22, 1969; and (c) the identification at the police station, which the judge decided to be \u201cdeficient in several regards.\u201d As on the earlier remand, he \u201cgave . . . [Tempesta] the benefit of the doubt\u201d and found that he did not knowingly waive his right to have counsel present during the lineup. He concluded that the identification was impermissible for this reason and because the arrangement for the victim\u2019s observation of Tempesta was such that the victim \u201cwas aware that\u201d he \u201cwas the man she was to view.\u201d The judge, however, was of opinion that the police, at the viewing, \u201chad no conviction . . . whether Tempesta was the man wanted.\u201d Although the judge found that the viewing was \u201cso structured as to be unduly suggestive,\u201d he concluded that it \u201cwas <em>not </em>so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification, given the firmness of [the] victim\u2019s impression of her assailant on the day of the rape.\u201d He further found that the victim\u2019s \u201cobservations of . . . [Tempesta] during the March 2 rape were sufficiently clear, convincing, substantial, and consistently reported to be relied on for a conviction.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge reiterated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>his conviction \u201cbeyond any reasonable doubt that the victim\u2019s in-court identification ... is independent of the impermissible police lineup, and that the lineup was not sufficiently suggestive ... to affect . . . her in-court identification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">1. These careful and precise findings (based on \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence [see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>388 U. S. 218, 240] that the in-court identification was not dependent upon the identification at Station No. 1) are well warranted by the victim\u2019s clear and positive testimony, unshaken on cross-examination. In the light of the judge\u2019s findings, we perceive no occasion for suppressing the in-court identification. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>355 Mass. 620, 622; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>356 Mass. 724, 725; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cefalo, </em>357 Mass. 255, 257-258. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Preston, </em>359 Mass. 368, 372-374.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">2. The judge properly admitted testimony of the victim\u2019s \u201cfresh complaint\u201d to her roommate on the evening of the rape. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cleary, </em>172 Mass. 175, 176-177; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hanger, </em>357 Mass. 464, 466; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Izzo, </em>359 Mass. 39, 42-43. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>355 Mass. 526, 529-530.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b205-14\"> On motion of the Commonwealth we have examined the transcript of the proceedings in the Superior Court. The case was decided in the Superior Court on December 15, 1969, before our decisions in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Guillory, </em>356 Mass. 591, and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kazonis, </em>356 Mass. 649. We felt it appropriate to have more complete findings by the judge of the facts pertinent to Tempesta\u2019s efforts to suppress evidence (a) of the victim\u2019s identification of Tempesta in a police station on July 22, 1969, and (b) her in-court identification of him on December 12, 1969. Accordingly, we remanded the case to the Superior Court for such findings. The judge received further evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>on these aspects of the case on October 1, 1971. A transcript has been furnished to us. Thereafter we made a further remand of the case to the judge because of uncertainty whether his findings on the first remand dealt with all the factors discussed in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>388 U. S. 218, 241, quoted in <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Picard, </em>316 F. Supp. 856, 859-860 (D. Mass.), and earlier in 428 F. 2d 1351, 1354 (1st Cir.). The judge, with meticulous care, has now amplified his findings in a manner which we regard as fully satisfying the <em>Cooper </em>case requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b207-7\"> Later, at trial, Tempesta testified that when he was arrested, the M. B. T. A. officer had said to him, \u201cAs long as you come straight and you haven\u2019t had anything to do with this other thing [the March 2 rape] don\u2019t worry about it [the July 22 indecent exposure charge] .... That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t want a lawyer.... I wouldn\u2019t want to wastfe] any money on a lawyer that I could spend on . . . [my] kids.\u201d As noted below, the judge on both remands (see fn. 1) has somewhat modified his conclusion concerning the police station identification on July 22.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b207-9\"> Our decisions in the <em>Guillory </em>case, 356 Mass. 591, 592-594, and in the <em>Kazonis </em>case, 356 Mass. 649, 651-653, dealt with circumstances in which in-court identification were held to be \u201cthe product of tainted pre-trial identification.\u201d See also <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Picard, </em>428 F. 2d 1351, 1353-1354 (1st Cir.); <em>S.C. </em>316 F. Supp. 856 (D. Mass.). These decisions illustrate the great care which should be taken by police to ensure (a) that a suspect knows that he may have an attorney (provided at the Commonwealth\u2019s expense if the suspect is indigent) at a lineup or other similar pre-trial identification, and (b) that, particularly with respect to an unrepresented suspect, the circumstances of the lineup or other pre-trial identification are fair and free from suggestive aspects. Attention also should be given to a more recent decision of the United States Court of Appeals, <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>453 F. 2d 970, 974 (1st Cir.), which further discusses police station identifications and the use of one-way mirrors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b208-6\"><em> </em>He stated that he found \u201cno ground for any reasonable doubt regarding this conclusion\u201d for various reasons, including (a) \u201cthe victim\u2019s demeanor on the . . . stand,\u201d (b) her realization of the \u201cserious consequences\u201d of a mistake on her part, (c) her desire not to convict one who was innocent, (d) her positive testimony that she could have identified Tempesta apart from the July 22 lineup, (e) her ample opportunity to observe Tempesta prior to and during the rape, which left \u201can indelible impression in her memory,\u201d and (f) her lack of any confusion about the identification.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b208-10\"> The judge pointed out subsidiary facts which supported his conclusions: (a) the victim\u2019s \u201cample opportunity to observe\u201d on March 2 for a substantial period of time; (b) the ample artificial lighting on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>the M. B. T. A. station stairs; (c) the certainty of the victim\u2019s in-court identification; (d) the absence \u201cof other conflicting identifications by the victim,\u201d and (e) \u201cthe lack of dramatic effect which the lineup had upon the victim \u2014 as evidenced by her probable inattention to the detail at the lineup.\u201d The judge in his findings \"referred to the careful police surveillance of the M. B. T. A. station in July, 1969, the admissions by Tempesta of previous presence there, and the in-plausible explanation for his presence in the station where he had not been seen using the M. B. T. A. service at any time.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
