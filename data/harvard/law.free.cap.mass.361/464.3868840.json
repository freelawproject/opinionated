Style appealed. The facts are stated largely on the basis of the judge\u2019s voluntary findings. The evidence is reported.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">Louis Shafmaster was treasurer of Style and \u201cin operational control\u201d of that company. Prior to July 8, 1968, he purchased in West Germany three sample rolls of a synthetic fabric (loosely referred to as imitation leather) for use for lining shoes. These were exported to the United States. T. D. Downing Company was employed as customhouse broker. The duty stated on the \u201cInformal Entry\u201d papers <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was nine per cent.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">On July 26, 1968, Shafmaster bought for Style a bulk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>quantity of the same merchandise for an invoice cost of $58,169.94. This material arrived in New York about August 17. On August 19, Style sent the shipping documents to Pistorino. A sample of the material was sent by Pistorino to the Boston Customs House by messenger with a note requesting that the rate of duty be determined. A handwritten reply was received (initialed by a Customs import specialist, Albert Van Bibber) referring to tariff schedule \u00a7 355.81 and a rate of eleven per cent.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">On August 27, Pistorino sent to Style an invoice covering \u201cestimated duty only\u201d containing two items: a duty deposit of $6,398.59 for \u201c2587 rolls [of] leather\u201d and \u201cOceanfreight $2208.75,\u201d representing a \u201ccash outlay\u201d by Pistorino. On August 29 or 30, Pistorino made entry of the goods and was reimbursed by Style for the duty. On August 31, Pistorino sent a final invoice to Style, in which, next to the item \u201cDuty,\u201d appeared in red print, \u201c(Subject to correction by customs).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Abhx\">On January 21, 1969, the Boston District Director of Customs notified Pistorino and Style of an increase in duty of about $35,000 because of a reclassification from tariff schedule \u00a7 355.81 at eleven per cent to \u00a7 359.50 at twenty-five cents a pound plus thirty per cent ad valorem. On May 9, 1969, the additional duty was liquidated by customs at $35,169.96. Pistorino had notified Style of its right to \u201cprotest\u201d the increase. Style failed to file any protest or to avail itself of Pistorino\u2019s offer to be of assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">Frederick Koerner, Pistorino\u2019s executive vice-president, testified that Pistorino obtains a binding declaration \u201cin case a client wants to determine how much the duty . . . [will] be on merchandise which he intends to buy and import.\u201d This, he said, would be done \u201cin case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>the merchandise has not arrived yet\u201d by sending <em>\u201ca </em>sample to Washington and ask[ing] for a decision. . prior to buying the merchandise.\u201d He also testified that Pistorino first \u201creceived the documents\u201d from Style on August 20, 1968, which was the first word Pistorino had of this transaction. No binding declaration was sought, he said (in an answer to an interrogatory) because there \u201cwas not sufficient time to obtain . . . [one] and . . . [Style] did not request one.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">The trial judge made also the following findings and reached the conclusions mentioned below. The merchandise was bought on July 26, 1968, and shipped about August 6. Style first communicated with Pistorino on August 19. Shafmaster and Koerner had no conversations before January 22, 1969. If Style \u201crelied on anyone before it made the . . . purchase on July 26 ... it relied on the duty stated on the papers when it employed T. D. Downing Company as its customs broker\u201d in connection with entry of the samples. Pistorino \u201cacted with due diligence and reasonableness as a customs broker in full conformity with applicable\u201d customs regulations. \u201cShafmaster was a man of considerable experience as an importer of leather and allied products.\u201d From this the judge concluded that he was \u201cfamiliar with the opportunity available to an importer to obtain ... a binding determination of duty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The judge ruled that Pistorino, on the facts found, had no duty (as Koerner in fact testified, in effect as an expert on customs practice) to advise Style about the binding determination procedure. He also ruled that Pistorino was entitled to be exonerated for the additional customs duty ($35,169.86) for which it became liable (see fn. 1, supra).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>1. The demurrer was correctly overruled. There was clearly a controversy about Style\u2019s obligation to reimburse Pistorino for the additional duty. Pistorino, as the customhouse broker and importer of record, became liable for the additional duty in the first instance. It is immaterial that the duty was not liquidated by the customs authorities until May 9, 1969, after this suit was commenced (on May 6, 1969). General Laws c. 231A has long been construed broadly as to the existence of a controversy. See <em>School Comm. of Cambridge </em>v. <em>Superintendent of Schs. of Cambridge, </em>320 Mass. 516, 518; <em>Billings </em>v. <em>Fowler, ante, </em>230, 233-234. See also <em>Nissenberg </em>v. <em>Felleman, </em>339 Mass. 717, 720-722.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">Pistorino was not obliged to postpone its request for declaratory relief until termination of administrative and review proceedings before the customs authorities and the United States Customs Court to protest the increased duty. Style refused or failed to initiate such proceedings. It also did not request Pistorino to initiate a protest in its behalf. See 19 C. P. R. (1968) \u00a7 31.10(d) forbidding a customhouse broker to represent any person in an appeal or protest \u201cunless he shall previously have been . . . authorized to do so.\u201d See also <em>Altieri </em>v. <em>United States, </em>55, C. C. P. A. 104, 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The present proceeding does not involve the correctness of the customs duty in fact imposed and thus there is no question of invasion of any exclusive jurisdiction of the United States Customs Court or of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals. See 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 \u00a7 1541, 1582, 1583 (1970). Cf. <em>Batista </em>v. <em>Nicolls, </em>213 F. 2d 20, 21-22 (1st Cir.), where declaratory relief was prematurely sought concerning the precise subject matter about which further administrative relief was available. The jurisdiction of this court and of the Superior Court to afford declaratory relief is not affected by the circumstance that it may be necessary incidentally to consider questions affecting the duties of customhouse brokers under the Federal customs laws. See <em>Union Brokerage Co. </em>v. <em>Jensen, </em>322 U. S. 202, 204-206; <em>F. W. Myers &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Piche, </em>109 N. H. 357, 359.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>2. The judge\u2019s subsidiary findings are justified by the reported evidence, much of it oral, including the testimony of Shafmaster and Koerner. The findings cannot be said to be plainly wrong. See <em>Hurley </em>v. <em>Hobbs, </em>360 Mass. 618, 621-622.</p>\n<p id=\"AsUz\">The finding, most dependent on inference, is that Shafmaster was \u201cfamiliar with the opportunity available to an importer to obtain ... a binding determination of duty.\u201d This was supported by evidence that Shafmaster had been dealing with the German shipper of the merchandise for eighteen to twenty years, that he had been engaged in importing leather and spent much time in Europe on the importing business; that the samples were imported through T. D. Downing Company \u201cfor the purpose of determining the customs duty that would be employed in merchandise of this type in the future\u201d; and that he had seen the United States Customs \u201cinformal\u201d entry form, used by T. D. Downing Company, at least as early as a pre-trial deposition taken eight months before trial in October, 1970. This \u201cinformal\u201d entry form (see fn. 2, <em>supra) </em>contained a reference to the \u201cbinding determination\u201d procedure. The judge was not required to believe, and obviously did not believe, Shafmaster\u2019s denial of knowledge of the opportunity of obtaining a binding declaration. Although we think this inferential finding permissible we deal with the case without relying on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">3. On the merits, Style\u2019s principal contention is that Pistorino \u201chad a duty to advise . . . [Style] of the availability of a procedure for obtaining a binding determination of duty from the . . . Bureau of Customs.\u201d Style, however, points to no regulation specifically imposing such a duty. There was general evidence about the duties and function of a licensed customhouse broker. See 19 C. F. R. (1968) \u00a7\u00a7 31.1-31.14.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The obligations im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>posed on brokers by the regulations <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> do not appear to be more onerous than the duty to use due diligence and good faith.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Wholly apart from the judge\u2019s finding (discussed in part 2 of this opinion) that Shafmaster knew about the \u201cbinding determination\u201d procedure, the judge was not required by the evidence to conclude that there was any lack of due diligence or good faith in Pistorino\u2019s failure to advise Shafmaster about the procedure. The evidence does not suggest that Style informed Pistorino of any special uncertainty concerning the merchandise or its composition. Pistorino also is not shown to have had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>knowledge of the earlier sample shipment (which carried a nine per cent rate rather than the eleven per cent rate originally estimated on the bulk shipment).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">Such uncertainty as Pistorino may have had was confined to the fact that it was \u201cunable to determine the nature of the material from the documents.\u201d In these circumstances, Pistorino acted with reasonable diligence in obtaining a sample from Style and in submitting it to the Boston customs office for its classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Pistorino thus had in August, 1968, no indication of any uncertainty on the part of either Style or the customs service which might have led to some consideration of using the \u201cbinding determination.\u201d Indeed, the basis of the final assessment in 1969 seems to have been a post-entry test of the merchandise by the United States Customs Laboratory, and a \u201cdetermination that the . . . merchandise was a textile fabric of man-made fibers, not specifically provided for under any other tariff provision\u201d than that (\u00a7 359.50) used in the final assessment. The judge reasonably could have decided that Pistorino was not bound to anticipate such a nonapparent and latent difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The judge was justified in placing reliance on Koerner\u2019s testimony about the occasions when a \u201cbinding determination\u201d would ordinarily be requested. He could also reasonably conclude (a) that such a determination would not be usual where merchandise had already arrived in the United States following a purchase, (b) that such a procedure (fn. 2) was not generally employed except where some special circumstance suggested its use,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>and (c) that any reliance by Style or Shafmaster was on the T. D. Downing Company \u201cinformal\u201d entry rather than on anything Pistorino did or reported or failed to report.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">\n<em>Decree-affirmed with costs of appeal.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b479-6\"> As to the right to reimbursement in such cases, see <em>William G. Young &amp; Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Dyer, </em>112 F. Supp. 1, 4 (S.D. N.Y.). See also <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>United States, 370 </em>F. 2d 870, 873 (5th Cir.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b479-7\"><em> </em>The Bureau of Customs \u201cInformal Entry\u201d form carried a note in small print, \u201cThe rates of duty used in this entry are not binding for future imports. Section 16.10(a), Customs Regulations, tells how to obtain binding rates.\u201d This section reads: \u201c\u00a7 16.10a Tariff classification of prospective imports, (a) Any prospective importer or foreign exporter may apply in writing to the Commissioner of Customs, Washington, D. C. 20226, for a ruling as to the tariff classification of any article which he intends to import into or ship to the United States in commercial quantities. The application shall contain a full description of each article. The application shall also give the following information ... (1) The respective quantities and values of the component materials of . . . the article . . .; (2) information as to its chief use ... in the United States; and (3) any specifications, analyses, or other information deemed necessary to a tariff classification . . .. Whenever practicable, a sample . . . should be submitted . . ..\u201d The remaining paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of \u00a7 16.10a indicate that the process is likely to result in detailed (and perhaps prolonged) administrative consideration. There was evidence that it might take from one week to four months to obtain a binding declaration although, in this particular case, since no binding declaration was sought, Pistorino\u2019s executve vice-president of course could not tell what time in fact would have been required. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>record gives no adequate indication to what extent the procedure for obtaining a \u201cbinding determination\u201d may be comparable in difficulty to obtaining a \u201cclosing agreement\u201d in any Federal internal revenue tax matter. See Int. Rev. Code of 1954, \u00a7 7121; Rabkin &amp; Johnson, Federal Income, Gift, and Estate Taxation, \u00a7 71.04; C.C.H. Standard Federal Tax Reporter (1972),pars. 5692-5693.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b481-6\"> Pistorino\u2019s employee, Udo D. Lampert, an import specialist, obtained the Boston customs officer\u2019s opinion that the sample merchandise was subject to duty at eleven per cent under \u00a7 355.81. He testified that he was not familiar with the \u201cbinding determination\u201d procedure. He, however, was not a licensed customhouse broker and merely handled \u201cimport documentations, to get them ready for Customs.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b483-6\"> Concerning the duties of customhouse brokers, see <em>Union Brokerage Co. </em>v. <em>Jensen, </em>322 U. S. 202, 203-204, stating that \u201cthe consignee of imported merchandise must \u2018make entry\u2019 of them at the office of the collector of customs at . . . [the entry point] either in person or by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>an authorized agent, and this must be done within forty-eight hours of the report of the vehicle which carried the goods unless the collector extends the time. ... To make entry, the contents and value of the shipment must be declared and the tariff estimated, and the production of a certified invoice and a bill of lading is generally required. . . . Speed in making entry is vital, because goods cannot proceed to their ultimate destination until its completion. Apart from the fact that importers cannot always or even often make entries in person, the procedure makes demands upon skill and experience. The specialist ... is the customhouse broker. In addition, he advances the duty in order that the goods may be cleared. . . . The competence of the broker also bears on the efficient collection of customs duties in that the likelihood of additional assessment or refund after final determination of the duty is greatly lessened by accuracy in the tentative computation. But since errors and differences of opinion are inevitable, to insure collection of deficiencies the Government requires a bond prior to release.\u201d The opinion proceeds (pp. 204-205) to discuss, generally the nature of the licensing process, designed to assure (p. 204) \u201ca sense of responsibility and skill\u201d on the part of such brokers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b484-9\"> Section 31.10 defines certain general obligations of such brokers as, for example, \u201c(j) Each customhouse broker shall exercise due diligence to ascertain the correctness of any information which he imparts to a client with reference to any customs business; and no customhouse broker shall knowingly impart to a client false information relative to any such business when such false information is or might be detrimental to the interests of the Government, the client, or any other person, (k) No customhouse broker shall withhold information relative to any customs business from a client who is entitled to the information.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b484-10\"> Style argues that a customhouse broker stands in a fiduciary relationship to an importer served by him. Cf. <em>Berenson </em>v. <em>Nirenstein, </em>326 Mass. 285, 288. Even if we were to assume (without deciding) that Pistorino was a fiduciary, this record requires no finding that Pistorino has committed any breach of fiduciary duty. The evidence justifies a conclusion that Pistorino has complied with proper standards of business morality and good faith and has exercised that due diligence and skill in the circumstances which would be employed by a man of ordinary prudence in dealing with his own affairs. Cf. Restatement 2d: Trusts, \u00a7\u00a7 170, 174.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b485-7\"> The record was somewhat meager with respect to highly complicated Federal customs procedures and the usual practices of customhouse brokers in situations like that here presented. Style\u2019s counsel at trial sought to establish that a binding determination could have been obtained while the merchandise remained under customs bond, subject to shipment elsewhere and resale without paying the customs duty. The evidence adduced on this subject was at best inconclusive, and did not require the judge to decide that, in the circumstances, the additional customs liability could have been avoided. There was no evidence that even the avoidance of the duty would have decreased loss to Style, in view of its possible loss in resale and reshipment of the goods.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
