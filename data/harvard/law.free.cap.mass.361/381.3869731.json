L. c. 231A by the First National Bank of Cape Cod (the First) seeks a binding declaration that the defendant Board of Bank Incorporation (the board) committed error in granting the petition of the defendant Cape Cod Bank and Trust Company (Cape Cod Bank) \u201cto establish and operate a branch office in . . . Provincetown.\u201d The petition of the Cape Cod Bank was opposed by the First at a hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>before the board on June 25,1970, at which evidence was presented by both banks. On August 11, 1970, the clerk of the board informed the First by a letter addressed to its counsel that \u201c[a]t an Executive Session of the Board of Bank Incorporation held on August 7, 1970, it was voted to grant authority to the Cape Cod Bank, . . . Hyannis, ... to establish a branch office to be located on Shank Painter Road near the intersection of Route 6, Provincetown, Massachusetts.\u201d The board made no written subsidiary or ultimate findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The plaintiff brought this bill in the Superior Court alleging that the action of the board was arbitrary and capricious since there was no evidence before it \u201con which a finding of inadequate banking facilities for the public convenience in Provincetown would have been warranted and, in fact, no such finding was made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The board and the Cape Cod Bank filed pleas in bar based on the theory that there was evidence before the board upon which it could have \u201cbased an opinion\u201d that the bank facilities were inadequate. Disposition of the pleas in bar was postponed pending a hearing on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">The judge, after hearing, ruled that \u201cthe Board need not state explicitly that it \u2018finds existing banking facilities in the town of Provincetown inadequate for the public convenience.\u2019 Taken in the context of the facts of this case, such a finding is implicit in the letter of approval ... sent by the Board. ... G. L. c. 172, \u00a7 11 (a), makes the Board the sole arbiter of the existence of inadequate banking facilities. The Board\u2019s decision cannot be attacked on its merits, and the quantum of evidence supporting the decision cannot be re-evaluated. The Board could satisfy itself on the issue of inadequate banking facilities in any manner it might choose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">The findings and rulings made by the judge were adopted as his report of material facts. The plaintiff appeals from the final decree reflecting the findings and rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">1. The plaintiff contends that if the banking facilities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>in Provincetown were in fact adequate the board acted beyond its statutory authority <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in granting the application of the Cape Cod Bank. We have held in <em>Natick Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Bank Incorporation, </em>337 Mass. 615, 617, and <em>City Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Board of Bank Incorporation, </em>346 Mass. 29, 32, that the adequacy of community banking facilities, tested in terms of public convenience, is \u201ca political question, one of governmental policy peculiarly for the determination of an administrative department.\u201d The matter is not subject to judicial review under G. L. c. 30A, the State Administrative Procedure Act, since neither constitutional right nor statute requires the board to give a hearing. We decline to hold that G. L. c. 231A confers jurisdiction on the court to review the board\u2019s action on this question. Compare <em>South Shore Natl. Bank </em>v. <em>Board of Bank Incorporation, </em>351 Mass. 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">2. A second question raised by the plaintiff is whether the board was required by the statute, G. L. c. 172, \u00a7 11 (a), to make formal written subsidiary and ultimate findings of fact. It is argued that the statute requires an express finding of inadequacy, and action taken without first making such a finding is beyond the scope of the statute. We think the argument lacks merit. We have noted that the <em>Natick Trust Co. </em>case, which involved as here an application for a branch in a town other than that in which the bank\u2019s principal office was located but in the same county, made it clear that the statute <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>require an adjudicatory proceeding. The plaintiff argues that the board has the obligation of first finding (prior to approval of the application) that in its opinion the bank facilities are inadequate. However, we agree with the judge that this was implicit in the board\u2019s letter of approval which it dispatched to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. Any requirement of express findings would serve no useful purpose, although appropriate records of any votes taken at its meetings should be maintained by the board and notification of formal action should reflect those votes.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">3. The defendant board has requested us to consider whether the pleas in bar were the proper procedural responses to this attempt to seek judicial review of the board\u2019s action. Since resolution of this question is not necessary to our decision, and since the plaintiff\u2019s bill is framed in such a way as to make resolution difficult without full argument and briefs, we decline to discuss it.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-6\"> General Laws c. 172, \u00a7 11 (a), as amended by St. 1966, c. 200, \u00a7 2, provides: \u201cAfter such notice and hearing as the board may prescribe, a trust company may, with the approval of the board, establish and operate one or more branch offices in the city or town where its principal office is located, or in any other city or town in the same county having no commercial banking facilities or having banking facilities which, in the opinion of the board, are inadequate for the public convenience.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b397-7\"> The statute referred to in the <em>Natick Trust Co. </em>case was G. L. c. 172, \u00a7 45. General Laws c. 172 was completely revised by St. 1961, c. 493, \u00a7 1. The portion of G. L. c. 172, \u00a7 45, material to the <em>Natick Trust Co. </em>case became G. L. c. 172, \u00a7 11 (a). In <em>City Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Bank Incorporation, </em>346 Mass. 29, 32, we held that the amendment was not intended to avoid the holding in the <em>Natick Trust Co. </em>case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
