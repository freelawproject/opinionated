John R. O\u2019Malley, serving as a juror in the Superior Court for Franklin County on January 11, 1968, was injured by a swinging door while on his way to the jury waiting room.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>The issue, one of first impression, is whether O\u2019Malley in his capacity as a juror <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was an \u201cemployee\u201d of Franklin County within G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1 (4), and therefore entitled to receive workmen\u2019s compensation. This question has been decided in five jurisdictions with only one allowing recovery.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">Our Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act defines an employee as \u201cevery person in the service of another under any contract of hire, express or implied, oral or written . . ..\u201d G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1 (4). The claimant must therefore come within this statutory definition before the provisions of the act apply. \u201cThe test used in this Commonwealth to determine whether an individual is, on the one hand, a servant or employee, and thus covered by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act (G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1 [4]), or, on the other hand, an independent contractor, and therefore not covered by the act, is the <em>control </em>which may be exercised over the individual in the performance of his work. If in the performance of his work an individual is at all times bound to obedience and subject to direction and supervision as to details, he is an employee; but if he is only responsible for the accomplishment of an agreed result in an agreed manner, he is an independent contractor. The essence of the distinction is the right to control\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Brigham\u2019s Case, </em>348 Mass. 140, 141-142. It does not follow, however, that one who is not an independent contractor is therefore an employee. For example, this court has ruled that a prisoner is not entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>to coverage. \u201cThe fact that he was obliged to perform labor [in prison] did not constitute him an employee of the county \u2018under any contract of hire, express or implied, oral or written.\u2019 These words as used in the statute imply a voluntary relation between the parties . . ..\u201d <em>Greene\u2019s Case, </em>280 Mass. 506, 508.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">\u201cThe services of a juror are not the result of contractual negotiations, either express or implied, between the individual juror and the county which summons . . . [him] to duty. He functions as part of our judicial system and plays an indispensable part in its overall administration for justice. ... A juror is [only] subject to the control of ... [the] court in its proper exercise of judicial discretion.\u201d <em>Silagy </em>v. <em>State, </em>101 N. J. Super. 455, 466, affd. 105 N. J. Super. 507, certificate den. 54 N. J. 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Moreover, there is no statutory provision which prohibits a juror from continuing with his regular employment outside of court hours. It is common knowledge that many jurors continue to receive compensation from their regular employers during their jury duty (see, for example, G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 IB). Jury service merely causes a temporary separation from a juror\u2019s regular employment, and an employer is prohibited from terminating juror\u2019s employment because of jury service. G. L. c. 268, \u00a7 14A.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">There is no contract of employment, expressed or implied, between the county and the juror. The county merely provides the facilities and other personnel for the court and the jurors. It exercises no control over the juror\u2019s work. Any control and direction exercised over the juror is by order of the court. The juror cannot refuse service nor can the county terminate the service.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Jurors do not constitute an independent organization or body within the judicial system. They perform legal functions imposed upon them in the manner prescribed by law. \u201c[T]hey are an appendage, a branch, an integral part of the court acting under the authority of the court.\u201d <em>Grand Jurors for Worcester County for the Year 1951 </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>329 Mass. 89, 91. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>any supervision exercised by the county over jurors is subject to the final control and supervision exercised by the court. None of the criteria necessary for an employer-employee relationship exists between the county and the juror. We therefore conclude that there is no recovery under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act for injuries received by a juror during jury service.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">\n<em>Final decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b519-7\"> General Laws, c. 234, \u00a7 1, provides: \u201cA person of either sex qualified to vote for representatives to the general court, whether a registered voter or not, shall be liable to serve as a juror . . ..\u201d Jurors\u2019 names are drawn according to statutory provisions (G. L. c. 234, \u00a7\u00a7 17-24), and service is compulsory unless excused by court order (G. L. c. 234, \u00a7 1A). Compensation is paid by the county where the juror is serving (G.
