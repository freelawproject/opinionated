L. c. 168, has authority to arrange for the transfer of funds from savings accounts by withdrawal orders in negotiable form without requiring the depositor or his representative to appear at the bank\u2019s offices. The case was reported without decision by a Superior Court judge upon the bill and exhibits, the answer, and a case stated with exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-16\">The proposed form of withdrawal order possesses the attributes of negotiability required by the Uniform Commercial Code, G. L. c. 106, \u00a7 3-104 (1), as appearing in St. 1958, c. 542, \u00a7 5. It is an unconditional order to the bank signed by the drawer and depositor to pay a sped<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>fied sum, and it is payable to order and on demand. It is contemplated that these withdrawal orders would be available to the depositor on his agreement that they are subject to such notice requirements as may be adopted by the bank or the bank commissioner pursuant to G. L. c. 168, \u00a7 26. The negotiable withdrawal orders would be drawn on a no passbook account and would be payable through a commercial bank. The orders would be presented to the bank for payment in a daily clearing, and payment would occur at its offices. The bank would make returns on stop payment orders, overdrafts, and so forth, and would handle signature verifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">The bank on July 28, 1970, sought approval of the commissioner for the plan. On September 28, 1970, the commissioner denied its request.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">We see no reason in law why the bank should be prohibited from putting its plan into effect. General Laws c. 168, \u00a7 26, as amended through St. 1971, c. 354, \u00a7 2, provides in part as follows: \u201cThe deposits in such corporation may be withdrawn at such time and in such manner as the by-laws direct, subject to the provisions of . . . [certain sections of this chapter] and of other applicable provisions of law.\u201d The bank\u2019s by-laws provide in art. IX, cl. 2, the following: \u201cWithdrawals may be made by presentation of deposit book, other evidence of deposit or other written instrument, by the depositor, his legally appointed representative or another on a written order.\u201d The negotiable withdrawal order is permissible under art. IX, cl. 2, of the bank\u2019s by-laws because it is an \u201cother written instrument\u201d and, also, because under G. L. c. 168, \u00a7 26, quoted above, such method of withdrawal is authorized.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">We do not agree with the commissioner that use of the negotiable withdrawal order creates a new account not authorized by c. 168. Those sections of c. 168 cited by the commissioner in support of her argument do not prescribe procedures for the withdrawal of deposits. They are concerned principally with the types and conditions of the deposits themselves. Thus, c. 168, \u00a7 21, relates to deposits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>made in trust and stipulates those who may receive payment but does not spell out the mechanics of withdrawal. The same comment can be made of \u00a7 22A concerning special notice account deposits. In fact it would appear that G. L. c. 168, \u00a7 26, leaves the establishment of methods of withdrawal to the individual banks. In <em>Brannan </em>v. <em>Eliot Five Cents Sav. Bank, </em>211 Mass. 532, we found nothing in the statute or by-laws to prohibit assignment of a depositor\u2019s savings account after delivery of the bankbook and order by the depositor to the bank. The circumstances here are not dissimilar.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">The commissioner contends that in all savings accounts a passbook is required for withdrawal because certain sections of c. 168 dealing with specialized savings accounts require \u201cdeposit . . . [books] evidencing deposits received under . . . [these sections]\u201d to be particularly titled. See \u00a7\u00a7 22A and 22B. But \u00a7 1 of c. 168, as amended by St. 1962, c. 169, \u00a7 1, defines deposit book as \u201cthe book <em>or other instrument </em>issued to the depositor as evidence of his deposit\u201d (emphasis supplied). This definition guides the reading of \u00a7\u00a7 22A and 22B, and would seem to negate the requirement of a passbook. A negotiable withdrawal order qualifies as an \u201cother instrument\u201d evidencing deposit. As was said in <em>Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Bank Commr. of Maryland, </em>248 Md. 461, 475, \u201cIf ... a depositor of the Bank, on making a withdrawal, has the option of requesting cash, or a treasurer\u2019s check, or of purchasing a money order, . . . according him a fourth option of drawing a check on his own account. . . is a distinction without a difference.\u201d That language is most persuasive and helpful in the determination of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">A final decree is to be entered containing a binding declaration that the bank is entitled to permit its depositors to make withdrawals by means of a withdrawal order in negotiable form, which order may be employed in the withdrawal of bank deposits as proposed and indicated in the case stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
