There were some twenty or thirty stools around the bar plus a few tables and booths near the . . . entrance. . . . [He] passed three stools and a bowling machine and sat on a stool. The other stools were filled. The bar was filled nearly to capacity with about fifty people and it was crowded and noisy. . . . There was another patron . . . sitting on the next stool to the plaintiff\u2019s left who was getting loud and one of the bartenders or the owner [several times] told him to quiet down because he was making a disturbance. He looked like he was falling asleep.\u201d \u201cHe kept putting his head down on the bar like he was sleeping.\u201d Then he would raise his head and yell, \u201c \u2018where\u2019s my drink, where\u2019s my drink\u2019 in a . . . voice that could be heard all over the bar.\u201d The bartender would then give him a drink. After he \u201cfinished a drink, he [would] put his head back on the bar and his glasses would be gone and he\u2019d say T want my drink,\u2019\u201d whereupon he would be given another drink. He was served about five drinks of whiskey while the plaintiff was there.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">There was testimony by another customer at the bar that the owner said that the patron was \u201cnoisy and loud and using foul language.\u201d The owner of the bar testified that the patron sitting next to the plaintiff was \u201cunusually loud and upsetting and was disruptive of the people there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">After the plaintiff had been at the bar about an hour or so he went to the cigarette machine and got a package of cigarettes. When he came back to the bar he saw the patron who had been occupying the stool next to him \u201cfalling over the stool.\u201d The plaintiff tried to \u201cgrab\u201d him and, when he did, \u201cthe patron fell on the plaintiff\u2019s leg.\u201d The plaintiff was injured and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>customers helped him into a taxi which drove him home. Later he was taken to a hospital where it was learned that he had suffered a broken thigh bone. He remained in the hospital about three weeks and \u201cwent home by ambulance on December 31, 1967, in a full body cast. In mid January, 1968, he had a full leg cast applied. He was on crutches until May, 1968, and then used a cane. He was disabled until September, 1968. His leg is permanently crooked as a result of the accident.\u201d The judge in allowing the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict stated that his reason for doing so was that \u201cthe action of the person falling off the stool and injuring the plaintiff was not the kind of violence intended by the Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Carey </em>v. <em>New Yorker of Worcester, Inc. . . . </em>[355 Mass. 450].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">The language in the <em>Carey </em>case which the judge apparently relied on was as follows, at page 454: \u201cThe specific kind of harm need not be foreseeable as long as it was foreseeable that there would be harm from the act which constituted the negligence, provided it was foreseeable that there would be violence toward others.\u201d This language was included in paragraph numbered 3 of that opinion as part of our summary of the judge\u2019s charge. It is apparent that the charge was summarized because the defendant had argued two exceptions concerning it, neither of which involved the precise language here at issue. Taken in context it seems clear that the summary was not intended to be a comprehensive statement of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">In the <em>Carey </em>case (paragraph numbered 1), in response to the defendant there contending that its motion for a directed verdict should have been allowed, we plainly set forth the duty which an operator of a bar owes to its patrons. \u201cThe defendant, as the operator of a restaurant and bar, was in possession of real estate open to the public for business purposes. It owed a duty to a paying patron to use reasonable care to prevent injury to him by third persons whether their acts were <em>accidental, negligent, </em>or <em>intentional. </em>Restatement 2d: Torts, \u00a7 344. <em>Rawson </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Operating Co. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number><em>Inc. </em>328 Mass. 558. <em>Greco </em>v. <em>Sumner Tavern, Inc. </em>333 Mass. 144\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Id. </em>at 452. See <em>Adamian </em>v. <em>Three Sons, Inc. </em>353 Mass. 498, 499. It was open to the jury in the instant case to determine whether the defendant failed to conform to this duty by failing to restrain or remove the boisterous patron, and by continuing to serve him liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">We likewise believe that the jury could have found that the injury to the plaintiff was foreseeable. In the <em>Carey </em>case, at 453, we observed that serving liquor to one already drunk may well make the individual unreasonably aggressive, and enhance the possibility of irrational acts. It is equally true that liquor impairs the individual\u2019s sense of balance. The jury would have been warranted in finding that the patron\u2019s falling from the barstool was predictable, and that the instinctive reaction of one in a nearby position would be to try to catch the falling patron. Involved here, the jury could have found, was a natural, human impulse to come to the aid of a fellowman. We decline to characterize the consequential harm as a \u201cremote possibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">It is also clear to us that the plaintiff\u2019s sitting in the bar next to the inebriated patron, his drinking beer, and finally his good Samaritan act in trying to catch the falling patron do not, as a matter of law, constitute contributory negligence or assumption of the risk. The'\u2019 defendant had the burden of proof on these issues, and this is not one of those \u201crare cases\u201d where it can be ruled as a matter of law that these burdens have been sustained. <em>Halley </em>v. <em>Hugh Nawn, Inc. </em>356 Mass. 28, 30, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
