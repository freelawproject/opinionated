The petitioners are Town Crier, Inc., a corporation publishing a weekly newspaper with circulation in Weston, and Thomas F. Sleeper, the editor of the newspaper. The case has been reported without decision by a justice of the Superior Court upon a statement of agreed facts. G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-12\">The petitioners argue that the respondent\u2019s refusal to make the arrest register and daily log available to them is a violation of his statutory duty to permit any person, at reasonable times and under proper supervision, to inspect and examine public records in the respondent\u2019s custody. G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 10, as amended through St. 1948, c. 550, \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The petitioners\u2019 contention raises the sole issue whether the arrest register and daily log are public records under the laws of this Commonwealth. The peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>tioners do not contend that they have greater rights than the public in the examination of the police records.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">From the record the following facts appear: The petitioners made demand upon the respondent on June 18, 1971, and again by letter dated July 15, 1971, for an opportunity to examine his department\u2019s arrest register and daily log. The respondent has refused to comply with the petitioners\u2019 demand. The arrest register is a bound volume which contains information on each person arrested by the Weston police, including his name, address, date and place of birth, the nature of the offence charged, its disposition, and the identity of the officers involved. The daily log consists of sheets in a loose-leaf binder. Entries regularly made on the sheets concern the investigation and arrest of suspects (both juvenile and adult), reports and complaints received from all sources, and the identity of the officers receiving and responding to reports.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Weston police department has maintained the arrest register and daily log for at least twelve years as an aid to internal communication and for the assistance of department supervisory personnel. There is evidently no town by-law which requires that these records be kept. Pertinent information contained in the records is used to prepare, inter alia, a monthly statistical report of police activity to the town selectmen and a monthly statistical report under G. L. c. 124, \u00a7 9, of the number of persons arrested, by sex and class of offence, to the Commissioner of Correction. The report to the selectmen is made available to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The petitioners\u2019 claim of a right of public access to the police records is based on their interpretation of the statutory definition of public records. G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth, as amended through St. 1969, c. 831, \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>They contend that the statute applies to all town records actually made and not merely to those containing entries required by law but that, in any event, the police records involved in this case fall within the second category. Each contention is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">With reference to the first contention, the critical language in G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, provides as follows: \u201cIn construing statutes the following words shall have the meanings herein given, unless a contrary intention clearly appears : . .. Twenty-sixth, \u2018Public records\u2019 shall mean any written or printed book or paper ... of any .. . town . . . in or on which <em>any entry has been made or is required to be made by law\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). As the petitioners interpret the statute, the term \u201cpublic records\u201d encompasses two categories of books and papers: \u201cnamely, (a) those in which entries have been made, and (b) those in which the law requires entries to be made.\u201d The petitioners achieve this construction by applying the words \u201cby law\u201d in the definition to the second verb phrase, \u201cis required to be made,\u201d but not to the first verb phrase, \u201chas been made.\u201d Under the statute so construed, the arrest register and daily log fit within the definition since both are \u201cbooks containing written entries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">If we adopted the petitioners\u2019 interpretation, governmental records of every nature and description would be subject to public scrutiny. A consideration of the legislative history of the statutory definition of public records refutes this interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">The first statute defining the term \u201cpublic records\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>applied to \u201cany written or printed book or paper ... of any... town, in or on which <em>any </em>record or <em>entry has been or is to be made in pursuance of any requirement of </em>law\u201d (emphasis supplied). St. 1897, c. 439, \u00a7 1. As the petitioners themselves acknowledge, the original statute \u201c[q]uite clearly ... applied only to entries made pursuant to a requirement of law.\u201d The present phraseology was adopted in 1902 when the statute was codified as R. L. c. 35, \u00a7 5. In the report of the commissioners who prepared the revision there is nothing to indicate that any change in meaning was intended. See Report of the Commissioners for Consolidating and Arranging the Public Statutes of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (1901), Vol. 1,392-395.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The general rule is that \u201cverbal changes in the revision of a statute do not alter its meaning and are construed as a continuation of pre-existing law in the absence of some accompanying report of revisers or other indication showing an express purpose to change the substance of the law.\u201d <em>Derinza\u2019s Case, </em>229 Mass. 435, 442. See <em>Main </em>v. <em>County of Plymouth, </em>223 Mass. 66, 69, and cases cited; <em>Ollila </em>v. <em>Huikari, </em>237 Mass. 54, 56; <em>Mackintosh, petitioner, </em>246 Mass. 482, 484; <em>Longyear </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>265 Mass. 585, 588; <em>Neiss </em>v. <em>Burwen, </em>287 Mass. 82, 96.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> While changes in wording in a revision \u201cmay be so violent as to take them out of the general rule ...\u201d (see <em>Great Barrington </em>v. <em>Gibbons, </em>199 Mass. 527, 529, and cases cited; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>New </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number><em>York Cent. &amp; Hudson River R.R. </em>206 Mass. 417, 419), \u201c[t]he present case falls within the general rule.\u201d <em>Neiss </em>v. <em>Burwen, supra. </em>The current statutory definition which follows the 1902 revisi\u00f3n, although less explicit in language than the first statutory definition, incorporates the provision of the original enactment that, for a book or paper containing written entries to be a public record, the entries must have been made pursuant to a requirement of law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">The petitioners assert that any construction other than that which they propose would do \u201cviolence to the language of the . .. [statute]\u201d because \u201cthe phrase \u2018has been made\u2019... [would be] rendered nugatory.\u201d We disagree. The proper construction of G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth, in our view is that the two categories of records encompassed by the definitions are (a) those in which \u201cany entry has been made . . . [pursuant to a legal requirement]\u201d and (b) those in which \u201cany entry... is required to be made by law,\u201d even though such entry may not <em>in fact </em>have been made as required. This construction preserves the clear legislative intention of the original statute (St. 1897, c. 439, \u00a7 1), yet it accords with the familiar axiom of statutory interpretation that a statute should be construed so as to give meaning to all its lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>guage. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Woods Hole, Martha\u2019s Vineyard &amp; Nantucket S.S. Authy. </em>352 Mass. 617, 618, and cases cited. Furthermore, when G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth, was most recently amended, the Legislature in the same act inserted in the public records chapter, G. L. c. 66, a new section, \u00a7 17B, creating eight new classes of records open to public inspection. See St. 1969, c. 831.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We have said that statutes concerning the same subject matter should \u201cbe interpreted so as to give each \u2018. . . a rational and workable effect... to the end that there may be a harmonious and consistent body of legislation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Chelsea, </em>343 Mass. 499, 501, citing <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Director of Civil Serv. </em>324 Mass. 455, 458, and <em>School Comm. of Gloucester </em>v. <em>Gloucester, </em>324 Mass. 209, 212. If c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth, and the new \u00a7 17B of c. 66 are considered together, they confirm our conclusion that the former provision applies only to records with entries required by law. Were its coverage broader, encompassing all governmental records, there would have been no need for the portion of the new section that gives the public access to certain records which do not meet the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>\u201clegal requirement\u201d test but nonetheless are governmental records. See G. L. c. 66, \u00a7 17B, part 1, (c)-(f), (h). For these reasons, we are convinced that, while the Legislature has liberalized access to governmental records since the enactment of the first statute defining \u201cpublic records,\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> it has at no time broadened the statutory definition to cover, in effect, all records kept by public officials, regardless of whether they contain entries made pursuant to a requirement of law. Any further extension of the definition to additional classes of governmental records is clearly a legislative function.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">We turn to the petitioners\u2019 alternative theory that, in any event, the arrest register and daily log meet the \u201clegal requirement\u201d test because they are used to compile monthly statistical reports to the Commissioner of Correction under G. L. c. 124, \u00a7 9, and to the town selectmen at their request. Even assuming arguendo that the monthly reports to the commissioner and to the selectmen are public records within the meaning of G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the inclusion in these reports of data <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>derived from the arrest register and daily log does not make the subsidiary records also public records. Cases to this effect include <em>Steiner </em>v. <em>McMillan, </em>59 Mont. 30, 36, <em>Matter of Andrews </em>v. <em>Police Dept. of N. Y. </em>50 Misc. 2d (N. Y.) 343, and <em>Steel </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>9 Wash. 2d 347, 355-356. See <em>Linder </em>v. <em>Eckard, </em>261 Iowa, 216, 219-220; <em>State ex rel. Spencer </em>v. <em>Freedy, </em>198 Wis. 388, 390-391. Cf. <em>Mariano </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of Marlborough, </em>353 Mass. 663, 665-666. To hold otherwise would as a practical matter nullify the \u201clegal requirement\u201d test which we have just concluded is a part of the \u201cpublic records\u201d definition under our statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">The petitioners direct our attention to certain decisions in other jurisdictions which have given broader scope than we do today as to what constitutes a public record. See <em>Disabled Police Veterans Club </em>v. <em>Long, </em>279 S. W. 2d 220, 223 (Mo. Ct. App.); <em>MacEwan </em>v. <em>Holm, </em>226 Ore. 27, 41; <em>Conover </em>v. <em>Board of Educ. of Nebo Sch. Dist. </em>1 Utah 2d 375, 377. To the same effect is <em>International Union, UAW, Local 180 </em>v. <em>Gooding, </em>251 Wis. 362, 371. These decisions, however, are not apposite because, in each case, the statute construed was less restrictive than G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth. <em>Disabled Police Veterans Club </em>v. <em>Long, supra, </em>at 222 (construing the statutory phrase \u201ca record of all its proceedings which shall be open to public inspection\u201d). <em>MacEwan </em>v. <em>Holm, supra, </em>at 34-35, 43 (construing statute applicable to \u201crecords and files\u201d in the custody of public officer). <em>Conover </em>v. <em>Board of Educ. of Nebo Sch. Dist. supra, </em>at 376 (construing statute applicable to \u201cpublic writings,\u201d including laws, judicial records, \u201c[o]ther official documents,\u201d and \u201c[p]ublic records ... of private writings\u201d). <em>International Union, UAW, Local 180 </em>v. <em>Gooding, supra, </em>at 366-371 (construing statute covering records \u201crequired by law to be filed\u201d and records \u201cin the lawful possession or control of [a public officer]\u201d). Furthermore, an examination of the cited cases indicates that the statutes involved concerned only public inspection of records, whereas by virtue of many provisions in our laws governing public records, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>G. L. c. 4, \u00a7 7, Twenty-sixth, affects not only the citizen\u2019s right to inspect public records, but also such matters as the paper on which public records must be made, the ink to be used on such records, and the proper keeping, destruction, and removal of such records. See G. L. c. 66, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4, 7-9,11, 12. Without an explicit legislative mandate, we are necessarily reluctant to extend the application of these special rules, many of which impose costly administrative burdens. Cf. <em>Lord </em>v. <em>Registrar of Motor Vehicles, </em>347 Mass. 608, 611-612. All police records, however, whether or not they are public records, are subject to being summoned before a proper tribunal in accordance with established rules of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">In view of the result which we reach, there is no occasion to consider whether publication of either the arrest register or the daily log would constitute a constitutional invasion of the privacy of the citizens of Weston.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> While \u201c[t]he existence of any nonstatutory right to privacy has been recognized only to a limited extent in Massachusetts\u201d <em>(Ostric </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal on Motor Vehicle Liab. Policies &amp; Bonds, ante, </em>459, 462), a constitutional right of privacy exists, although its exact dimensions may not be clear. <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>381 U. S. 479. <em>Eisenstadt </em>v. <em>Baird, </em>405 U. S. 438. \u201c[W]hen and if we are confronted with some substantial, serious, or indecent intrusion upon ... [a citizen\u2019s] private life\u201d <em>(Frick </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>350 Mass. 259, 264), we will then deal with the constitutional issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">On the present record, our decision is limited to a holding that the records sought are not public records and, therefore, their public disclosure cannot be forced by a writ of mandamus. Nothing stated in this opinion should be construed as affecting any duty existing in law to disclose arrests or other information (e.g. under a town bylaw) or as prohibiting the town or its officials from the voluntary and nondiscriminatory disclosure, in whole or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>in part, of contents of police records, subject to the rights and privileges of persons named therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">Judgment dismissing the petition is to be entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b697-13\"> \u201cEvery person having custody of any public records shall, at reasonable times, permit them to be inspected and examined by any person, under his supervision, and shall furnish copies thereof on payment of a reasonable fee.

While courts are not bound by an executive or administrative interpretation of a statute (see Sutherland, Statutory Construction [3d ed.] \u00a7\u00a7 5103-5105), we agree in the instant case with the cited opinions of the Attorney General in so far as they interpret the statutory definition of public records as being inapplicable to records which are kept as a matter of administrative convenience but not pursuant to a legal requirement. Since some of the early opinions cited were given shortly after the revision of the original statutory definition in 1902 and before its inclusion in the General Laws in 1921, these opinions also indicate a contemporaneous interpretation. In Assessors <em>of Holyoke </em>v. <em>State Tax Commn. </em>355 Mass. 223, 243-244, we said: \u201cUndue weight, of course, is not to be given to administrative interpretations of statutes which are not ambiguous.
