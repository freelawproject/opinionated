L. c. 40A, \u00a7 21) from action of the board of aldermen (the board). The board, acting as the special permit authority under the Newton zoning ordinance (\u00a7 25-26), granted a special permit to the trustees of Freeport Foundation, who are also named as defendants,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to operate on the locus (on which stands a large single family frame residence) a \u201cdwelling for per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>sons of high school age . . . who are alienated from living with their parents.\u201d A Superior Court judge made careful and perceptive findings. These were adopted by him as a report of material facts. A final decree was -entered sustaining the action of the board. The evidence is reported. Except as otherwise indicated, the facts are stated on the basis of the report of material facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">The locus and the neighbors\u2019 lots and houses are in a Single Residence B zone. The area is a \u201cfine, single family neighborhood\u201d with houses with a market value of $60,000 to $80,000. There are no commercial or business uses in the neighborhood. Section 25-5 permits, as of right, in single residence districts, dwellings for not more than one family, churches, and schools not operated for profit (but not including nursery or reform schools or dormitories). Accessory uses shall be permitted if \u201cnot injurious to the neighborhood.\u201d In addition, the board may permit one or more of certain additional uses, some of which are listed in the margin. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Action of the board must be in accordance with \u00a7 25-26 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>Statutory authority to issue special permits is given by G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 4.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Freeport\u2019s application for a permit was filed on February 2, 1970, and set out the proposed use of this ten bedroom house as a residence for not more than sixteen students (to be charged only actual cost of room and board) under the supervision of an adult couple. The application was referred to the board\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>Land Use Committee, which held a well attended public hearing on April 13, 1970. There was compliance with all requirements of notice and newspaper publication.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">The Committee on April 16 met and voted (either six to one or five to two) to recommend to the full board that the permit be granted subject to conditions, obviously-drafted with great care \u201c in an effort to protect the neighborhood.\u201d These were supplemented by additional safety restrictions on April 23.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A0nb\">The full board (of aldermen) met on May 4,1970. The meeting was open to the public. The chairman of the Land Use Committee read to the full board the committee\u2019s report (contained in a previously prepared typed memorandum describing the Land Use Committee\u2019s views). The report recommended that the permit be granted, subject to listed conditions. The board voted (two members absent and one vacancy), eighteen to three, to adopt the report by an order (drafted by the city\u2019s planning department) set out in part in the margin.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The conditions form part of the order and some of these also are set out in the margin.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The filed copy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>of the order sets forth the names of the three aldermen who voted \u201cNay\u201d and of the two absentees. It was formally filed with the city clerk on May 6, or May 7, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">On June 5,1970, the city clerk accepted and filed a one-page statement prepared sometime after May 4, 1970, by the city legal department. This summarizes the actions of the Land Use Committee and of the board, on May 4, 1970, and theretofore. It recites the substance of the reasons stated by the Land Use Committee\u2019s chairman in his oral report to the board on May 4, and that the board approved the request for permissive use, \u201caccepted the reasons of the [cjommittee as its reasons for ordering such approval, and included in the order all of the restrictions recommended by the . . . [cjommittee.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">Some of the judge\u2019s further findings (apart from stating the conditions, fn. 7) may be summarized as follows: The locus is to be used, for periods ranging from three months to a year or more, as a home away from home for high school students experiencing difficulty with life at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>home. The large house is on a lot 21,170 square feet in area. The students will be referred by schools, psychiatrists, social agencies, and churches. House parents, already selected by Freeport, will be an ordained Methodist minister and his wife, both with relevant experience. The proposed use will not substantially diminish the residential character or appearance of the house or grounds, which have been in a somewhat shabby condition. Indeed, Freeport\u2019s plans will improve the attractiveness of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">After summarizing medical testimony and testimony from school officials, the judge concluded that \u201cthe proposed use of the locus, under the carefully-drawn conditions imposed by the [bjoard . . . will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the zoning ordinances . . . and especially those . . . relating to single residence districts. ... [T]he residential character of the locus itself will not be destroyed and . . . the proposed use, properly conducted, will not be detrimental to the neighborhood . . . [nor] affect the residential character of the neighborhood.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">The judge made various rulings. We deal with those sufficiently argued by the neighbors to require discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">1. The neighbors contend that the board\u2019s decision did not meet the requirements of G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 18, as amended (see fn. 4). Although the decision is cast in the form of an order appropriate for a legislative body, the deficiencies of the decision (as the judge found) are \u201cinsubstantial . . . and not prejudicial to the\u201d neighbors. The first paragraph of the decision states the board\u2019s general conclusions. The unusually detailed conditions (see fn. 7, <em>supra) </em>show thoughtful consideration of the objections advanced in opposition to the permit. They show also the board\u2019s decision on each of them. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>This board, and other boards acting in like situations, should prepare decisions with more specific and complete findings and statements of reasons. Some of the deficiencies were met by the statement of conditions. Others were met by the supplemental statement filed June 5, 1970 (see fn. 8, and related text, supra). The judge, we think correctly, found \u201cno prejudice\u201d to the neighbors \u201cfrom this late filing.\u201d See <em>Dion </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Waltham, </em>344 Mass. 547, 552-553. It was done within a reasonable time by or in behalf of the city clerk charged with recording the proceedings of the board. See St. 1897, c. 283, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">The proceedings on May 4, 1970, and earlier, described in the statement, had been attended by representatives of proponents and opponents of the permit. This accurate statement, the written text of the committee chairman\u2019s report, the order, and the conditions (fns. 6, 7) in the aggregate show the reasons for the board\u2019s decision. See <em>Zartarian </em>v. <em>Minkin, </em>357 Mass. 14, 16-18. This is not a case where there was a complete failure to state or disclose reasons. Cf. <em>Tahanto Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Bourne, </em>346 Mass. 762; <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Great Barrington, </em>352 Mass. 523, 526-527. Cf. also <em>MacGibbon </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Duxbury, </em>347 Mass. 690, 692; <em>S. C. </em>356 Mass. 635, 639. With respect to a permit for an exception, the specific requirements for a variance need not be satisfied. See <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Cataldo, </em>356 Mass. 325, 328. Cf. <em>McNeely </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>358 Mass. 94, 100-101.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">We agree with the judge that there has been compliance with the substance of the requirements of G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 18.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>2. We perceive no fatal vagueness or uncertainty in the standards laid down by the zoning ordinance (see fns. 2, 3, <em>supra). </em>Freeport and its proposed beneficiaries, we think, are clearly an \u201c[association of persons living together in a common dwelling.\u201d The proposed use of the building may also constitute a \u201cdormitory.\u201d In a general sense, Freeport is an \u201ceducational\u201d institution attempting to prepare its high school \u201cclients\u201d for life and to assist them to solve their difficulties in adjusting to their parents. The \u201ccommon and approved\u201d meaning of the words \u201cassociation of persons\u201d includes, we think, such a small group of students under appropriate supervision. See <em>Kurz </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of No. Reading, </em>341 Mass. 110, 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">The board and its committee exercised unusual diligence to make certain (a) that the public convenience will be substantially served by granting the permit, and (b) that there will be no detriment to the public good or derogation from the purpose of the ordinance with respect to a single residence district. They and the trial judge obviously found no ambiguity or vagueness in the terms used, nor do we. See for a somewhat similar situation <em>Salvation Army of Mass. Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeal of Boston, </em>346 Mass. 492, 493-494. There is no such unlimited grant of arbitrary authority to the board as was held to be invalid in <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Newbury, </em>348 Mass. 407, 408-409.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">3. The permit was not invalid because given to Free-port only for its own use and for only so long as its occupancy was without violation of the reasonably imposed conditions. The validity of a permit, thus limited to a single permit holder, was not finally determined in <em>Todd </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Yarmouth, </em>337 Mass. 162, 168-169. In that case, however, it is strongly intimated that the \u201cpower to give permits ... is so worded [see G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 4, fn. 4, supra] as to suggest that personal use may be contemplated.\u201d In <em>Maki </em>v. <em>Yarmouth, </em>340 Mass. 207, 213, we stated that a master (following the <em>Todd </em>decision), who construed a permit considered in the <em>Todd </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>case as \u201cpersonal\u201d to the holder, correctly applied that decision.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We have no doubt that the present permit is not only valid but personal to Freeport and properly dependent for its continuance on Freeport\u2019s compliance with the conditions (fns. 6, 7, <em>supra) </em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">4. Evidence was properly admitted concerning the aspects of Freeport\u2019s activities which were educational in character. Freeport apparently has made some contention (which it has not waived, but which it does not seriously press) that it is an institution organized for public educational purposes. See G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 2 (as appearing in St. 1957, c. 145; see later amendment by St. 1959, c. 607, \u00a7 1). The extent to which Freeport\u2019s project will be such an institution, or will be used \u201cfor any educational purpose,\u201d was relevant in deciding whether its proposed activities were generally appropriate in this residential district.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The Land Use Committee\u2019s oral report to the board on May 4, 1970 (see earlier parts of this opinion), showed what was before the board and one basis on which it acted. The committee chairman testified that he read this report to the full board verbatim in the presence of at least some of the neighbors and their counsel and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>the board accepted that report. This report is consistent with the written order adopted at the meeting (fns. 6, 7) as supplemented by the statement (fn. 8) of the city clerk filed on June 5, 1970. This statement and the report in substance constituted parts of the \u201cdetailed record of . . . [the board\u2019s] proceedings\u201d mentioned in G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 18 (see fn. 4, <em>supra), </em>and were admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">5. The trial judge\u2019s conclusions that the public interest of the community gives support to Freeport\u2019s project and that it will have no detrimental effect on the locus and upon the neighborhood were fully justified by substantial testimony. There was evidence about the need for the project and its public usefulness. There was also testimony that improvements and changes made on the locus for the purpose of the project would not change the exterior of the house, would not make it unsuitable for a single family residence, and in fact would increase its value and the safety of its occupants. Thus, if the permit should not be renewed, resumption of single family use would not be made more difficult. The judge was not required to believe evidence of real estate experts that market values in the neighborhood would be adversely affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed with costs of appeal.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b773-10\"> The trustee of Freeport Realty Trust (which took title to the locus on June 2, 1970) and Freeport, Inc., were joined as parties defendant upon the neighbors\u2019 motion. The judge found that Freeport Foundation was formed (with participation by the First Unitarian Society in Newton as donor of $250) \u201cto . . . operate a \u2018home\u2019 for high school students . . . who . . . cannot live with their families, and to adopt such policies as will be \u2018preventive\u2019 in the sense that young people and sympathetic adults will attempt to provide an environment of cooperative living as a[n] . . . alternative to the . . . \u2018institutions\u2019 usually offered to young people who have become alienated from their families, and by offering . . . assistance to [such] alienated young people.\u201d Freeport, Inc., is a charitable corporation incorporated under G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>c. 180, with purposes similar to those of Freeport Foundation, although worded more broadly to include \u201ceducational opportunities\u201d to high school students and courses of study for the general public regarding problems of high school students and adolescents. After the permit was voted the trustee of Freeport Realty Trust conveyed the locus to Freeport, Inc. The judge found that, for most of the material issues, \u201cFreeport Foundation and Freeport, Inc., may be treated as identical . . . [with] essentially similar purposes and . . . controlled by essentially the same persons.\u201d The word \u201cFreeport\u201d in this opinion, unless otherwise indicated, refers to either or both entities without distinction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b774-6\"> Uses allowable (\u00a7 25-5 [b]) by the board by permit include: \u201c(1) <em>Association of persons living together in a common dwelling. </em>(2) Hospital, sanitarium ... or rest home or other like institution.

The member of the law department who prepared it had in his possession the typewritten memorandum read to the board on May 4, 1970. The statement was not prepared pursuant to specific instructions, rules, or policy of the board. It, however, correctly reflects in substance what the board and its committee did on or before May 4, 1970.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b778-7\"> The judge found further that the board did not act unreasonably or capriciously, that there was ample basis for its action, and that the board\u2019s failure to act within sixty days after the application was filed (see fn. 4) did not adversely affect the neighbors. See <em>Cullen </em>v. <em>Building Inspector of No. Attleborough, </em>353 Mass. 671, 680.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b779-6\"> Doubtless, the failure to adhere to a conventional administrative form of decision, including findings and conclusions, is because the decision was made by a board of over twenty aldermen (accustomed to action in a legislative manner), rather than by a much smaller administrative board of appeals. A large board obviously must rely on its clerk and upon its or the city\u2019s staff in such matters. Confusion and litigation, however, have obviously been caused by the board\u2019s failure to follow more usual practices.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b781-6\"> Cases from other jurisdictions, relied on by the neighbors, seem irrelevant to the validity of the conditions and rest on somewhat different statutory provisions. See <em>Vlahos Realty Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Little Boar\u2019s Head Dist. </em>101 N. H. 460 (decision deals with question as relating to a variance and not to an exception under the closest New Hampshire statutory equivalent to G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 4; see N. H. Rev.

If the neighbors, given opportunity to obtain a voice in the management of the enterprise, fail to take advantage of that opportunity, they cannot reasonably be heard to use their own lack of cooperation to attack this condition imposed for their benefit. Such a condition the board might reasonably waive as insubstantial, if it proves impossible of performance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
