The commissioner had assessed such a tax upon a legacy, under the will of a Massachusetts testator, to certain Florida public charitable institutions. There is a statement of agreed facts amounting to a case stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-12\">Under the testator\u2019s will and codicils, a fund was left to pay certain specific legacies after the death of the testator\u2019s wife. She died in 1967, less than three months after the death of the testator. One legacy of $10,000 was given to Bethesda Hospital, owned and operated by the Southeastern Palm Beach County Hospital District.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Another legacy of $10,000 was given to Congregational Church of the Palms, Delray, a Florida nonprofit cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>poration. The Internal Revenue Service allowed the testator\u2019s estate a charitable deduction for each legacy for Federal estate tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Florida has no inheritance tax. It has an estate tax equal to the credit allowed for State death taxes against the Federal estate tax. No Federal estate tax is assessed on legacies such as these. Such legacies do not contribute to the amount of the credit and no Florida estate tax is assessed or payable by reason of such legacies. If the testator had been a resident of Florida, no Florida inheritance or estate tax would have been assessed or become payable by reason of these two legacies.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">General Laws c. 65, \u00a7 l,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> exempts from Massachusetts inheritance taxes all property transferred by reason of the owner\u2019s death to charitable, educational, or religious institutions \u201cwhich are <em>organized under the laws of, </em>or whose principal charitable, educational or religious objects are carried out within <em>any other state or states </em>of the United States <em>which exempt from similar taxation legacies </em>and devises <em>by its citizens </em>to or for the use of <em>such societies or institutions which are organized under the laws of, </em>or whose principal charitable, educational or religious objects are carried out within <em>the commonwealth\u201d </em>(emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">1. Since Florida imposes no inheritance tax at all, we think it must be regarded as a State (within G. L. c. 65, \u00a7 1, quoted above) which affords Massachusetts charities the equivalent of a reciprocal exemption from inheritance taxes upon bequests made to them by Florida domiciliaries. The obvious legislative purpose of G. L. c. 65, \u00a7 1, is to exempt bequests by Massachusetts residents to non-Massachusetts charities where the States of such charities would do the same for legacies to Mas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>sachusetts charities. Certainly, in the light of this obvious legislative purpose, the effect of the absence of a Florida inheritance tax is the same as an exemption. See <em>Tax Commr. </em>v. <em>Poucher, </em>127 Conn. 441, 447-449, which (at pp. 444-445) gives weight to legislative purpose in construing such statutes, citing <em>Bliss </em>v. <em>Bliss, </em>221 Mass. 201, 210-211. In the <em>Bliss </em>case, in a somewhat different context, the words \u201clike exemption\u201d were construed in the light of whether another State in fact would impose a tax burden upon particular property passing upon the death of its owner.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">2. The same principle applies to Florida\u2019s estate tax (Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 198.02, 198.03, 198.44) which is equal only to the credit for State death taxes allowable against the Federal estate tax. See Int. Rev. Code of 1954, \u00a7 2011 (and amendments through 26 U. S. C. [1970] \u00a7 2011). It is agreed that such legacies as those to the two Florida charities \u201cdo not contribute to the amount of the [estate tax] credit and [that] no Florida estate tax is ... payable by reasons of such legacies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">3. The types of charitable legacies exempt from Federal estate tax appear to be substantially the same as those exempt under the Massachusetts statute. See Int. Rev. Code of 1954, \u00a7 2055 (as amended through 26 U. S. C. [1964], \u00a7 2055; later amendments through the 1970 U. S. Code compilation are not here pertinent). If there is any difference between the scope of the relief from taxes upon charitable bequests afforded by \u00a7 2055 and that afforded by G. L. c. 65, \u00a7 1, the difference relates only to a few corporations, and for present purposes (in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>volving a church and a hospital) is neither relevant nor consequential.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Any such difference obviously has no application to the bequests here in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b625-13\"> Legacies to this hospital district have been ruled by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to be deductible in computing a decedent\u2019s taxable estate for Federal estate tax purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b626-8\"> Section 1 has been amended, in respects here pertinent, by St. 1955, c. 596. Since that amendment and prior to the testator\u2019s death (July 15, 1967), \u00a7 1 was amended in other respects. Since 1967 there have been various further amendments. See <em>Old Colony Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Tam. </em>343 Mass. 613, 615 et seq. See also 1955 Ann. Survey Mass. Law, \u00a7 16.9; annotation, 12 A. L. R. 3d 918.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b627-9\"> The commissioner in his brief properly and expressly disclaims any intention to ask us to follow the \u201cunduly restrictive\u201d and narrow construction adopted in <em>In Re Estate of Parmelee, </em>7 Ohio Op. 455, 461-462, cert. dism. 304 U. S. 544, <em>S. C. </em>133 Ohio St. 519; 134 Ohio St. 420. There are no limitations upon Florida\u2019s complete statutory failure to impose any tax burden on bequests by Florida residents to Massachusetts charities. We thus have no occasion to consider provisions of the type held fatal to reciprocal exemptions in the <em>Poucher </em>case, 127 Conn. 441, 445-447, and in <em>Merrill Trust Co. </em>v. <em>State Tax Assessor, </em>159 Maine, 45, 49-51.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b628-5\"><em> </em>Some suggestion was made at the arguments that <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>343 Mass. 409, dealt with a charitable enterprise which would not be an exempt donee under the Federal statute. Whether the enterprise was thus exempt does not appear in the original papers in the <em>Carroll </em>case. See, however, cumulative list of organizations described in \u00a7 170 (c), Int. Rev. Code of 1964; Int. Rev. Serv. Publn. No. 78 (rev. 12-31-1966) p. 327. See also <em>Dulles </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>273 F. 2d 362, 365-369 (2d Cir.) cert. den. 364 U. S. 834; <em>St. Louis Union Tr.
