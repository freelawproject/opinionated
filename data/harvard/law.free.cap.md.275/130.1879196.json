Levine, the other appellee. The order, as modified by the court below, also directs the company to continue accepting \u201cthe business of physicians\u2019 and surgeons\u2019 liability insurance in the State of Maryland, by receiving <em>all </em>new applications . . . , and by considering for renewal <em>all </em>outstanding policies for such insurance issued by the Company which have expiration dates on or after January 1, 1975 ... .\u201d (emphasis added). We granted a Writ of Certiorari and advanced the case for argument because of the important issues that are presented, and the critical circumstances that have developed in regard to medical malpractice insurance in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Following the oral argument on March 21, 1975, we issued a per curiam order in which, after concluding that the statutory basis for the orders passed by the commissioner and the court below\u2014Maryland Code (1957, 1972 Repl. Vol., 1974 Cum. Supp.) Art. 48A, \u00a7 234A \u2014 \u201c[is] not applicable to the decision of the appellant-insurer to cease writing its entire line of medical malpractice insurance policies in this State,\u201d we ruled \u201cthat upon the filing of [this] opinion in [the] cast, and the subsequent issuance of the Court\u2019s mandate,\u201d the order of the Baltimore City Court would be reversed with directions to cause the order of the commissioner to be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The company, a \u201cmulti-line\u201d insurance carrier operating throughout the United States and in other countries, is authorized to do business in Maryland by virtue of a certificate of authority issued by the commissioner. In the late 1930\u2019s or early 1940\u2019s, it became one of the first insurers to market what is commonly referred to as medical malpractice insurance. In 1960, it commenced a special relationship with the Maryland Medical and Chirurgical Faculty (Med-Chi), whereby it became the sponsored insurer of its members for medical malpractice insurance. At that time, as is the case today, the company was one of approximately twelve writing such insurance in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">The sponsorship arrangement imports neither group <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>insurance nor a contractual relationship. The company simply commits itself to provide medical malpractice insurance to the members of Med-Chi, and each individual physician is issued a separately underwritten policy. Med-Chi merely agrees \u201cto work with\u201d the company in the areas of loss prevention and in the review and processing of claims. At the commencement of the relationship in 1960, the company wrote between 15 and 20 percent of medical malpractice insurance marketed in Maryland; by 1974, under the sponsorship arrangement, it had become the insurer for some 3,600 physicians, or approximately 85 percent of those practicing in the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">With the advent of specialization and greater complexity in the practice of medicine have come increasing demands upon the insurance companies handling medical malpractice insurance. Claims adjusters and defense attorneys in this field must now possess a specialized expertise. Not surprisingly, therefore, these circumstances, together with other developments in medical malpractice litigation, have increased the underwriting risk of this form of coverage, and have reduced the national market to some 12 insurance companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">As this case demonstrates, however, nothing reflects the impact of these trends more impressively than the dramatic rise which has occurred in the cost of such insurance in the last few years. In September 1973, the company filed a request for a rate increase of 59.7 percent which was denied on the following November 13. As the result of a conference between the commissioner and company representatives, an amended request for an increase of 45.9 percent was filed, which was granted effective January 4,1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Reacting sharply to the action of the commissioner in paring its request, the company wrote to the executive director of Med-Chi that it could not continue to write medical malpractice coverage on what it characterized as \u201ca net loss basis.\u201d After summarizing the efforts it had made to obtain rate relief, it predicted that the loss experience would continue \u201cto deteriorate.\u201d Hence, an early request for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>additional rate relief was likely. It concluded with this statement: \u201cShould there be a lengthy delay in acting upon the 1974 rate increase, or if the request is denied, we will be unable to' continue in our present capacity as the sponsored carrier in Maryland beyond 1974.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Subsequently, a request was made for an increase of 48 percent which was denied in May 1974. In rejecting this request, the commissioner assigned several reasons, the essence of which was that he disagreed with the actuarial procedures employed by the company in assembling its request. Further administrative and judicial review of the commissioner\u2019s action was not sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Upon the rejection of the rate increase, the company wrote to both the commissioner and Med-Chi on June 17, 1974, and announced that a new sponsored insurer should be sought, since it would \u201ccease writing physicians and surgeons professional liability in Maryland by January 1, 1975.\u201d It promised \u201cto provide [its] normal market until such time as a new sponsored carrier [was] designated by Med-Chi, or January 1,1975, whichever occur [red] first.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">On November 14, 1974, the company directed a \u201cnotice of non-renewal\u201d to Dr. Levine in which he was advised that his two policies (\u201cprimary\u201d and \u201cexcess\u201d coverage), which were scheduled to expire on January 1 and 2, 1975, respectively, would not be renewed. In an accompanying explanation, the company summarized its unsuccessful efforts to obtain what it regarded as the necessary rate relief. The thrust of its position was that in its 13-year relationship with Med-Chi, it had incurred an alleged \u201cdeficit on this line of business in Maryland of nearly $10,000,000.\u201d Hence, it was compelled \u201cto withdraw from Maryland for this line of business.\u201d At the same time, the company initiated a similar procedure of issuing notices to all of the physicians it insured in Maryland 45 days in advance of their respective expiration dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Upon a complaint being lodged with the commissioner by Dr. Levine, a hearing was scheduled which was held on December 20 and 23, 1974. The commissioner ruled that \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>234A, as amended by chapter 752 of the Laws of 1974, was applicable, and that the company had not met its burden of persuasion to \u201cdemonstrate that the . . . refusal to underwrite or renew [was] justified ... .\u201d Consequently, he ordered the company to renew Dr. Levine\u2019s policies, and to \u201caccept the business of Physicians\u2019 and Surgeons\u2019 liability insurance in the State of Maryland ... at currently approved rates ... .\u201d In so ruling, the commissioner observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-6\">\u201cThe statute in question specifically limits the action of an insurer (or agent or broker) in making what is termed \u2018underwriting decisions\u2019 (refusal to write a risk or class of risk in the first instance, the cancellation of a risk or class of risk in midterm or the failure to renew a risk or class of risk at the end of a policy period), in three distinct areas. These include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-7\">\u201c1. Underwriting decisions based \u2018in whole or in part upon race, color, creed or sex of an applicant or policyholder.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-8\">\u201c2. Underwriting decisions based on \u2018any arbitrary, capricious, or unfairly discriminatory reason.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-9\">\u201c3. Underwriting decisions not based on \u2018standards which are reasonably related to the insurer\u2019s economic and business purposes.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">He then found that the company had violated standards \u201c2\u201d and \u201c3\u201d in reference to both Dr. Levine, an individual risk, and the medical community as a whole, a class of risk. On appeal to the Baltimore City Court, as we noted earlier, the order of the commissioner was modified and, as modified, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">In this Court, the company advances these contentions:</p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">1) Section 234A does not apply because the company has made a general business decision not to underwrite an entire category of insurance, rather than a specific decision involving only a \u201cparticular insurance risk or class of risk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>2) The company has met its burden of persuasion of showing its decision to have been by the application of standards which are reasonably related to its economic and business purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">3) That \u00a7 234A is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Since we agree-that the statute is inapplicable to this case, it is unnecessary for us to decide the remaining two points.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Section 234A was first enacted as chapter 417 of the Laws of 1970. In relevant part, it then prohibited any insurer from cancelling and refusing to underwrite or to renew \u201ca particular insurance risk or class of risks for any arbitrary, capricious, unfair or discriminatory reason, based in whole or in part upon the race, creed, color, religion, national origin, or place of residency of an applicant or policyholder.\u201d From the very beginning, \u00a7 234A has been included in the subtitle of the insurance code labeled \u201cUnfair Trade Practices.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">By chapter 789 of the Laws of 1971, \u00a7 234A was repealed and re-enacted so as to provide in pertinent part: \u201c(a) No insurer, agent or broker shall cancel or refuse to underwrite or renew a particular insurance risk or class of risk for any reason based in whole or in part upon race, color, creed or sex of an applicant or policyholder or for any arbitrary, capricious, or unfairly discriminatory reason. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">We considered \u00a7 234A, in light of the 1971 amendment, in <em>Insurance Comm\u2019r v. Allstate Ins., </em>268 Md. 428, 302 A. 2d 200 (1973), where two automobile liability policies had been non-renewed, one because of a series of accidents and the other because of an accumulation of violations. In upholding a decision for the insurers, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-10\">\u201cIt is clear to us that the principal thrust of this legislation was directed toward any action of an insurer in failing to underwrite or renew a particular risk or class of risk for any reason based in whole or in part upon race, color, creed or sex of an applicant or policyholder for any arbitrary, capricious or unfairly discriminatory reason <em>like </em>those specifically mentioned, including, but not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>restricted to, religion, national origin, place of residency or other similar irrelevant considerations. In short, the General Assembly intended to broaden the scope of \u2018arbitrary, capricious, or unfairly discriminatory reason,\u2019 but within the frame of reference of the specifically mentioned \u2018reasons.\u2019 \u201d 268 Md. at 442 (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-3\">Our decision in <em>Allstate </em>led directly to the enactment of chapter 752 of the Laws of 1974, which produced \u00a7 234A in its present form. Expressly referring to <em>Allstate </em>by name, the General Assembly in a preamble to the amended law recited its determination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-4\">\u201c. . . that all underwriting decisions of insurers and insurance agents and brokers, with regard to both eligibility and acceptability of applicants for insurance and insureds, [should] be made solely on the basis of a reasonable application to relevant facts of underwriting principles, standards and rules that can be demonstrated objectively to measure the probability of a direct and substantial adverse effect upon losses or expenses of the insurer... .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">The General Assembly also determined that the general welfare of the people \u201cis insufficiently assured and inadequately promoted merely upon a showing by insurers . . . that their underwriting decisions\u201d are not based on the historic prejudices such as \u201crace, color, religion or creed, sex, national origin or place of residence and the like.\u201d Thus, it added the last two sentences to subsection (a) of \u00a7 234A. which now provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">\u201c(a) No insurer, agent or broker shall <em>cancel or refuse to underwrite or renew a particular-insurance risk or class of-risk </em>for any reason based in whole or in part upon race, color, creed or sex of an applicant or policyholder or for any arbitrary, capricious, or unfairly discriminatory reason. . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>No insurer, agent or broker may <em>cancel or refuse to underwrite or renew a particular insurance risk or class of risk </em>except by the application of standards which are reasonably related to the insurer\u2019s economic and business purposes. At any hearing to determine whether there has been a violation of this section, the burden of persuasion shall be upon the insurer to demonstrate that the cancellation, or refusal to underwrite or renew is justified under the standards so demonstrated.\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The company contends that it decided to withdraw entirely from the medical malpractice insurance market in Maryland because of \u201cdeteriorating\u201d conditions in that line, the unsympathetic regulatory climate, and the fact that it had lost over $10,000,000 in that market and was continuing to lose money. To demonstrate the accuracy of this appraisal, it points to the fact that no other insurance carrier has offered to furnish any of the coverage being relinquished by the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">In pressing its argument that \u00a7 234A is inapplicable, the company maintains that the statute is aimed at individual underwriting decisions involving \u201ca particular risk or class of risk,\u201d not at general policy decisions, made at the highest corporate level, affecting a complete line of insurance such as medical malpractice coverage. Thus, the company contends that the words \u201crisk or class of risk,\u201d within the contemplation of \u00a7 234A, actually mean \u201cperson or class of persons.\u201d This view, says the company, is consistent with the statutory purpose \u201cto provide for non-discriminatory treatment of individual risks, and for equal treatment for those risks falling within the same proper rating classification.\u201d As the company sees it, therefore, it is free to determine which line of insurance it will offer, but once it elects to underwrite a category or line of insurance, the statute requires that it not discriminate, without justification, between persons or classes of persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">The commissioner, on the other hand, concerned with what he regards as a form of blackmail in the pursuit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>higher insurance rates, argues that the company cannot refuse to underwrite medical malpractice insurance in this state without showing the decision to be based on \u201cstandards which are reasonably related to the insurer\u2019s economic and business purposes.\u201d Although conceding that an insurer may withdraw from an entire line of insurance, he maintains that medical malpractice insurance is not an entire line, but merely a \u201cclass of risk\u201d within the line designated \u201cliability other than automobile\u201d; and that an insurer, therefore, cannot discontinue underwriting medical malpractice insurance, without justifying its decision under \u00a7 234A, unless it withdraws from all \u201cliability other than automobile.\u201d Thus, absent such a withdrawal or compliance with \u00a7 234A, the company must continue to underwrite medical malpractice insurance for an indeterminate period.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Essentially, then, the applicability <em>vel non </em>of \u00a7 234A turns upon the meaning of the words, \u201ccancel or refuse to underwrite or renew a particular insurance risk or class of risk,\u201d as they are used in that section. As we have frequently said, the cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and carry out the real legislative intent, <em>Md.-Nat\u2019l Cap. P. </em>&amp; <em>P. v. Rockville, </em>272 Md. 550, 555, 325 A. 2d 748 (1974:); <em>Radio Com., Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>271 Md. 82, 93, 314 A. 2d 118 (1974); <em>Scoville Serv., Inc. v. Comptroller, </em>269 Md. 390, 393, 306 A. 2d 534 (1973); <em>Silberman v. Jacobs, </em>259 Md. 1, 267 A. 2d 209 (1970); and in ascertaining that intent, the Court considers the language of an enactment in its natural and ordinary signification, <em>Md.-Nat\u2019l Cap. P. &amp; P. v. Rockville, supra, </em>272 Md. at 556; <em>City of Gaithersburg v. Mont. Co., </em>271 Md. 505, 511, 318 A. 2d 509 (1974); <em>Radio Com., Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">In deciding the meaning of the word \u201crisk,\u201d as used in \u00a7 234A, the following statement from 12 Appleman, <em>Insurance Law and Practice, </em>\u00a7 7121, at 154-55 (1943), which we have quoted frequently, is apposite:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-7\">\u201cIn the absence of statute, it is purely voluntary on the part of the company as <em>to whom </em>it will insure, and it is under no duty to write insurance for any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>particular <em>applicant. </em>The insurer is at liberty to choose its own <em>risks </em>and may accept or reject <em>applicants </em>as it sees fit.\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. v. Ins. Comm\u2019r, </em>273 Md. 467, 478, 330 A. 2d 653 (1975); <em>Insurance Comm\u2019r v. Allstate Ins., </em>268 Md. 428, 441, 302 A. 2d 200 (1973); <em>Edelstein v. Nationwide Mut. Ins., </em>252 Md. 455, 462, 250 A. 2d 241 (1969).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">This statement suggests that the word \u201crisk,\u201d which is used synonymously with the words \u201cwhom\u201d and \u201capplicant,\u201d refers in this context to the person being insured. Similar use of the word was made in <em>Insurance Comm\u2019r v. Allstate Ins., supra, </em>quoting from <em>Edelstein v. Nationwide Mut. Ins., supra, </em>252 Md. at 461:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-8\">\u201cIt is well established in Maryland and generally that an insurance company has the unqualified right to select the <em>risks </em>it considers profitable to insure and the company is under no obligation to accept an insurance <em>application </em>submitted by its agent or broker. . . .\u201d 268 Md. at 440 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">The language of the first sentence of \u00a7 234A itself suggests that \u201crisk,\u201d as used in that section, was intended to mean person or applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">Clearly, then, the evil aimed at by the statute is discrimination against individuals or classes of individuals. When the Legislature added a new standard to \u00a7 234A in the 1974 amendment, it did so by inserting the identical language, \u201cparticular insurance risk or class of risk,\u201d immediately following the prior enactment. This must be regarded as a manifestation of intent that this phrase, as used in the amendment, should have the same meaning that it already had in the original statute. Section 234A, therefore, although now containing broader substantive standards, continues to be aimed at discrimination against individuals or classes of individuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">The commissioner claims, however, that even if a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>\u201cparticular insurance risk\u201d means an individual person and a \u201cclass of risk\u201d means a class of persons, the company must nevertheless renew the insurance for each physician unless it can comply with the standards of \u00a7 234A. In other words, despite its avowed departure from the entire line of medical malpractice insurance, the company is no less engaged at the same time in non-renewing Dr. Levine and each of the other individual physicians to whom it has sent similar notices. According to this view, the company\u2019s complete withdrawal from the medical malpractice market in Maryland, and the non-renewal of <em>all </em>of the 3,600 physicians it insures, does not relieve the company from compliance with \u00a7 234A. The company must justify the non-renewal of all of them. Under this interpretation, no insurer could ever refuse to offer any category of insurance to an individual applicant, even though it had previously never underwritten such coverage, without first complying with \u00a7 234A. This would follow because the statute refers to \u201ccancel or refuse to underwrite or renew\u201d collectively. Hence, it is directed not only at non-renewals and cancellations, but at refusals to underwrite, which the commissioner, in his own order below, defines as a \u201crefusal to write a risk or class of risk <em>in the first instance. </em>\u201d (emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Logically, then, the commissioner\u2019s interpretation would mean that <em>all </em>insurers could be required to underwrite any given line of insurance, since the statute makes no distinction between underwriting \u201cin the first instance,\u201d and the non-renewal of existing policies. That no such result was intended is evident from the plain language of \u00a7 234A. The general rule is that the courts may not surmise a legislative intention contrary to the plain language of a statute, nor insert or omit words to make the statute express an intention not evident in its original form. Therefore, in the absence of ambiguity, the courts should, as a general rule, confine themselves to a construction of a statute as written, and not attempt, under the guise of construction, to supply omissions or remedy possible defects in these statutes. <em>Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. v. Ins. Comm\u2019r, supra, </em>273 Md. at 481-82; <em>Patapsco Trailer v. Eastern Freight., </em>271 Md. 558, 563-64, 318 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>A. 2d 817 (1974); <em>Radio Com., Inc. v. Public Serv. Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>271 Md. at 94-95; <em>Scoville Serv., Inc. v. Comptroller, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Furthermore, if the words \u201cparticular insurance risk,\u201d referring to each individual person no matter how many there are in the aggregate, could be applied in this manner to every case, as urged by the commissioner, then the phrase \u201cor class of risk\u201d would be completely superfluous. Absent a clear indication to the contrary, a statute, if reasonably possible, is to be read so that no word, clause, sentence or phrase shall be rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory. <em>A.H. Smith Sand </em>&amp; <em>Gravel v. Dep\u2019t, </em>270 Md. 652, 659, 313 A. 2d 820 (1974); <em>Baltimore City v. United Stores, </em>250 Md. 361, 368-69, 243 A. 2d 521 (1968); <em>Thomas v. Police Commissioner, </em>211 Md. 357, 361, 127 A. 2d 625 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">In light of the evident purposes of \u00a7 234A, the words \u201cparticular insurance risk or class of risk\u201d mean that the statute applies to decisions aimed at individual persons or classes of persons, but not to decisions, such as the one here, which concern an entire line of insurance. In short, an insurer may determine independently of \u00a7 234A whether it will underwrite a given line of insurance, but once it elects to do so, it must insure every individual or class of individuals desiring such insurance, or else justify its refusal under \u00a7 234A.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Lastly, the commissioner contends that an insurer can make such basic decisions to underwrite or not underwrite an entire line of insurance without being subjected to the scrutiny mandated by \u00a7 234A only if the specific market, such as medical malpractice coverage in this case, actually constitutes a \u201cline\u201d of insurance. By this, as we suggested earlier, he means that an insurer may withdraw from a line, but not <em>k </em>lesser category. The commissioner attributes to the word \u201cline\u201d a technical meaning. He claims that each of the categories listed on the certificate of authority which he issues to each insurer is a \u201cline\u201d of insurance. Medical malpractice insurance, according to the commissioner, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>merely a \u201cclass\u201d of insurance within the \u201cline\u201d described as \u201cliability other than automobile.\u201d Under this view, the company is free to withdraw from the medical malpractice insurance market \u2014 independently of \u00a7 234A \u2014 only if it also withdraws from the entire \u201cline\u201d.designated as \u201cliability other than automobile.\u201d This argument proves too much.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-3\">Were the statute to be read so as to require the company to justify its non-renewal of medical malpractice insurance, so long as it continued to underwrite all other \u201cliability other than automobile\u201d insurance, then the other companies writing the latter insurance in Maryland \u2014 approximately 300 in number \u2014 would also be compelled to justify their refusal to underwrite medical malpractice coverage. This result would follow, we think, from the meaning of the statutory language, \u201ccancel or refuse to underwrite or renew,\u201d to which we referred earlier. In effect, the argument of the commissioner, if adopted, would ascribe to \u00a7 234A an intention to create an \u201cassigned risk\u201d plan, which even he concedes would require express statutory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">As we noted earlier, chapter 752 was a direct response to our decision in <em>Allstate. </em>There, we had held that despite the 1971 amendment, \u00a7 234A continued to be directed only at the historic prejudices enumerated in the first sentence of the statute or \u201c. . . any arbitrary, capricious or unfairly discriminatory reason <em>like </em>those specifically mentioned ... .\u201d <em>Insura,nee Comm\u2019rv. Allstate Ins., supra, </em>268 Md. at 442 (emphasis in original). Consequently, the statute, as then written, did not apply to the two non-renewals being contested there, which were based on' a series of automobile accidents and on an accumulation of traffic violations. The General Assembly, in its preamble to chapter 752, stated that \u201cthe general'welfare of the people ... is insufficiently assured and inadequately promoted\u201d by such a limited statutory scheme. By 1974, a discernible pattern had emerged suggesting a tendency on the part of some automobile insurers to seize upon a given number of accidents or violations during the insurance term \u2014 sometimes as few as one \u2014 as the purported basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>non-renewal. The Legislature was concerned that such underwriting policies might not be justified by the actual risk experience of those insurers. The 1974 amendment, therefore, was designed \u201c... to correlate insurance acceptability with \u2018relevant facts of underwriting principles, standards and rules that can be demonstrated objectively . . . <em>Gov\u2019t Employees Ins. v. Ins. Comm\u2019r, supra, </em>273 Md. at 483. Chapter 752, in short, was conceived to eliminate underwriting decisions of the kind which were challenged in <em>Allstate, </em>except when made by \u201cthe application of standards . . . reasonably related to the insurer\u2019s economic and business purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">In sum, as its placement under the subtitle \u201cUnfair Trade Practices\u201d also tends to suggest, \u00a7 234A is aimed at underwriting decisions which discriminate against an individual or a class of individuals, not at business decisions to withdraw from an entire line of insurance. Since the company has not discriminated against an individual physician or a class of physicians, that is, since its decision does not single out Dr. Levine or any other individual physician or class of physicians, \u00a7 234A does not apply. For these reasons, the complaints against the company should have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed; remanded to the Baltimore City Court with directions to vacate the order of the Insurance Commissioner of Maryland dated January 21, 1975; appellee, Insurance Commissioner, to pay costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b166-7\">\n<em>Eldridge, J,</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Ad2\">\n<em>dissenting:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">The majority concludes that \u00a7 234A of the Insurance Code <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is \u201caimed at discrimination against individuals or classes of individuals.\u201d Yet the Court somehow also concludes that physicians seeking professional liability or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>malpractice coverage do not constitute a class of individuals covered by \u00a7 234A. I would hold that medical malpractice coverage for physicians fits precisely in the term \u201cclass of risk\u201d as used in \u00a7 234A.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">This Court has once before taken a very narrow view of the scope of coverage of \u00a7 234A. In <em>Insurance Comm\u2019r v. Allstate Ins., </em>268 Md. 428, 302 A. 2d 200 (1973), the Court held that an earlier version of \u00a7 234A was restricted to prohibiting discrimination only on the basis of factors such as race, religion, sex, national origin and place of residency. The legislative reaction to that decision was swift and decisive. The General Assembly enacted Ch. 752 of the Acts of 1974. The Legislature stated in the preamble of Ch. 752 that: \u201c[T]he general welfare of the People of Maryland . . . is inadequately assured . . . merely upon a showing by insurers . . . that their underwriting decisions are made without reasons based . . . upon considerations as race, color, religion or creed, sex, national origin or place of residency and the like <em>. . . .\u201d </em>The Legislature further determined that \u201cthe general welfare . . . requires that <em>all underwriting decisions </em>of insurers ... be made solely on the basis of a reasonable application to relevant facts of underwriting principles, standards and rules that can be demonstrated objectively to measure the probability of a direct and substantial adverse effect upon losses or expenses of the insurer in light of the approved rating plan or plans of the insurer then in effect . . . .\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Ch. 752 amended \u00a7 234A of Art. 48A by adding the two sentences which appear at the end of subsection (a) as it now stands:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\">\u201cNo insurer, agent or broker shall cancel or refuse to underwrite or renew a particular insurance risk or class of risk for any reason based in whole or in part upon race, color, creed or sex of an applicant or policy-holder or for any arbitrary, capricious, or unfairly discriminatory reason. . . . No insurer, agent or broker may cancel or refuse to underwrite or renew a particular insurance risk or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>class of risk except by the application of standards which are reasonably related to the insurer\u2019s economic and business purposes. At any hearing to determine whether there has been a violation of this section, the burden of persuasion shall be upon the insurer to demonstrate that the cancellation, or refusal to underwrite or renew is justified under the standards so demonstrated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">The intent of the Legislature, that <em>\u201call </em>underwriting decisions\u201d be based on underwriting criteria having a reasonable relation to the insurer\u2019s economic and business purposes, is in conflict with the Court\u2019s limitation in this case of the applicability of \u00a7 234A. This is particularly troublesome in view of the Legislature\u2019s explicit broadening of the scope of \u00a7 234A in response to our decision in <em>Allstate.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">The majority\u2019s holding is based on an arbitrary denomination of medical malpractice coverage as being a \u201cline of insurance\u201d rather than a \u201cclass of risk.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In making this important choice of terms, the majority rejects the Insurance Commissioner\u2019s determination that medical malpractice is a \u201cclass of risk\u201d within the line of insurance of \u201cliability other than automobile.\u201d This is indeed a \u201ctechnical\u201d definition, as the majority labels it, which the Commissioner in the exercise of his expert judgment has made. When reviewing questions arising in a complex area such as the regulation of insurance, we should give significant weight to determinations made by expert administrative bodies. A. Davis, <em>Administrative Law </em>\u00a7 30.09, at 243 (1958). The majority offers no basis in law or fact for preferring their presumably nontechnical formula to the Commissioner\u2019s \u201ctechnical\u201d definition of a \u201cline of insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>If, as the majority suggests, \u00a7 234A is meant only to prevent discrimination against individuals as such or individuals who happen to be grouped together on the basis of their individual traits or accident records, then the phrase \u201cclass of risk\u201d is essentially without meaning, except to represent the plural of \u201crisk.\u201d The term \u201cclass of risk\u201d must refer to more than just individuals who can be grouped together because they each represent a risk greater than other individuals receiving the same type of coverage. Logically, a \u201cclass of risk\u201d should include all persons covered by a particular type of insurance. The majority\u2019s definition of \u201cclass of risk\u201d would leave these persons at the mercy of insurers, so long as individuals within these groups were not discriminated against. For example, the majority\u2019s reasoning would apply \u00a7 234A to require a business purpose in the case where a pediatrician\u2019s coverage was cancelled while other pediatricians\u2019 coverage was not, but the majority\u2019s reasoning would deny application of \u00a7 234A where all pediatricians had their coverage cancelled, but all obstetricians continued to be covered, if the insurer merely labelled coverage of the pediatricians as a different \u201cline of insurance\u201d than coverage of obstetricians.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>Therefore, I would hold that medical malpractice insurance is a \u201cclass of risk\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 234A. As \u00a7 234A by its clear terms applies to refusals to renew a \u201cclass of risk,\u201d the statutory provision is fully applicable in this case. Under \u00a7 234A, St. Paul has the burden of showing that its suspension of writing medical malpractice insurance was not arbitrary and was based on the application of standards which are reasonably related to its economic or business purposes. However, I would not hold, as the Insurance Commissioner - suggests, that \u00a7 234A gives the Commissioner authority to reject the properly presented claims of insurers that they do not find it economically feasible to continue insuring a certain class of risk. Neither the language nor the history of \u00a7 234A supports the proposition that hearings undertaken to evaluate a claim brought under \u00a7 234A are to be transformed into rate hearings. If, after a final rejection of a rate increase request, an insurer believes that continued coverage of a certain class of risk cannot be maintained without economic disadvantage or loss to it, then \u00a7 234A does not authorize the Commissioner to require that the insurer continue coverage of that class of risk. Section 234A does not allow the Commissioner to force insurers, against their will, indefinitely to continue covering a particular class of risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">However, in this case St. Paul did not \u2022 exhaust the administrative remedies available to it with regard to the rate increase it sought. St..Paul was granted a 45.9% rate increase, effective January 4, 1974. It informed the Maryland Medical and Chirurgical Faculty that if it could not obtain another rate increase, it would cease writing medical malpractice insurance. Shortly thereafter it sought another increase of 48%. The Commissioner tentatively rejected this request. St. Paul did not seek further adminstrative consideration of this requested rate increase. The Insurance Code, Art. 48A, \u00a7 242B (1), provides that if an insurer is aggrieved by a pre-hearing decision of the Commissioner such as was made here, then the insurer may request a hearing and the Commissioner \u201cshall\u201d grant a hearing and consider his prior action. The section goes on to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>provide that the Commissioner, after the hearing, shall affirm, reverse or modify his prior action, specifying the reasons therefor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> St. Paul did not pursue its remedy under this section. Rather, the company immediately announced that it would cease medical malpractice coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">This action by St. Paul was \u201carbitrary\u201d within the meaning of that term as used in \u00a7 234A. Moreover, St. Paul\u2019s action was not \u201creasonably\u201d related to the insurer\u2019s stated business purpose within the meaning of \u00a7 234A. The insurer\u2019s stated business purpose was that it could not obtain a rate increase, but it failed to pursue its administrative remedy to obtain such increase. If St. Paul had gone through the complete administrative procedure available to it and then withdrawn from writing medical malpractice insurance, the Commissioner would not be able on \u00a7 234A grounds to reject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>St. Paul\u2019s business decision that a rate increase could not be obtained which would allow it to continue in business. In such an eventuality, the action of St. Paul in withdrawing from the field of medical malpractice insurance could not be said to be \u201carbitrary\u201d and would be \u201creasonably related\u201d to its \u201cbusiness purpose,\u201d as those terms are used in \u00a7 234A.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">However, the company\u2019s precipitous action, in failing to explore fully the possibilities available to it with regard to an increase in rates, deprived the Commissioner and the public of the ability to determine whether the company\u2019s claim that it could not obtain rate relief was correct. Thus, the Commissioner could determine that St. Paul\u2019s action was arbitrary, and he was not, at that point, obligated to accept St. Paul\u2019s business judgment with regard to its inability to continue writing medical malpractice coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">I would affirm the order of the Baltimore City Court that St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company renew Dr. Levine\u2019s policies and \u201ccontinue to accept the business of physicians\u2019 and surgeons\u2019 liability insurance in the State of Maryland.\u201d</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b166-9\">. Maryland Code (1972 Eepl. Vol., 1974 Supp.), Art. 48A, \u00a7 234A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b168-7\">. The majority make much of the fact that if physicians professional liability is seen as a class of risk, companies not writing it would have to justify their refusal to do so. This argument is a \u201cstrawman,\u201d however, since a company not writing such insurance need do no more than to state that it had determined that it has no economic or business reason to do so. Sec. 234A does not give the Insurance Commissioner authority to second guess the business decisions of insurance company officials.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b169-5\">. That \u201cclass of risk\u201d does not mean groups of individuals within a certain type of insurance coverage who possess a particular personal characteristic or accident record is indicated by \u00a7 242(c)(4) of Article 48A. Subsection (c)(4) of \u00a7 242 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-6\">\u201cRisks may be grouped by classifications for the establishment of rates and minimum premiums. Classification rates may be modified to produce rates for individual risks in accordance with rating plans which establish standards for measuring variations in hazards or expense provisions, or both. The standards may measure any difference among risks that can. be demonstrated objectively to have a probable effect upon losses or expenses. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">This provision, which allows rates to be based on certain characteristics of the insureds covered by a particular type of insurance, indicates that the Legislature did not intend the term \u201cclass of risk\u201d in \u00a7 234A to have the meaning ascribed to it by the majority. If the Legislature had intended to convey the meaning claimed by the majority, it would have used instead the phrase \u201cclassification of risks\u201d in order to make \u00a7 234A consistent with \u00a7 242 (c)(4). It is a fundamental rule that different parts of a statute should be construed in a manner making them consistent and harmonious, if possible. Coerper v. Comptroller, 265 Md. 3, 6, 288 A. 2d 187 (1972); Unsatisfied Fund v. Bowman, 249 Md. 705, 709, 241 A. 2d 714 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b171-6\">.
