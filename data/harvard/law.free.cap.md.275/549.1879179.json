The claim arose from the arrest of the appellant, Hershey Krashes, in Frederick, Maryland; his confinement in Frederick; his extradition to Richmond, Virginia; and his subsequent imprisonment in that city until the charge against him was nol prossed. The appellees filed a motion to dismiss the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>complaint on the ground that the United States District Court in Maryland lacked personal jurisdiction over them. A hearing was held on the motion, and the District Court took the matter under consideration. Before any ruling on the appellees\u2019 motion, the appellants filed a motion requesting the District Court to certify to this Court those issues of Maryland law which might be determinative in ruling on the appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss. Thereafter, the District Court certified three questions of law to this Court. The questions certified are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-5\">\u201c(1) Is arrest an essential element of the torts of criminal malicious prosecution and abuse of process, or does the occurrence of an arrest in these torts provide merely an aggravation of damages?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-6\">\u201c(2) If arrest is an essential element of the torts of criminal malicious prosecution and abuse of process, then did \u2018tortious injury\u2019 occur in the State of Maryland, although the remaining elements of both torts occurred in the Commonwealth of Virginia?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\">\u201c(3) If \u2018tortious injury\u2019 did not occur in the State of Maryland but, rather, occurred in the Commonwealth of Virginia, does the recently amended portion of Article 75, section 96 (a) (4) of the Maryland Annotated Code extend personal jurisdiction to a fact situation such as that involved in the instant action? \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">The \u201cStatement of Facts\u201d contained in the District Court\u2019s Order of Certification sets forth the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-9\">\u201cBriefly stated, this action had its origination when a check for $644.00 was given by plaintiff, Hershey Krashes, to defendant corporation, Modern Coin Shop [\u201cModern\u201d], in Richmond, Virginia; the check was subsequently returned for insufficient funds. After repeated efforts to collect, Modern, through its chief executive and principal manager, defendant Arthur Wilkerson, retained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>the Richmond law firm of White, Roberts, Cabell &amp; Paris [\u201cthe firm\u201d], which is also a defendant, to aid in the collection of the check. The firm, through an associate and defendant, Conrad Lewane, sent several letters to Krashes threatening action if the amount of the check was not paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-5\">\u201cThese threats were carried out when a complaint was filed in Richmond concerning the check. As a re\u00e1ult of this complaint a warrant was issued for plaintiff\u2019s arrest. Acting upon the request of the Richmond police, the Frederick, Maryland police obtained [from a justice of the peace] a fugitive warrant for plaintiff\u2019s arrest. Plaintiff was subsequently taken into custody by the Frederick police and then transported to Richmond to stand trial on a felony charge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-6\">\u201cOnce incarcerated in Richmond, plaintiff alleges the defendant-firm, through its associates, extracted a $500.00 check from plaintiff\u2019s sister and a $1,400.00 confessed judgment note from plaintiff. After these items were received from plaintiff, it is alleged that defendant-Lewane notified the local State\u2019s Attorney that an error had been made, thereupon the charge against Krashes was <em>nol prossed.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-7\">\u201cPlaintiff instituted an action in this Court, seeking relief on two counts: one for abuse of process, and the other for malicious prosecution. Plaintiffs are citizens and residents of the State of Maryland and defendants are citizens and residents of or are incorporated in and with their principal place of business in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Plaintiff alleges that defendants have persistently engaged in commercial conduct in the State of Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-8\">\u201cDefendants have filed a motion to dismiss the action and to quash service of process, arguing that this Court lacks <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Jurisdiction, if it exists, must be obtained through the Maryland \u2018long-arm\u2019 statute, Art. 75, \u00a7\u00a7 94-100, Md. Ann. Code (1969 Repl. Vol., as amended).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">In addition to the facts set forth in the Order of Certification, the record reveals the following facts which may be pertinent to any consideration of the jurisdictional issue in this case. In 1967, an attorney from the appellee law firm, White, Roberts, Cabell &amp; Paris, represented a party in a case in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. Between 1967 and 1970, the firm represented three Maryland residents in civil cases brought in Virginia courts. The firm communicated with its Maryland clients and co-counsel by telephone and letter. The firm received over $15,000 in fees in the three cases in which it represented Maryland residents in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Pursuant to Maryland Rule 896 (a) (iv), the District Court ordered that the plaintiffs be treated as the appellants in the certification procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">Before this Court, the appellees \u201cconcede for purposes of argument that \u2018tortious injury,\u2019 based on the allegations of the Complaint, occurred in this state.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, the appellees maintain that the first two issues certified by the United States District Court are \u201cimmaterial to the resolution of the central issue of personal jurisdiction in this case.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The appellees contend that, if personal jurisdiction in the District Court over them exists, it must be based on Code (1974), \u00a7 6-103 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (the \u201clong arm statute\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They further argue that personal jurisdiction over them cannot be obtained under \u00a7 6-103.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">The appellants contend that arrest is an indispensable element of the torts of malicious prosecution and abuse of criminal process, although in oral argument before us they agreed with the appellees that this question does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>determine the matter of personal jurisdiction over the appellees. Appellants further argue that the District Court had personal jurisdiction over the appellees under \u00a7 6-103 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The first question certified by the District Court is whether \u201carrest [is] an essential element of the torts of criminal malicious prosecution and abuse of process, or does the occurrence of an arrest in these torts provide merely an aggravation of damages? \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">We conclude that arrest is not an essential element of the tort of \u201ccriminal\u201d malicious prosecution. The elements of malicious prosecution of a criminal charge have been clearly stated many times by this Court. In <em>Brewer v. Mele, </em>267 Md. 437, 440, 298 A. 2d 156 (1972), the Court set them forth as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-8\">\u201cThe necessary elements of a case for malicious prosecution of a criminal charge are well established. There must be: (a) a criminal proceeding instituted or continued by the defendant against the plaintiff, (b) termination of the proceeding in favor of the accused, (c) absence of probable cause for the proceeding, and (d) malice, or a primary purpose in instituting the proceeding other than that of bringing an offender to justice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-9\"><em>Jannenga v. Libernini, </em>222 Md. 469, 472, 160 A. 2d 795 (1960); <em>Banks v. Montgomery Ward </em>&amp; <em>Co., </em>212 Md. 31, 38, 128 A. 2d 600 (1957); <em>Safeway Stores, Inc. v. Barrack, </em>210 Md. 168, 173, 122 A. 2d 457 (1956); <em>Delk v. Killen, </em>201 Md. 381, 383, 93 A. 2d 545 (1953); <em>Kennedy v. Crouch, </em>191 Md. 580, 586-587, 62 A. 2d 582 (1948); <em>Goldstein v. Rau, </em>147 Md. 6, 13, 127 A. 488 (1925); <em>Pessagno v. Keyes, </em>143 Md. 437, 441, 122 A. 651 (1923); <em>Medcalfe v. Brooklyn Life Ins. Co. of New York, </em>45 Md. 198, 203-204 (1876); <em>Boyd v. Cross, </em>35 Md. 194, 196 (1872); Prosser, <em>Torts </em>\u00a7 119 at 835-836 (4th ed. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">On the other hand, the tort of malicious use of civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>process requires, in addition to the four essential elements of malicious prosecution of a criminal charge set forth in <em>Brewer v. Mele, supra, </em>that there be \u201cdamages . . . inflicted on the plaintiff by seizure of his property or other special injury.\u201d <em>Wesko v. G.E.M., Inc., </em>272 Md. 192, 197, 321 A. 2d 529 (1974); <em>Siegman v. Equitable Trust, </em>267 Md. 309, 317, 297 A. 2d 758 (1972). Thus in an action for malicious use of civil process, arrest may in certain cases be an element of the tort since it may be considered the \u201cspecial injury\u201d which must be alleged. <em>North Point Constr. Co. v. Sagner, </em>185 Md. 200, 207, 44 A. 2d 441 (1945); <em>Owens v. Graetzel, </em>149 Md. 689, 694, 132 A. 265 (1926); <em>McNamee v. Minke, </em>49 Md. 122, 133 (1878). Unlike a plaintiff in a malicious use of civil process suit, the plaintiff in a criminal malicious prosecution action need not prove any special damages, such as arrest or seizure of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">The appellants would add to the requirement that a criminal proceeding be instituted by the defendant against the plaintiff, the requirement that this proceeding must involve the arrest of the plaintiff. It is true that the mere filing of a complaint, without some action by law enforcement or judicial officials, does not constitute the initiation of a criminal proceeding. Prosser, <em>supra, </em>at 836. The issuance of an arrest warrant or the making of an arrest may often be the first official action in a criminal proceeding. However, a criminal proceeding may be carried out completely without an arrest. For example, a defendant may be summonsed to appear at a trial without having been previously arrested, <em>see Delk v. Killen, supra, </em>or a defendant may be charged when unavailable to be arrested. We, therefore, conclude that arrest is not an essential element of the tort of criminal malicious prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Next, we consider whether arrest is an essential element of abuse of process. The tort of abuse of process occurs when a party has wilfully misused criminal or civil process after it has issued in order to obtain a result not contemplated by law. <em>Wesko v. G.E.M., Inc., supra, </em>272 Md. at 195-196; <em>James v. Goldberg, </em>256 Md. 520, 530, 261 A. 2d 753 (1970); <em>Walker v. American Security Co., </em>237 Md. 80, 87, 205 A. 2d 302 (1964); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number><em>Bartlett v. Christhilf, </em>69 Md. 219, 229, 14 A. 518 (1888); <em>Herring v. Citizens Bank &amp; T. Co., </em>21 Md. App. 517, 528-529, 321 A. 2d 182 (1974); <em>see Zablonsky v. Perkins, </em>230 Md. 365, 370, 187 A. 2d 314 (1963); Prosser, <em>Torts </em>\u00a7 121 (4th ed. 1971). While the issuance by a court of some sort of criminal process against a party is necessary before that party can properly bring an action for abuse of criminal process, there is no requirement that the party be arrested or that an arrest warrant against him be issued. The cases cited above make clear that arrest is not an essential element of the tort of abuse of criminal process.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The second and third questions certified by the United States District Court are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-7\">\u201c(2) If arrest is an essential element of the torts of criminal malicious prosecution and abuse of process, then did \u2018tortious injury\u2019 occur in the State of Maryland, although the remaining elements of both torts occurred in the Commonwealth of Virginia?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-8\">\u201c(3) If \u2018tortious injury\u2019 did not occur in the State of Maryland but, rather, occurred in the Commonwealth of Virginia, does the recently amended portion of Article 75, section 96 (a) (4) of the Maryland Annotated Code [now \u00a7 6-103 (b) (4) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article] extend personal jurisdiction to a fact situation such as that involved in the instant action? \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">As is apparent from this portion of the Order of Certification, the second question set forth by the District Court is to be answered by this Court only if we reply affirmatively to the first question in the order, and we answer that question in the negative. Consideration by this Court of the third question is premised on an answer to the second question and, as just pointed out, we are not called upon to answer the second question.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>As previously discussed, both the appellants and the appellees took the position in argument before us that the answer to the first certified question was not necessarily dispositive of the jurisdictional issue in this case. Both sides urged us to answer the second and third certified questions or to decide whether or not, in light of the factual allegations of the complaint, a court in Maryland could under this State\u2019s \u201clong arm\u201d statute exercise jurisdiction over the appellees. However, the Uniform Certification of Questions of Law Act, Code (1974), \u00a7\u00a7 12-601 <em>et </em>sec/., of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, does not authorize us to go beyond the questions certified in the order of the certifying court. The Order of Certification issued by the United States District Court for the District of Maryland did not provide that we could in any way reformulate or rearrange the questions certified in order to set forth answers to what we might consider to be the essential jurisdictional issues in this case. Compare <em>Volkswagen of America v. Young, </em>272 Md. 201, 205, 321 A. 2d 737 (1974), where the order of the certifying court, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, \u201cspecified that the phrasing of the certified question was not intended to restrict our consideration of the problems involved and the issues as we perceive them in light of the complaint in the case.\u201d Consequently, we cannot specifically answer the second and third certified questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">On the other hand, so that our holding in part (1) of this opinion is not misconstrued, and as we are inclined to agree with the parties that whether or not an <em>essential </em>element of the tort occurs in Maryland is not necessarily dispositive of the \u201clong arm\u201d statute\u2019s reach in this type of case, we shall briefly deal with the scope of the statute under Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The \u201clong arm\u201d statute, \u00a7 6-103 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-7\">\u201c(b) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 A court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a person, who directly or by an agent:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>(1) Transacts any business or performs any character of work or service in the state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">(2) Contracts to supply goods, food, services, or manufactured products in the state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">(3) Causes tortious injury in the state by an act or omission in the state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-7\">(4) Causes tortious injury in the state or outside of the state by an act or omission outside the state if he regularly does or solicits business, engages in any other persistent course of conduct in the state or derives substantial revenue from goods, food, services, or manufactured products used or consumed in the state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-8\">(5) Has an interest in, uses, or possesses real property in the state; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-9\">(6) Contracts to insure or act as surety for, or on, any person, property, risk, contract, obligation, or agreement located, executed, or to be performed within the state at the time the contract was made, unless the parties otherwise provide in writing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">Although six specific categories are listed in the subsections of \u00a7 6-103 (b), this Court has applied \u00a7 6-103 (b) flexibly, in order to carry out the legislative intent of extending the personal jurisdiction of Maryland courts as far as is possible consistent with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. For example, the Court stated in <em>Gilliam v. Moog Industries, Inc., </em>239 Md. 107, 111, 210 A. 2d 390 (1965):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-11\">\u201cIt seems clear that the purpose of the Legislature in enacting these new provisions was to give the courts of the State personal j urisdiction over all out of state persons and corporations which constitutionally could be reached as having had sufficient Maryland contacts, under the jurisdictional yardstick established by the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>Court in cases such as <em>International Shoe Co. v. Washington, </em>326 U. S. 310, 90 L. Ed. 95; <em>McGee v. International Life Ins. Co., </em>355 U. S. 220, 2 L.Ed.2d 223; and <em>Hanson v. Denckla, </em>357 U. S. 235, 2 L.Ed.2d 1283.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">In <em>Harris v. Arlen Properties, </em>256 Md. 185, 195-196, 260 A. 2d 22 (1969), this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-7\">\u201cIn our own State the Legislature sought to provide a more flexible approach to jurisdiction by enacting our present \u2018Long Arm\u2019 Statute, Chapter 95 of the Acts of 1964. This Court recognized that there was a purposeful effort on the part of the Legislature to broaden jurisdiction by expanding it to the boundaries of permissible constitutional limits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-8\"><em>Lamprecht v. Piper Aircraft Corp., </em>262 Md. 126, 130, 277 A. 2d 272 (1971); <em>Groom v. Margulies, </em>257 Md. 691, 700-701, 265 A. 2d 249 (1970); <em>Vitro Electronics v. Milgray, </em>255 Md. 498, 504-505, 258 A. 2d 749 (1969); <em>Novack v. Nat\u2019l Hot Rod Ass\u2019n, </em>247 Md. 350, 353-354, 231 A. 2d 22 (1967); <em>see Van Wagenberg v. Van Wagenberg, </em>241 Md. 154, 164-165, 215 A. 2d 812, 27 A.L.R.3d 379, <em>cert. denied, </em>385 U. S. 833, 87 S. Ct. 73, 17 L.Ed.2d 68 (1966); Auerbach, <em>The \u201cLong Arm.\u201d Comes to Maryland, </em>26 Md.L.Rev. 13, 30 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">Perhaps fact situations will arise which will be deemed outside the scope of the Maryland \u201clong arm\u201d statute, although there may be a constitutional basis for jurisdiction over the nonresident defendant. Nevertheless, the prior decisions of this Court make it clear that the reach of the statute will largely depend upon whether Maryland <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction may be asserted under the Fourteenth Amendment. This, in turn, will involve applying the principles set forth in cases such as <em>Hanson v. Denckla, </em>357 U. S. 235, 250-251, 78 S. Ct. 1228, 1238, 2 L.Ed.2d 1283, <em>reh. denied, </em>358 U.
