Vol.), Art. 89B, \u00a7 9,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a petition in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County to \u201cquick take\u201d a parcel of 1.83 acres, running a distance of 732 feet along the eastern boundary of a tract totalling 10 acres owned by Roscoe H. Parker and his wife, the appellees, in Largo, for the relocation of Landover Road (Maryland Rt. 202). In accordance with the provisions of the statute, the Commission deposited with the clerk of the court $65,308.94, its estimate of the \u201cfair market value\u201d of the portion taken by it for the highway construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">The appellees requested that the case be referred to the Board of Property Review for a determination of the value of the property, without prejudice to their right to have the matter considered by a jury. <em>See </em>Code (1957, 1964 Repl. Vol.), Art. 89B, \u00a7\u00a7 17-20 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Maryland Rule U27. Dissatisfied with the award determined by the Board, the Commission on May 1, 1969, requested the reinstatement of the condemnation proceedings. After the matter had laid dormant for more than four years, the Commission, with leave of the court, filed an amended petition to include within the scope of the condemnation, the entire rectangular 10-acre tract of the appellees so that an interchange could be constructed thereon between Central Avenue (Maryland Rt. 214) and the reconstructed and relocated Landover Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Described as rolling and wooded land, the acreage \u201cfronts\u201d along its northern boundary for a distance of 530 feet on Central Avenue. It had no frontage along the relocated Landover Road since access thereto was denied upon the \u201cquick taking.\u201d Situate upon the land were several delapidated farm buildings conceded to have no significance in the valuation of the acreage. Zoned as \u201cC-2\u201d (general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>commercial),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the property is located approximately one mile east of the intersection- of Central Avenue and the Capital Beltway. Three miles to the north is located the Landover Mall, a large shopping center; one mile to the northwest, the new Capital Centre Sports Arena conducts sports contests and entertainment events almost nightly. A small shopping center, Hampton Mall, is located one mile westward; Prince George\u2019s Community College campus is one and one-half miles to the south and a garden apartment development is located immediately southwestward. Within the g\u00e9neral geographical area there are 4,000 acres described as being in the \u201cearly stages of intensive residential development\u201d together with related commercial service facilities. Just to the east and southeast of the subject property \u2014 off Central Avenue \u2014 is a prestigious single family residential development named \u201cKettering,\u201d which is served by a small shopping center on that avenue. A gasoline filling station, a' fruit stand and a dry cleaning establishment were described as being operated at the intersection of Routes 214 and old Route 202.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">During the proceedings before the jury leading to the inquisition, the appellant produced testimony from two expert witnesses \u2014 Messrs. Roy K. Davis and Paul J. Gilroy. Davis placed a fair market value upon the 10 acres of $501,200.00; Gilroy\u2019s appraisal was $450,000.00. Two expert witnesses who testified on behalf of the appellee-owners, Messrs. John L. Richards and Adelbert W. Lee were of the opinion that the property being taken had a value, of $3 per square foot, or a total fair market value of SI,306.800.00</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">The jury, apparently finding the opinion testimony of Messrs. Richards and Lee to be the more persuasive, on July 1, 1974, by their inquisition awarded the cohdemnees $1,306,800.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">The appellant, aggrieved at the valuation placed upon the tract by the jury, contends in its appeal here that the trial court (Judge George Sachse<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>I. Abused its discretion by admitting evidence of comparable sales: (a) sales of lots grossly disparate in size from the subject property, (b) sales of lots incompatibly zoned in that they were zoned industrial and (c) sales proximately remote from the subject property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-5\">II. Committed prejudicial error by remarks made in the presence of the jury tending to buttress the appellees\u2019 valuation testimony;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-6\">III. Erred by sustaining objections to questions upon cross-examination of appellees\u2019 appraisers when it \u201csought to ascertain if the latter understood a relevant principle implicit in the statutory definition of \u2018fair market value\u2019 \u201d; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-7\">IV. Erred in not granting appellant\u2019s instruction that comparable sales \u201ccan be viewed as primary or independent evidence of value.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">It must be observed at the outset that there is a conflict concerning the existence of utilities to service the subject acreage; although appellant authoritatively states that no utilities serve the property and a four-year-old sewer moratorium was in effect upon the stipulated date of valuation, it points to no such evidence in the record. Contrariwise, both the expert witnesses on behalf of the appellees gave testimony in connection with the existence of water and sewer; John L. Richards, acknowledging the existence of a \u201csewer moratorium,\u201d testified that a public water system served the property, that a ten-inch sewer line and terminal was within 60 feet of the property line and that such service would be available \u201cin the very near future\u201d since the capacity of Western Branch was being increased. The witness Lee testifed that the property \u201chad water across the front\u201d and that \u201csewer was in very close proximity in the rear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-11\">In testifying concerning his opinion on the \u201cfair market value\u201d of the tract being condemned, the witness Lee listed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>as comparable sales six transactions, occurring between 1970 and 1972, five of which such properties were zoned \u201cC-2\u201d and the sixth of which was zoned \u201cC-O.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The property so sold ranged in area from 33,706 sq. ft. to 199,421 sq. ft. and ranged in price between $2.28 per sq. ft. and $4.03 per sq. ft., or from $99,317.00 per acre to $175,547.00 per acre. The appellant objected to the inclusion of three of these transactions as not being \u201ccomparable sales.\u201d It objected to the property zoned \u201cC-O,\u201d which contained 199,421 sq. ft.\u2014and which had sold at $2.28 per sq. ft. \u2014 involving the largest area and the lowest price per sq. ft. of all the properties described by the witness Lee, solely on the ground of the incompatibility of the zoning classification. There was no evidence concerning the proximity of that acreage to the subject property. A property consisting of 33,706 sq. ft. (.77 acres) which had been sold at $4.03 per sq. ft. was objected to as being dissimilar in size. The third such sale objected to pertained to a parcel of land containing 53,316 sq. ft., which had been sold at $2.57 per sq. ft. which was objected to solely on the basis of its distance from the subject property. Although the appellant alleges in its brief that that sale involved property located \u201c12 miles\u201d distant and argues that it was \u201c15 miles\u201d removed from the subject property, the testimony disclosed that it was described as being located \u201c7 to 8 miles\u201d from the Parkers\u2019 land. Each of these objections was overruled by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The appellant made no objection to the other three sales considered by the witness Lee; these were described as containing, respectively, 33,956 sq. ft. (.78 acres), 34,512 sq. ft. (.79 acres) and 48,358 sq. ft. (1.13 acres) with sale prices, respectively, of $2.72, $2.50 and $3.55 per sq. ft. Each of the unobjected-to sales pertain to property located between seven and ten-and-one-quarter miles from the property being condemned.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The witness described each one of said sales as each having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>been made by \u201cwell informed buyers,\u201d each involved property zoned \u201ccommercial\u201d and all were described as having a comparable traffic flow and type of development within their areas. It was further the opinion of the witness that although property zoned \u201cC-O\u201d was limited to office use, property zoned \u201cC-2\u201d authorized generally commercial enterprises \u2014 including office use. The witness was never cross-examined by the appellant concerning the property zoned \u201cC-O,\u201d although the asserted differences in zoning were the sole basis for its objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Fifteen sales made between 1969 and 1973 located from within 800 feet of the subject property to a maximum of two miles distant were submitted by the witness Richards. Challenging their comparability the appellant objected to all but four of such transactions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court sustained its objections to four of the sales which involved tracts of less than one-half acre in size and property zoned for high-density apartments; its objections to the remainder of the sales were overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Six of the property sales considered comparable by Richards were of land zoned \u201c1-1\u201d (Industrial-light); five were zoned, as was the subject property, as \u201cC-2.\u201d Objection was made solely on the grounds of incomparability as to five of the six sales of land zoned \u201clight industrial.\u201d Objection to the sixth such sale (of 42,112 sq. ft.), also on the ground of incomparability was not limited to its zoning classification but included as well its size. Objection was made to only one of the sales of property zoned \u201cC-2\u201d and this was predicated upon asserted differences in a number of the features of the sale. The sales considered by Richards, to which no objections were made involved properties all zoned \u201cC-2\u201d which ranged in size from 42,000 sq. ft. (.97 acres) to seven acres and which had been sold at prices ranging from $1.13 (for the seven-acre tract) to $2.78 (for the .97 acre site) per square foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">In comparing each of the described transactions, Richards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>made adjustments \u2014 both upward and downward \u2014 in the prices for which said properties had been sold to allow for increases in valuation due to inflation, from the date of such sales to the time of trial, made adjustments for differences in zoning classifications, for the size, shape and front\u00e1ge of the acreage sold, in comparison to the subject property, and made adjustments as well to compensate for differences in topography and the existence vel non of utilities upon the sold properties. It was his opinion that \u201cC-2\u201d zoning was a \u201cbetter\u201d classification for obtaining the highest and best use of the property. Basically he added a ten-cent per sq. ft. adjustment upward to each of the reported sales to compensate for the zoning differences.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">On cross-examination it was the witness\u2019 view that a district zoned \u201ccommercial\u201d permitted \u201cmore variety of uses\u201d than that allowed in a district zoned \u201clight industrial\u201d and that one \u201chas less trouble getting zoning for commercial land than . . . for industrial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The objection to the sale of the sole property zoned as \u201cC-2\u201d involved 1.32 acres which had been sold in 1968 by the Simplex Land Co. to the Boron Oil Co. \u2014 for a filling station site \u2014 which was located on the south side of Central Avenue (Rt. 214) 800 feet southwest of the subject property. It was the same acreage (53,315 sq. ft.) which the appellees themselves had sold at $2.25 per sq. ft. to the Simplex Land Co. and which, according to the testimony of the appellee Roscoe H. Parker, had been resold \u2014 on the same day by Simplex \u2014 for $2.78 per sq. ft. In his testimony Roscoe Parker described that lot as being located 435 feet from the \u201cboundary of the subject property\u201d and projecting an allowance for inflation since 1968, calculated its value, as of the time of trial, at $4.17 per sq. ft.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Each of the appraisers \u2014 both for the appellant and the appellee \u2014 in. stating his opinion of the fair market value of the acreage being taken, employed the \u201ccomparable sales\u201d approach, but each used a different methodology. All agreed that the location of property so sold was an important element in helping to assess its comparability, but to each, however, location carried a slightly different weight. To the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>appellant\u2019s appraiser, Roy K. Davis, whose testimony was limited to five such sales, it meant the \u201cgeneral neighborhood.\u201d To its other appraiser, Paul J. Gilroy, who listed only three such comparable sales, it literally meant that the closer the property sold was to the subject property, the more comparable was the sale. The appellees\u2019 witness Lee was of the view that physical proximity of the reported sales was only one element in determining comparability and that adjacent geographical areas with similar traffic flow counts and adjacent economic development provided \u201cvery comparable locations.\u201d To Mr. Richards the general economic area provided a basis for comparability and he emphasized that the principal element in his opinion of valuation was the \u201clocation of the subject property in an area of intense and rapid commercial development.\u201d Having limited his analysis of comparable sales to those occurring within a two-mile radius, he emphasized that the appellees\u2019 property was \u201clocated at the cross-roads of Prince George\u2019s County\u201d and compared its location to a similar area in Montgomery County at the intersection of the East-West Highway and Wisconsin Avenue.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">By way of contrast, it appears from the record that the expert witnesses for the appellant did not give any consideration in their opinion evaluation to the rapidly changing economic state of real estate values in the general area of Largo, nor did either of them make any adjustments for any differences whatsoever between the land being condemned and the eight sales they considered to be comparable which ranged in size from 2.34 acres to 32.68 acres.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">As early as 1915 our predecessors in a condemnation proceeding, in <em>Patterson v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>127 Md. 233, 96 A. 458 (1915), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-7\">\u201cIt is the settled law, in this State and elsewhere, that in establishing the value of land, the prices realized at the sales of similar lands in the vicinity, made within a reasonable period of time theretofore, being voluntary and not forced sales, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>are admissible in evidence, either on direct or cross-examination of witnesses conversant with the facts. <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Smith, </em>80 Md. 472-473, and other cases there cited.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-5\">\u201cIn regard to the degree of similarity which must exist and the nearness in respect of time and place no general rules are laid down, and as the trial judge is usually conversant with such matters they must be left largely to his discretion.\u201d 127 Md at 241, 96 A. at 461.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The rule stated in <em>Patterson </em>has been explicated and applied in <em>Lustine v. State Roads Comm\u2019n, </em>217 Md. 274, 142 A. 2d 566 (1958); <em>Bergeman v. State Roads Comm\u2019n, </em>218 Md. 137, 146 A. 2d 48 (1958); <em>Winepol v. State Roads Comm\u2019n, </em>220 Md. 227, 151 A. 2d 723 (1959); <em>Hance v. State Roads Comm\u2019n, </em>221 Md. 164, 156 A. 2d 644 (1959); <em>Taylor v. State Roads Comm\u2019n, </em>224 Md. 92, 167 A. 2d 127 (1961), and <em>State Roads Comm\u2019n v. Adams, </em>238 Md. 371, 209 A. 2d 247 (1965) \u2014 to mention but a few of our cases discussing the admissibility of expert testimony pertaining to \u201ccomparable sales.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">In <em>Lustine, </em>the trial court had ruled inadmissible testimony by one of the appellant\u2019s experts concerning two transfers which he had considered as \u201ccomparable sales\u201d; one was of a 42-acre parcel of land, approximately one-half mile from the subject property which had been formerly used as a gravel pit but which had been graded and laid out for subdivision purposes before its sale; the other transaction related to an adjacent parcel of 17 acres which had been \u201craw land\u201d prior to its sale for subdivision purposes but which was \u201cserved by a dead end road.\u201d In reversing, this Court, in connection with these evidentiary rulings, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-8\">\u201cWe think that the court, in ruling out testimony as to the sales prices of these properties, as not. being comparable, was unduly restrictive. We are aware that there is considerable latitude in the exercise of discretion by the lower court in determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>comparable sales. <em>Patterson v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>127 Md. 233, 241, <em>Williams v. New York, P. &amp; N R. Company, </em>153 Md. 102, 108. It should be borne in mind, however, that real estate parcels have a degree of uniqueness which make comparability, one with the other, in a strict sense, practically impossible. We think it the better policy, where there are any reasonable elements of comparability, to admit testimony as to the sales, and leave the weight of the comparison for the consideration of the jury, along with such distinguishing features as may be brought out on cross-examination or otherwise. <em>Forest Preserve District of Cook County v. Eckhoff </em>372 Ill. 391, 24 N. E. 2d 52. <em>Cf. Turner v. State Roads Commission, </em>213 Md. 428, 431.\u201d 217 Md. at 280-81, 142 A. 2d at 569.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">In <em>Bergeman, </em>the appellants contended that two of the sales described by an expert witness for the State Roads Commission were not comparable because the properties were not, when sold, located in a commercial zone. This Court, in sustaining the admissibility of such evidence recognized, that it is \u201cgenerally true that property in a residential zone is less valuable than in a commercial zone which would make them not truly comparable, but we have held that the probability of rezoning within a reasonable time may be taken into account in some situations,\u201d and pointed out, citing <em>Lustine, supra, </em>that the \u201ctrial court\u201d has a wide discretion in determining what sales are reasonably comparable, leaving the weight of the comparison for the consideration of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">In connection with the opinion of the expert witness, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-9\">\u201cIt is trite to observe that the weight of evidence is for the triers of fact, or for the court on motion for new trial. We are only concerned with the legal sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict, and in passing upon that question the testimony, and all proper inferences therefrom, must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>considered in a light most favorable to the plaintiff\u2019s case. <em>Safeway </em>Stores, <em>Inc. v. Barrack, </em>210 Md. 168, 173. We have also said that \u2018the opinion of [an expert] witness, and the grounds upon which it was formed, and the weight to be attached thereto, were matters for the consideration of the jury.\u2019 <em>Davis v. State, </em>38 Md. 15, 41; <em>Marshall v. Sellers, </em>188 Md. 508, 518. The value or weight of the opinion of an expert is dependent on, and is no stronger than, the facts on which it is predicated. Cf. <em>Grant v. Curtin, </em>194 Md. 363, 385. The conclusions of the witnesses as to value in the instant case depend upon basic facts to which the formulae are applied, and we perceive no reason why the jury should not be permitted to draw their own conclusions from such basic facts as they may choose to find, if supported by testimony or permissible inferences therefrom. We think there was legally sufficient evidence to support the verdict.\u201d 218 Md. at 144, 146 A. 2d at 52.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">In <em>Winepol, </em>the holdings in <em>Lustine </em>and in <em>Bergeman </em>were described as an approval of \u201cthe liberal approach\u201d to the admissibility of such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">In <em>Hance v. State Roads Comm\u2019n, </em>the property owners on appeal asserted inter alia error by the trial court in two of its evidentiary rulings. An expert for the condemnor used the capitalization of rent method of appraisal in connection with two of the three buildings located upon the land. When asked why he did not use the capitalization method with reference to the third building, he replied that in his opinion it was not \u201cfit for human habitation.\u201d The refusal of the trial court to strike this answer was asserted as error. Additionally, a real estate appraiser produced on behalf of the owners was precluded from offering as evidence of a comparable sale a transaction which had occurred subsequent to the \u201ctaking\u201d of the property by the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-9\">In rejecting the appellant\u2019s contention concerning the lack of habitability of one of the buildings, Judge Prescott, who delivered the opinion for the Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>\u201cWe think the evidence objected to in the case at bar was clearly relevant and admissible. It was nothing more nor less than an expert, who had expressed his opinion as to value, stating his reasons for the opinion given; and these reasons may be elicited by the party who has called the witness, as well as by the opposite party upon cross-examination. In <em>Baltimore Belt R. R. Co. v. Sattler, </em>102 Md. 595, 602, 62 A. 1125; 64 A. 507, this Court said, \u2018[a]n expert witness * * * may give his opinion as to the value of the property * * * and he may state to the jury the reasons upon which his opinion is based, in order that they may judge of the value of his testimony.\u2019 Again, in <em>Baltimore City v. Hurlock, </em>113 Md. 674, 683, 78 A. 558, the Court quoted, with approval, from an Illinois case as follows: \u2018The facts upon which opinions of expert witnesses as to the value of property proposed to be taken in condemnation proceedings, may be stated by them, either in chief, or upon cross-examination\u2019 * * * as their [the opinions\u2019] weight and value depends largely upon the foundation of fact and reason upon which they stand.\u2019 See also <em>M &amp; C. C. of Balto. v. Smith, etc. B. Co., </em>80 Md. 458, 472, 31 A. 423, 2 Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>(3rd Ed.), Secs. 562, 655. Cf. <em>State Roads Comm. of Md. v. Novosel, </em>203 Md. 619, 626, 102 A. 2d 563.\u201d 221 Md. at 168-169, 156 A. 2d at 646.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">Although the Court did find that it was error to have excluded the evidence concerning a comparable sale solely on the basis of it having occurred subsequent to the taking, the Court was \u201cunable to see how the exclusion of this one sale worked any real harm to or substantially prejudiced the appellants\u201d and that \u201cit was doubtful that this ruling of the trial court made any difference in the jury\u2019s verdict, much less a substantial one.\u201d After noting that no proffer was made in connection with the evidence which had been rejected, it stated, \u201cCourts are reluctant to set aside verdicts for errors in the admission or exclusion of evidence unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>they cause substantial injustice. This is especially true in condemnation proceedings. Such cases usually consume much time in trial, and are expensive in nature. As a rule, they are determined by a myriad of different items of evidence.\u201d 221 Md. at 176, 156 A. 2d at 650.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">In <em>Taylor, </em>one of the grounds urged for reversal was the contention by the land owners that the testimony of an expert for the appellee as to a comparable sale should have been excluded because the property referred to by him was \u201czoned,\u201d whereas the property being condemned was \u201cnot zoned.\u201d Although this contention was rejected because the record did not disclose how the lots in the sale had in fact been zoned, the Court, again through Judge Prescott, pointed out that \u201cthis Court has stated, and repeatedly restated, the rule in Maryland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">After quoting from <em>Lustine v. State Roads Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>(as we have hereinabove set forth) he further wrote: \u201cthe rule as thus stated conforms with the great weight of authority elsewhere (citations omitted).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">Judge Barnes, for this Court, in <em>State Roads Commission v. Adams, supra, </em>in a review of the rule and our antecedent holdings, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-8\">\u201cIn Maryland it is well settled that evidence of the price for which similar property has been sold in the vicinity may legitimately be used in support of, and as background for, the opinion of an expert testifying as to the value of the property taken in condemnation proceedings. <em>Williams v. New York, P. &amp; N. R. Co., </em>153 Md. 102, 108, 137 A. 506 (1927); <em>Patterson v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>127 Md. 233, 241, 96 A. 458 (1915). There is a conflict of authority nationally upon the question of whether the price paid at voluntary sales of land similar to that taken is admissible as independent evidence of the value of the land taken. See Annotation, 85 A.L.R.2d 110 (1962), <em>\u2018Admissibility on issue of value of real property of evidence of sale price of other real property.\u2019 </em>We adhere to the \u2018Massachusetts\u2019 or \u2018majority\u2019 view that evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>such sales is admissible as primary evidence of the value of the property taken, or to support an expert witness\u2019s opinion as to such value, or both. <em>Hance v. State Roads Commission, supra; Taylor v. State Roads Commission, </em>224 Md. 92, 167 A. 2d 127 (1961); see 5 Nichols, <em>Eminent Domain </em>(3rd ed.), Section 21.3 [1], In those states which adhere to the Massachusetts view the question frequently arises as to whether or not the conditions of other real property together with the circumstances surrounding its sale, are sufficiently similar to those of the land taken as to permit the admission of the sale price of the former as evidence of the value of the latter. In <em>Lustine v. State Roads Commission, </em>217 Md. 274, 142 A. 2d 566 (1958), we held that the trial court has \u2018considerable latitude\u2019 (or \u2018wide discretion,\u2019 <em>Bergeman v. State Roads Commission, </em>218 Md. 137, 146 A. 2d 48 (1958)) in determining what sales are \u2018reasonably comparable.\u2019 Moreover, we went further in <em>Lustine </em>and declared it the <em>better policy to admit testimony as to the sales where there are any reasonable ele m ents of comparability, and leave the weight of the comparison to the consideration of the jury, together with such contrasting or distinguishing features as may be brought out on cross-examination or otherwise (Lustine, </em>p. 281 of 217 Md.). Cf. <em>Winepol v. State Roads Commission, </em>220 Md. 227, 151 A. 2d 723 (1959) and <em>State Roads Commission v. Smith, </em>224 Md. 537, 548-549, 168 A. 2d 705 (1961). The appellant states that the question to be decided is whether Judge Macgill\u2019s rulings were \u2018correct,\u2019 but this formulation of the issue is ambiguous and perhaps misleading. <em>We do not undertake to weigh the similarities vel non between allegedly comparable properties as matters of first impression in this Court to be decided without reference to the action of the trial judge. Rather, we decide only whether the standards enunciated in Lustine and Bergen),an as applied to the facts of a </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number><em>given case \u2018compel a finding that the trial court abused its discretion,\u2019 Winepol v. State Roads Commission, supra, in admitting or refusing to admit the contested evidence. </em>Even a finding of abuse of discretion does not compel a reversal: see the comments of Judge Prescott, speaking for the Court in <em>Hance, supra, </em>at page 176 of 221 Md., discussing the reluctance of the courts generally to set aside judgments in condemnation cases for errors in the admission or exclusion of evidence, in the absence of express showing that these errors caused \u2018substantial injustice\u2019 to the complaining party.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) 238 Md. at 378-79, 209 A. 2d 250-51.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">In <em>Adams, </em>the Court held that there was no abuse of the wide discretion vested in the trial court when it admitted evidence of a sale of 280.3 acres of farm land, with a few out buildings thereon in a trial where the State Roads Commission was condemning 12.65 acres of the appellee\u2019s 196 acre dairy farm. The Court pointed out that the \u201ctract [was] sufficiently close, in point of locatipn and distance, and the sale thereof, sufficiently near, in point of time, as to furnish a test of the present value, other considerations aside.\u201d After pointing out that <em>Taylor v. State Roads Commission, supra, </em>had made it plain that the \u201c5 year and 5 mile limits\u201d was not a rule of law we held, \u201cas a legal proposition,\u201d that the sizes of the respective tracts (196 acres owned by the appellee and 280.3 acres in the \u201ccomparable sale\u201d) were not \u201cgrossly dissimilar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">After holding that \u201cappellant\u2019s contentions go to the weight rather than to the admissibility of the disputed evidence,\u201d the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-7\">\u201c[W]e base our disposition of these objections on the additional ground that there has been no satisfactory showing that the admission of the challenged evidence worked any \u2018substantial injustice\u2019 to the appellant, [footnote omitted.] <em>Hance v. State Roads Commission, supra. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>Prejudice, or the lack of it, is always of significance to an appellate court, and it assumes increased importance in condemnation cases, in view of the \u2018myriad of different items of evidence\u2019 sought to be introduced, <em>(Hance, </em>at 176). See <em>Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore v.

We are not dealing with an award of damages whose size is greatly in excess of the highest estimate of the appellees, and which must be taken to be based entirely upon the impressions gained by the jury from its view of the premises. Cf. <em>Bergeman v. State Roads Commission, supra, </em>at 142-143 of 218 Md. Nor does the verdict rest upon the untutored judgment of .the property owner.\u201d 238 Md. at 385, 209 A. 2d at 254.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">In <em>Smith v. Potomac Electric Power Co., </em>236 Md. 51, 202 A. 2d 604 (1964) while recognizing that \u201cin condemnation suits we have held admissible evidence of comparable sales as an aid in determining value and we have left much to the discretion of the trial court in deciding what sales are sufficiently comparable to be admissible,\u201d this Court found no abuse of discretion when the trial court excluded proffered evidence as to the rentals of a tract of land, developed as an industrial park less than a half mile distant from the land being condemned, because the two tracts were not comparable and the valuation was too speculative in character. The tract being condemned was raw land, scarred from mining operations, in need of regrading and was wholly undeveloped for use as an industrial park. By contrast, the condemned tract was a developed industrial park with improved roads and utilities, including five railroad sidings and a number of constructed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>industrially-used buildings. <em>See also Winepol v. State Roads Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>where it was held not to have been an abuse of discretion to have excluded evidence of a sale in a \u201cshopping district concededly of much higher grade than that in which the store of the appellant was located, and that its frontages on two commercial streets gave it an extraordinary and almost unique value.\u201d 220 Md. at 231, 151 A. 2d at 725-26; and <em>Greater Balto. Cons. Mkt. Authority v. Duvall, </em>255 Md. 90, 256 A. 2d 882 (1969), where it was held the trial court properly refused, as being too speculative a basis for valuation, proffered evidence from the property owner concerning the value of his undeveloped land based on his intention to ultimately develop the land for an industrial park and his belief concerning the valuation of finished sites in a neighboring industrial park.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">In <em>Taylor v. State Roads Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>this Court approved the method whereby an expert witness in connection with his opinion evidence of value makes \u201cadjustments\u201d in connection with sales he considers to be comparable. <em>See also State Roads Commission v. Wyvill, </em>244 Md. 163, 171, 223 A. 2d 146, 149-50 (1966) where a comparable sale was adjusted upward for time and downward because of location, and <em>First Nat\u2019l Realty v. State Roads Comm\u2019n, </em>255 Md. 605, 611, 258 A. 2d 419, 422 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">The appellant\u2019s expert witness Gilroy recognized the problem in attempting to locate sales which could be considered to be comparable when he stated \u201cyou try to get the properties with pretty much the same utility. However, in this case it wasn\u2019t easy because there weren\u2019t that many sales in the area that I felt were comparable to the subject zoning-wise and utility-wise.\u201d He limited such sales to three in number since he felt that the \u201ccloser\u201d they were to the subject property \u201cthe more comparable they were.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">As this Court pointed out in <em>Lustine, supra, </em>\u201creal estate parcels have a degree of uniqueness, which makes comparability, one with the other, in a strict sense practically impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">What the Utah court stated in <em>Redevelopment Agency of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number><em>Salt Lake City v. Mitsui Inv., Inc., </em>522 P. 2d 1370 (Utah 1974), cited by the appellant, concerning the exercise of \u201ccommon sense\u201d in this area as to the admissibility of such evidence is here particul\u00e1rly apropos. That court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-5\">\u201cOn the question of evaluation property, as in most areas of the law, a resort to common sense and practical experience is helpful. Real estate has always been regarded as unique because <em>no two parcels can be exactly alike. . </em>. . It is certainly not to be supposed that there will be found sales which are identical as to time, location, quantity and various characteristics of the property. The requirement is that it meet the test of <em>\u2018reasonable comparability. </em>\u2019 That is, that these factors exist in sufficient similarity that the sale can fairly be regarded as having <em>some probative value </em>in arriving at a proper appraisal of the property.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) 522 P. 2d at 1373.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">In striving for proximity the witness Richards, on behalf of the appellee, limited such sales to a radius of two miles, even though a number of such sales involved property zoned \u201clight industrial.\u201d The sale from Simplex Land Co. to Boron Oil Co. was, in distance, that closest to the property being condemned. Although the sales described by the appellee\u2019s witness Lee, were as much as 10 miles distant, all such properties were of land zoned \u201ccommercial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">Although the appellant in its brief, by arbitrarily packaged passages reminiscent of the chapters in James Joyce\u2019s \u201cUlysses\u201d recites in great factual detail a jury-type argument in support of dissimilarities between the land being condemned and the properties described by the witnesses Lee and Richards to which it made objection because of \u201csize,\u201d \u201cdistance\u201d and \u201czoning,\u201d it overlooks the fact that \u201c[w]e do not undertake to weigh the similarities vel non between allegedly comparable properties as matters of first impression in this Court to be decided without reference to the action of the trial judge.\u201d Our function is to \u201cdecide only whether the standards enunciated in <em>Lustine </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>and in <em>Bergeman </em>as applied to the facts of a given case \u2018compel a finding that the trial court abused its discretion\u2019 \u201d in admitting the contested evidence. <em>State Roads Comm\u2019n v. Adams, supra. </em>As we see it those sales recited by the witnesses Lee and Richards were not \u201cgrossly dissimilar\u201d in either acreage, or in remoteness, or in being zoned as \u201clight industrial\u201d to the appellees\u2019 land so as to require that they should have been excluded as having no \u201cprobative value\u201d in assisting at a proper evaluation of the property. The sales described, and to which objection was made, in an area of rapid and intense economic development contained \u201creasonable elements of comparability.\u201d The weight of the comparisons and such contrasting or distinguishing features as may have been elicited by cross-examination or otherwise, was for the consideration of the jury.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>State Roads Comm\u2019n v. Adams, supra, Taylor v. State Roads Comm\u2019n, supra. </em>References to such sales were merely predicates upon which the witnesses for the appellee undertook to arrive at an opinion of the fair market value of the condemned acreage. <em>Hance v. State Roads Comm\u2019n, supra. </em>We conclude that the \u201cstandards enunciated in <em>Lustine </em>and in <em>Bergeman\u201d </em>as applied to the facts by the trial court do not sustain the contention that it abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">There is nothing in the holdings in <em>Smith v. State Roads Comm\u2019n, </em>257 Md. 153, 262 A. 2d 533 (1970), cited by the appellant which dictates a different result. In that case it was held that the trial court had not erred in a case involving a condemnation of a portion of a quarry when it excluded expert testimony which sought to spell out in detail the unit price of the mineral deposits ' (sand and gravel) in the condemned land and multiply that factor by the number of useable \u00fcnits of sand and gravel which would be lost by the taking, stating that such a method was \u201ctoo speculative\u201d and that the proper measure of validation was the fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>market value of the land with its minerals, and not the minerals alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Additionally, as was pointed out in <em>Hance </em>and in <em>Adams, </em>\u201cthe appellant has singularly failed to show what substantial injustice has been done to it.\u201d There was no award of damages \u201cin excess of the highest estimate calculated by the witnesses for the appellee. Neither did the verdict rest upon the \u2018untutored judgment of the property owner.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">It was the jury\u2019s function to determine \u201cwhether the emphasis sought to be given in the facts in any of the testimony [by the experts] is correct, and they need not follow any witness\u2019 judgment as to the weight to be given to a particular factor in arriving at a valuation.\u201d <em>State Roads Commission v. Novosel, </em>203 Md. 619, 625, 102 A. 2d 563, 566 (1954). <em>See also Lustine v. State Roads Comm\u2019n, supra, </em>and <em>Bergeman v. State Roads Comm\u2019n, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">The holdings in <em>Congregation of St. Vincent de Paul v. Commonwealth, </em>336 Mass. 357, 359, 145 N.E.2d 681, 682 (1957), and in <em>Brush Hill Dev. Inc. v. Commonwealth, </em>338 Mass. 359, 367, 155 N.E.2d 170, 175 (1959), relied upon by the appellant, as we read them, are factually distinguishable. In the first such cited case the trial judge was held to have properly excluded evidence of a sale in a residential zone where the eondemnees\u2019 property was located in a commercial zone.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the <em>Brush Hill Development </em>case, there was held no abuse of discretion in excluding a comparable sale in a subdivision which had been approved for residential purposes where the subject property had not been so approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">The appellant\u2019s reliance upon the holdings in <em>Comm. Redev. Agency v. Henderson, </em>251 Cal.App.2d 336, 59 Cal. Rptr. 311 (1967), in <em>Urban Ren. Agency of Austin v. Georgetown S &amp; L Assoc., </em>509 S.W.2d 419 (Tex. Civ. App., 1974) and in <em>City of Garland v. Joyce, </em>462 S.W.2d 86 (Tex. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>Civ. App., 1970) is misplaced. In <em>Henderson </em>it was held to have been no abuse of discretion to have excluded evidence of sales made in a commercially zoned downtown business section since the property being condemned, although contiguous to that business section, was in a blighted area, zoned for residences, 95% of which had been constructed prior to 1919. In each of the Texas cases, that court held that a witness cannot \u201crelate to the jury sales of tracts obviously not similar and then \u2018adjust\u2019 those sales and the prices paid to the opinion of the witness so as to call them \u2018comparable\u2019 \u201d, and pointed out, in <em>Joyce, </em>that \u201cthe witness did not use the sales to arrive at an opinion of value; he used his opinion of value of the severed tracts to \u2018adjust\u2019 the prices paid on the sale in an attempt to make the sales \u2018comparable\u2019 \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Obviously the appellant\u2019s witness Richards did not in his \u201cadjustments\u201d use the procedure condemned by the Texas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The salient observation made by Chief Judge Bru\u00f1e of this Court in <em>Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore v. State Roads Comm\u2019n, </em>232 Md. 145, 151, 192 A. 2d 271, 275 (1963), when he stated: \u201c[t]he appellants\u2019 main difficulty seems to be that the jury did not accept their appraisers\u2019 valuation\u201d seems here particularly appropriate. <em>See also State Roads Comm \u2019n v. Adams, supra, </em>at 385; <em>Greater Balto. Cons. Mkt. Authority v. Duvall, supra, </em>at 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">The appellant\u2019s next contention is that the trial judge committed prejudicial error and improperly afforded undue weight to one of the sales described as comparable during the testimony of the witness Richards. While describing a sale from the Hampton Park Corporation to James E. Boatman, et al. in 1971 of a lot containing 42,112.81 sq. ft. (.967 acres) which had sold for $75,000.00, counsel for the appellant objected and moved that reference to the sale be stricken because \u201cthe size of the subject is ten times as large as the sale and the zoning is different and it has all utilities. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>I believe it is incomparable.\u201d The trial judge in overruling the objection, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-3\">\u201cTHE COURT: I don\u2019t know. He hasn\u2019t testified as to the utilities. I feel that something an acre could be compared because the ten acres could be broken up into acre lots, if they wish. Under the circumstances I feel that the acre would be comparable and as stated before, I feel the zoning would be comparable enough zoning, so the Court will overrule the objection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">No objection was made to these remarks nor was there any motion to strike them or for a mistrial. Hence, the question is not properly before us. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 885; <em>Dresbach v. State, </em>228 Md. 451, 453, 180 A. 2d 299, 300 (1962). <em>See also Mezzanotte Const. Co. v. Gibons, </em>219 Md. 178, 181-82, 148 A. 2d 399, 402 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">We see the remarks of the trial court, however, as no more than a statement of the very logical reason given for the ruling made on the objection, coming as it did during the direct examination of the witness Richards when virtually every answer he gave was objected to on some ground or another on behalf of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Although we see no prejudice in the remarks made, assuming arguendo that it did constitute error, it was dispelled by the clear and explicit instructions by the trial court to the jury when he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-7\">\u201cAny comment 1 may have made or that I make about the case is only for the purpose of procedure or clarification and any such comment or comments made by me or the tone of my voice or anything I may have said or done are not to be considered by you to show that I have an opinion as to the proper amount to be awarded in this case. Under no circumstances am I to influence your opinion as you the jury are to decide the award according to the evidence before you, of which you are the sole judges.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number><em>See State Roads Comm\u2019n v.

Blanchette, </em>239 Md. 168, 175, 210 A. 2d 732, 736 (1965) where the trial court after, examination, cross-examination and redirect examination of the appellant\u2019s expert witness, poignantly asked the witness why the subject property wasn\u2019t a \u201cdelightful project for a residential sub-division\u201d and it was alleged that the trial judge thereby had expressed to the jury that in his opinion \u201cthe highest and best use of the property was for residential purposes.\u201d There \u2014 as we do here \u2014 it was held that the trial court\u2019s instruction dispelled any possible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Although the appellant\u2019s third contention of error asserts that the trial court sustained \u201cobjections to questions upon cross-examination of appellees\u2019 appraisers, which sought to ascertain if they understood a relevant principle implicit in the statutory definition of \u2018fair market value,\u2019 \u201d it is difficult to fathom from the appellant\u2019s disjointed argument whether it relates to rulings by the trial court upon the voir dire examination of the witnesses\u2019 qualifications to testify as experts, or whether it pertains to cross-examination of those witnesses pertaining to any enhancement in the value of the property as a result of the public project built.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">Although \u201cit is not incumbent upon this Court, merely because a point is mentioned as being objectionable at some point in a party\u2019s brief, to scan the entire record and ascertain if there be any ground, or grounds, to sustain the objectionable feature suggested,\u201d <em>see State Roads Comm\u2019n v. Halle, </em>228 Md. 24, 32, 178 A. 2d 319, 323 (1962), we shall review the cross-examination of both the appellees\u2019 experts to ascertain whether or not the appellant was precluded from cross-examining them in either facet of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">After counsel for the appellees in a voir dire examination of the witness John L.

BRICE: I would <em>like to ask one more question.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-7\">\u201cMR.

LANCASTER: I object, Your Honor. This is flaunting the Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: This Court will sustain the objection because there is no law that says he has to give the Code definition. It says whether it is a recognized definition recognized in Maryland. I would say what he gave is recognized.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-11\">\u201cAll right, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-12\">\u201cMP. LANCASTER: I submit the witness is qualified, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: I don\u2019t know that there are any further questions. Are <em>there any further questions!</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-14\">\u201cMR. BRICE: <em>No, Your Honor.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-15\">\u201cTHE COURT: All right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-16\">Similarly, after the witness Adelbert W. Lee was examined concerning his qualifications, he was cross-examined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-17\">\u201cMR. BRICE: What is the definition of fair market value?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-18\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: It is what\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-19\">\u201cMR. BRICE: Can you do it without reading it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-20\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: Yes, sir. I am not about to read it. Fair market value is what a willing purchaser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>and willing buyer, both completely informed on values are willing to pay on the market free of any compulsion to either buy or sell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-5\">\u201cMR. BRICE: <em>I have nothing further. </em>I note an objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: What?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-7\">\u201cMR. BRICE: Note an objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Overruled.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">It is patent that the appellant\u2019s contention that it was precluded from being able to cross-examine either of the appellees\u2019 witnesses as to the definition of \u201cfair market value\u201d is frivolous. The answers given by each of the witnesses \u2014 as asked by the questions \u2014 certainly satisfied the general definition of \u201cfair market value.\u201d If counsel for the appellant had other specific questions which he wished to address to each of the witnesses considering the statutory definition as set out in Code (1957, 1973 Repl. Vol.), Art. 21, \u00a7 12-106 (a), he was in no way precluded from addressing such questions to the witnesses, but he abandoned any further examination of them. Simply put, if he wished to inquire of the witnesses whether they recognized that in condemnation proceedings \u201cany increment in value proximately caused by the public project for which the property [being] condemned is needed\u201d should be excluded, in arriving at \u201cthe fair market value of the property being condemned,\u201d it would have been a simple enough proposition to have posed such a question.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">The appellant also contends \u2014 as best we can understand it \u2014 that the appellees\u2019 expert witnesses failed \u201cto realize that they were required to value the tract as though relocated Landover Road did not exist\u201d and thus failed to exclude from their opinion of fair market value any \u201cenhancement\u201d in the valuation of the property as a result of the \u201cpublic project\u201d for which the condemned property was needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-11\">To properly understand what we see to be the objection in this regard requires the setting forth of the cross-examination of each of the witnesses as it was directed to this subject matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>The witness Richards was cross-examined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-5\">\u201cQ.

In the second paragraph of that letter, do you not state that \u2018Although the subject is converted in the appraisal process to square feet, it is acreage.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-8\">Do you say that? A. When it is sold as acreage it is listed in the tax sale as acreage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-9\">\u201cQ. You are saying it is acreage? A. Because I took it from the tax sale.

A. No, sir. I would like to correct that statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-5\">\u201cI found great confusion in identifying this property.

It is what we call property having <em>sight visibility of the intersection of those roads. </em>But again, sir, I have had great difficulty in identifying just where this was because of insufficient records of the State Roads Commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-9\">\u201cQ. Did you not say in your report that it is a ten acre parcel of land situated on the corner of Central Avenue and Landover Road? A. I did, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-10\">\u201cQ.

Although the witness Lee was examined about whether he had located the subject property \u201cat the corner\u201d of the two highways, and he responded that he had so geographically located and identified the property, no question was ever addressed to him concerning any enhancement in valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-12\">In the rather detached, obtuse manner in which counsel for the appellant cross-examined the witness Richards he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>first inquired as to whether or not the witness had \u201cbelieved\u201d that the property \u201cwas on a corner\u201d; he then switched the subject matter of his examination to the contents of the witness\u2019 report concerning the acreage of the properties considered as \u201ccomparable sales.\u201d On return to the subject-matter the witness denied that he ever described the appellees\u2019 property as \u201ca corner lot\u201d and stated that he did not indicate that the property \u201c.had access to [Route] 202.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">In another portion of the witness\u2019 cross-examination, he was asked whether or not he was aware that the State Highway Administration was acquiring the property for the construction of relocated Maryland Route 202 and a ramp from Central Avenue on to new 202. The witness, after stating that he was so \u201caware,\u201d replied that he had seen nothing in writing, had heard it by \u201cword of mouth,\u201d but \u201cthe way the state changes its mind, you don\u2019t know what they are going to put in there.\u201d He finished his answer by stating \u201cwhat the government intends to do with a piece of property has no bearing on the value of that property at the time of the trial.\u201d After then digressing to examine the witness concerning the sale \u201cfrom Simplex to Boron [Oil Co.],\u201d the appellant returned to the \u201cpublic improvement\u201d issue and the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-6\">\u201cQ. Did you not just explain to us that when valuing a piece of property you are to disregard the public improvement that is being put in, it has no effect on value? I think you just said that. A. I just don\u2019t connect that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-7\">\u201cMR. LANCASTER: I don\u2019t think he said that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: No, he didn\u2019t say that. He says he doesn\u2019t disregard the public improvement when he appraises the property for the purpose of getting a condemnation suit. I don\u2019t know what your question is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-9\">\u201cMR. BRICE: That he does or does not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: In estimating the value of the land he doesn\u2019t consider the improvements that are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>to be put in as being valuable to the land, but not that he doesn\u2019t consider them. I am trying to keep it straight because there is an objection. He didn\u2019t say he didn\u2019t consider them if the property is being condemned on a public improvement. I think that was the tenor of your question, the way I understood it. Maybe I am wrong. Maybe you can clarify it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Instead then of undertaking to clarify his questioning in this regard \u2014 as suggested by the trial court \u2014 counsel for the appellant departed from this line of inquiry and asked the witness Richards whether he had \u201cexamined the neighborhood.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Our evaluation of all the cross-examination of the witness Richards leads to the conclusion that there were no rulings by the trial court which prevented the appellant from inquiring whether or not his valuation of the property included any increment in value resulting from the highway construction for which the property was being taken. He said it did not!</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">The final contention by the appellant is that the trial court failed to grant its instruction that comparable sales \u201ccan be viewed as primary or independent evidence of value.\u201d It argues that the failure to give the requested instruction \u201cmandated a reliance upon the opinion testimony to the exclusion of such independent evidence of values.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\">After the jury had been instructed and counsel were invited to \u201capproach the bench\u201d for the noting of any exceptions, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-10\">\u201cMR. BRICE: This is the plaintiff talking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-11\">\u201cI would except to the Court\u2019s failure to give the instruction of the plaintiff which reads:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-12\">\u201c \u2018You are instructed that you are to determine the comparability of market sales offered in evidence in support of opinion testimony or as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>independent evidence of value. You are further instructed that if you deem or find any such sale or sales to be particularly comparable to the subject property, then such sale or sales are the best evidence of value\u2019 \u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">In ruling on that, and other exceptions taken by the appellant, the trial court stated: \u201cIt is the opinion of the court that the jury has been properly instructed and that most of what the plaintiff has taken exception to the court has covered in its own terms.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-6\">\u201cIt is settled law in this State that evidence of the price for which similar property in the vicinity has actually been sold may be used as <em>primary </em>evidence of the value of the property taken <em>or in support of and as background for </em>the opinion of an expert testifying as to the value of the property, <em>or both.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) <em>State Roads Comm\u2019n v.

Halle, supra, </em>228 Md. at 32, 178 A. 2d at 323.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">Although the record transmitted to this Court does not contain such a requested instruction. as having been submitted to the trial court, we assume that such a request was before the lower court since in noting its exception counsel for the appellant apparently undertook to read verbatim a submitted instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">As framed, the requested instruction would have the court tell the jury \u201cto determine the comparability of market sales [which were offered in evidence] <em>in support of </em>[the] opinion testimony <em>or </em>[which were offered] <em>as independent evidence of value.\u201d </em>Not being framed within the holdings in <em>Wyvill, Adams </em>or <em>Halle, </em>it did not request that the jury might consider evidence of the sales of comparable properties \u201cas primary evidence of the value of the property taken\u201d or consider such evidence \u201cin support of and as background for the opinion\u201d of the experts testifying, or consider \u201cboth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">If the appellant had desired to have the jury instructed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>accordance with the holdings in <em>Wyvill, Adams </em>and <em>Halle, </em>it would have been a simple enough matter to have prepared such a requested instruction with some preciseness. It is obvious that the nebulous nature of the proposal \u2014 being incomplete as a matter of law \u2014 would have done nothing in assisting the jury in connection with the evidence submitted to it of \u201ccomparable sales.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Additionally, it is noted that the appellant, by the second sentence in its requested instructions sought to have the jury told that if they found a \u201csale or sales to be particularly comparable to the subject property, then such sale or sales are the <em>best evidence </em>of value.\u201d No citation of authority is provided for this bald statement, and we know of none.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The first sentence in the requested instruction was imprecise, did not fully state the recognized principle of law and by syntax was most confusing. In our view there was no error in failing to grant it.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">In its instructions to the jury, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-8\">\u201cNow, in considering the factual issues of the case you are to consider all of the evidence bearing on each issue regardless of whether the plaintiff or the defendant produced the evidence. I might also add that what you saw at the scene of the property when you visited the property is evidence to be considered by you, together with the other evidence offered in determining your award to the owner. In consideration of all the evidence you may relate your own experience and common sense and consider what you saw at the scene to test and weigh the correctness of the testimony given by the various witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-9\">\u201cIn condemnation cases it is proper for experts to testify as to the sale price of properties in the area similar to the property which is the subject matter of this case and to testify to such information which is generally termed comparable sales as a background for the expert\u2019s opinion in testifying as to the value of the property taken in the condemnation proceeding. Of course, it is for you to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>determine to what extent such sales as were previously made in the area on which the experts base their opinions are similar to the property which is the subject matter of this proceeding, and you may determine the value of any such adjustments as you feel may be necessary because of any difference that you may find to exist between the sales of the property testified to and the land being taken in this case. As I previously stated, you are also to consider the testimony and exhibits and your view of the property in arriving at your verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">As we see it, the instruction given by the trial court to the jury fully and fairly covered the issue of comparable sales in the case and there was no requirement on its part to grant any specific requested instruction submitted by the appellant \u2014 assuming arguendo \u2014 that such proffered instruction would have, with precision, submitted to the jury a correct proposition of law. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 554 b 1. <em>See also Aleshire v. State, Use of Dearstone, </em>225 Md. 355, 370, 170 A. 2d 758, 765 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">We find no error when the trial court denied the appellant\u2019s exception and refused to further instruct the jury as the appellant requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">\n<em>Judgment of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County affirmed; costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b675-7\">.

Bight additional sales considered by the witness Lee pertaining to properties of one-half acre or less were not proffered by him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b679-8\">. Appellant indeed objected to another such sale but when counsel\u2019s attention was directed to the inclusion of that same transaction by its expert witness, Gilroy, the objection was withdrawn!</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b692-6\">. The jury\u2019s evaluation of the weight to be given the testimony by the four expert witnesses was, of course, facilitated by its own view and inspection of the subject property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b693-9\">. No sales of residential properties were submitted as \u201ccomparable\u201d by either of the expert witnesses for the appellees. Although some such sales were included in their reports, objections to their admissibility were sustained.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
