Siegel, the respondent, admitted on 12 November 1930 to the practice of law before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">On 5 January 1971, the grand jury in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland returned a three-count felony indictment, each count charging, for the calendar years 1963, 1964 and 1965, respectively, Mr. Siegel with \u201cwillfully and knowingly attempting] to evade and defeat a large part of the income tax due and owing,\u201d by filing with the Internal Revenue Service a false and fraudulent joint income tax return on behalf of himself and his wife, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201. After communication with the Assistant United States Attorney assigned to prosecute the case, Mr. Siegel appeared in the district court on 14 April 1972, where he proffered a nolo contendere plea to the first count of that three-count indictment. Before acting on this offer Judge James R. Miller, Jr., fully interrogated the accused concerning, among other things, the voluntariness of his plea, his under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>standing of the charges, and his awareness of the consequences. It was only after the judge was completely satisfied with Mr. Siegel\u2019s answers to these inquiries, that he accepted the plea to this felony count, although he stated he seldom did this with such a charge. A few months later, on 1 September 1972, Judge Miller imposed a one-year prison sentence, but suspended the serving of all except thirty days of the period (subsequently reduced to twenty-two days), and the Assistant United States Attorney entered a <em>nolle prosequi </em>for the remaining two counts of the indictment. There is no contention that the entry of this plea is anything but a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">As a consequence of this judgment, entered after the acceptance of Mr. Siegel\u2019s nolo contendere plea, which judgment for disciplinary purposes is \u201cdeemed to be a conviction,\u201d Maryland Rule BV4 f 1, The Bar Association of Baltimore City, the petitioner in this proceeding, acting pursuant to Rule BV3 a, filed a \u201cPetition for Disciplinary Action\u201d in this Court, which charged the respondent with \u201cprofessional misconduct, a crime involving moral turpitude, or conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice,\u201d resulting from Siegel\u2019s \u201cWillful Evasion of Income Taxes.\u201d So that the allegations could be heard and recommendations concerning their disposition be made, we transmitted this petition, as authorized by Rule BV3 b, to a three-judge panel of the Supreme Bench of Baltimore City, consisting of Chief Judge Dulany Foster and Judges Robert B. Watts and Robert L. Karwacki. On 22 November 1974, the respondent, by his answer to the charges, admitted the allegations contained in the petition, conceding among other things that he was convicted of criminal tax fraud by virtue of his nolo contendere plea, but urged, nonetheless, \u201cthat he has not been guilty of professional misconduct, of a crime involving moral turpitude, nor conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d Following a hearing the judicial panel found the charges to be sustained; nevertheless, by memorandum submitted to this Court, on 6 January 1975, it unanimously recommended: \u201cIn light of . . . factors proffered in mitigation, we feel that the appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>sanction in this case would be suspension from the practice of law for a period of one year.\u201d The bar association and Mr. Siegel urge us to adopt the panel\u2019s sentiment.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">After considering this recommendation from the panel and reviewing the record made at the hearing, both filed in accordance with Rule BV5 b, this Court, on 21 February 1975, ordered the respondent to \u201cshow cause on or before the 31st day of March, 1975, why he should not be disbarred . . . .\u201d Mr. Siegel timely responded and asserted that he \u201cshould not be disbarred because of the most compelling extenuating circumstances existing in this unusual case.\u201d The \u201ccircumstances\u201d relied on by the respondent, in our view, fall into one of two categories: (i) events surrounding the institution of the criminal charges and the entry of the nolo contendere plea, and (ii) Mr. Siegel\u2019s reputation as a member of the bar of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">Before probing the respondent\u2019s reasons as to why he should not be disbarred, we reiterate what has been well established by the previous decisions of this Court: \u201cwillful tax evasion, proscribed by \u00a7 7201, is in that class of felonious crimes which involve moral turpitude and are infested with fraud, deceit, and dishonesty,\u201d <em>Maryland St. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Callanan, </em>271 Md. 554, 556, 318 A. 2d 809 (1974); therefore, once a final judgment of conviction has been entered establishing that a member of the bar of this Court is guilty of this offense, that attorney will be disbarred unless he can \u201cdemonstrate by clear and convincing evidence a compelling reason to the contrary.\u201d <em>Maryland St. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Agnew, </em>271 Md. 543, 551, 318 A. 2d 811 (1974); see <em>Maryland St. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Callanan, supra; Rheb v. Bar Ass\u2019n of Baltimore, </em>186 Md. 200, 46 A. 2d 289 (1946). The rationale for this conclusion has been previously and thoroughly discussed by this Court in the three cases cited above, making it unnecessary for us to re-examine it in this proceeding \u2014 especially since the present respondent raises no challenge concerning it. Therefore, the task here is to determine whether Mr. Siegel has offered a \u201ccompelling exculpatory explanation\u201d which would justify the imposition of less than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>the extreme sanction, <em>Maryland St. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Agnew, supra </em>at 550.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">(i)</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">In an attempt to convince this Court that he should not be disbarred because of \u201ccompelling extenuating circumstances,\u201d citing <em>Maryland St. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Agnew, supra </em>at 553, Mr. Siegel requests that we scrutinize the various \u201cunusual\u201d occurrences which led up to and influenced his plea of nolo contendere. He delineates these in his answer to the show cause order by quoting the following factors mentioned by the hearing panel in its memorandum and recommendation: \u201chis prosecution on the indictment filed against him . . . was recommended against by two United States Attorneys\u201d; \u201cprosecution was overzealously pursued\u201d; \u201chis plea of nolo contendere was necessitated by considerations for his inability [, due to health reasons,] to undergo an extended trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The first circumstance which the respondent proffers is the fact that two highly respected United States Attorneys, Stephen H. Sachs and George Beall, recommended to the appropriate authorities in the United States Department of Justice that the prosecution of Mr. Siegel under the three-count indictment be abandoned. By spotlighting the inclinations of these two reputable former federal prosecutors the respondent appears to be intimating that the case against him was so weak that it would have resulted in his acquittal had he maintained his protestation of innocence and stood trial. Even if the prosecution had a weak case, that is not a \u201ccompelling extenuating circumstance\u201d diminishing the degree of culpability inherent in his guilt. Moreover, on several occasions \u2014 before Judge Miller, before the three-judge panel, and before this Court \u2014 either the respondent or his counsel consistently agreed that the evidence available to the prosecutor for presentation at trial was at least sufficient to create a jury question. As Judge Miller said before he accepted the nolo contendere plea:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-7\">\u201cThe court is satisfied that the plea of nolo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>contendere to count one is entered by the defendant, Maurice T. Siegel, freely and voluntarily with full knowledge of the possible consequences thereof; ... and that there is a basis for the charge that would, in the evidence that would be presented, at least, at the very least, present a jury question; and, that there is a reasonable possibility that a finding of guilt could be made by the jury in the event that count one went to trial on the plea of not guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">In addition, if by focusing on the fact that two United States Attorneys for the District of Maryland recommended that the criminal charges against him be dropped, the respondent is urging that we consider their judgment rather than the assessment of their superiors in the Justice Department, he is asking us to ignore the chain of command within the federal prosecutorial system \u2014 something, absent a significant reason, we are reluctant to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The respondent next insists that the impetus behind the bringing of the charges against him in the tax fraud case was generated by the animosities of certain federal law enforcement officials who attempted, but failed, to have him convicted in another criminal matter relating to the operation of an illegal lottery, see <em>State v. Siegel, </em>266 Md. 256, 292 A. 2d 86 (1972). Beside the fact that this allegation is unsubstantiated by the respondent, we answer this suggestion by pointing out that impugning the motives of those who press charges does not erase the crime\u2019s occurrence or diminish the criminality of one\u2019s participation in it, if in fact it was perpetrated by the accused. In any event, the way to counteract the type of overreaching by government agents alleged here is to destroy their credibility at trial, before judge or jury, not by confessing to having committed the criminal act and complaining afterward that those who instigated the bringing of the charges were inspired by impure motives.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Thirdly, Mr. Siegel urges that his nolo contendere plea was largely, if not exclusively, the result of his extremely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>poor health \u2014 two massive heart attacks \u2014 which he suffered after he was indicted for tax fraud. We responded to this same contention when it was made under like circumstances in <em>Maryland St. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Callanan, supra </em>at 557, where we decided that while the \u201chealth problem is distressing ... we conclude that since [it] . . . developed or occurred <em>subsequent </em>to his criminal activity. . . [this coronary malady does] not serve to palliate the evil of his offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">But aside from these flaws in the respondent\u2019s arguments, which have already been individually examined, there is, more importantly, an overriding reason as to why the factors which Mr. Siegel contends justify a lesser sanction than disbarment cannot even be considered within the category of \u201ccompelling extenuating circumstances.\u201d Those considerations which potentially could merit this designation, even though the respondent has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude, are only those which may cause this Court to view the conviction in a light which tends to show that the respondent\u2019s illegal act, committed in violation of a criminal statute, resulted from intensely strained circumstances or that the magnitude and the nature of the crime are not so severe as to compel disbarment. On the other hand, we cannot accept as \u201ccompelling extenuating circumstances\u201d those proffers by the respondent which in essence call upon us to assess the integrity of the criminal conviction itself \u2014 that prior adjudication is conclusive and thus cannot be attacked in a disciplinary proceeding by invoking this Court to reweigh or to re-evaluate the respondent\u2019s guilt or innocence. This is so as we are prohibited from such a consideration by Rule BV4 f 1, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\">\u201cIn a hearing of charges pursuant to this Rule, a final judgment by a judicial tribunal in another proceeding convicting an attorney of a crime shall be conclusive proof of the guilt of the attorney of such crime. A plea or verdict of guilty, or a plea of <em>nolo contendere </em>followed by a fine or sentence, shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>be deemed to be a conviction within the meaning of this Rule. A final adjudication by a judicial tribunal in a disciplinary proceeding that an attorney has been guilty of misconduct shall be considered as conclusive proof of such misconduct in the hearing of charges pursuant to this Rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Based on this rule and based on the cases which have applied it, <em>see Maryland St. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Rosenberg, </em>273 Md. 351, 329 A. 2d 106 (1974); <em>Maryland St. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Kerr, </em>272 Md. 687, 326 A. 2d 180 (1974); <em>Maryland St. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Agnew, supra; see also </em>concurring opinion in <em>In re Braverman, </em>271 Md. 196, 212, 316 A. 2d 246 (1974), we must conclude, regardless of what the respondent suggests, that the final judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, entered after Mr. Siegel\u2019s nolo contendere plea, is conclusive proof of his guilt of the crime charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">(ii)</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Aside from the circumstances preceding the nolo contendere plea, the respondent notes that his \u201crecord as a member of the Bar for over forty years was unblemished and [that he is] ... held with obvious esteem in his community, both as a lawyer and as a family man,\u201d which he asserts are extenuating circumstances warranting a lesser sanction than disbarment. These plaudits tend to make more distasteful our responsibility in this type of proceeding; but, because \u201can attorney\u2019s character <em>must remain beyond reproach,\u201d </em>this \u201cCourt has the duty, since attorneys are its officers, to insist upon the <em>maintenance </em>of the integrity of the bar and to prevent the transgressions of an individual lawyer from bringing its image into disrepute. Disciplinary proceedings have been established for this purpose, not for punishment, but rather as a catharsis for the profession and a prophylactic for the public.\u201d (emphasis added) <em>Maryland St. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Agnew, supra </em>at 549; see <em>Balliet v. Balto. Co. Bar Ass\u2019n, </em>259 Md. 474, 270 A. 2d 465 (1970). Our constancy in this responsibility cannot be shaken by our respect for an individual attorney\u2019s reputation, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>our recognition of the longevity of his career at the bar, or by our appreciation for his service to the community. Indeed, some may even suggest that the more years of practice and the greater the stature within and without the profession a member of this bar can boast, the closer the scrutiny and the stricter the demands that should be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Since the respondent was convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude, and no sufficient and compelling mitigating circumstances were presented in his behalf to justify the imposition of a lesser sanction, the name of Maurice T. Siegel will be stricken from the rolls of those authorized to practice law in this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b551-6\">\n<em>Levine, J.,</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"Ai\">\n<em>dissenting:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">I respectfully dissent. At the outset, it must be observed that certain aspects of this case, of vital significance to the contentions presented by both the bar association and the respondent, have been glossed over by the majority. Hence, they merit further consideration and emphasis here.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">First, the cursory reference to the proceedings before Judge Miller in the United States District Court does not reflect the full import of the respondent\u2019s plea and its acceptance. As the assistant United States Attorney presenting the case suggested to the court at that time, although the Government normally lodges a \u201cvigorous objection to a nolo contendere plea, especially [when] offered by an attorney in a tax evasion case,\u201d in this instance it merely wished to \u201cfile a minor technical objection\u201d because of the respondent\u2019s \u201chealth.\u201d Nor, in departing from its customary policy in such cases, did the prosecution make any recommendation of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">Eminent counsel then representing the respondent in the tax case informed the court that he had strongly recommended the negotiations and the resulting plea. For reasons which he thoroughly detailed, it was his considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>opinion that many of the witnesses whom the prosecution intended to call could be discredited, and that the remainder of its case was tenuous. Furthermore, having witnessed the effect upon the respondent of the two-week trial in the Criminal Court of Baltimore, he was truly fearful of the toll \u2014 as was the heart specialist treating the respondent \u2014 that might be exacted by a six-week trial in the tax case. No one has ever challenged this estimate, nor the likelihood that the respondent\u2019s testimony alone would have consumed approximately two weeks. As the record shows, the trial judge sitting in the Criminal Court of Baltimore (Ross, J.) had found it necessary on humane grounds to call frequent recesses of ample duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">In accepting the plea, Judge Miller emphasized that \u201cabsent special circumstances,\u201d a plea of nolo contendere normally would not have been allowed \u201cin a case of this type.\u201d Nevertheless, he had concluded that this was \u201cone of the <em>rare </em>cases in which it would be appropriate\u201d to do so. (emphasis added). Later, at the sentencing hearing, he amplified his reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-5\">\u201c. .. [T]his is a case that would likely be lengthy, at least several weeks. The health of the defendant is very bad, according to the medical reports which I have received and which other members of this Court, in connection with pre-trial motions and matters, have also received.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">\u201c. . . [T]his is a type of case in which it is, as a practical matter, almost mandatory that the defendant take the stand and testify in explanation of the various matters[.] ... Based on the medical evidence which is available to me, such an ordeal, aside from the strain of the trial itself, would be <em>extremely serious </em>to the health of the Defendant; and <em>that is probably putting it as an understatement. </em>.. .\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">He - then proceeded to impose sentence, which he subsequently modified by requiring the respondent merely to serve 22 days at Allenwood Prison Camp.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>Secondly, because it erroneously perceives the respondent\u2019s emphasis on the weaknesses of the tax case as an effort to attack the conviction itself, the majority completely overlooks the relationship which those infirmities bear to this proceeding. Specifically, as the prosecutor handling the case patiently detailed on three separate occasions (before the federal court, the bar association\u2019s grievance committee, and the three-judge panel below), the Government had built its case not only on the conventional \u201cnet worth plus expenditure\u201d theory, but also on the estimate by a Department of Labor economist that the respondent and his family had spent specific sums on \u201cconsumables.\u201d This approach, which had not been previously employed by the Government in this federal district, was in the opinion of the prosecutor \u201cnovel\u201d; hence, he and his colleagues \u201chad some question as to whether or not it would be successful.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">The remaining proof of the tax case was to rest on the testimony of a large number of witnesses who had been clients of the respondent in connection with various gambling charges lodged against them in the state courts. One -particularly large segment of these witnesses had also testified for the state in the criminal court prosecution, where they had been so thoroughly discredited that an acquittal resulted on all of the charges that had been brought to trial. In light of this summary of the tax case, one can appreciate why the prosecutor characterized the nolo contendere plea as a \u201cgood deal\u201d for the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The majority dismisses the recommendation of the two former United States Attorneys that the respondent not be prosecuted as an attempt by the latter to equate their evaluation of the tax case with the required \u201ccompelling extenuating circumstances.\u201d Although this is clearly not the purpose of his argument, it is not inappropriate to consider what one of the former prosecutors did say in these proceedings. Mr. Sachs had thought the case so \u201cthin and weak\u201d that he returned it to the Department of Justice with a recommendation against prosecution. At the hearing before the three-judge panel, he was less delicate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>characterizing the case as a \u201clousy\u201d one \u2014 \u201ca very thin net worth case; ... we did not feel that the case should go forward.... we felt it was marginal at best in terms of strength.\u201d This was \u201cthe only time [he] remember[ed] disagreeing with the Tax Division\u201d during his tenure as United States Attorney. That the appraisal of the two former United States Attorneys should not be lightly dismissed is perhaps underscored by the observation of bar association counsel that he had never known either of them to \u201cwalk away from a difficult case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">The gravamen of the matter, however, is not simply that the federal prosecution might well have failed in the event of a trial. To merely make that point here would amount to little more than \u2014 as the majority erroneously regards it \u2014 an attack upon the conviction. This is where the majority misconceives the essence of the respondent\u2019s position. It is not that because of the weakness of the prosecution\u2019s case, he should not be disciplined. The plea of nolo contendere \u2014 as the respondent quickly concedes \u2014 is dispositive on that score. We are confronted here, however, with the proper sanction to be invoked. To that extent, as the three-judge panel recognized, all mitigating circumstances are relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Therefore, the critical point here is the submission of the nolo contendere plea in light of the suspect quality of the tax case. Manifestly, the answer lies in the poor state of the respondent\u2019s health. As the bar association counsel observed, it \u201cdenied him his day in court.\u201d In short, but for his health, the respondent would have been afforded a full opportunity to defend against the charges; and enough has been said about his prospects in those circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">It is no answer, I submit, to say that the respondent\u2019s heart attacks occurred \u201csubsequent to his criminal activity . .. .\u201d Nowhere in <em>Maryland St. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Callanan, </em>271 Md. 554, 318 A. 2d 809 (1974), did we state, much less hold, as the majority does for the first time here, that \u201ccompelling extenuating circumstances\u201d may arise only where the conduct itself \u201cresulted from intensely strained circumstances or [where] the magnitude and the nature of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>the crime are not so severe as to compel disbarment.\u201d While the latter part of that statement is patently without significance, the first part is a wholly unwarranted extension of <em>Callanan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">We held in <em>Maryland St. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Agnew, </em>271 Md. 543, 318 A. 2d 811 (1974), that disbarment will follow from conduct such as occurred here absent \u201cthe most compelling extenuating circumstances.\u201d Both the bar association and the three-judge panel thought this was such a case, and so do I. If what we truly meant to say was that a conviction on such charges will automatically and <em>absolutely </em>result in disbarment, we should not have- included any idle expressions about \u201ccompelling extenuating circumstances.\u201d As I read the majority opinion \u2014 in light of the facts here \u2014 I sincerely question whether it is realistic to suggest that a state of facts can ever exist which will suffice to avoid disbarment in this kind of case.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">It must now be clear to the respondent that he was confronted with a monumental \u201cHobson\u2019s choice\u201d when he appeared in the federal court: either run a serious risk of losing his life by going to trial on a case acknowledged by virtually everyone officially associated with it to be a weak one; or face certain disbarment by pleading nolo contendere in reliance upon the sound medical and legal advice which he had received. If what we said in <em>Agnew </em>in respect to \u201ccompelling extenuating circumstances\u201d has any vitality at all, that exception applies here. If it does not, as the majority holds, I am at a loss to imagine when it could ever apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">I would adopt the carefully considered recommendation of the three-judge panel and suspend the respondent for one year. Judges Singley and Eldridge authorize me to state that they concur in this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
