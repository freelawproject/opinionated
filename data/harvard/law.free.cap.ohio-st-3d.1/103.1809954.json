Thus, if an employer\u2019s principal business is not building and other construction or demolition work, then that employer is not required to comply with IC-3-11.03(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">The significant factors in evaluating whether an activity constitutes an employer\u2019s \u201cprincipal business\u201d include <em>inter alia: </em>source of income, expenditures and disbursements and actual functions performed by the employer. See, generally, <em>W.R. Co. </em>v. <em>North Carolina Property Tax Comm. </em>(1980), 48 N.C. App. 245, 260, 269 S.E.2d 636. See, also, Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (\u201cprincipal\u201d is defined as \u201cmost important, consequential, or influential\u201d); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5 Ed.) (\u201cprincipal\u201d is defined as \u201c[c]hief; leading; most important or considerable; primary; original\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-11\">Applying these factors and definitions to the facts <em>sub judice, </em>we find, for the reasons that follow, that the Court of Appeals and the commission correctly concluded that building and construction were not the \u201cprincipal business\u201d of the water department.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-12\">Initially, the report of Hearing Officer Robert E. Ward reflects that: (1) the water department\u2019s operation \u201cis primarily to supply water to the county\u201d and (2) construction, including materials, comprises merely 20 to 30 percent of the water department\u2019s budget.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-13\">Futhermore, the report of R. Richard Pfalzgraf, the investigator upon whom the commission specifically relied in making its factual findings, stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b138-14\">\u201cThe investigation revealed that the claimant was employed as a Maintenance Man by the Warren County Department of Water &amp; Sewer * * *. That he sustained the injury of record while working inside of a trench excavation, in the process of repairing a service leak at a water main. <em>That </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number><em>construction was not the principal business of the employer. That the principal business of the Warren County Department of Water &amp; Sewer was the sale and distribution of water to citizens in Warren County, Ohio. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">After a careful review of the entire record, we conclude that the record does contain some evidence to support the commission\u2019s factual findings that: the water department\u2019s principal business is to supply water to the citizens of Warren County and not to engage in building or other construction work. See <em>State, ex rel. Allerton, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St. 2d 396, 397 [23 O.O. 3d 358]; <em>State, ex rel. Dodson, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St. 2d 408, 409-410 [16 O.O. 3d 439]. As such, we refuse to reweigh the evidence. <em>State, ex rel. GF Business Equip., Inc., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St. 2d 446 [20 O.O. 3d 379].</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Accordingly, for all the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b139-8\">Celebrezze, C.J., Sweeney, Locher and Krupansky, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b139-9\">W. Brown, Holmes and C. Brown, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b139-10\">Clifford F. Brown, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AzG\">dissenting. The finding of the Industrial Commission and the decision of this court cause an unjust denial of an additional award of compensation to relator. The determination that the water department\u2019s principal business is supplying water to the citizens of Warren County, not building and construction, ignores the fact that distribution and supply of water necessarily includes the construction, installation, maintenance and repair of water mains, pipelines and other facilities.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">To be within the scope of the Industrial Commission\u2019s specific safety requirements, the employee must be \u201cengaged in building and construction work.\u201d IC-3-01.01. Such work is defined to include \u201cthe excavation, construction, alteration, and repair of- * * * sewers, * * * trenches, * * * pipelines, * * * and all operations pertaining thereto.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-12\">The following evidence supports a determination that the water depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>ment was engaged in building and construction work within the meaning of IC-3-01.01. On a day to day operational basis, the water department installed, maintained and repaired lines by digging trenches, regularly using various types of equipment for such trenches and excavations. On the average of two days per week relator performed work which included digging trenches and installing water lines. All installations involved work in trenches over five feet deep, at which depth the Industrial Commission regulation IC-3-11.03(A) requires bracing and support.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Notwithstanding this evidence, the commission and this court have determined that the principal business of the water department was \u201cto supply water to the citizens of Warren County and not to engage in building or other construction work.\u201d However, supplying water and constructing, maintaining and repairing water mains, pipelines and facilities are inextricably interwoven. Therefore, the water department was \u201cengaged in building and other construction * * * work as * * * [its] principal business\u201d within the meaning of IC-3-01.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">The other view is supported solely by an investigator\u2019s report by one investigator, R. Richard Pfalzgraf, appointed by the commission, which stated that he \u201cwas told\u201d the principal business of the water department was the sale and distribution of water. Such a report is a mere self-serving declaration by an employer that it did not violate a specific safety requirement, unsupported by testimony or exhibits. The decision of the commission that the water department is exempt from these specific safety requirements constitutes an abuse of discretion, since there was no reliable evidence on which it could base the exemption. See <em>State, ex rel. Humble, </em>v. <em>Mark Concepts, Inc. </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St. 2d 77 [14 O.O. 3d 275]. Nevertheless, this court labeled this report \u201csome evidence\u201d to support the commission\u2019s factual findings, and has denied the requested writ. The decision today carries the \u201csome evidence\u201d standard to absurd extremes and emphasizes the mischief its application has caused. Moreover, there is no need to muddy the waters of judicial precedent by resting upon the nebulous \u201csome evidence\u201d standard, a shibboleth which had its first flash, like spontaneous combustion, in <em>State, ex rel. Dodson, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St. 2d 408, 410 [16 O.O. 3d 439]. See my dissent in <em>State, ex rel. Teece, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1981), 68 Ohio St. 2d 165, 170 [22 O.O. 3d 400]. <em>Dodson </em>was without any prior judicial precedent to justify its spawning, or its subsequent spewing, like judicial flotsam and jetsam, into several recent workers\u2019 compensation cases. See, also, dissent in <em>State, ex rel. Allerton, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St. 2d 396, at 399-400 [23 O.O. 3d 358]. Only an alarming tendency towards judicial oscitancy in the workers\u2019 compensation field permits such a rubber stamp standard of review to persist.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">Believing relator to be entitled to an additional award because his injury resulted from the violation of a specific safety requirement, I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b140-8\">W. Brown, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b139-13\"> A review of R.C. Chapter 6103 makes it clear that the primary function of the county water department is the construction, maintenance and repair of water distribution facilites. For example, R.C. 6103.02, in part, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b139-14\">\u201cFor the purpose of preserving and promoting the public health and welfare, and providing fire protection, any board of county commissioners m\u00e1y by resolution acquire, construct, maintain, and operate any public water supply or water work system within its county for any sewer district, * * *. The sanitary engineer, * * * shall assist the board in the performance of its duties under sections 6103.02 to 6103.30 of the Revised Code, and shall be charged with such other duties and services in relation thereto as the board prescribes.* * * No public water supplies or water pipes or mains shall be constructed in any county outside of municipal corporations by any person, firm, or corporation except for the purpose of supplying water to such municipal corporations, until the plans and specifications for the same have been approved by the board.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
