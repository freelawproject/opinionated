If the petition is filed in the municipal court, the registrar shall be represented as provided in section</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">1901.34 of the Revised Code.\u201d Appellant argues that this language requires that he represent the Registrar, because the Hamilton County Municipal Court functions as a county court in this case. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">R.C. 1901.01 provides, in part: \u201cThere is hereby established a municipal court in each of the following municipal corporations: *** Cincinnati ***.\u201d R.C. 1901.02 provides, in part: \u201cThe municipal courts, established by section 1901.01 of the Revised Code, have jurisdiction within the corporate limits of their respective municipal corporations and are courts of record. Each of the courts shall be styled \u2018.........municipal court,\u2019 inserting the name of the municipal corporation, except *** the municipal court established in Cincinnati, which shall be styled and known as the \u2018Hamilton County municipal court,\u2019 ***. The municipal courts also have jurisdiction as follows: *** The Hamilton County municipal court has jurisdiction within Hamilton County.\u201d Under these provisions, the Hamilton County Municipal Court is a <em>municipal court </em>with county-wide jurisdiction. Therefore, R.C. 4511.191(G)(3) requires that we read R.C. 4511.191 together with R.C. 1901.34.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">In <em>State, ex rel. Dollison, </em>v. <em>Reddy </em>(1978), 55 Ohio St. 2d 59 [9 O.O. 3d 67], the majority of this court reversed the Court of Appeals and issued a writ of mandamus ordering the Law Director of the City of Garfield Heights to represent the Registrar. \u201cThe issue is confused by the fact that most of R.C. 1901.34 concerns legal representation in criminal cases, whereas this court has said that proceedings under R.C. 4511.191 are civil in nature. <em>Kettering </em>v. <em>Baker </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St. 2d 351 [71 O.O. 2d 322]. However, the part of R.C. 1901.34 that creates the law director\u2019s duty does not refer to criminal cases at all. Actually it is quite general: \u2018The city director of law shall perform the same duties, as far as they are applicable thereto, as are required of the prosecuting attorney of the county.\u2019<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> One of the duties \u2018required of the prosecuting attorney\u2019 is to represent the registrar in most license-suspension cases under R.C. 4507.40 and 4511.191 when the petition is filed in the county court. But, when the petition is filed in the Municipal Court, the duty is \u2018applicable,\u2019 not to the prosecuting attorney, but to \u2018the city or director of law,\u2019 because R.C. 4507.40 and 4511.191 both state that \u2018[i]f the petition is filed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>the municipal court, the registrar shall be represented as provided in section 1901.34 of the Revised Code.\u2019 \u201d <em>Reddy, supra, </em>at 60. (Footnote and emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Mandamus is an extraordinary writ. \u201cIn order to grant a writ of mandamus, a court must find that the relator has a clear legal right to the relief prayed for, that the respondent is under a legal duty to perform the requested act, and that relator has no plain and adequate remedy at law. <em>(State, ex rel. Harris, </em>v. <em>Rhodes </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St. 2d 41 [8 O.O. 3d 36].)\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Westchester, </em>v. <em>Bacon </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St. 2d 42 [15 O.O. 3d 53], paragraph one of the syllabus. In light of the provisions of the Revised Code which we quoted above and this court\u2019s holding in <em>Reddy, </em>appellant does <em>not </em>have a clear legal right to represent the Registrar.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We recognize that our construction of the statutes may require city law directors to appear in municipal courts in distant counties if the suspended licensee resides elsewhere in Ohio. Nevertheless, the General Assembly clearly intended that licensees have a convenient forum for their suspension appeals. Therefore, it is for the General Assembly, not this court, to reduce whatever burden this may place on city law directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals denying the writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b46-8\">Celebrezze, C.J., W. Brown, Sweeney, Locher, C. Brown and Krupansky, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b46-9\">Holmes, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b45-13\"> This portion of R.C. 1901.34 currently provides: \u201c*** The village solicitor, city director of law, or similar chief legal officer shall perform the same duties, as far as they are applicable thereto, as are required of the prosecuting attorney of the county. ***\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b46-10\"> Likewise, appellant\u2019s two other propositions of law fail. Appellant correctly observes that this court has admitted him to the practice of law. Section 2(B)(lXg), Article IV, Ohio Constitution. Yet, neither this alone nor in conjunction with the Registrar\u2019s request that appellant defend the suspension appeal create a clear legal right to represent a public official if the General Assembly has properly provided otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
