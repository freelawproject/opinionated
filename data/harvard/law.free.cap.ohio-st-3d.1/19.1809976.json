Moreover, it is fundamental that the weight of the evidence and credibility of witnesses are primarily for the trier of the facts. <em>State </em>v. <em>DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St. 2d 230 [39 O.O. 2d 366], paragraph one of the syllabus. This principle is applicable to suppression hearings as well as trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">The trial court held that the appellant failed \u201c*** to establish with sufficient preponderance here that there was any one-on-one confrontation prior to the lineup, ***.\u201d This determination is supported by evidence presented at the hearing. The eyewitness and the officer both denied that such a confrontation occurred. The officer also denied that a picture was taken as claimed by appellant. Further, the record shows that the eyewitness had a brief but unobstructed view of his assailant at the time of the robbery. Therefore, noting that there was conflict in the testimony, applying \u201cthe totality of the circumstances\u201d standard, we do not find error by the trial court in not finding the identification unduly suggestive. Thus, appellant\u2019s first proposition of law is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">The issue presented in appellant\u2019s second proposition of law is whether he was denied a speedy trial when a retrial, following a mistrial because of a hung jury, is scheduled 29 days after the trial date. R.C. 2945.71 requires that an accused who is in jail in lieu of bail on the pending charge be brought to trial within 90 days after arrest. Appellant\u2019s first trial commenced 88 days after his arrest; the retrial began 120 days after arrest. R.C. 2945.72 provides that:</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">\u201cThe time within which an accused must be brought to trial, or, in the case of felony, to preliminary hearing and trial, may be extended only by the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b54-11\"><em>(( </em>* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>\u201c(H) The period of any continuance granted on the accused\u2019s own motion, and the period of any reasonable continuance granted other than upon the accused\u2019s own motion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The trial court correctly held that R.C. 2945.71 is. not applicable to retrials. It is noteworthy that the statute does not include any reference whatever to retrials. The standard to be applied, therefore, is basically reasonableness under federal and state constitutions. Considering the facts of this case, the 29-day continuance was reasonable. Thus, appellant\u2019s second proposition of law is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Finally, concerning appellant\u2019s third proposition of law, the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Kentucky </em>(1981), 450 U.S. 288, is controlling in this case and would require reversal, if proper request for an instruction had been made to the trial court. In <em>Carter, </em>the United States Supreme Court held, at page 305, that a \u201ctrial judge has the constitutional obligation, upon proper request, to minimize the danger that the jury will give evidentiary weight to a defendant\u2019s failure to testify,\u201d and that a defendant has a right, under the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment, to have the judge instruct the jury that defendant\u2019s failure to testify cannot be considered for any purpose <em>(id. </em>at 300). Thus, based on this decision, the trial court has a mandatory constitutional duty, upon proper request, to give such a requested instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Consequently, this court must overrule the determination in <em>State </em>v. <em>Nelson </em>(1973), 36 Ohio St. 2d 79 [65 O.O. 2d 222], paragraph three of the syllabus, wherein it was held that it was discretionary with the trial judge whether to instruct the jury on the defendant\u2019s rights to elect not to testify. Since appellant\u2019s case was pending on appeal at the time of the <em>Carter </em>decision, this court must apply the rule as announced in <em>Carter. Linkletter </em>v. <em>Walker </em>(1965), 381 U.S. 618, 639.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">Nevertheless, <em>Carter </em>requires such an instruction only \u201cupon proper request.\u201d The record shows that appellant did not file a written special jury instruction request at the close of the evidence pursuant to Crim. R. 30. Since such a request must be in writing and made at the close of the evidence or at such earlier time as the court reasonably directs in order to be proper, appellant\u2019s request was not proper. Therefore, appellant was not entitled to the requested special instruction under <em>Carter, </em>concerning the jury\u2019s consideration of his failure to testify. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s third proposition of law is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b55-11\">W.
