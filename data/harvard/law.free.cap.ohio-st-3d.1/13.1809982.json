Specifically, relator\u2019s argument is two-pronged. First, relator argues that R.C. 1721.01 authorizes appropriation only where there are no graves in the area sought to be appropriated. Thus, according to relator, once the existence of such a grave is established, there is no statutory basis for appropriation and respondent\u2019s jurisdiction in the matter is \u201cat an end.\u201d Second, relator maintains that it was error for respondent \u201cto journalize an entry allowing *** [ODOT] to change the location of its proposed highway ***.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">Even were we to assume, <em>arguendo, </em>the validity of relator\u2019s first argument, the critical question remains\u2014what effect is to be given respondent\u2019s order of November 24, 1981, authorizing amendment of the appropriation complaint? If the order is valid, then there will be no graves located within the property sought to be appropriated. Therefore, according to relator\u2019s logic, if there are no graves situated within such property, respondent may properly exercise jurisdiction over the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">At this juncture, the question presented is not one of jurisdiction; rather, the question is whether respondent committed error in permitting amendment of the complaint. This is an issue more properly raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">This court has consistently held that in order for prohibition to lie, three requirements must be satisfied: \u201c***(1) the court or officer against whom it is sought must be about to exercise judicial or quasi-judicial power; (2) the exercise of such power must be unauthorized by law; and (3) it must appear that the refusal of the writ would result in injury for which there is no other adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the law.***\u201d <em>State, ex rel. McKee, </em>v. <em>Cooper </em>(1974), 40 Ohio St. 2d 65 [69 O.O. 2d 396], paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>State, ex rel. Susi, </em>v. <em>Flowers </em>(1975), 43 Ohio St. 2d 11 [72 O.O. 2d 6]; <em>State, ex rel. Bell, </em>v. <em>Blair </em>(1975), 43 Ohio St. 2d 95 [72 O.O. 2d 53]. Accord <em>State, ex. rel. Rhodes, </em>v. <em>Solether </em>(1955), 162 Ohio St. 559 [55 O.O. 440].</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">Moreover, it is patently clear that \u201cprohibition cannot be used as a substitute for appeal.\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Crebs, </em>v. <em>Court of Common Pleas </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St. 2d 51, 52 [67 O.O. 2d 61].</p>\n<p id=\"b48-11\">Under the facts of this case, relator has an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law by way of appeal. Accordingly, the writ of prohibition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-12\">\n<em>Writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b48-13\">Celebrezze, C.J., W. Brown, Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C.
