It is undisputed that on March 31, 1982, the board of elections was divided by a 2-to-2 vote on the issue of the validity of Speck\u2019s declaration of candidacy and petition. At this point, the board, in accordance with R.C. 3501.11, properly referred the matter to the Secretary of State in order that he could cast the tie-breaking vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-13\">Before the Secretary of State cast this deciding vote, however, the board, on April 13, 1982, voted again, and certified Speck\u2019s petition as valid by a 3-0 vote. Since R.C. 3513.05 empowers the board of elections to certify candidates and R.C. 3501.11 authorizes the Secretary of State to become involved in the process only if there is a tie vote, this 3-0 vote of the board certifying Speck\u2019s declaration of candidacy and petition divested the Secretary of State of any role in this cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>For this reason, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals in dismissing the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b311-7\">Celebrezze, C.J., W. Brown, Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, C. Brown and Krupansky, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
