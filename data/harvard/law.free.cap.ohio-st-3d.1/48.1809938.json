No. 82-6 reveals that respondent did withdraw $9,000 from the estate checking account as fees without prior agreement with his client. Such conversion of a client\u2019s funds to the personal use of the attorney is in violation of DR 1-102(A)(4), (5) and (6) and DR 9-102(A)(2). <em>Ohio State Bar Assn. </em>v. <em>Weaver </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St. 2d 97 [70 O.O.2d 175]; <em>Akron Bar Assn. </em>v. <em>Hughes </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St. 2d 369 [75 O.O.2d 446]; <em>Columbus Bar Assn. </em>v. <em>Amos </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St. 2d 256 [16 O.O.3d 287].</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">This court concurs with the findings and conclusions of the board in that respondent violated the foregoing Disciplinary Rules in D.D. No. 82-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">Furthermore, after a careful examination and review of the entire record in D.D. No. 82-7, this court concurs with the finding of the board that respondent deposited funds of his client in a general office banking account and not in an identifiable bank account, and used those funds to meet general personal obligations and obligations of his law office. Accordingly, we find that respondent violated DR 9-102(A)(2) of the Code of Professional Responsibility. <em>Toledo Bar Assn. </em>v. <em>Illman </em>(1969), 18 Ohio St. 2d 122 [47 O.O.2d 280]; <em>Columbus Bar Assn. </em>v. <em>Tuttle </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St. 2d 183 [70 O.O.2d 341]; <em>Ohio State Bar Assn. </em>v. <em>Willard </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St. 2d 3 [4 O.O.3d 34].</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">It is the judgment of this court that for the disciplinary violations in D.D. Nos. 82-6 and 82-7 respondent be suspended indefinitely from the practice of law in this state, and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-11\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b87-12\">Celebrezze, C.J., W.
