Brown, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8d\">Relator was disqualified from acting as judge pursuant to Gov. R. VI(l)(b) which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">\u201cA judge is disqualified from acting as a judge while there is pending an indictment or an information charging him in the United States with a crime punishable as a felony under state or federal law.\u201d .</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">The sole issue presented herein is whether a judge who has been thus disqualified is, nevertheless, entitled to his judicial compensation pending the resolution of such charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">R.C. 2701.11 and 2701.12 set forth the causes and procedures for removal and suspension of judges without pay.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Neither of these statutes provides for removal or suspension of a judge without pay unless and until a full investigation has been conducted by the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline and a hearing has been held before a commission of judges. Only after such notice and hearing may a judge be removed or suspended without pay for those causes specified in R.C. 2701.12. Only after the charges against a judge have been subjected to the rigors of the adversarial process as outlined in R.C. 2701.11 may he be deprived of any of the incidents of his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">In the present case, respondent was neither \u201cremoved\u201d nor \u201csuspended\u201d for any of the causes allowing for such removal or suspension found in R.C. 2701.12. Moreover, respondent was never afforded the procedural safeguards as set forth in R.C. 2701.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">Inasmuch as the disqualification of a judge under Gov. R. VI(l)(b) does not constitute a cause for removal or suspension without pay, such judge is enti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>tied to full compensation pending disposition of the indictment or information which occasioned his disqualification. Accordingly, respondents are ordered to pay relator all amounts heretofore wrongfully withheld during the period of January 1, 1979, to April 3, 1979, and February 7, 1980, to July 21, 1982.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">\n<em>Writ allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b90-6\">Celebrezze, C.J., W.

I reluctantly concur with the majority, and do so only because the statutes and Rules of Judicial Conduct as currently written unfortunately allow this judge, who has not carried out his judicial functions, to be able to unduly profit from his unearned judicial salary. This cause presents a situation which cries out for legislative change in these statutes, or certain additions to the Supreme Court Rules for the Government of the Bar as such relate to the removal or suspension of judges.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b90-9\">Krupansky, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AVl\">dissenting. In my view, relator has no right to receive compensation for work which he has been prohibited from performing by order of this court. I would deny this writ, and for this reason I must respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">The primary focus of R.C. 2701.11 is upon the procedure for retirement, removal and suspension of a judge without pay. This statute, however, does not even mention disqualification due to pending indictment. In order for a judge to be disqualified, therefore, it is not necessary to follow the procedure outlined in R.C. 2701.11. In fact, the procedure set forth in the statute was not followed when relator was twice disqualified by order of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-11\">While R.C. 2701.11 is silent regarding disqualification, this subject is specifically addressed in Gov. R. VI(6). This rule however, is silent concerning compensation for a disqualified judge. Since there is nothing in either the statute or the rule which expressly requires a judge be compensated during a period of disqualification, it would seem reasonable to conclude the disqualified judge should not be paid for work which he has not performed. The propriety of this conclusion becomes clear when one realizes that it is necessary to appoint acting judges to fulfill the judicial duties of the disqualified judge, and that the acting judges must be compensated for their work. The rule thus espoused is an old and simple one: no work, no pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-12\">In sum, either the statutory procedure should be followed entirely, or the rule procedure should be followed entirely. Since the statute does not pertain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>to disqualification due to pending indictment, the rule procedure, which does pertain to disqualification, was followed by this court when relator was disqualified. It would be inconsistent to follow the statutory procedure at this point when the statute addresses only retirement, removal and suspension of a judge. It would, therefore, be consistent to follow the rule which deals with disqualification, but which is silent regarding compensation, and grant no pay for no work.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">For the above reasons, I woiild deny relator\u2019s writ.</p>\n<judges id=\"b91-6\">Locher, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
