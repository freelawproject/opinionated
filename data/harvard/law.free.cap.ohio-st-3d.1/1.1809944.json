Yet, appellant argues that it is entitled to submit an App. R. 9(C) narrative statement instead of a transcript, because App. R. 9(B) further provides: \u201c*** If there be no officially appointed reporter, Rule 9(C) or 9(D) may be utilized. ***\u201d Appellant suggests that an <em>officially appointed </em>reporter must be a <em>professional </em>court reporter in spite of the fact that it is stipulated that the court appointed both Corlett and Beebe. We refuse, however, to construe \u201c*** App. R. 9(B) in a hypertechnical manner not required by the facts of this cause ***.\u201d <em>Farmers Banking Co. </em>v. <em>Hinkle </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St. 2d 374, 377 [75 O.O. 2d 448, 450].</p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">Appellant also bases its request for a writ of mandamus on the fact that Corlett cannot type and has retired to another state. \u201cIn order to grant a writ of mandamus, a court must find that the relator has a clear legal right to the relief prayed for, that the respondent is under a clear legal duty to perform the requested act, and that relator has no plain and adequate remedy at law. <em>(State, ex rel. Harris, </em>v. <em>Rhodes, </em>54 Ohio St. 2d 41 [8 O.O. 3d 36].)\u201d <em>State, ex rel. Westchester, </em>v. <em>Bacon </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St. 2d 42 [15 O.O. 3d 53], paragraph one of the syllabus. Appellant has not requested a transcript, however, and it has not demonstrated that a transcript is unavailable. See App. R. 9(C); cf. <em>Knapp </em>v. <em>Edwards Laboratories </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St. 2d 197 [15 O.O. 3d 218]. Appellant, therefore, does not have a clear legal right to a settlement statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-11\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals, denying the writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-12\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b36-13\">Celebrezze, C.J., W.
