State, </em>Md. , 423 A.2d 558 (1980), has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>very recently (December 17, 1980), considerably altered the application of this provision of our Constitution holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\">\"Implicit in the decisions of this Court limiting the jury\u2019s judicial role to the 'law of the crime\u2019 is a recognition that all other legal issues are for the judge alone to decide. Because of this division of the law-judging function between judge and jury, it is incumbent upon a trial judge to carefully delineate for the jury the following dichotomy: (i) that the jury, under Article 23, is the final arbiter of disputes as to the substantive 'law of the crime,\u2019 as well as the 'legal effect of the evidence,\u2019 and that any comments by the judge concerning these matters are advisory only; and (ii) that, by virtue of this same constitutional provision, all other aspects of law (e.g., the burden of proof, the requirement of unanimity, the validity of a statute) are beyond the jury\u2019s pale, and that the judge\u2019s comments on these matters are binding upon that body. In other words, the jury should not be informed that all of the court\u2019s instructions are merely advisory; rather only that portion of the charge addressed to the former areas of 'law\u2019 may be regarded as non-binding by it, and it is only these aspects of the 'law\u2019 which counsel may dispute in their respective arguments to the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>423 A.2d at 565.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Relying upon this holding, the appellants here, Ralph Dupont Davis and Steven George Thomas, contend that the Criminal Court of Baltimore committed reversible error when it refused a request that the jury be instructed that, even though they were judges of the law, they were bound by the trial court\u2019s instruction that the burden was upon the State to prove their guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. We agree.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>The State first contends that the appellants\u2019 objection was not sufficient to preserve the issue, because it constituted \"a frontal one against the jury\u2019s role under the Maryland Constitution and not a peripheral one asking for instructions of one or more of the limitations upon that role.\u201d <em>Jones v. State, </em>29 Md. App. 182, 204, 348 A.2d 55 (1975), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>279 Md. 1, 367 A.2d 1 (1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>431 U.S. 915 (1977).. We are unable to follow the State\u2019s argument. The basis for the objection was quite clear; it was the failure of the trial judge to instruct the jury that they were bound by the judge\u2019s instruction concerning the burden of proof. Even if the basis for the objection is not explicitly stated, the objection was still sufficient, under the principles set forth in <em>Sergeant Co. v. Pickett, </em>283 Md. 284, 388 A.2d 543 (1978). There the Court, construing Rule 554 d and e, the civil counterpart to the Criminal Rule 757 f,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> said at 288-89:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>\"The reason for Rule 554 d and e, as this Court stated in <em>Fisher v. Balto. Transit Co., </em>184 Md. 399, 402, 41 A.2d 297 (1945), 'is obviously to enable the trial court to correct any inadvertent error or omission in the oral charge, as well as to limit the review on appeal to those errors which are brought to the trial court\u2019s attention.\u2019 In this manner, the trial judge is afforded 'an opportunity to amend or supplement his charge if he deems an amendment necessary.\u2019 <em>State v. Wolleyhan Transport Co., </em>192 Md. 686, 689-90, 65 A.2d 321 (1949). Succinctly put, then, the rule is designed to afford the trial judge and opposing counsel ample opportunity to be informed of the nature and grounds of the exception. Indeed, no special form is required for the objection and no ground need even be stated 'where the record makes clear that all parties and the court understood the reason for the objection.\u2019 <em>Exxon Corp. v. Kelly, </em>281 Md. 689, 694 n.6, 381 A.2d 1146 (1978).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">It is obvious to us that in the instant case all persons involved below clearly understood that the appellants desired an instruction that the jury was bound by the trial court\u2019s instruction concerning burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Neither are we impressed by the state\u2019s argument that the charge complied with the <em>Stevenson </em>requirements even though they were given before <em>Stevenson </em>was decided. The appellants made a specific request as to the burden of proof which was denied. This is a clear violation of the <em>Stevenson </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>language, and we therefore reverse the appellants\u2019 robbery convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">We do not reach the other issues raised by the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">\n<em>Case remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">\n<em>Costs not reallocated pursuant to Maryland Rule 1082f.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b523-7\">. The retroactivity of Stevenson v. State, <em>supra </em>is not in issue here. This case is covered by the principle laid down in McClain v. State, 288 Md. 456, 419 A.2d 369 (1980), <em>in </em>which the Court held that even though one of its decisions was not retroactive, it would apply nonetheless where the point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>was raised below and the appellant simply sought to have the same principle applied to his case, which was pending at the time of the decision. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">\"This case is unlike many cases in which a retroactive application of a new rule has been sought in that it is not a collateral attack on a prior judgment nor is it one on direct review where the point was not raised in the trial court and it is sought to be raised on appellate review. Here, as we have already held, the point was raised below and McClain simply seeks to have applied in his case the same rule which was applied in Johnson\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>288 Md. at 463.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-7\"><em>See also, </em>Lewis v.
