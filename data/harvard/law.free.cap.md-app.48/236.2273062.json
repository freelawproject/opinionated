A petition was subsequently filed in the Maryland District Court alleging appellant to be a delinquent child. That court held an adjudicatory hearing and found the appellant to be a delinquent child. After a disposition hearing the appellant was placed on probation under the supervision of the Juvenile Services Administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">On appeal, Dominic W. presents several questions, and requests that we reverse the judgment of the lower court. We must reverse that judgment because of our affirmative answer to appellant\u2019s first question,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-6\">\"Was a watch taken from appellant during a search by the assistant principal seized without probable cause, in violation of \u00a7 7-307 of the Maryland Code\u2019s Education Article, and improperly admitted into evidence?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">What gave rise to the delinquency petition being filed against appellant may be briefly summarized with additional facts supplied as necessary in our discussion of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Two male students at the high school involved prepared to attend an assigned gym class. They shared a locker in the gym\u2019s locker room to store their regular clothing; the locker was made secure by the use of a combination lock. On the day in question, after changing into their gym clothes, the students placed their regular clothing and personal possessions in the locker, locked the combination lock, and proceeded to the gym class. These students were two of some ninety students taking gym at that time. After completion of the gym class these two students returned to their locker and found the combination lock broken and unlocked. Upon opening the locker door they discovered that a watch belonging to one of them was missing, as well as two five-dollar bills. A report of this theft was made to the school\u2019s assistant principal. One of the students reported that he had seen three individuals walking by the row of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>lockers and looking around. He gave their names to the assistant principal. The assistant principal testified he had been told by one of the student victims that appellant and two others were seen by the victims \"hanging around the lockers\u201d before gym class. After interviewing the other two boys named, who denied involvement, the assistant principal sought out the appellant, took him to an empty classroom, and told him he was suspected of being involved in a theft. The appellant was requested to empty his pockets, which he did, revealing ten one-dollar bills and a pack of cigarettes. The assistant principal then felt appellant\u2019s pockets and, upon reaching into one of them, found a watch. This watch was later identified as being the one that was missing from the locker. Appellant was turned over to the police, who took him to a police station. Appellant was given his \"Miranda\u201d rights, and gave police a statement incriminating another student. Although he admitted being at the locker when it was broken into, he said that the watch was given to him. The next day, this second student gave police a statement wherein he said that appellant forced open the locker and took the watch and money. During the adjudicatory hearing appellant made timely objections to the admission of his statements and the watch, which the court overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The appellant contends that the watch seized from his pants pocket should not have been admitted into evidence. Conceding that the assistant principal had authority under Md. Educ. Code Ann. \u00a7 7-307 to make certain searches, the appellant argues that such searches are authorized only if probable cause exists to believe that the suspect possesses contraband.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>The State argues that the exclusionary rule developed for violations of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution does not apply to this case, and that the appropriate probable cause was present to satisfy the Maryland statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">In our view the exclusionary rule developed for Fourth Amendment violations does apply. This conclusion is reached because \u00a7 7-307 of the Md. Education Article makes patent that the search was governmental action in the context of the Fourth Amendment. That the assistant principal here was an agent of the State would appear to be beyond doubt. Furthermore, the legislature itself required probable cause to exist before the search could be made. While Maryland has no exclusionary rule by statute, case law, or rule of evidence for search and seizure purposes, it does have the exclusionary rule for Fourth Amendment violations imposed on it under the constitutional compulsion of <em>Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 81 S. Ct. 1684 (1961). <em>See Belton v. State, </em>228 Md. 17, 178 A.2d 409 (1962). By our interpretation of \u00a7 7-307 and the application of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule, the items seized here and the subsequent statements should not have been admitted. <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 488, 83 S. Ct. 407 (1963); <em>Everhart v. State, </em>274 Md. 459, 337 A.2d 100 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">In reaching this conclusion, we considered whether there was probable cause for the assistant principal to make the search. In doing so we made an independent examination of the evidence in the record. <em>Ponds v. State, </em>25 Md. App. 162, 335 A.2d 162 (1975). Prior to the search of appellant the information had by the assistant principal consisted of (1) a student\u2019s locker had been broken into and two five-dollar bills and a watch were stolen; (2) the appellant and two other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>boys were observed \"hanging around\u201d the <em>lockers; </em>(3) these three were apparently among ninety students taking the gym class; (4) in talking to the other boys who had been observed with appellant the assistant principal was advised by one of them that he was not involved and was not aware of anyone else who was involved; (5) that upon confronting appellant he asked him to empty his pockets, which was done, revealing a new pack of cigarettes and ten one-dollar bills. At this point of the search of appellant\u2019s pockets, the watch was discovered. In overruling appellant\u2019s objection to the watch\u2019s admission, the trial judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-5\">\"... I\u2019m going to rule that he had probable cause, based on the evidence that\u2019s been ... he had the complaint made to him and the names of three people were ... or at least the identity of three people were made known. I think that\u2019s sufficient.. ..\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">We hold that the trial judge was wrong. In <em>Edwards v. State, </em>196 Md. 233, 237, 76 A.2d 132, 134 (1950), the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-7\">\"The Supreme Court of the United States in the case of <em>Brinegar v. U. S., </em>338 U.S. 160, at pages 175-176, 69 S. Ct. 1302, at pages 1310, 1311, 93 L.Ed. 1879, said that the substance of all the definitions of probable cause is a reasonable ground for belief of guilt, and that probable cause exists where the facts and circumstances within the officers\u2019 knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information are sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that an offense has been or is being committed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">In this case, the assistant principal clearly had insufficient information to lead a reasonably cautious person to believe that appellant committed the theft.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>The unreasonable nature of the subject search is shown by the failure of the information provided to the assistant principal to place the appellant in a more suspicious light than any other gym student on the day of the incident. The information found in the record does nothing more than create a mere suspicion and thus does not constitute probable cause. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>State, </em>8 Md. App. 187, 191, 259 A.2d 97 (1969). Therefore, the search and seizure were impermissible, and the watch inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Appellant\u2019s additional questions concern the exclusion of his statements, and the statements of a nontestifying codefendant, made in response to the search. The admission into evidence of the appellant\u2019s statements was premised on the search\u2019s validity. Our finding that the search was invalid eliminates this premise for admission of the statements. Likewise, absent valid admission of the appellant\u2019s statements, the trial court lacked the proper predicate for admitting the statements of the nontestifying codefendant. Thus there was nothing with which the codefendant\u2019s statement could \"interlock\u201d and be admitted under the exception to <em>Parker v. Randolph, </em>442 U.S. 62, 99 S. Ct. 2132 (1979), to the rule against admissions set forth in <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S. Ct. 1620 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">\n<em>Order reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">\n<em>Costs are not reallocated as part of the judgment of this court pursuant to Maryland Rule 1082 f.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b286-6\">.
