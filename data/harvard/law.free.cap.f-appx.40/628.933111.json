The complaint asserts three claims against O\u2019Dell\u2019s former employer Trans World: (1) sexual harassment, in violation of both Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>and the New York State Human Rights Law (\u201cHRL\u201d), Exec. Law \u00a7 296 <em>et seq.; </em>(2) unlawful retaliation, including constructive discharge, in violation of both Title VII and the HRL; and (3) breach of contract for failure to pay a year-end bonus.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">As to the claims of sexual harassment and unlawful retaliation, we affirm for substantially the reasons stated in Judge Scheindlin\u2019s order. <em>O\u2019Dell v. Trans World Entm\u2019t Co., </em>153 F.Supp.2d 378 (S.D.N.Y. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">As to O\u2019Dell\u2019s claim of breach of contract, we need not decide whether the year-end bonus under Trans World\u2019s Bonus Program constitutes wages under New York Labor Law \u00a7 190. <em>See Reilly v. Natwest Mkts. Group, Inc., </em>181 F.3d 253, 264-65 (2d Cir.1999) (indicating that some types of incentive pay may constitute wages under New York law). The undisputed evidence indicates that O\u2019Dell failed to qualify for a year-end bonus because the 1998 operating profit for the store she managed was below the 1998 targeted operating profit for that store.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-13\">The judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
