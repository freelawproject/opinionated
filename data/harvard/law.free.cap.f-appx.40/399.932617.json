Jury Instruction No. 12, which defined the elements of an offense under \u00a7 841(d)(2), contained the language \u201cmethamphetamine or some other prohibited drug\u201d in its description of the reasonable cause requirement. Defendant did not object to this language before the jury retired to deliberate, and thus we review his challenge for plain error. <em>United States v. Elias, </em>269 F.3d 1003, 1017-18 (9th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-14\">Under \u00a7 841, the government was not required to prove that Defendant knew or had reasonable cause to believe that the Mini Thins that he sold, which contained listed chemicals, ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, would be used to manufacture methamphetamine. Rather, the government only had to prove that Defendant knew that the Mini Thins would be used to manufacture some controlled substance. <em>See Quintero v. United States, </em>33 F.3d 1133, 1136 (9th Cir.1994) (\u201cThis court has held that a defendant charged under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 need not know the exact nature of the substance with which he was dealing. Instead, a defendant can be convicted under \u00a7 841 if he believes that he possessed some controlled substance.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); <em>United States v. Ramirez-Ramirez, </em>875 F.2d 772, 774 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Because the district court did not commit plain error by including \u201cmethamphetamine or some other prohibited drug\u201d in Instruction No. 12, it did not abuse its discretion by incorporating this language in Instruction No. 14. <em>United States v. Solomon, </em>825 F.2d 1292, 1295 (9th Cir. 1987) (stating that we review a district court\u2019s clarification of jury instructions for an abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Defendant next argues that the district court should have conducted an evidentiary hearing after a juror told defense counsel to \u201cgo back and tell Mr. Sneef that he can\u2019t come to this country and sell products like that.\u201d In the alternative, Defendant argues that the district court should have released juror information to enable defense counsel to conduct interviews regarding the statement. The district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to release juror information or by not conducting an evidentiary hearing after being informed about the juror\u2019s comment. It was reasonable for the district court to conclude that the juror\u2019s comment was not a racially or ethnically biased statement but rather a repudiation of Defendant\u2019s defense. <em>See United States v. Hanley, </em>190 F.3d 1017,1031 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b418-11\">.
