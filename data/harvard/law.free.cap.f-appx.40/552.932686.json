For the reasons that follow, we affirm. Subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-15\">At the time of removal to federal court, Schaffer\u2019s complaint had alleged a violation of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (\u201cCOBRA\u201d), codified at 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1161 et <em>seq. </em>Because Schaffer\u2019s complaint presented a federal question on its face, the removal of both her federal and state law claims was proper. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 <em>1331, </em>1441(a) <em>&amp; </em>(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-16\">Schaffer\u2019s subsequent amendment of her complaint to eliminate the federal question did not deprive the district court of jurisdiction over Schaffer\u2019s state law claims. <em>See Sparta Surgical Corp. v. Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Secs. Dealers, Inc., </em>159 F.3d 1209, 1213 (9th Cir.1998) (providing that \u201ca plaintiff may not compel remand by amending a complaint to eliminate the federal question upon which removal was based\u201d). Accordingly, the district court had subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-17\">Summary judgment in favor of the defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-18\">A. <em>Schaffer\u2019s second cause of action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b572-19\">Schaffer\u2019s second cause of action alleges gender discrimination on the part of Verizon and Schueller in violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (\u201cFEHA\u201d) (Cal. Gov.Code \u00a7 12900 <em>et seq.). </em>Schaffer alleges that her employer discriminated against her by denying her certain training opportunities; berating her for failing to follow work-related procedure; providing her with a less desirable cubicle than her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>male counterparts; denying her Internet access; denying her access to a company vehicle; and paying her less than her male counterparts.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Schaffer\u2019s complaints about her cubicle, lack of Internet access, lack of access to a company vehicle, and denial of training fail because the conduct complained of does not constitute adverse employment action. <em>See Godwin v. Hunt Wesson, Inc., </em>150 F.3d 1217, 1220 (9th Cir.1998) (observing that in order to make prima facie claim for gender discrimination under FEHA, plaintiff must show, <em>inter alia, </em>that employer subjected plaintiff to an adverse employment action); <em>Soldinger v. Northwest Airlines Inc., </em>51 Cal.App.4th 345, 58 Cal.Rptr.2d 747, 760 (Cal.Ct.App.1996). Schaffer neither alleges facts nor adduces evidence showing how this conduct had any material, let alone a substantial and detrimental, effect upon her employment. <em>See Thomas v. Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>77 Cal.App.4th 507, 91 Cal.Rptr.2d 770, 773 (Cal.Ct.App.2000) (holding that, in order to state cause of action for discrimination under FEHA, plaintiff must allege conduct amounting to \u201cadverse employment action\u201d by alleging facts that evidence \u201cboth a substantial and detrimental effect\u201d upon plaintiffs employment).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Similarly, work-related <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>reprimands directed to employees by management do not amount to adverse employment action. <em>See Khachikian v. Dewy Ins. of Tech., </em>No. 01CV05935, 2002 WL 84149, at *8 (C.D.Cal. Jan.14, 2002)</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Schaffer has made out a prima facie case, however, with respect to her pay discrimination claim. <em>See Godwin, </em>150 F.3d at 1220. Schaffer alleged that two male employees, her husband, and a Mr. Weiss, both of whom were hired to perform the same job as Schaffer, were offered salaries of $50,000 per year whereas Schaffer was offered only $45,000 per year.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">If the plaintiff makes a prima facie showing, then the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a nondiscriminatory reason for the allegedly discriminatory conduct. <em>Godwin, </em>150 F.3d at 1220. Here, Verizon met this burden by establishing that it sets a \u201csalary range\u201d for each open position. In deciding where in the salary range to place a new employee, Verizon takes into account the new hire\u2019s background and experience as well as the prior salary. Verizon established that, at the time of her hire, appellant was earning $30,000 per year. By contrast, her husband had been earning $38,000 per year, and Mr. Weiss was earning $60,000 per year. With respect to background and experience, Verizon also proved that appellant had less relevant technical experience than the two males. Most significantly, Schaffer lacked experience with \u201cBanyan Vines\u201d \u2014 a sophisticated software system used by Verizon to network computers.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The burden then fell on Schaffer to show that Verizon\u2019s reasons were merely a pretext for discrimination. Because Schaf-fer\u2019s evidence of pretext is entirely circumstantial, Schaffer must produce both \u201csubstantial\u201d and \u201cspecific\u201d evidence of pretext. <em>See Godwin, </em>150 F.3d at 1221-22 (holding that plaintiff may show pretext by either (1) offering \u201cvery little\u201d direct evidence of discriminatory motive, or (2) offering \u201cspecific\u201d and \u201csubstantial\u201d circumstantial evidence tending to show that the employer\u2019s proffered motives were not the employer\u2019s actual motives).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">Schaffer relies almost exclusively on her complaint and on her own declaration (which essentially amounts to a restatement of her complaint) as evidence of pretext. This type of opinion evidence is not sufficient to defeat the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. <em>See McGlinchy v. Shell Chem. Co., </em>845 F.2d 802, 809 (9th Cir.1988) (\u201cThe declarations appellants submitted when seeking reconsideration of summary judgment merely restated the pleadings ... Federal Rule 56(e) does not allow a party to oppose summary judgment on the pleadings themselves.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">Schaffer does, however, set forth some specific evidence in support of her pay discrimination claim. Schaffer points to, <em>inter alia, </em>a Verizon job description and the declaration of her husband, both of which she claims demonstrate that Banyan experience was not really a requirement of the job for which she was hired.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">Nonetheless Schaffer\u2019s proffered evidence is insufficient to show pretext on the part of Verizon. First, Schaffer\u2019s characterization of the evidence is misleading. For example, although Schaffer correctly observes that the Verizon job description does not mention Banyan experience as a job requirement, she fails to observe that the job description explicitly states: \u201cThis description provides a brief outline of the position responsibilities and is not intended to be all inclusive of all aspects of the position.\u201d Even if we were to find that Schaffer\u2019s evidence supported her position, however, we would nevertheless reject her challenge because the circumstantial evidence adduced by Schaffer, though specific, is not substantial enough to demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>strate pretext. <em>See Godwin, </em>150 F.3d at 1221-22. Accordingly, we affirm the summary judgment in favor of Verizon on Schaffer\u2019s gender discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Summary judgment in favor of defendant Sehueller on the gender discrimination claim was also free from error because, under <em>Reno v. Baird, </em>18 Cal.4th 640, 76 Cal.Rptr.2d 499, 957 P.2d 1333, 1347 (Cal.1998), supervisors may not be sued individually under FEHA for alleged discriminatory acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">\n<em>B. Schaffer\u2019s third cause of action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Schaffer\u2019s third cause of action alleges pregnancy discrimination by Verizon. Schaffer contends that she was not provided \u201cadequate accomodation for her pregnancy in that Defendants continued to expect Plaintiff, as a condition of employment, to move 60 lb. bins ... and Defendants threatened] Plaintiff with adverse employment impacts if she continued in not moving the heavy bins.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">Schaffer fails to point to any evidence tending to show that her employer discriminated against her, let alone that her employer discriminated against her on the basis of her pregnancy. To the contrary, the evidence strongly suggests that Schaffer\u2019s employer made concessions to Schaffer on account of her pregnancy. For example, Schaffer testified in her deposition that when she told her supervisor that she was pregnant and did not want to lift computer servers, the supervisor agreed that Schaffer did not need to do any lifting. The district court did not err in granting Verizon summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">C. <em>Schaffer\u2019s fifth and sixth causes of action</em></p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">Schaffer\u2019s fifth and sixth causes of action allege wrongful constructive termination in violation of public policy and tortious wrongful termination in violation of public policy. These claims fail for two reasons. First, Schaffer fails to point to any evidence tending to show that the defendants violated public policy. <em>See Lagatree v. Luce, Forward, Hamilton &amp; Scripps LLP, </em>74 Cal.App.4th 1105, 88 Cal. Rptr.2d 664, 669 (Cal.Ct.App.1999). Second, the working conditions alleged by Schaffer were not so extreme as to have compelled a reasonable employee to resign. <em>See Cloud v. Casey, </em>76 Cal.App.4th 895, 90 Cal.Rptr.2d 757, 761 (Cal.Ct.App. 1999). The summary judgment in favor of defendants on these claims is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-12\">\n<em>D. Schaffer\u2019s eighth, ninth and tenth causes of action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b575-13\">Schaffer\u2019s eighth, ninth, and tenth causes of action allege negligent infliction of emotional distress, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligence. The infliction of emotional distress claims fail because, under California law, claims for negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress made within the context of the employment relationship are within the exclusive remedy provisions of the California Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See Cole v. Fair Oaks Fire Protection Dish, </em>43 Cal.3d 148, 233 Cal.Rptr. 308, 729 P.2d 743, 750 (Cal.1987) (\u201c[W]hen the misconduct attributed to the employer is actions which are a normal part of the employment relationship, such as demotions, pro-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>motions, criticism of work practices, and frictions in negotiations as to grievances, an employee suffering emotional distress causing disability may not avoid the exclusive remedy provisions of the Labor Code by characterizing the employer\u2019s decisions as manifestly unfair, outrageous, harassment, or intended to cause emotional disturbance resulting in disability.\u201d); <em>Haynal v. Target Stores, </em>No. 96-1599-K(RBB), 1996 WL 806706, at *6 (S.D.Cal. Dec.9, 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Similarly, Schaffer\u2019s negligence claim fails because claims for negligence are within the exclusive remedy provisions of the California Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. <em>See Coit Drapery Cleaners v. Sequoia Ins. Co., </em>14 Cal.App.4th 1595, 18 Cal.Rptr.2d 692, 699 (Cal.Ct.App.1993); <em>see also Hay-nal, </em>1996 WL 806706, at *6 (holding that employee\u2019s negligence claims brought against employer, arising from conduct occurring in course of employment, were barred by workers\u2019 compensation laws).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Additionally, a necessary element of a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress is outrageous conduct by the defendant. Schaffer fails to allege outrageous conduct by the defendants. <em>See Janken v. GM Hughes Elecs., </em>46 Cal. App.4th 55, 53 Cal.Rptr.2d 741, 756 (Cal. Ct.App.1996); <em>Ankeny v. Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co., 88 </em>Cal.App.3d 531, 151 Cal.Rptr. 828, 831 (Cal.Ct.App.1979). We affirm the summary judgment in favor of defendants on these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">\n<em>(5) Schaffer\u2019s eleventh cause of action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Schaffer\u2019s eleventh cause of action charges Verizon with failure to provide a safe work environment in violation of California Labor Code section 6400-03. This claim fails because, under California law, a cause of action for failure to provide a safe work environment falls within the exclusivity provisions of the California Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. <em>See Gunnell v. Metrocolor Labs., Inc., </em>92 Cal.App.4th 710, 112 Cal.Rptr.2d 195, 197 (Cal.Ct.App.2001) (observing that California Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provides the exclusive remedy for injuries caused by employer\u2019s concealment of unsafe working conditions and violation of safety regulations).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b572-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b572-12\">. At the time of Schaffer\u2019s employment, \"Verizon Data\u201d was known as \"GTE Data.\u201d \"GTE Data\u201d changed its name to \"Verizon Data\u201d following the June 2000 merger of GTE with Bell Atlantic.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b572-13\">. Schaffer appeals the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in favor of defendants with respect to her second, third, fifth, sixth, eighth, ninth, tenth and eleventh causes of action. In her opposition to the defendants' motion for summary judgment, Schaffer abandoned: (1) her first cause of action for violation of the Unruh Act; (2) her fourth cause of action for sexual harassment; and (3) her seventh cause of action for constructive termination. Accordingly, we do not address these three causes of action on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b573-6\">. According to the dissent, in <em>Ray v. Henderson, </em>217 F.3d 1234 (9th Cir.2000), a Ninth Circuit case addressing what constitutes \"adverse employment action\u201d under Title VII (i.e., under federal law), this court \"overruled\u201d <em>Thomas v. Department of Corrections, </em>77 Cal.App.4th 507, 91 Cal.Rptr.2d 770 (Cal.Ct.App.2000), a California state appellate court decision addressing what constitutes \"adverse employment action\u201d under FEHA (i.e., under California law). <em>Ray </em>did not overrule <em>Thomas, </em>and <em>Thomas </em>remains good law in California. <em>See, e.g., Akers v. County of San Diego, </em>95 Cal.App.4th 1441, 116 Cal.Rptr.2d 602, 612 (Cal.Ct.App.2002) (agreeing with <em>Thomas </em>court that \"to he actionable, the [employer\u2019s conduct] must result in a substantial adverse change in the terms and conditions of the plaintiff\u2019s employment\u201d and concluding that an employer's conduct \"constitutes actionable retaliation only if it had a substantial and material adverse effect on the terms and conditions of the plaintiff's employment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Further, when interpreting a California statute like FEHA in the absence of a federal question, this court is bound by decisions of the California Supreme Court which interpret FEHA, not by decisions of federal courts which interpret Title VII. <em>See Vestar Dev. II, LLC v. Gen. Dynamics Corp., </em>249 F.3d 958, 960 (9th Cir.2001) (\"When interpreting state law, federal courts are bound by decisions of the state\u2019s highest court.\u201d) (quoting <em>Lewis v. Tel. Employees Credit Union, </em>87 F.3d 1537, 1545 (9th Cir. 1996)); <em>Strother v. S. Cal. Per-manente Med. Group, </em>79 F.3d 859, 865 (9th Cir. 1996) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">Where, as here, the California Supreme Court has not yet addressed the particular issue of statutory interpretation with which we are confronted, \"a federal court must predict how the highest state court would decide the issue using intermediate appellate court decisions, decisions from other jurisdictions, statutes, treatises, and restatements as guidance.\u201d <em>Strother, </em>79 F.3d at 865. In making our \"prediction,\u201d however, not all of these various legal authorities carry the same weight. Specifically, \"[i]n the absence of convincing evidence that the state supreme court would decide differently, a federal court <em>is obligated to follow the decisions of the state\u2019s intermediate courts.\" Easyriders Freedom F.I.G.H.T. v. Hannigan, 92 </em>F.3d 1486, 1494 n. 4 (9th Cir.1996) (citation and quotations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">Here, there is no convincing evidence that, in interpreting FEHA, the California Supreme Court would construe the phrase \"adverse employment action\u201d differently from the way in which California's intermediate appellate courts have construed that phrase. Nor does the mere fact that California state courts have, of their own volition, looked to federal court decisions interpreting Title VII to assist them in interpreting FEHA, <em>see, e.g., Reno v. Baird, </em>18 Cal.4th 640, 76 Cal.Rptr.2d 499, 957 P.2d 1333, 1337 (Cal. 1998), somehow provide us with the power to substitute our own interpretation of a <em>federal statute </em>for an intermediate state appellate court's interpretation of an analogous <em>state statute. </em>Accordingly, we follow our own precedent, and decline to accept the dissent\u2019s1- invitation to rewrite California law in our own image.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b575-9\">. The dissent\u2019s discussion of the law on this point is simply irrelevant. As discussed above, Schaffer\u2019s claims for wrongful termination in violation of public policy are insufficient to withstand defendants\u2019 motion for summaiy judgment. Accordingly, although a plaintiff with a tort cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of public policy can recover emotional distress damages as a component of compensatory damages, Schaffer is unable to do so because she lacks a meritorious wrongful termination claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b576-10\">PREGERSON, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AN9\">Dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-11\">I dissent from the majority\u2019s affirmation of the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Verizon on Schaffer\u2019s second cause of action for gender discrimination. I do so because the majority incorrectly applies the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-12\">First, the majority incorrectly relies on <em>Thomas v. Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>77 Cal. App.4th 507, 91 Cal.Rptr .2d 770, 772-73 (Ct.App.2000), to reject Schaffer\u2019s gender discrimination claim because \u201cSchaffer neither alleges facts nor adduces evidence showing how [Verizon\u2019s] conduct had any <em>material, let alone substantial and detrimental, effect upon her employment.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The <em>Thomas </em>court, finding no California or Ninth Circuit authority, relied exclusively \u2014 and without comment or reasoning of its own \u2014 on out-of-circuit authority for the proposition that employer conduct must \u201cbe both detrimental and substantial\u201d and \u201cresult in a material change in the terms of [the employee\u2019s] employment\u201d in order to qualify as an adverse employment action. 91 Cal. Rptr.2d at 772-73 (noting that \u201cmost circuits\u201d required this). But shortly after <em>Thomas </em>was decided, we held that \u201c[w]hile some [employment] actions that we consider to be adverse ... do \u2018materially affect the terms and conditions of employment,\u2019 others ... do not.\u201d <em>Ray v. Henderson, </em>217 F.3d 1234, 1242 (9th Cir.2000). I believe that had the <em>Thomas </em>Court had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>benefit of our <em>Ray </em>opinion, it would have followed <em>Ray </em>rather than out-of-circuit authority. I further believe that were the California Supreme Court to consider the matter, it would follow <em>Ray </em>rather than the unreasoned adoption of out-of-circuit authority in <em>Thomas. </em>These beliefs are not undermined by <em>Akers v. County of San Diego, </em>95 Cal.App.4th 1441, 116 Cal. Rptr.2d 602 (Ct.App.2002), which relied on <em>Thomas </em>after <em>Ray. </em>The <em>Akers </em>court cited to <em>Ray, </em>but only \u201cgenerally\u201d and in connection with the proposition that \u201ca plethora of federal courts have considered the issue [of the meaning of an adverse employment action] and have reached differing conclusions.\u201d <em>Akers, </em>116 Cal.Rptr.2d at 611. The <em>Akers </em>court did not even mention, let alone discuss, our holding in <em>Ray </em>that an adverse employment action does not have to \u201cmaterially affect the terms and conditions of employment.\u201d <em>Ray, </em>217 F.3d at 1242. This holding, therefore, remains persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Second, I would conclude that Schaffer\u2019s circumstantial evidence is sufficiently specific and substantial to rebut Verizon\u2019s non-discriminatory reasons, as required by <em>Godwin v. Hunt Wesson, Inc., </em>150 F.3d 1217, 1222 (9th Cir.1998). When viewed in the aggregate and in the light most favorable to her, Schaffer\u2019s evidence constitutes specific and substantial evidence that Verizon\u2019s decision to pay Schaffer $5,000 less than her male counterparts was motivated by discriminatory animus, rather than by the non-discriminatory reasons offered by Verizon. <em>See Bergene v. Salt River Project Agric. Improvement and Power Dist., </em>272 F.3d 1136, 1143 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Schaffer\u2019s husband earned <em>$38,000 </em>at the time of hire and Mr. Weiss earned <em>$60,000, </em>yet both were offered the <em>same salary, </em>$50,000, and Schaffer was offered only $45,000. Schaffer\u2019s husband had <em>several years </em>Banyan experience and Mr. Weiss had at most <em>several months, </em>yet both were offered the <em>same salary, </em>$50,000, and Schaffer was offered only $45,000. A reasonable jury could conclude on the basis of this specific and substantial evidence that the only thing that Schaffer\u2019s husband and Mr. Weiss had in common and that set them apart from Schaffer was that they were male and that she was female. A reasonable jury could further conclude on the basis of this specific and substantial evidence that it was this gender difference, rather than the non-discriminatory reasons offered by Verizon, that motivated the pay differential. The District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Verizon on Schaffer\u2019s second cause of action for gender discrimination should therefore be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">Finally, the majority\u2019s statement in connection with Schaffer\u2019s ninth cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress that \u201cunder California law, claims for negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress made within the context of the employment relationship are within the exclusive remedy provisions of the California Workers\u2019 Compensation Act\u201d misstates California law. Rather, under California law, \u201ca plaintiff <em>can </em>recover for infliction of emotional distress [within the context of the employment relationship] if he or she has a tort cause of action for wrongful termination in violation of public policy ... because then, emotional distress damages are simply a component of compensatory damages.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Gemini Moving Specialists, </em>63 Cal.App.4th 563, 74 Cal.Rptr.2d 29, 38 (Ct.App.1998) (citing <em>Gantt v.
