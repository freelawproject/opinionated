We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-24\">Gurrola-Olivas was a driver for a Tijuana, Mexico trucking company. On April 3, 2001, Gurrola-Olivas left Tijuana with a shipment of television sets bound for the United States. At the United States border a drug detecting dog alerted to his truck. Customs inspector found 15,359 pounds of marijuana in boxes with an estimated street value of $12,000,000. Evidence indicated this was the largest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>amount of marijuana ever seized at a land port.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">We review the district court\u2019s factual finding that Gurrola-Olivas\u2019s role was not minor for clear error. <em>United States v. Hursh, </em>217 F.3d 761, 770 (9th Cir.2000). \u201cThe fact that a defendant acted as a drug courier does not necessarily mean his role was minimal or minor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and alterations omitted). We affirmed the denial of a decrease in sentence for minor role when the defendant \u201cwas the driver and sole occupant of a vehicle in which a substantial amount of marijuana was hidden, and the evidence proved that [he] knew the drugs were in the gas tank.\u201d <em>Id.; see United States v. Davis, </em>36 F.3d 1424, 1437 (9th Cir.1994) (where defendant was a courier who knew he was carrying drugs and was prepared to accept money, not a minor participant); <em>United States v. Lui, </em>941 F.2d 844, 849 (9th Cir.1991) (defendant may be courier but not minor participant, and possession of a \u201csubstantial amount\u201d of narcotics also ground for refusing reduction).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">The district court did not clearly err in finding that Gurrola-Olivas had accepted money to transport a huge amount of marijuana into the United States. Gurrola-Olivas apparently detoured from his trip to the border which normally would have taken about 15 minutes, as he did not arrive until 2 hours after his departure from the television factory. Gurrola-Olivas points to no evidence in the record regarding the roles of other participants in the scheme, and he had \u201cthe burden of proving that he is entitled to a downward adjustment based on his role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>36 F.3d at 1436 (citation omitted). He has not carried his burden of proving that he was a minor participant when compared to others in the scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b609-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
