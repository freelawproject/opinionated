We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we dismiss in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-21\">Vazquez-Dehonor first contends the district court erred by declining his request for a downward departure based on aberrant behavior. Because the record demonstrates the district court exercised its discretion by expressly denying Vazquez-Dehonor\u2019s request for a downward departure, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s decision. <em>See United States v. Berger, </em>103 F.3d 67, 70 (9th Cir. 1996). Accordingly, we dismiss this portion of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-22\">Vazquez-Dehonor\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 960 under <em>Ap-prendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Mendoza-Paz, </em>286 F.3d 1104, 1110 (9th Cir.2002). His contention that the indictment should be dismissed because it did not allege mens rea as to drug type and quantity is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Carranza, </em>289 F.3d 634, 644 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-23\">DISMISSED in part; AFFIRMED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b526-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
