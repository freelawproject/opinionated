R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b385-26\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-27\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-28\">A. <em>The Scope of Defense Counsel\u2019s Closing Argument</em></p>\n<p id=\"b385-29\">\u201cThe trial court has broad discretion in controlling closing arguments, and, in the absence of an alleged violation of specific constitutional rights, we will apply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>an abuse of discretion standard of review.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We find no such abuse here. The fact that counsel\u2019s statement regarding the \u201cclear and convincing\u201d standard of proof appears to have been legally accurate does not mean it had no potential to confuse or distract the jury, particularly where, as here, that is not the standard the jury was ultimately asked to apply. The propriety of this type of argument in any particular case is an issue the district courts are uniquely well positioned to decide and, thus, that we are particularly reluctant to second-guess.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">B. <em>Reasonable Doubt Instruction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">In <em>United States v. </em>Velasquez,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we held that \u201cuse of the \u2018firmly convinced\u2019 language [does] not indicate to the jury that the prosecutor ha[s] a lesser burden than that implied by the use of the term \u2018reasonable doubt\u2019 standing alone\u201d and that, therefore, it is not reversible error for the court to give that instruction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Several other circuits have come to the same conclusion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although we share the First Circuit\u2019s preference for the \u201chesitate to act\u201d formulation,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6we find nothing in its opinion in <em>United States v. </em>Woodward<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to persuade us that en banc reconsideration of <em>Velasquez </em>is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">C. <em>Apprendi</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-13\">After being instructed that the Government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Garcia-Fregoso \u201cintentionally brought cocaine into the United States\u201d and that he \u201cknew that it was cocaine or some other prohibited drug\u201d and that he \u201cknowingly possessed cocaine ... with the intent to deliver it to another person,\u201d the jury found him guilty. Based solely on the facts the jury found, GarciaFregoso could have been sentenced to up to 240 months in prison, or twenty years, under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). His ninety-four-month sentence is well below this statutory maximum. Thus, there was no violation under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As the Supreme Court held in <em>United States v. </em>Raines,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cone to whom application of a statute is constitutional will not be heard to attack the statute on the ground that impliedly it might also be taken as applying to other persons or other situations in which its application might be unconstitutional.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In addition, Garcia\u2019s facial constitutional challenge to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 was foreclosed by <em>United States v. Buckland.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-14\">The foregoing discussion also disposes of Garcia\u2019s challenge to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Any error the district court may have made in instructing the jury under that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>statute is harmless because Garcia\u2019s entire sentence was fully valid under \u00a7 841. Similarly, any <em>Apprendi </em>issues or other constitutional challenges that Garcia raises in regard to \u00a7 960 cannot change his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b385-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b386-6\">. <em>United States v.
