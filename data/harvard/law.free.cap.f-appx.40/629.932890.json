Specifically, the plaintiff brought this action under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 <em>et seq., </em>and under the New York State Human Rights Law, N.Y. Exec. Law \u00a7 296(3-a). The plaintiff also alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>pendent state law claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">On appeal, plaintiff argues that the District Court erred in holding that he had not produced sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable jury to conclude that he was discriminated against because of his age. Elliott further contends that the District Court erred in denying his motion for reconsideration because the District Court overlooked relevant legal authority and facts and because Elliott presented new evidence in the form of Elliott\u2019s supplemental affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-12\">For substantially the reasons stated in Judge Buchwalds\u2019s comprehensive Opinion and Order of April 25, 2001 and Memorandum and Order of August 20, 2001, the judgment and order of the District Court are hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
