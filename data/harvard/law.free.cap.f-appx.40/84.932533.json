This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-23\">On January 27, 1989, Special Agents of the F.B.I. entered a motel room where a suspected drug deal was taking place. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Hodges was in the room selling cocaine. Hodges fought with the Special Agents, escaped the grip of an agent, fled to a bathroom, closed the door, and fired five shots through the door. The Special Agents narrowly escaped injury or death. In fact, one agent was shot in the shoe. The Special Agents returned fire; two bullets struck Hodges.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Hodges pleaded guilty to conspiring to distribute cocaine, using a firearm during and in relation to a drug crime, and assaulting federal agents. The district court sentenced Hodges to an aggregate 270-month term of imprisonment. This court affirmed Hodges\u2019s conviction and sentence. <em>United States v. Hodges, </em>Nos. 89-3602/3723, 1990 WL 38160 (6th Cir. Apr.5, 1990). In 1996, the district court reduced Hodges\u2019s sentence to 192 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">In his motion to modify his term of imprisonment, Hodges contended that his sentence must be reduced pursuant to USSG App. C. Amendment 599, November 1, 2000. He claimed that the district court improperly increased his offense level based on a weapon enhancement when he had already been penalized for use of a firearm by virtue of his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) conviction. The district court denied that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">In his timely appeal, Hodges reasserts that he is a victim of \u201cdouble counting\u201d and that his sentence must be reduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">This court reviews for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision denying a motion to modify sentence. <em>United States v. Cothran, </em>106 F.3d 1560, 1562 (11th Cir. 1997); <em>United States v. Townsend, </em>55 F.3d 168, 170 (5th Cir.1995). Section 3582(c)(2) allows the court to reduce a term of imprisonment if the defendant\u2019s sentence was based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission and if a reduction would be consistent with the applicable policy statements in the guidelines. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Diaz, </em>19 F.3d 1340, 1341 (11th Cir.1994); <em>Ebbole v. United States, </em>8 F.3d 530, 539 (7th Cir.1993). Amendments to the guidelines which retroactively lower sentencing ranges and which thus permit a defendant to seek relief under \u00a7 3582(c) are listed at USSG \u00a7 1B1.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">The district court properly denied Hodges\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c) motion. Hodges argues that his sentence should be reduced in accordance with Amendment 599 to the guidelines. Amendment 599 is given retroactive effect under \u00a7 1B1.10, and thus a defendant may seek relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) pursuant to that amendment. <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>248 F.3d 1065, 1107-08 (11th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Aquino, </em>242 F.3d 859, 865 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>533 U.S. 963, 121 S.Ct. 2622, 150 L.Ed.2d 775 (2001). Amendment 599 provides for certain changes to the commentary to USSG \u00a7 2K2.4, which impacts the sentence of a defendant who is convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 844(h), 924(c), or 929(a). Amendment 599, in this instance, prohibits a weapon enhancement to the underlying offense where there is a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">However, Amendment 599 does not apply in Hodges\u2019s case. The record reveals that the district court did not make a two-level increase for Hodges\u2019s use of a firearm as recommended by the presentence report; rather, the district court refused to apply the two-level increase to Hodges\u2019s offense level and instead departed upward five levels based on the extreme danger created by Hodges in the motel room. Consequently, Amendment 599\u2019s changes to \u00a7 2K2.4 do not affect Hodges\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Accordingly, we hereby affirm the district court\u2019s judgment pursuant to Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
