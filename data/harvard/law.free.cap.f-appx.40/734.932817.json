This case arises from his termination as a police officer and a subsequent federal prosecution for his alleged deprivation of the civil rights of an arrested man. He appeals from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the defendants on his 1983 malicious prosecution and false-arrest claims, his First Amendment retaliation claim, his municipal liability claim for failure to reinstate to the Police Department and state law claims for malicious prosecution, false arrest and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Our review of the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is plenary. <em>Huang v. BP Amoco Corp., </em>271 F.3d 560, 564 (3d Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>Inasmuch as the district court (Wald-man, J.) has already set forth the factual and procedural history of this case, we find it unnecessary to repeat that history here. <em>See Vassallo v. Timoney, </em>No. 00-84, 2001 WL 1243517 (E.D.Pa. October 15, 2001). Moreover, the district court, in its Memorandum Opinion and Order, has carefully and completely explained its reasons for denying Vassallo the relief he seeks and granting summary judgment to the defendants. Because of the district court\u2019s thoughtful and searching analysis, we need not engage in a redundant analysis simply to reach the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Accordingly, we will affirm the district court substantially for the reasons set forth in the district court\u2019s Memorandum Opinion without further elaboration.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
