The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to 70 months imprisonment and 5 years supervised release. On appeal, counsel has filed a brief and moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and Reynoso has not filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-32\">Counsel argues that the district court should have granted Reynoso\u2019s motion for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0 based on his willingness to consent to administrative deportation without a hearing. The district court\u2019s refusal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>depart is unreviewable, however, because the court acknowledged its authority to depart and declined to do so. <em>See United States v. Wolf, </em>270 F.3d 1188, 1192 (8th Cir .2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">After reviewing the record independently under <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we have found no nonfrivolous issues. Accordingly, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b340-33\">. The Honorable Nanette K.
