Gatten filed a motion for summary judgment in district court on grounds of quali-fled immunity. The district court denied the motion. We affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we recite them only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-13\">In this appeal, Gatten provisionally concedes, as he must for this court to have jurisdiction, Mahler\u2019s version of the facts. <em>See Jeffers v. Gomez, 267 F.3d 895, 908 </em>(9th Cir.2001); <em>Knox v. Southwest Airlines, </em>124 F.3d 1103, 1108 (9th Cir.1997). The question properly before us, then, is whether, after drawing all reasonable factual inferences in favor of Mahler, qualified immunity was appropriately denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-14\">In evaluating a claim of qualified immunity, we first ask whether the facts alleged show the officer\u2019s conduct violated a constitutional right. <em>~A </em>constitutional violation would exist in this case if 1) Mahler\u2019s medical need was a \u201cserious need\u201d and 2) Gatten responded to that need with \u201cdeliberate indifference.\u201d We find a \u201cserious medical need\u201d if \u201cthe failure to treat a prisoner\u2019s condition could result in further significant injury or the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.\u201d <em>McGuckin v. Smith, </em>974 F.2d 1050, 1059 (9th Cir.1992) (quotation omitted), <em>overruled on other grounds by WMX Techs., Inc. v. Miller, </em>104 F.3d 1133, 1136 (9th Cir.1997) (en banc)). <em>McGuckin </em>offered three examples of \u201cindications that a prisoner has a serious need for medical treatment\u201d: \u201c[t]he existence of an injury that a reasonable doctor or patient would find important and worthy of comment or treatment; the presence of a medical condition that significantly affects an individual\u2019s daily activities; or the existence of chronic and substantial pain.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 1059-60 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Drawing all reasonable inferences from the record most favorably to Mahler, Mahler\u2019s situation fits within these examples. Dr. Peel found Mahler\u2019s need for a first floor accommodation to be \u201cworthy of comment or treatment,\u201d hence his written request. The reports from all three doctors who examined Mahler state that the stair-climbing increased his chronic, substantial pain. There was also some evidence that the stair-climbing could have advanced in time (although it did not cause) the need for corrective surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">According to <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 847, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994), \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to such a serious medical need exists \u201cif [the officer] knows that [the] inmate[ ] facets] a substantial risk of serious harm and disregards that risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it.\u201d The deliberate indifference standard \u201cis less stringent in cases involving a prisoner\u2019s medical needs than in other cases involving harm to incarcerated individuals because \u2018the State\u2019s responsibility to provide inmates with medical care ordinarily does not conflict with competing administrative concerns.\u2019 \u201d <em>McGuckin, </em>974 F.2d at 1060 <em>(quoting Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 6, 112 S.Ct. 995,117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\"><em>Farmer\u2019s </em>articulation of the standard requires that the official know that the inmate faces \u201ca substantial risk of serious harm.\u201d <em>Farmer, </em>511 U.S. at 842, 114 S.Ct. 1970. The facts according to Mahler are that Gatten received five requests from Mahler, and one from Dr. Peel, to move Mahler to the first floor because of his severe joint disease and the resulting pain. To receive those requests and ignore them entirely would constitute deliberate indifference to Mahler\u2019s medical needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Gatten\u2019s primary argument to the contrary is that the decision whether or not to move a prisoner is ordinarily a matter within Gatten\u2019s discretion. The district court did rule that making decisions regarding movement of prisoners is a \u201cdiscretionary function,\u201d but that ruling was specific to the tort cause of action for negligence under the Federal Tort Claims Act, not at issue in this appeal. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5148. The FTCA discretionary function concept has no pertinence to the question whether Gatten violated Mahler\u2019s <em>constitutional </em>rights by deliberately failing to move him despite his serious medical needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">That Dr. Peel made a request rather than issue an order does not detract from the possibility of finding, on this record, the requisite deliberate indifference. Dr. Peel testified that there was nothing he could fill out that constituted an \u201corder,\u201d because prison administrators had the final call. In any event, the question under <em>Farmer </em>is not whether Gatten disobeyed an order, but whether he knew of a serious medical need that he could have ameliorated but chose to ignore. Viewing the facts most favorably to Mahler, Gatten did.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">Gatten points out that Mahler was assigned to a different correctional counselor on October 8, 1995, 16 days after Gatten allegedly received Dr. Peel\u2019s request. According to Mahler, however, Gatten was deliberately indifferent to Mahler\u2019s medical condition before as well as after Dr. Peel\u2019s request. Mahler\u2019s condition and pain were apparent, and known to Gatten, and Mahler had made several requests to be moved before he went to see Dr. Peel.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">Having ascertained that the record read favorably to Mahler demonstrates violation of a constitutional right, we must decide whether the \u201ccontours\u201d of the right are \u201csufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.\u201d <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 202, 121 S.Ct. 2151,150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>It is critical to this inquiry that Gatten has advanced no reason whatever for denying the request that Mahler be housed on the first floor \u2014 no security or competing resources basis, for example. To refuse <em>for no reason </em>\u2014 or not to consider at all \u2014 requests from a doctor and a prisoner to alleviate to some degree a prisoner\u2019s serious medical condition and thereby permit the exacerbation of the prisoner\u2019s injury or the wanton infliction of pain demonstrates deliberate indifference to medical needs. A reasonable official after <em>Farmer </em>would have so understood the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">We recognize that the absence of any explanation for Gatten\u2019s lack of response to Mahler\u2019s and Peel\u2019s requests may well reflect Gatten\u2019s basic factual contention in the underlying case \u2014 that he never received the requests. For present purposes, however, we must assume otherwise. We deny the present appeal and remand so that the factual disputes in this case can be resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b434-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
