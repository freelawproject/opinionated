Hutter appeal from a ruling issued on March 29, 2001 by the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut (Squatrito, /.). That decision affirmed an order of the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Connecticut in <em>In re Hutter, </em>215 B.R. 808 (Bankr. D.Conn.1997) (Shift, <em>J.) </em>granting the appointment <em>nunc pro tunc </em>of Coan, Lewen-don, Royston, Deming &amp; Gulliver (\u201cCoan, Lewendon\u201d), the law firm of trustee-appel-lee Richard M. Coan, to litigate the sale of real property owned by the Hutters. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Richard Coan is the bankruptcy trustee for Nance Hutter\u2019s estate. On May 3, 1996, Coan brought an adversarial proceeding against Gerhard Hutter, debtor-appellant\u2019s husband, under Section 363(h) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363(h), to sell Mr. Hutter\u2019s one-half interest in the couple\u2019s residence at 933 Lake Avenue, Greenwich, Connecticut. At that time, Coan had not filed an application pursuant to \u00a7 327(a) for court approval of his retention of counsel to prosecute the adversary proceeding. Approximately one year later, on May 8, 1997, Coan filed his \u00a7 327(a) application to retain his own law firm, Coan, Lewendon, <em>nunc pro tunc </em>to May 1, 1996 before the initiation of the adversarial proceeding. Coan admitted that his application was untimely because he \u201cmistakenly assumed that ... [he] had [already] filed the application.\u201d Tr. of 6/6/97 Hr\u2019g at 49. The Hutters objected to the retention of Coan, Lewendon and to the <em>nunc pro tunc </em>request, arguing that Coan\u2019s failure to file his application in a timely manner could not be dismissed as \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">The bankruptcy court granted the application, finding that Coan was under pressure to begin the litigation quickly in order to satisfy debtor-appellant\u2019s creditors, that the Hutters suffered no prejudice as a result of the delay, and that \u201c[Coan\u2019s] delay was in large part due to the numerous papers filed and consequential court appearances caused by the Hutters.\u201d <em>In re Hutter, </em>215 B.R. at 316. The court therefore found that Coan\u2019s actions constituted \u201cexcusable neglect.\u201d On appeal, the district court, applying the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d test of <em>In re Keren Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>189 F.3d 86 (2d Cir.1999) (per cu-riam), affirmed the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision concluding that it had not abused its discretion in granting <em>nunc pro tunc </em>retention.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">On appeal, the Hutters argue that the bankruptcy court erroneously applied the less demanding \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d standard rather than the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d test. Furthermore, they argue that, under either the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d standard or the \u201cexcusable neglect\u201d standard, the bankruptcy court erred in authorizing <em>nunc pro tunc </em>retention because the delay was attributable only to the trustee\u2019s negligence. Finally, they assert that both the bankruptcy court and the district court erred in finding that the Hutters contributed to the delay by filing numerous papers.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">On appeal, the district court reviewed the bankruptcy court record under the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d standard and found that the bankruptcy court, in its findings, had demonstrated \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d in this unnecessarily protracted litigation. We affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
