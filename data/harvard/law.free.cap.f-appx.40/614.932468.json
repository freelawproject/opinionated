The allegations in the complaints and the documents attached thereto demonstrate that Pilchman was not qualified for the naval position he sought. With respect to the FOIA and Privacy Act claims, we agree with the District Court that \u201c[pjlaintiff identified] no basis\u201d for these claims in the proceedings before the District Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm for substantially the reasons stated in the District Court\u2019s orders of July 25, 2001, and July 17,1998.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b632-14\">. We note, however, that the Navy has indicated that its investigation is complete and that, accordingly, it will entertain a renewed FOIA request by Pilchman.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
