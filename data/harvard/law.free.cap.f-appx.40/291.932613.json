Doty was convicted of first-degree intentional homicide by a Wisconsin state court. Several years after he began serving his life sentence, the Wisconsin Department of Corrections signed a contract with Corrections Corporation of America to place some of Wisconsin\u2019s inmates in CCA\u2019s privately run prisons, and transferred Doty to CCA\u2019s facility in Whiteville, Tennessee. Doty then petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. He claims that he should be immediately freed because the U.S. Constitution prohibits Wisconsin from exercising jurisdiction over him after transferring him to an out-of-state facility. The district court denied his petition, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">We have already recognized the propriety of Wisconsin\u2019s transfer of inmates to private, out-of-state prisons, and we have rejected as frivolous arguments that the practice is unconstitutional. <em>Pischke v. Litscher, </em>178 F.3d 497, 500-01 (7th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">The district court treated Doty\u2019s petition as arising under \u00a7 2254, but objections to transfers to out-of-state prisons are really challenges under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. <em>Moran v. Sondalle, </em>218 F.3d 647, 650 (7th Cir.2000). Doty had the benefit of the warnings we offered both in <em>Pischke </em>and in <em>Moran </em>against filing challenges to out-of-state transfers as habeas corpus petitions. <em>Pischke, </em>178 F.3d at 500; <em>Moran, </em>218 F.3d at 651-52. Therefore under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) he has earned two strikes because both his petition and appeal are \u201cthoroughly frivolous.\u201d <em>Moran, 218 </em>F.3d at 651-52; <em>Stanley v. Litscher, </em>213 F.3d 340, 343 (7th Cir.2000); <em>Pischke, </em>178 F.3d at 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
