Mr. Jones argues that imprisonment for such a lengthy period is unreasonable; he notes that the United States Sentencing Guidelines recommends a 3-9 month sentence. For the reasons set forth in this order, we must affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-17\">In 1992, Mr. Jones pleaded guilty to one count of a 22-count indictment charging conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. He was granted a downward departure based upon his cooperation with the government, resulting in a sentence of 94 months\u2019 imprisonment. This sentence was one-half the low end of the applicable guideline range. In January 2000, Mr. Jones began his 5-year term of supervised release. After the probation office found that he had violated the conditions of his supervised release, the district court issued a rule to show cause why his supervised release should not be revoked. After a hearing, the court concluded that Mr. Jones had in fact violated the terms of his release. Although the policy statement contained in the sentencing guidelines recommends a sentence range of 3-9 months\u2019 imprisonment, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a), the court imposed 60 months\u2019 incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-19\">A district court has substantial discretion in imposing a sentence of incarceration upon revocation of supervised release. Indeed, we shall reverse such a sentence only if it is \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d under the circumstances. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(4); <em>United States v. Huusko, </em>275 F.3d 600, 602 (7th Cir.2001). In this case, the district court had the statutory authority to sentence Mr. Jones to a period of incarceration up to 60 months. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). The policy statement contained in the sentencing guidelines, which recommend a 3-9 month period of incarceration, is merely \u201cadvisory,\u201d <em>see United States of America v. Hale, </em>107 F.3d 526, 529 (7th Cir.1997), and this recommendation is only one of a number of factors a district court should consider when imposing a sentence of revocation of supervised release. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). In <em>United States v. Huusko, </em>275 F.3d 600, 603 (7th Cir.2001), we noted that, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3), the sentencing court must consider:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-22\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (2) the defendant\u2019s history and characteristics; (3) the need of the sentence to deter future crime, protect the public, and provide the criminal with necessary services; (4) Sentencing Commission recommendations regarding sentence range; (5) Sentencing Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>sion policy; and (6) sentence consistency for like violations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Here, the district court correctly examined each of the factors and found that Mr. Jones\u2019 violations of supervised release demonstrated that he is \u201cunsupervisable\u201d and that supervised release would only \u201cfurther burden the Probation Office and the Court.\u201d R.28 at 10-12. Mr. Jones had admitted previously to the court that he had violated the conditions of his supervised release by failing to medicate, failing to attend counseling sessions, refusing to submit urine samples and testing positive for opiates. The district court discussed Mr. Jones\u2019 attendance at probation meetings and at drug treatment and counseling sessions since his release from prison. The court further questioned his ability to be rehabilitated based upon his failures to provide specimens for drug testing and his positive tests for opiates. Moreover, the court properly considered the seriousness of Mr. Jones\u2019 crime, which involved the distribution of 10 to 30 kilograms of heroin. Lastly, the court noted that Mr. Jones\u2019 sentence was relatively brief, as compared to the sentences of his co-defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">We also note that the district court had extensive contact with the defendant and, after the hearing, deferred decision for 60 days to ascertain with more certainty the appropriate course of action. As an appellate court, bound by the record before us, we cannot say that Mr. Jones\u2019 sentence of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment is plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">AFFIRMED</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
