Because genuine issues of material fact still exist with respect to one of the two Fourth Amendment claims against Kynard, we REVERSE in part the district court\u2019s de-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>cisi\u00f3n and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Our previous opinion, which reversed the district court\u2019s initial grant of summary judgment to Kynard, contains a thorough discussion of the facts of this case. <em>Smith v. Stone, </em>No. 99-3208, 2000 WL 687672, at *l-*3 (6th Cir. May 19, 2000). The facts as pertinent to this appeal are as follows: On May 27, 1995, Kynard and more than ten of her fellow police officers responded to an emergency call for backup following the firing of gunshots in the area of 1420 Addington Road, Toledo, Ohio. <em>Id. </em>at *1. After hearing from another officer that an armed suspect had run into the house at that address, Kynard entered the residence and began to search for the suspect. <em>Id. </em>at *2. No such individual was found. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Two years later, the residents of 1420 Addington Road filed a complaint in state court alleging that Kynard and ten other named members of the Toledo Police Division had deprived them of their Fourth Amendment rights in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The defendants removed the case to the district court and filed a motion for summary judgment, which the district court granted. We reversed the grant of summary judgment to Kynard only. On remand, the district court granted Ky-nard\u2019s motion to submit supplemental affidavits<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but ultimately denied her renewed motion for summary judgment. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">We first consider our jurisdiction to hear this appeal. Citing <em>Johnson v. Jones, </em>515 U.S. 304, 115 S.Ct. 2151, 132 L.Ed.2d 238 (1995), the plaintiffs contend that we lack such jurisdiction because the district court found that the existence of a genuine issue of material fact precluded a grant of summary judgment to Kynard. Factual disputes that are immaterial to legal issues, however, do not affect our jurisdiction. <em>Claybrook v. Birchwell, </em>274 F.3d 1098, 1103 (6th Cir.2001). We may review a denial of qualified immunity when a defendant is \u201cwilling to concede to the facts as alleged by the plaintiff and discuss only the legal issues raised by the case.\u201d <em>Klein v. Long, </em>275 F.3d 544, 549 (6th Cir.2001) (quotation omitted), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>70 U.S.L.W. 3758 (U.S. May 28, 2002) (No. 01-1742).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s denial of qualified immunity. <em>Klein, </em>275 F.3d at 550. It is well established \u201cthat government officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). Furthermore, qualified immunity \u201cis an <em>immunity from suit </em>rather than a mere defense to liability\u201d; it shields government officials from the \u201cburdens of litigation.\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Forsyth, </em>472 U.S. 511, 526, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985). In ruling upon a claim of qualified immunity, we first inquire whether the factual allegations, \u201c[tjaken in the light most fa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>vorable to the party asserting the injury,... show the officer\u2019s conduct violated a constitutional right.\u201d <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>583 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001). \u201c[I]f a violation could be made out on a favorable view of the parties\u2019 submissions, the next, sequential step is to ask whether the right was clearly established\u201d \u2014 that is, \u201cwhether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 201-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">In this case, Kynard initially averred that she had \u201cheard an officer state that a fleeing suspect carrying a firearm had just run into the house at 1420 Addington Road.\u201d J.A. at 105 (Kynard Aff. at H4). Although the plaintiffs disputed the fact that any such person had made such an entrance,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the district court held that exigent circumstances justified the warrant-less search, because Kynard and her fellow officers had \u201cperceived [themselves] to be [in] \u2018hot pursuit\u2019 of the fleeing gunman.\u201d J.A. at 141. We reversed, holding that \u201cthere are factual disputes regarding whether Kynard could enter plaintiffs\u2019 house without a warrant because of exigent circumstances and whether she was required to comply with the knock and announce rule before entering the house.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>2000 WL 687672, at *9.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">On remand, Kynard submitted a supplemental affidavit in which she identified Tommie Lyles (\u201cLyles\u201d) as the officer who had informed her about the armed suspect. J.A. at 183 (Kynard Supp. Aff. at 113). Fellow officer Curtis Stone (\u201cStone\u201d) also averred that Lyles had made the statement. J.A at 186 (Stone Supp. Aff. at If 3). Moreover, Kynard vouched for Lyles\u2019s truthfulness and reliability. J.A. at 183 (Kynard Supp. Aff. at 117). To counter Kynard\u2019s assurance of Lyles\u2019s credibility, the plaintiffs submitted the affidavit of Jeremiah Reditt (\u201cReditt\u201d), who disputed the facts of an incident report in which Lyles was listed as the witness.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Reditt asserted that Lyles had made a false statement in keeping with his alleged \u201cpropensity for making false statements to police officers\u201d and \u201chistory of being untruthful.\u201d J.A. at 211 (Reditt Aff. at 115).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The district court found that the issue of Lyles\u2019s reliability necessitated the denial of Ky-nard\u2019s renewed motion for summary judgment. J.A. at 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">We now reverse in part. The facts material to Kynard\u2019s claim of qualified immunity with respect to the warrantless search are (1) the identity of the officer who stated that an armed suspect had entered the plaintiffs\u2019 residence and (2) the reliability of that officer as known to Kynard at the time of the search. Our previous reversal of the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Kynard was based on evidentiary gaps in the record. The supplemental affidavits filed by Kynard and Stone now identify Lyles as the source of the information about the gunman. Ky-nard\u2019s supplemental affidavit also states that Lyles had been her partner for several years at the time of the shooting incident and that he had always proved himself to be \u201ctruthful and reliable.\u201d J.A. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>183 (Kynard Supp. Aff. at \u00b6\u00b6 5, 7).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These undisputed facts support the reasonableness of Kynard\u2019s reliance on Lyles\u2019s information and her belief that exigent circumstances justified the warrantless search of the plaintiffs\u2019 residence. It is simply immaterial whether a written incident report summarizing Lyles\u2019s view of the incident was later asserted to be false, because Kynard had no reason to doubt Lyles\u2019s reliability at the time he informed her of the armed suspect, much less an opportunity to learn about the allegedly false statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">In our previous opinion, we noted the existence of a genuine issue of material fact not only with regard to whether Ky-nard could enter the house without a warrant because of exigent circumstances but also with respect to Kynard\u2019s asserted failure to satisfy the Fourth Amendment\u2019s \u201cknock and announce\u201d requirement before entering the plaintiffs\u2019 residence. <em>Smith, </em>2000 WL 687672, at *6.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The district court denied qualified immunity with respect to both claims. Kynard does not address whether qualified immunity is appropriate respecting the knock and announce issue. Because we generally deem arguments that are not briefed on appeal to have been abandoned or waived, <em>see, e.g., Ewolski v. City of Brunswick, </em>287 F.3d 492, 516-17 (6th Cir.2002), the knock-and-announce claim is not before us at this time and the district court\u2019s denial of qualified immunity controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE in part the decision of the district</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">court. We REMAND so that the district court may proceed with the knock and announce claim in accordance with our opinions in this case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b218-7\">. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(e), district \"court[s] may permit affidavits to be supplemented or opposed by depositions, answers to interrogatories, or further affidavits.\u201d The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion in permitting Kynard to submit supplemental affidavits. <em>Cf. Lighten v. Univ. of Utah, </em>209 F.3d 1213, 1227 (10th Cir.2000) (stating that a \"district court clearly has discretion to permit supplemental affidavits it finds useful for summary judgment determination\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b219-7\">. J.A. at 120 (Smith Aff. at 11 6).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b219-8\">. Lyles was reported in the incident report as stating that he had observed Joseph Washington Jr. (\u201cWashington\u201d) with a gun in the mid-afternoon of May 27, 1995. J.A. at 212-13. Reditt, Washington's cousin, claimed that he had been with Washington on that day and that Washington \"did not fire, handle or otherwise exercise control over any firearm.\u201d J.A. at 211 (Reditt Aff. at II3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b219-12\">. The sole basis stated in the affidavit for the propensity allegations was the matter described in n. 3 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b220-7\">. Indeed, Lyles would have been Kynard\u2019s partner on May 27, 1995, had he not been off duty. J.A. at 184 (Kynard Supp. Aff. at H 10).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b220-8\">. We note that the exigent circumstances exception does not necessarily have the same application in the contexts of warrantless searches and knock-and-announce violations. <em>Compare, e.g., United States v. Haddix, </em>239 F.3d 766, 767 (6th Cir.2001), <em>with United States v. Dice, </em>200 F.3d 978, 983 (6th Cir. 2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
