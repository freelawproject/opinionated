Dalton also appeals the district court\u2019s imposition of an alternative sentence. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We reject Dalton\u2019s claims and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">We recite here only those facts necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">On October 10, 1996, a grand jury returned a twelve count superceding indictment charging Dalton with conducting a continuing criminal enterprise (\u201cCCE\u201d), multiple counts of conspiracy to manufacture marijuana, manufacturing marijuana, possessing with intent to manufacture marijuana, and witness tampering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1512(b)\u00ae, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846, and 848.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-14\">Following an evidentiary hearing on Dalton\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment and the government\u2019s motion to determine the admissibility of certain recordings, the district court excluded the bedroom recordings of conversations between Dalton and his then wife Horstman, and denied Dalton\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-15\">After a month-long jury trial, on September 21, 1999, Dalton was convicted on Counts One, Two, Three, Six, Eight, and Nine, <em>ie., </em>one count of operating a continuing criminal enterprise, two counts of manufacturing marijuana and possessing marijuana with the intent to manufacture it, and three counts of conspiring to manufacture and possess with intent to manufacture marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-16\">Dalton moved to set aside his CCE conviction on the ground that the CCE jury instruction was erroneous. Dalton also moved, separately, for a new trial, or in the alternative for a <em>Remmer </em>hearing, based upon allegations of \u201cconduct influ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>encing the jury.\u201d The district court denied each of Dalton\u2019s motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">On December 1, 2000, the district court sentenced Dalton to 324 months of imprisonment as to Count One (CCE) and 60 months as to the remaining counts, to run concurrently with the sentence on Count One and each other. In conformity with <em>United States v. Medina, </em>940 F.2d 1247, 1253 (9th Cir.1991), the court imposed an \u201calternative sentence\u201d to become effective in the event that the conviction on the CCE count was reversed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Dalton appeals the Court\u2019s denial of each of his motions, as well as the district court\u2019s imposition of an alternative sentence, each of which we discuss <em>seriatim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">A. <em>Motion to Dismiss</em></p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">We agree with the district court that DEA Agent Nelson engaged in outrageous conduct in this case. During the DEA\u2019s investigation of Dalton, after his then wife Horstman began cooperating with authorities, Agent Nelson brought Horstman to a DEA safe-house, in violation of DEA policy, and the two consumed alcohol together and engaged in amorous conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">Soon after the \u201ckissing\u201d incident, Agent Nelson asked Horstman to secretly record conversations between her and Dalton, then her husband, in their bedroom. She complied by placing a recording device behind their bed, and recordings were made. The government sought to introduce these recordings at trial, but the trial court suppressed them.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">Dalton contends that the conduct of DEA Agent Nelson was so outrageous that the district court should have dismissed the indictment rather than simply suppressing the tapes of the bedroom conversations. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-12\">Dalton points to no authority that supports his claim that the outrageous conduct here so tainted the investigation that it would be fundamentally unfair to proceed against him. \u201cOutrageous government conduct is not a defense, but rather a claim that government conduct in securing an indictment was so shocking to due process values that the indictment must be dismissed.\u201d <em>United States v. Montoya, </em>45 F.3d 1286, 1300 (9th Cir.1995) (citing <em>Hampton v. United States, </em>425 U.S. 484, 96 S.Ct. 1646, 48 L.Ed.2d 113 (1976)). Under the \u201c \u2018extremely high standard\u2019 of this doctrine, an indictment should be dismissed \u2018only when the government\u2019s conduct is so grossly shocking and so outrageous as to violate the universal sense of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Montoya, </em>45 F.3d at 1300 (quoting <em>United States v. Garza-Juarez, </em>992 F.2d 896, 903 (9th Cir.1993) (internal citations omitted)). The conduct at issue here simply does not rise to the level required for dismissal, <em>see, e.g., United States v. Simpson, </em>813 F.2d 1462, 1465 (9th Cir. 1987) (no outrageous conduct where police informant carried on a five-month sexual relationship with defendant), and the district court appropriately imposed the more limited remedy of suppression, <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>449 U.S. 361, 366, 101 S.Ct. 665, 66 L.Ed.2d 564 (1981) (holding \u201c[t]he remedy [for government misconduct] is limited to denying the prosecution the fruits of its transgression.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-13\">B. <em>Jm'y Instructions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b441-14\">Dalton contends that his CCE conviction must be overturned due to an error in the jury instruction on that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-15\">The jury instruction required the jury to agree unanimously on the three violations that constitute the continuing series of three or more violations committed over a definite period of time. The instruction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>did not say that the violations must be in separate years. Dalton contends that is error.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Dalton\u2019s argument fails for two reasons. First, the conspiracy and the substantive offense underlying it each qualify as predicate offenses, which together may constitute a \u201cseries of acts\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 848. <em>United States v. Hernandez-Escarsega, </em>886 F.2d 1560, 1571 (9th Cir.1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>497 U.S. 1003, 110 S.Ct. 3237, 111 L.Ed.2d 748 (1990). Second, the jury\u2019s verdict itself refutes Dalton\u2019s argument, insofar as the jury convicted him of a conspiracy and substantive count related to the 1994 grow, a conspiracy count related to the 1992 grow, and a conspiracy and substantive count related to the 1991 grow. The jury, therefore, <em>necessarily </em>found Dalton guilty of \u201coffenses arising out of three separate grows in three separate years,\u201d <em>to wit, </em>1991, 1992, and 1994. The CCE conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">C. <em>Motion for a New Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Dalton argues that the district court erred in failing to grant him a new trial, or in the alternative to grant him a <em>Remmer </em>hearing. The basis for the motion was Dalton\u2019s claim that his attorney instructed Dalton\u2019s brother, Ted, to place newspaper articles discussing Dalton\u2019s case around the lunchroom where the jury would eat. Ted submitted an affidavit, and later an unsworn statement, asserting that the attorney told him to place the articles near jurors, and that he in fact did so. Though Dalton\u2019s attorney vehemently denies having acted in this manner, Dalton alleges that, on the basis of the statements submitted by him and his brother, the court was required to hold a <em>Remmer </em>hearing or grant him a new trial. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">An evidentiary hearing was not necessary where no credible evidence of jury tampering was presented to the court. <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>209 F.3d 1103, 1110 (9th Cir.2000) (noting that district court was not required to hold a hearing where investigator\u2019s allegation of tampering was inherently incredible); <em>United States v. Angulo, 4 </em>F.3d 843, 847 (9th Cir.1993) (holding that \u201c[a]n evidentiary hearing is not mandated <em>every </em>time there is an allegation of jury misconduct or bias\u201d); <em>United. States v. Navarro-Garcia, </em>926 F.2d 818, 822 (9th Cir.1991) (though finding credible evidence to warrant a hearing in the case, noting that a hearing is not necessary when the court \u201ccan determine from the record before it that the allegations are without credibility\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">Significant evidence existed calling into doubt the veracity of the statements made by Dalton\u2019s brother. Putting aside the fact that Dalton\u2019s brother is an interested party, the brother\u2019s \u201cdeclaration\u201d fails to provide dates for the events alleged, fails to identify the \u201cother person\u201d who distributed the articles with him, and fails to state which articles were left and where. Dalton\u2019s own claim that this event occurred on more than one occasion is itself contradicted by his brother\u2019s statement that it occurred only once. Lastly, his brother admitted to previous perjury on Dalton\u2019s behalf, as well as admitting to having committed other crimes. The district court found his testimony incredible. The finding was not clearly erroneous. The district court therefore did not abuse its discretion in denying Dalton\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">D. <em>Imposition of the Alternative Sentence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">Dalton contends that the district court\u2019s articulation of an alternative sentence, to be imposed in the event that Dalton\u2019s CCE conviction were to be reversed on appeal, violated his constitutional right against double jeopardy insofar as it would not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>take effect unless and until his CCE conviction were to be set aside. He argues that the alternative sentence imposed is anticipatory, having no force and effect until after double jeopardy attaches \u2014 a time at which the reassertion of the remaining convictions would violate that constitutional protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">In <em>United States v. Medina, </em>940 F.2d 1247, 1253 (9th Cir.1991), we discussed the dilemma district courts confront when faced with convictions on both CCE and lesser-included conspiracy counts. In such circumstances, the \u201cmost efficient course for the district court to follow is to impose a sentence on the CCE count and an alternative sentence on the lesser-included convictions\u201d \u2014 one \u201cconditioned upon an appellate reversal of the CCE count.\u201d <em>Medina, </em>940 F.2d at 1253. Such an approach is efficient because, in the event a CCE conviction is reversed on appeal, \u201cneedless remand will be avoided.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the case at bar, the district court followed <em>Medina, </em>imposing an alternative sentence of 108 months to take effect only upon appellate reversal of the CCE conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">We affirm the decisions of the district court and deny Dalton\u2019s claims in their entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b440-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Cir.
