The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-17\">The district court correctly determined that petitioner was ineligible for coram nobis relief. Because petitioner is in federal custody and contests the validity of his sentence, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 provides the exclusive avenue for seeking relief. <em>See Pennsylvania Bur. of Corr. v. United States Marshals Serv., </em>474 U.S. 34, 43, 106 S.Ct. 355, 88 L.Ed.2d 189 (1985); <em>United States v. Sawyer, </em>239 F.3d 31, 37 (1st Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Barrett, </em>178 F.3d 34, 55 (1st Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 1176, 120 S.Ct. 1208, 145 L.Ed.2d 1110 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-20\">This is not merely a formal distinction. As petitioner has already filed four previous \u00a7 2255 motions, all of which were rejected, he would be required to satisfy the rigid gatekeeping provisions applicable to successive \u00a7 2255 motions in order to have the merits of his claims considered. One of those provisions requires petitioner to request leave of this court to file a successive petition. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (U 8); <em>see Jamison v. United States, </em>244 F.3d 44, 45-46 (1st Cir.2001). We have not granted such leave, nor would we since petitioner\u2019s claims involve neither newly discovered evidence nor a new rule of constitutional law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244 &amp; 2255. Accordingly, the judgment is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
