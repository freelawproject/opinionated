Michael McCann to release records related to the criminal case that led to Whitlow\u2019s conviction. The district court dismissed on the basis that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction, and Whitlow appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-22\">On appeal WTiitlow argues that four provisions entitle him to federal relief: the Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551; the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a); the statute governing an action to compel, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361; and the Wis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>consin Public Records Law, Wis. Stat. <em>1931, et seq. </em>But the district court properly found that the FOIA and \u00a7 1361 apply only to federal officials and McCann is an official of the State of Wisconsin. The district court further held correctly that \u00a7 1651 does not independently confer jurisdiction but rather only supplements already existing jurisdiction established on another basis. <em>See In re Campbell, </em>264 F.3d 730, 731 (7th Cir.2001). Finally, the district court appropriately concluded that the Eleventh Amendment bars Whitlow\u2019s action against a state official in federal court for a violation of state law, and thus there is no federal forum for Whitlow\u2019s claim under the Public Records Law. <em>See Pennhurst State Sch. &amp; Hosp. v. Halderman, </em>465 U.S. 89, 92, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984); <em>Luder v. Endicott, </em>253 F.3d 1020, 1024 (7th Cir.2001). Because there is no legitimate basis for federal jurisdiction over Whitlow\u2019s claims, the distriet court was correct to dismiss his peti^ion</p>\n<p id=\"ACjo\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
