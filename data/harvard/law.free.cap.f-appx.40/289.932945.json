Pettigrew filed a successful claim to recover his medical costs under the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act (\u201cFECA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8101 et seq. In June 1995 he filed another FECA claim with the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs (\u201cOWCP\u201d) in the Department of Labor (\u201cDOL\u201d), alleging a \u201crecurrence of disability\u201d from the December 1994 injury. In support of his claim Pettigrew submitted medical reports diagnosing lumbar strain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>and disc herniation. In September 1995 the OWCP denied his claim, concluding that Pettigrew had failed to establish that his work accident caused his claimed disability. Pettigrew\u2019s subsequent administrative appeals to the DOL were denied. He then filed this action in federal district court against the DOL, the OWCP, the Employment Standards Administration, and the Secretary of Labor. Pettigrew alleges that he was denied benefits without due process of law; he seeks a new adjudication of his claim. The district court dismissed his complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, concluding that judicial review of his benefits claim is prohibited by statute and that his constitutional claims are insubstantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">The FECA forbids judicial review of federal workers\u2019 compensation decisions. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8128(b); <em>Czerkies v. United States Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>73 F.3d 1435, 1437 (7th Cir.1996) (en banc). Although the FECA does not bar review of <em>constitutional </em>claims, <em>Czerkies, </em>73 F.3d at 1442, a claim for benefits \u201ccloaked in constitutional terms\u201d is plainly barred under \u00a7 8128(b), <em>id. </em>at 1443. Consequently, Pettigrew may challenge constitutional errors in his administrative proceeding, but not the denial of his benefits claim. <em>Id. </em>at 1440. Much of Pettigrew\u2019s complaint unabashedly seeks review of the agency\u2019s benefits determination. For example, it alleges that the DOL and the OWCP failed to comply with regulations by not offering him a suitable job that accommodated his disability. This claim squarely revisits the merits of his benefits petition and is barred under \u00a7 8128(b). Pettigrew also complains that the Postal Service wrongly fired him and submitted false records to the DOL. The Postal Service, however, is not a party in this action (his previous suit against it was dismissed in 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Pettigrew\u2019s complaint also purports to assail his administrative proceeding as violating his due process rights. He asserts that the DOL wrongly considered evidence submitted by the Postal Service; that the Postal Service had improper <em>ex parte </em>communication with the Secretary of Labor; and that the DOL violated its own procedural manual in administering and adjudicating his claim. We agree with the district court that such claims do not rise to the level of substantial due process claims. <em>See id. </em>at 1442-43 (employee\u2019s claim that his due process rights were violated when he was prevented from cross-examining his supervisor was insubstantial). Petti-grew\u2019s 38-page complaint repeatedly refers to \u201cdue process violations,\u201d but these are merely conelusory labels attached to his alleged grievances.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
