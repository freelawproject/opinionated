Prunty later gave the \u201cEdward Hill\u201d identification papers to Chester Spriggs, who used them to buy additional guns in West Virginia. Prunty and Ronnie Seamon traveled to West Virginia to purchase firearms, which they transported back to New Jersey for resale. Several weapons were stored at the home of DeCarlos Brown, who sold some of them. Mark Dean also purchased guns at Prunty\u2019s request at the West Virginia hardware store.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-24\">On June 5, 1998, Prunty, Dean, Moore, Seamon and Spriggs were jointly charged in a 15-count indictment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under a plea agreement,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Prunty pled guilty to conspir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>acy to traffic in firearms in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(a)(1)(A) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 in exchange for dismissal of the remaining counts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The District Court accepted Prunty\u2019s guilty plea.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The pre-sentence report adopted stipulations in the plea agreement and recommended a four-level aggravating role enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a) for organizing or leading the conspiracy. At sentencing, the District Court adopted these findings and enhanced Prunty\u2019s sentence four levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a). The District Court specifically found Prunty organized or led a criminal activity involving five or more participants.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">The District Court imposed a forty-eight month prison sentence, three years of supervised release, a $1000 fine and a $100 special assessment. In a proceeding for collateral relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, the District Court reinstated Prunty\u2019s right to appeal <em>nunc pro tunc </em>because his prior attorney failed to comply with his request to appeal. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">Prunty contends the District Court erred by enhancing his sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> because the evidence was insufficient to prove he organized or led the criminal activity. We review the District Court\u2019s factual determinations for clear error. \u201cWe will reverse only if we are left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. We may not reverse if the district court\u2019s findings are plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety.\u201d <em>United States v. Barrie, </em>267 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2001) (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-15\">Prunty claims his admission that he participated in a conspiracy to obtain and transport firearms does not support the four-level enhancement. We disagree. Application Note 4 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 enumerates factors the sentencing court should consider in determining whether the defendant was an organizer or leader. Those factors include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-16\">the exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-17\">The evidence indicates that Prunty was an organizer or leader. He recruited at least two other participants (Dean and DeCarlos <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>Brown). He bankrolled Dean\u2019s purchase of the firearms and paid Dean for his participation. Prunty was personally involved in all aspects of the conspiracy\u2014 including sales, purchasing, shipping, and firearms delivery. This evidence was sufficient for the sentencing court to conclude Prunty organized and led a criminal offense involving five or more participants. <em>See United States v. Felton, </em>55 F.3d 861 (3d Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Ortiz, </em>878 F.2d 125 (3d Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b750-15\">. DeCarlos Brown pled guilty to conspiracy to engage in unlawful firearms trafficking.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b750-16\">. In the plea agreement the parties stipulated that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(7) provided a base offense level of 12. The offense level was increased by six, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(1)(F), because 50 or more firearms were involved: two levels were added, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4), because at least one of the firearms had an obliterated serial number; and the offense level was decreased by three under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) and (b)(2) because of prompt acceptance of responsibility and a timely guilty plea.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b751-10\">.
