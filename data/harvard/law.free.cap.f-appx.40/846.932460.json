Following his guilty plea, Eseno-wo was convicted for conspiracy to defraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (1994). The district court sentenced him to fourteen months\u2019 imprisonment, a thirty-six month term of supervised release, 250 hours of community service, a $100 special assessment, $50,450 in restitution, and a $50,000 fine. Esenowo did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">Shortly after his release from custody and the commencement of his term of supervised release, Esenowo\u2019s supervised release terms were modified and then revoked. The district sentenced him to eighteen months\u2019 imprisonment following the revocation. Esenowo did not object to the penalty range nor sentence imposed. Thereafter, Esenowo appealed his sentence, contending the district court erred in sentencing him to eighteen months\u2019 imprisonment when his written plea agreement recited a maximum term of twelve months incarceration upon revocation of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-11\">Because of the lack of objection in the district court, we review Esenowo\u2019s sentence imposed after the revocation of supervised release for plain error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). A revocation sentence of up to two years\u2019 imprisonment was authorized by 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (West 1999 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2001). Furthermore, the plea agreement explained the sentencing court was not bound by any sentence recommendation or agreement, and that even if a sentence up to the statutory maximum was imposed, Esenowo could not withdraw his guilty plea. Moreover, the term of imprisonment imposed for the criminal offense and the term imposed for revocation of supervised release did not exceed the statutory maximum term of imprisonment of sixty months. Consequently, we find the district court did not err in sentencing Eseno-wo to eighteen months\u2019 imprisonment following the revocation of his supervised release term.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-12\">Accordingly, we affirm the revocation of Esenowo\u2019s supervised release term and his eighteen-month sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
