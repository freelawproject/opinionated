Freitas chal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>lenges the district court\u2019s drug quantity finding and also claims ineffective assistance of counsel. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">The district court\u2019s drug quantity finding was not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Castro-Hemandez, </em>258 F.3d 1057, 1059 (9th Cir.2001) (stating that the district court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error), <em>cert. denied</em>, \u2014 , U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 1185, 152 L.Ed.2d 126 (2002). Freitas\u2019 admission that he had been dealing cocaine for approximately three years provided a date early enough to support the quantity determination made by the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We do not address Freitas\u2019 ineffective assistance claim, which is \u201cordinarily left for collateral habeas proceedings due to the lack of a sufficient evidentiary record as to \u2018what counsel did, why it was done, and what, if any, prejudice resulted.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v.
