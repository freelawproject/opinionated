Hutchinson was convicted on one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute 100 kilograms or more of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (1994).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Hutchinson asserts that the district court erred by denying his motion for judgment of acquittal because the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>was insufficient to convict him in that the government\u2019s witnesses lacked credibility. However, in evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence, this court does not review the credibility of the witnesses and assumes that the jury resolved all contradictions in the testimony in favor of the government. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>815 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942); <em>United States v. Romer, </em>148 F.3d 359, 364 (4th Cir.1998). Accordingly, we affirm Hutchinson\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b848-10\"><em> </em>The jury acquitted Hutchinson on one count of attempted possession with intent to distribute marijuana, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 846.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
