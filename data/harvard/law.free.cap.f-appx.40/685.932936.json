For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Inasmuch as we write only for the parties who are familiar with the background of this suit, we need not set forth the underlying facts or circumstances of this appeal. We have reviewed the thorough and thoughtful Memorandum which the district court filed on August 8, 2001. We believe the district court adequately explained its reasons for granting summary judgment, and we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment substantially for the reasons set forth in that thoughtful Memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">We do, however, note that at oral argument, counsel for Chatam, argued that it was not \u201cimmediately apparent\u201d that Bo-dum\u2019s use of the domain name, \u201cCHAM-BORD.COM,\u201d was related to the sale or offering of coffee makers (as allowed by the 1982 Consent Decree) as opposed to the sale of coffee or tea (as prohibited under the Consent Decree). However, it is uncontested that the unambiguous text of the Consent Decree allows Bodum to use the mark, \u201cChambord,\u201d \u201cin connection with the sale and offering for sale of coffee makers.\u201d The challenged use of the domain name here is clearly \u201cin connection with the sale ... of coffee makers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Although it can be argued that such a connection is not \u201cimmediately apparent\u201d on the face of the domain name, the language of the Consent Decree does not require it to be. The connection to coffee makers is, immediately apparent from the web pages linked to the domain name. That is consistent with the language that the parties drafted. Although it is certainly possible that Bodum could use the mark in connection with the sale of coffee makers in a manner that would violate the Consent Decree, we do not find any such inconsistency here. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to Bodum, Inc.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b704-7\">.
