We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2241, and we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s decision to deny a petition for habe-as corpus. <em>Bowen v. Hood, </em>202 F.3d 1211, 1218 (9th Cir.2000). We affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we do not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-14\">Parole revocation, unlike criminal prosecution, deprives an individual only of his or her \u201cconditional\u201d liberty. Nevertheless, because there is a liberty interest involved, <em>some </em>process is due under the due process clause of the Constitution. <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 482, 484-89, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972). Fassler complains that the Parole Commission\u2019s delay in holding a hearing violated his right to due process. To establish such a due process violation, a parolee must establish first that the Commission delayed in holding a hearing, <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 530, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972) (stating that the length of the delay is the \u201ctriggering mechanism\u201d), and, second, that the \u201ccommission\u2019s delay in holding a revocation hearing was both unreasonable <em>and </em>prejudicial.\u201d <em>Vargas v. U.S. Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>865 F.2d 191, 194 (9th Cir.1988) (emphasis added) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-15\">The Commission failed to hold a final revocation hearing within the 90 days contemplated by the statutes and regulations pertaining to parole. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4214; 28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 2.48, 2.49. Courts do not often find a due process violation absent a showing of prejudice to one\u2019s defense. <em>See Hopper v. U.S. Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>702 F.2d 842, 845 (9th Cir.1993); <em>see also Cowart v. Hargett, </em>16 F.3d 642, 647 (5th Cir.1994). Fassler is unable to show any prejudice to his defense. He states only that the delay \u201ccreated the possibility his defense would be prejudiced by loss of witnesses over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>time.\u201d This speculative statement, however, is unsupported by any further discussion or evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Fassler\u2019s reliance on <em>U.S. v. Solomon, </em>758 F.2d 1522 (9th Cir. 1985) <em>superseded on other grounds by Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm. Inc., </em>43 F.3d 1311 (9th Cir.1995), to show that he has suffered prejudice, is misplaced. That case concerned a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial, a right that implicates \u201cabsolute liberty.\u201d Moreover, although that case explained that prejudice to one\u2019s defense is not essential, in fact, the court went on to hold that the defendant\u2019s allegations of personal prejudice and disruption to his life were not significant enough to be a violation of due process in light of the relatively short delay of only six months. <em>Solomon, </em>753 F.2d at 1527.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Fassler\u2019s cursory allegations of anxiety and oppressive incarceration are also insufficient to demonstrate prejudice. His allegations of anxiety are insufficient because they are indistinguishable from that all other parolees\u2019 experience when arrested for alleged parole violations. <em>United States v. Mohawk, </em>20 F.3d 1480, 1486 (9th Cir.1994) (citations omitted) (requiring that petitioner show he experienced anxiety and concern greater than other prisoners). Additionally, the mere fact of his incarceration does not establish prejudice in light of this court\u2019s affirmance of the Commission\u2019s revocation of his parole in Case No. 00-16168. <em>See U.S. v. Tucker, </em>8 F.3d 673, 676 (9th Cir.1993) (incarceration not oppressive where appeal without merit).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">We further find that Fassler fails to provide any evidence demonstrating that his parole officer or the Commission acted in \u201cbad faith.\u201d The instances that he cites show, at most, negligence; however, negligence in fulfilling a duty is insufficient to show bad faith. <em>Villafuerte v. Stewart, </em>111 F.3d 616, 624 (9th Cir.1997). Thus, Fas-sler has not made the requisite showing that there has been a due process violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b398-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b399-7\">.
