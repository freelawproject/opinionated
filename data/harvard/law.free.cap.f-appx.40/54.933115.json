Adler, the representative payee of Kathy Adler. The modification was initiated by the other respondent, the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs of the United States Department of Labor (\u201cOWCP\u201d). For the following reasons, we AFFIRM the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-15\">On July 6, 1981, a miner named Bobbie Stobaugh filed a claim for black lung benefits. He fisted his wife, Gladys, and his disabled stepdaughter, Kathy Adler, as dependents. He had retired from mining the year before when he was diagnosed with lung cancer that required removal of his left lung. He died on July 28, 1985, while his claim was still pending, and Gladys pursued the claim. At the same time, she filed her own claim for survivor\u2019s benefits under the Act. The claims were consolidated, and were tried before Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) Kendrick on October 21, 1987. On August 16, 1988, ALJ Kendrick issued a decision and order denying benefits to Bobbie Stobaugh and to Gladys Stobaugh as a survivor. ALJ Kendrick also found, in dicta, that Kathy Adler did not qualify as a dependent for purposes of augmenting an award under the applicable regulations. In particular, ALJ Kendrick found that Kathy, who had been married for five months in 1980 \u2014 before Bobbie filed his claim \u2014 lost the status of dependent by virtue of her marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-16\">Gladys then filed a timely appeal to the Board, which, on July 30, 1990, remanded the case because ALJ Kendrick had failed to consider whether Bobbie might have been entitled to benefits under a section of the statute providing for a rebuttable presumption of entitlement under certain cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>cumstances. On remand, the case was transferred to ALJ Jansen, who issued a decision and order on June 27, 1991, awarding benefits on Bobbie\u2019s claim, augmented for one dependent, Gladys. Because benefits under the Act terminate the month before the month during which eligibility terminates, and because Bobbie died on June 28, 1985, he was entitled to benefits (augmented for Gladys) through May 30,1985. Neither party appealed this decision. On October 31, 1991, Gladys filed a motion with ALJ Jansen seeking survivor\u2019s benefits pursuant to a regulation creating an automatic entitlement, as a matter of law, for survivors of miners who filed claims prior to January 1, 1982. On November 22, 1991, the ALJ noted that the time for appeal or reconsideration had passed, but ordered the case to be returned to the district director for a consideration of modification.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">On March 16, 1992, the district director issued an order to show cause why the order should not be modified to reflect an automatic continuation of benefits for Gladys. On July 24, 1992, the district director issued a proposed order to this effect, and on September 23, 1993, a third ALJ, ALJ Morin, issued a decision and order granting the modification. ALJ Morin specifically held that Gladys\u2019s entitlement to survivor\u2019s benefits had arisen automatically as soon as ALJ Jansen found that Bobbie was entitled to benefits. On May 25, 1995, the Board affirmed ALJ Morin\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">On April 1, 1996, the district director issued an order to show cause why ALJ Morin\u2019s award should not be modified to provide augmented benefits, dating back to July 1981, to Kathy as a disabled adult child. The show cause order did not refer to ALJ Kendrick\u2019s 1988 order, which had found that Kathy did not qualify as a dependent of Bobbie for purposes of augmented benefit payments. Instead, the show cause order simply stated, \u201cMarriage is not an entitlement terminating event for a disabled child.\u201d J.A. at 140. Peabody requested a hearing, and on July 20, 1998, a fourth ALJ. ALJ O\u2019Neill, issued a decision and order modifying the award to provide augmented benefits for Kathy. He found that ALJ Kendrick\u2019s 1988 finding that Kathy\u2019s marriage terminated her dependency was based on a Third Circuit case that was distinguishable and, in any event, not binding; that the issue had been decided in favor of a finding of dependency in a 1989 Sixth Circuit case; and that Bobbie and Gladys had continually raised the issue of Kathy\u2019s dependency throughout the years of ongoing proceedings. Peabody appealed, and on February 4, 2000, the Board affirmed ALJ O\u2019Neill\u2019s decision. The Board denied a motion to reconsider its ruling on August 31, 2000, and Peabody appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">We must affirm the Board\u2019s decision if it is rational, is supported by substantial evidence, and is in accordance with law. <em>Wright v. Island Creek Coal Co., </em>824 F.2d 505, 507 (6th Cir.1987). However, we review questions of law <em>de novo. Peabody Coal Co. v. Greer, </em>62 F.3d 801 (6th Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">Peabody raises two issues on appeal: (1) that modification of the award to reflect Kathy\u2019s status as an augmentee was barred by the one-year limitation in 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 922; and (2) that even if timely, the modification was based on a change in law, not a mistake in fact or change in condition, and that such a basis for modification is not allowed by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">A. One-Year Time Limit</p>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">33 U.S.C. \u00a7 922 [also known as Section 22 of the Black Lung Benefits Act] states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>Upon his own initiative, or upon the application of any party in interest ... on the ground of a change in conditions or because of a mistake in a determination of fact by the deputy commissioner, the deputy commissioner may, at any time prior to one year after the date of the last payment of compensation, whether or not a compensation order has been issued, or at any time prior to one year after the rejection of a claim, review a compensation case ... in accordance with the procedure prescribed in respect of claims in section 919 of this title, and in accordance with this section issue a new compensation order which may terminate, continue, reinstate, increase, or decrease such compensation, or award compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">33 U.S.C. \u00a7 922. The DOL regulations implement the statute in similar words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADT\">Upon his or her own initiative, or upon the request of any party on grounds of a change in conditions or because of a mistake in a determination of fact, the deputy commissioner may, at any time before one year from the date of the last payment of benefits, or at any time before one year after the denial of a claim, reconsider the terms of an award or denial of benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.310(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Peabody argues that ALJ O\u2019Neill\u2019s decision constituted an improper modification of ALJ Kendrick\u2019s eight-year-old finding that Kathy\u2019s marriage was an entitlement-terminating event. Peabody relies primarily on <em>Metropolitan Stevedore Co. v. Rambo, </em>515 U.S. 291, 298-300, 115 S.Ct. 2144, 132 L.Ed.2d 226 (1995), which suggests that the one-year limitation period must be strictly construed. The limitation period, however, is only triggered by \u201cthe denial of a claim\u201d or by \u201cthe last payment of benefits.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.310(a). The case before ALJ Kendrick in 1988 involved two consolidated claims, that of Bobbie, who had recently died, and that of Gladys as a survivor, both of which were rejected. Gladys, however, filed a timely appeal on both claims, and on July 30, 1990, the Board remanded Bobbie\u2019s claim and affirmed the denial of Gladys\u2019s claim, correctly noting that denial of her entitlement could change if, on remand, Bobbie was awarded benefits. On June 27, 1991, ALJ Jansen, on remand, held that Bobbie was entitled to benefits, augmented for one dependent, Gladys.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">As the Board correctly noted in its May 25, 1995 opinion, Gladys\u2019s entitlement arose by operation of law upon issuance of this award to Bobbie. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.213. Because Gladys filed a timely appeal of the 1988 decision, and because her entitlement arose as a matter of law after the award to Bobbie on remand, no final \u201cdenial of a claim\u201d by Gladys was ever issued that would trigger the limitations period. Instead, the one-year period was triggered by \u201cthe last payment of benefits\u201d to Gladys. A surviving spouse\u2019s benefits are paid until the month before the month in which the surviving spouse either remarries or dies. <em>Id. </em>Because Gladys died on May 24, 1996, she was entitled to receive benefits through April, 1996. The district director issued its order to show cause why the award should not be amended to reflect Kathy\u2019s dependency on April 1, 1996 \u2014 well before the one-year limitations period expired and, in fact, even before the event that would trigger that period, that is, Gladys\u2019s death, took place. Modification was therefore not barred by the one-year limitation period.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">B. Mistake in a Determination of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">While the one-year time limit for seeking modification is strictly applied, the allowable grounds for modification have consistently been broadly construed by courts. <em>See Rambo, </em>515 U.S. at 298-99 (citing <em>Banks v. Chicago Grain Trimmers Ass\u2019n, </em>390 U.S. 459, 465, 88 S.Ct. 1140, 20 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>L.Ed.2d 30 (1968)). In this case, modification was based on the \u201cmistake in a determination of fact\u201d clause of \u00a7 922. Peabody argues that the only potential mistake in the previous orders, which awarded no benefits to Kathy, was the determination by ALJ Kendrick that marriage is an entitlement-terminating event. The district director, in the April 1, 1996 show cause order, reached exactly the opposite conclusion. Peabody therefore argues that the modification to reflect Kathy\u2019s dependency was based on a ruling that ALJ Kendrick had made an error of law in determining that marriage is an entitlement-terminating event. In other words, Peabody does not now contest the substantive conclusion that marriage is not an entitlement-terminating event;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> instead, Peabody argues that modification is not the proper procedure for correcting this error, which Peabody describes as a pure mistake of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.209 provides that a child is a dependent for purposes of augmenting the benefits of a miner or surviving spouse if the child (1) is unmarried; and (2) is either under 18 years old, or is disabled, or is a full-time student. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.209(a). In 1988, ALJ Kendrick interpreted the first of these requirements to exclude any child who had ever been married, even if the child was again unmarried at the time the miner or surviving spouse sought benefits. J.A. at 60. He relied on the Board\u2019s opinion in <em>Kidda v. OWCP, </em>7 BLR 1-202 (1984), <em>aff'd, </em>769 F.2d 165 (3d Cir.1985), in which the Board held, and the Third Circuit affirmed, that a disability has to be continuous to create an entitlement to augmented benefits. ALJ Kendrick applied this same reasoning to the first dependency requirement \u2014 that a child must be unmarried \u2014 and determined in dicta that because Kathy had not been continuously unmarried, she could not be considered a dependent. The district director\u2019s show cause order, on the other hand, stated that \u201c[mjarriage is not an entitlement terminating event for a disabled child,\u201d and this interpretation was adopted by ALJ O\u2019Neill and the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">In most contexts, this may look like a change in law, so that the modification in question would have been impermissibly based on a mistake of law rather than on a mistake of fact. As the respondents point out, however, black lung cases are simply an anomaly. As we have previously noted, \u201cthe distinction between \u2018law\u2019 and \u2018facts\u2019 is not as clear as [the employer] suggests, at least in black lung benefits cases.\u201d <em>Youghiogheny &amp; Ohio Coal Co. v. Milliken, </em>200 F.3d 942, 954 (6th Cir.1999). In <em>Milliken, </em>this Court held that a surviving spouse could appropriately use the modification procedure to correct the decision of an ALJ who, in denying her claim, had failed to apply the so-called \u201cwidow\u2019s presumption,\u201d which provides that eligible survivors are presumptively entitled to benefits if their spouse was a miner who died before a certain date and who had been employed as a coal miner for 25 years or more. <em>Milliken, 200 </em>F.3d at 948, 953-54 (citing 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c)(5); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 727.204). In explaining the blurred distinction between questions of fact and questions of law in black lung benefits cases, this Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-8\">[A]t least one court of appeals has referred to a black lung claimant\u2019s entitlement to benefits as \u201cthe ultimate fact.\u201d <em>Keating v. Director, OWCP, </em>71 F.3d 1118, 1122-23 (3d Cir.1995). <em>See also Betty B Coal Co. [v. OWCP, </em>194 F.3d 491, 497 (4th Cir.1999)] (\u201c[A]nymistake <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>of fact may be corrected, including the ultimate issue of benefits eligibility\u201d). <em>Compare Amax Coal Co. v. Franklin, </em>957 F.2d 355, 357-58 (7th Cir.1992) (noting that the question of whether a miner had black lung disease is not one of \u201cfact[] in the lay sense,\u201d but observing that the question is nevertheless treated as one of fact for the purposes of deciding whether a \u201cmistake in a determination of fact\u201d has been made).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 954.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Adler and the OWCP characterize the issue of Kathy\u2019s dependency as the \u201cultimate fact\u201d in this case. Since, under <em>Mil-liken, </em>\u201c[i]f a claimant merely alleges that the ultimate fact ... was wrongly decided, the [district director] may, if he chooses, accept this contention and modify the final order accordingly,\u201d <em>id., </em>the respondents argue that the modification at issue here was appropriate. The respondents also cite to <em>Amax Coal Co. v. Franklin, </em>957 F.2d 355 (7th Cir.1992), in which the Seventh Circuit noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj\">a finding of black lung disease is generated by a complex system of presumptions; it is not a straightforward medical judgment. It might better be classified as a \u201cmixed question of fact and law\u201d or an \u201cultimate fact\u201d rather than as a plain-vanilla fact. But for many legal purposes (appellate review, for example) such facts, though they are not fact in the lay sense but are instead the outcome of applying legal standards to facts, are treated like fact, ... and one of these purposes we think should be that of deciding whether a black lung case can be reopened.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 357-58 (citations omitted). By analogy, OWCP suggests that, just as a finding of black lung disease is based on a complex set of presumptions, a finding of dependency is also based on a number of subsidiary questions, such as what Kathy\u2019s relationship is to Bobbie and Gladys, whether Kathy is disabled under the applicable regulations, and whether Kathy is unmarried.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">The analogy is persuasive. This circuit and a number of others have viewed the power to modify an award because of a mistake in a determination of fact quite broadly. Under this precedent, a wide array of issues related to the ultimate determination whether to award benefits can be modified under section 22, as can so-called \u201cultimate facts.\u201d In this case, the subsidiary issue of whether Kathy was \u201cunmarried\u201d as required by the regulation fits comfortably within the unusually loose confines of this precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b84-5\">. Nor does Peabody contest ALJ O'Neill's finding that Kathy is disabled and has been since before she was 18 years old, as required under the regulations. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 725.221, 725.209(a)(2)(ii). The Board affirmed the ALJ\u2019s factual findings regarding Kathy's eligibility under these requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
