Whitlock was sentenced to fifteen months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court ordered the sentence to run consecutively with an undischarged state sentence. Whitlock\u2019s attorney filed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating there are no meritorious issues for appeal but raising as a potential issue the district court\u2019s failure to impose a term of imprisonment to run concurrently to the state sentence. Whit-lock was informed of her right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">We find the district court did not err by imposing a sentence to run consecutive to the state sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a) (1994); <em>United States v. Rogers, </em>897 F.2d 134, 137 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Whitlock\u2019s conviction and sentence. We require that counsel inform her client, in writing, of her right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
