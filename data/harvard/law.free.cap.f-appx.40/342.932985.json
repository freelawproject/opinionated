His conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal. <em>United States v. Shaddon, </em>105 F.3d 663 (8th Cir.1997) (unpublished). On collateral review, Mr. Shaddon\u2019s motion to vacate his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 was denied, and two additional motions, which were treated as successive motions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, were both also denied. On August 29, 2001, Mr. Shaddon, acting pro se, filed yet another motion, this one entitled, \u201cNunc Pro Tunc ... Decree for a Specific Performance ... as to the Corree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>tion for the Violation of Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(2).\u201d The District Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denied the motion, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The essence of Mr. Shaddon\u2019s argument is that the indictment under which he was convicted was constitutionally defective because it did not specify the type or quantity of methamphetamine to which he eventually pleaded guilty and for which he was sentenced. Even if we put aside questions of the propriety of this proceeding, for which no certification from this Court was sought, it is clear that this claim is without merit. Mr. Shaddon waived his right to trial and pleaded guilty to distributing between three and ten kilograms of d-methamphetamine. Appellant\u2019s Appendix 65 (plea -agreement). Mr. Shaddon also agreed that his offense had a base offense level of 34 under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>Although it is true that a guilty plea does not cure a constitutionally defective indictment, in this case the indictment was not defective.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">No constitutional, statutory, or case law requires that the indictment specify the amount or type of a particular drug. See, <em>e.g., United States v. Bradford, </em>246 F.3d 1107,1113 (8th Cir.2001) (\u201cIf an indictment or jury verdict fails to specify the quantity of drugs involved, sentencing is limited by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), which provides a statutory maximum penalty of twenty years....\u201d). Mr. Shaddon\u2019s fourteen-year sentence on the conspiracy to distribute charge was below the statutory maximum of twenty years for distribution of methamphetamine without regard to quantity or type. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). Thus, the District Court was correct in concluding that \u201cShaddon\u2019s indictment fairly set out the allegations against him and gave him adequate notice of the claims against which he had to defend.\u201d <em>Shaddon v. United States, </em>No. 95-3008-01/04-CR-S-C, slip op. at 3 (W.D.Mo. Nov. 1, 2001). There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">The petitioner places major reliance on <em>Ex parte Bain, </em>121 U.S. 1, 7 S.Ct. 781, 30 L.Ed. 849 (1887). The Supreme Court recently overruled this case. <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 1781,152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-12\">The decision of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b363-7\">. The Hon.
