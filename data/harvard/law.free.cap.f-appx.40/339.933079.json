Smith pleaded guilty to possessing cocaine base with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and he was sentenced to 135 months imprisonment and 5 years supervised release. He appeals the sentence imposed by the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, his counsel has filed a brief and moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and Smith has not filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Because Smith knowingly and intelligently waived his right to appeal his sentence as part of his plea agreement, we dismiss this appeal. <em>See United States v. Estrada-Bahena, </em>201 F.3d 1070, 1071 (8th Cir.2000) (per curiam) (enforcing appeal waiver and dismissing appeal in <em>Anders </em>case); <em>United States v. Greger, </em>98 F.3d 1080,1081-82 (8th Cir.1996) (appeal waiver was knowing and intelligent where it was included in plea agreement, it was discussed at change-of-plea hearing, court imposed sentence without objection from defendant, and court reviewed appeal waiver at sentencing).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Having found no nonfrivolous issues relating to Smith\u2019s conviction after reviewing the record independently pursuant to <em>Pen-son v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346,102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b359-7\">. The Honorable Gary A.
