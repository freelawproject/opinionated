The district court sentenced appellant to 228 months imprisonment and 5 years supervised release. For reversal, appellant argues the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-21\">Prior to sentencing, Quijada filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea, contending that his plea had not been voluntary because (1) statements made by the government at the plea hearing, and discovery materials provided to the defense, falsely indicated that the government possessed a tape-recording of Quijada making incriminating statements; (2) counsel should have challenged a search warrant that had been granted based on an affidavit containing false statements, including the existence of the tape-recording; (3) the discovery materials also contained statements attributed to Quijada that were illegally obtained through interrogation by his jailer and should have been suppressed; and (4) in violation of <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), the discovery did not contain a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>letter Quijada had written to the jailer in which he denied the statements. After a hearing, the district court denied the motion to withdraw the guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Quijada\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea, because he failed to show a fair and just reason to do so. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(e) (court may permit plea to be withdrawn before sentencing if defendant shows any fair and just reason); <em>United States v. Prior, </em>107 F.3d 654, 657 (8th Cir.) (standard of review; relevant factors in determining whether Rule 32(e) motion should be granted), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 824, 118 S.Ct. 84, 139 L.Ed.2d 41 (1997). The record does not support Quijada\u2019s contentions that he was falsely led to believe an incriminating tape-recording existed or that the government violated <em>Brady. </em>Further, counsel\u2019s failure to seek suppression of Quijada\u2019s custodial statements to the jailer does not provide a fair and just reason to allow Quijada to withdraw his guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Morales, </em>120 F.3d 744, 748 (8th Cir.1997) (defendant\u2019s miscalculation of strength of government\u2019s case does not provide fair and just reason for withdrawal of guilty plea). Rather, ineffective assistance claims generally should be presented in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding. <em>See United States v. Cain, </em>134 F.3d 1345,1352 (8th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-22\">. The Honorable Charles R. Wolle, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
