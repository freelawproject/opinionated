There are two actions pending in the district court. In the first, <em>Northrop Grumman Corp. v. TRW, Inc., </em>1:02-00400 (N.D.Ohio), Northrop sought a preliminary injunction against the application of Ohio\u2019s Control Share Acquisition Act, Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 1701.831, and Merger Moratorium Act, Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 1704.01, <em>et seq. </em>In the second action, <em>Posner v. TRW, Inc., </em>Case No. 1:02-CV-00418 (N.D.Ohio), shareholders of TRW assert that TRW\u2019s board of directors and officers breached fiduciary duties in resisting Northrop\u2019s .efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-12\">The <em>Posner </em>plaintiffs filed a motion in the <em>NoHhrop </em>case for leave to file an amicus brief in support of Northrop\u2019s motion for injunctive relief. The district court denied both Northrop\u2019s motion for an injunction and the <em>Posner </em>plaintiffs\u2019 motion for leave to file an amicus brief. Northrop appealed the denial of the injunction, and that appeal is pending in this court as No. 02-3446. The <em>Posner </em>plaintiffs have appealed the denial of their motion for leave to file the amicus brief, resulting in the instant appeal. In a prior order, the <em>Posner </em>appellants were requested to address this court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction. Their response is now before the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-14\">This court has appellate jurisdiction in appeals from final orders and decisions of the district court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. As the <em>Posner </em>appellants have noted, an order may be immediately appealable as a collateral order if it determines a right \u201cseparable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action, too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated.\u201d <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 546, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-15\">The appellants argue that the district court\u2019s denial of their motion for leave to file an amicus brief is an appealable <em>Cohen </em>order because it had the same practical effect as the denial of a motion to intervene under Fed.R.Civ.P. 24. The denial of a motion under Rule 24(a) to intervene as of right may be appealed as a collateral matter. <em>Stringfellow v. Concerned Neighbors in Action, </em>480 U.S. 370, 107 S.Ct. 1177, 94 L.Ed.2d 389 (1987). In the instant case, however, the appellants did not seek intervention but simply permission to file an amicus brief. The denial of such a request is not the equivalent of a denial of participation as a party in the case. Although an amicus and an intervenor could have some characteristics in common, the two are not interchangeable statuses. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Michigan, </em>940 F.2d 143, 164-66 (6th Cir.1991) (curtailing a party granted \u201clitigating amicus status\u201d to the traditional role of an amicus). Nor do we believe that the denial of leave to file a brief as an amicus presents a question \u201ctoo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>important to be denied review.\u201d If the <em>Posner </em>plaintiffs wish to seek intervention as parties in the <em>Northrop </em>case, they must make a motion for such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Accordingly, this appeal hereby is DISMISSED for lack of an appealable order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
