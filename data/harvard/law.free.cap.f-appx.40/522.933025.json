We have jurisdiction pursuant 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">Tidwell contends that the district court erred in its determination that he was a career criminal offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 because his prior California state conviction for grand theft under CaLPenal Code \u00a7 487.2 is not a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d As conceded by Tidwell, this argument is controlled by this court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Wofford, </em>122 F.3d 787, 793-94 (9th Cir.1997) (holding a conviction for grand theft under Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 487.2 is a violent felony since it \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d). <em>See also </em>\u00a7 4B1.2 (defining a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as an offense punishable by an imprisonment term exceeding one year, that \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of injury to another\u201d). Accordingly, we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b541-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
