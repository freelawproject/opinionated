Collins was sentenced principally to a total of 204 months\u2019 imprisonment and three years\u2019 supervised release. Collins claims that certain statements made by the government in summation denied him a fair trial. We disagree with Collins and affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-13\">This appeal arises out of certain comments made by an Assistant United States Attorney (\u201cAUSA\u201d) in his summation at Collins\u2019s trial. At trial, the government presented evidence that Collins entered Jaswinder Dogra\u2019s taxicab and, while Collins\u2019s accomplice Dorrand Mitchell stood nearby brandishing a shotgun, robbed Do-gra. On direct examination, Dogra identified Collins in court as one of the robbers. On defense\u2019s cross-examination of Dogra, Collins\u2019s attorney sought to cast doubt on the reliability of Dogra\u2019s in-court identification. Collins\u2019s attorney suggested that the identification might have been influenced by the suggestive circumstances in the courtroom, in particular Collins\u2019s placement in the courtroom and the fact that he was one of the only African-Americans there. Now claiming that he misunderstood the defense to be contending that Dogra made his in-court identification by simply picking out whoever was placed in front of him, the AUSA made the following comments in his summation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-14\">Any decent, honest person would know how important it is to be careful when you say you\u2019re sure. For someone to come in a courtroom and simply pick someone out because of where they are sitting, you would have to be a morally bankrupt, horrible person to do that. You would have to have no sense of right and wrong. There\u2019s absolutely no evidence whatsoever that Mr. Dogra is that sort of person, none whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"afj-dedup-0\">Collins did not object to these comments at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-15\">On appeal, Collins urges reversal of the judgment of conviction on the basis that the AUSA\u2019s comments caused him substantial prejudice and deprived him of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>fair trial. According to Collins, the AUSA\u2019s comments \u201cmisled the jury concerning its evaluation of the victim\u2019s in-court identification of [Collins] by falsely creating an inflammatory issue of morality,\u201d and \u201cthe effect of this false issue was to improperly attempt to vouch for the credibility of the victim when the victim\u2019s credibility was not in question, but rather his ability to make a reliable identification.\u201d Collins also claims that the AUSA\u2019s invocation of morality contradicted the district court\u2019s instructions concerning the evaluation of eyewitness testimony and had the effect of improperly shifting the burden of proof onto the defendant. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">This court has held that to warrant reversal, \u201cprosecutorial misconduct must cause the defendant substantial prejudice by so infecting the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u201d <em>United States v. Elias, </em>285 F.3d 183, 190 (2d Cir.2002) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In making this determination, the court looks to the severity of the misconduct, the measures taken to cure it, and the certainty of conviction absent the misconduct. <em>Id. </em>Where, as here, the defendant failed to timely object to a prosecutor\u2019s statement, \u201cthe statement will not be deemed a ground for reversal unless it amounts to a flagrant abuse.\u201d <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>22 F.3d 430, 437 (2d Cir.1994) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Here, Collins was not substantially prejudiced by the AUSA\u2019s comments because, even if we were to consider the comments improper, they did not amount to a \u201cflagrant abuse.\u201d Although the AUSA\u2019s comments might have had an inflammatory and distracting effect, the severity of any misconduct is mitigated because, limited as it was to a single part of the summation, it was \u201can aberration in an otherwise fair proceeding\u201d and did not involve the sort of repeated misconduct whose aggregate effect might cast doubt upon the integrity of the trial. <em>See Elias, </em>285 F.3d at 191. In fact, we do not find the AUSA\u2019s comments to be particularly offensive. Viewing the challenged comments in the context of the trial as a whole, we do not think that the AUSA intended to inflame the jury by making an issue of the victim\u2019s morality. Rather, the AUSA\u2019s comments seem to us to be a response to comments by the defense that, by alluding to the \u201csuggestiveness\u201d of the court\u2019s layout, might reasonably have been misunderstood as an attack on the integrity of the government\u2019s case. <em>Cf. Rivera, </em>22 F.3d at 438 (noting that the \u201cgovernment is allowed to respond to argument that impugns its integrity or the integrity of its case\u201d with \u201csuitable\u201d language). Moreover, Collins\u2019s claim that these comments had the effect of vouching for Dogra\u2019s credibility is unpersuasive. In claiming that Dogra was not the type of person to identify just anyone, the AUSA \u201cdid not suggest that he had special knowledge of facts not before the jury\u201d or offer his own opinion, but rather emphasized the evidence supporting Dogra\u2019s credibility. <em>See United States v. Perez, </em>144 F.3d 204, 210 (2d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Finally, our determination that Collins was not substantially prejudiced so as to be deprived of a fair trial is further bolstered by the overwhelming evidence of Collins\u2019s guilt presented by the government at trial. <em>See United States v. Modica, </em>663 F.2d 1173, 1181-82 (2d Cir.1981). In addition to Dogra\u2019s in-court identification of Collins, the evidence of Collins\u2019s guilt included Dogra\u2019s identification of Collins from a photo array as the robber shortly after the crime; the testimony of Collins\u2019s accomplice, Mitchell, detailing Collins\u2019s role in the robbery; the testimony of Mitchell\u2019s aunt, Tamara Speed, that Collins and Mitchell entered her house after the robbery and that Collins asked to change his clothes; and Collins\u2019s own in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>criminating statements made after his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">After considering Collins\u2019s other objections to the AUSA\u2019s comments, we find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
