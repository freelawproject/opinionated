Subsequently, the court granted Appellee\u2019s Motion for Clarification and amended its order to correct a clerical error involving the date Appellant\u2019s benefits should commence. Appellant challenges that order. We will vacate in part and remand because we find the agency reopened Appellant\u2019s first application.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">Appellant, Ann A. Kaszer, has twice filed for disability insurance benefits (SSDI) and supplemental security income (SSI) pursuant to Titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act, respectively. She first filed on or about December 1, 1993. The agency denied that application, and Kaszer did not request reconsideration. Kaszer filed a second set of applications on September 6, 1995 alleging an inability to work beginning June 9, 1992 due to obesity, diabetes mellitus, arthritis, chest pain, eye implants, poor vision, and depression. This application was denied initially and upon reconsideration. Kaszer requested and received a hearing before an ALJ who denied Kaszer\u2019s claim for benefits. She filed an appeal with the Appeals Council, but it denied review of her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Kaszer then commenced a civil action in the District Court. The court granted Kaszer\u2019s motion for summary judgment reversing the ALJ and issued an order on June 26, 2000 awarding benefits retroactive to July 2, 1992. The Commissioner subsequently filed a Motion for Clarification arguing that the applicable statutory and regulatory provisions do not permit the Commissioner to pay benefits to Kaszer back to July 2, 1992 because SSDI benefits may be paid only for the twelve months prior to filing an application and because there is no retroactivity for SSI benefits. Since Kaszer\u2019s second application was filed on September 6, 1995, the Commissioner contended she could not legally pay benefits retroactive to July 2, 1992, as the District Court had ordered. The District Court agreed. It vacated and amended its previous order, saying that it was a \u201cclerical error\u201d which can be corrected under Rule 60 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The court issued a new order on February 20, 2001 instructing the Commissioner to pay benefits to Kaszer \u201cconsistent with this opinion and the applicable statutes and regulations.\u201d Kaszer appeals from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">We review <em>de novo </em>the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, and we apply the same standard of review as did the District Court; that is, we must uphold the Commissioner\u2019s decision if there is substantial evidence on the record supporting it. <em>See Burnett v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>220 F.3d 112, 118 (3d Cir.2000); <em>Dixon v. Massanari, </em>270 F.3d 1171, 1176 (7th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">Kaszer challenges the District Court\u2019s modification of its June 26, 2000 order. She argues that if any modification of the District Court\u2019s order was appropriate, the order should have been amended to reflect an onset date of December 1, 1992, which is twelve months prior to the filing of Kaszer\u2019s first application which she contends was reopened during the administrative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">The applicable statutes and regulations provide that the Commissioner may pay SSDI benefits under Title II only for twelve months prior to the date a claimant files an application. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(b); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.621(a)(1)\u00ae. There is no retroactivity provision under Title XVI for SSI benefits. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382(c)(7); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.501. Therefore, even if the filing date of Kaszer\u2019s first application\u2014 December 1, 1993 \u2014 is used as the appropriate starting point, benefits could be awarded retroactive only to twelve months before then, which is December 1, 1992. But the District Court\u2019s initial order awarded benefits retroactive to July 2, 1992, which is even earlier than December 1, 1992, and thus must have been a clerical error. The District Court committed no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>error by amending its earlier opinion, but whether the District Court\u2019s amended order itself is correct has become the issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">The primary dispute here is about locating the appropriate starting point for computing Kaszer\u2019s SSDI benefits. Is Kaszer eligible for benefits back to December 1, 1992, which is twelve months before the filing of her first application, or is she only eligible for benefits back to September 6, 1994, which is twelve months before the filing of her second application? It is noteworthy that the District Court did not directly answer this question in its amended opinion. Rather than saying Kaszer is eligible for benefits as of a certain date, the court merely ordered \u201cthe granting of benefits consistent with this opinion and the applicable statutes and regulations.\u201d The parties have interpreted this as meaning that benefits are to be paid with reference to the filing date of Kaszer\u2019s second application.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Kaszer argues that the appropriate starting point is the filing of her first application and that she should be awarded SSDI benefits back to December 1, 1992. If the ALJ reopened Kaszer\u2019s first application, either explicitly or <em>de </em>facto, when she considered Kaszer\u2019s second application, then benefits should be determined by reference to the filing date of the first application. <em>See Purter v. Heckler, </em>771 F.2d 682, 693 (3d Cir.1985); <em>Coup v. Heckler, </em>834 F.2d 313, 317-18 (3d Cir.1987), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Gisbrecht v. Barnhart, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 1817, 152 L.Ed.2d 996 (2002). To determine the appropriate starting point for computing benefits, then, we must determine whether Kaszer\u2019s first application was reopened.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-11\">Before we consider Kaszer\u2019s arguments, however, we should address the Commissioner\u2019s contention that Kaszer cannot raise on appeal any arguments that her prior applications were <em>de facto </em>reopened or that \u201cgood cause\u201d existed to reopen her prior applications because Kaszer did not raise these arguments below. The Commissioner argues that it is \u201cabundantly clear\u201d that Kaszer did not raise these arguments below since the District Court\u2019s opinion makes no mention of Kaszer\u2019s first set of applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-12\">We think Kaszer has done enough to preserve the reopening issue. In footnote 1 of her Brief in Support of Summary Judgment, Kaszer states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-13\">The issue of re-opening this prior application was deferred since the entire claim was denied. In the event of a remand for payment or on the merits, we reserve the right to have this issue revisited for reconsideration by the Commissioner to establish good cause for re-opening as per 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.911 and any other applicable regulations that may apply.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-14\">Kaszer probably expected that if she won at summary judgment, the District Court would remand her case back to the Commissioner, and there she would argue that her first application had been reopened. That is not the course her case took, as her win at summary judgment resulted in an award of benefits by the District Court rather than a remand. Then, however, the District Court amended its order, and she brought this appeal before us. In any event, it is clear that Kaszer intended to reserve her right to argue reopening at some point.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-15\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-16\">Kaszer argues that her first application was reopened during the administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>process. A short review of the law surrounding reopening of Social Security claims is warranted to help understand her position.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">When a claimant files successive applications, res judicata may be invoked by the agency to avoid entertaining each subsequent request based on the same issues. <em>See Purter v. Heckler, </em>771 F.2d 682, 691 (3d Cir.1985). Res judicata applies if the agency has \u201cmade a previous determination or decision under this subpart about your rights on the same facts and on the same issue or issues, and this previous determination or decision has become final by either administrative or judicial action.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.957. However, the ALJ is not required to apply res judicata, and there are circumstances when a final determination may be reopened either upon the claimant\u2019s request or the agency\u2019s own initiative. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.988.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">Additionally, it is not necessary for the claimant to make a formal petition for reopening to occur. <em>Purter, </em>771 F.2d at 695. For example, we have found that a reopening occurred where the claimant called his petition a \u201cthird application\u201d rather than a \u201cpetition to reopen.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">Finally, a decision by the agency not to reopen a claim is not judicially reviewable. <em>See Califano v. Sanders, </em>430 U.S. 99, 97 S.Ct. 980, 51 L.Ed.2d 192 (1977); <em>Coup, </em>834 F.2d at 317. But \u201cwe will examine the record to determine whether or not a reopening has occurred.\u201d <em>Coup, </em>834 F.2d at 317. We will find a reopening, and thus a waiver of res judicata, \u201cwhere the administrative process does not address an earlier decision, but instead reviews the entire record in the new proceeding and reaches a decision on the merits.\u201d <em>Kane v. Heckler, </em>776 F.2d 1130 (3d Cir.1985). We may find after looking at the administrative record than the reopening has been either explicit or <em>defacto. Coup, </em>834 F.2d at 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">Kaszer argues there was a <em>de facto </em>reopening in her case which supports the District Court\u2019s initial award of benefits back to July 2, 1992, or, alternatively, supports an award back to December 1, 1992. Kaszer contends we can find a reopening by either of two paths:</p>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">First, she suggests a reopening under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.988(a). That regulation provides that a determination may be reopened \u201c[wjithin 12 months of the date of the notice of the initial determination, for any reason.\u201d Unfortunately for Kaszer this path is not available to her. Kaszer says that her second application \u201cwas filed within one year of <em>receipt </em>of the initial denial.\u201d (emphasis added). But the applicable regulation states that it is the \u201cdate of the notice,\u201d not the date of receipt, which is relevant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The denial of Kaszer\u2019s first claim is dated September 1, 1994. Her second application is dated September 6, 1995. Clearly, it was not filed \u201c[wjithin 12 months of the date of the notice of the initial determination,\u201d so this avenue has been foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-12\">Kaszer offers no authority, nor have we found any, suggesting that we should not read the regulation for what it says on its face. That is, the regulation allows re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>opening without cause \u201cwithin 12 months of the <em>date </em>of the notice.\u201d It does not say, \u201cwithin 12 months of <em>receipt </em>of the notice.\u201d In addition to there being no textual support nor case authority for Kaszer\u2019s position, reading the regulation as making the relevant date the notice date rather than the receipt date makes sense because this regulation is also a limitation upon the ability of the Secretary to reopen a determination without cause. The Secretary may reopen a decision within twelve months \u201cfor any reason.\u201d If the twelve month period began tolling on the date that the claimant <em>received </em>notice of the determination, the Secretary could not possibly know precisely when the twelve month period actually began to run. The more reasonable interpretation is that the twelve month period began to run when the notice was dated, a date which is easily discernable to both parties. Therefore, we find that Kaszer\u2019s first application cannot be reopened under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.988(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">The second way Kaszer suggests we can find that her initial determination has been reopened is via 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.988(b). That section allows a determination to be reopened within four years of the date of the notice for \u201cgood cause.\u201d \u201cGood cause\u201d is defined in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.989 and includes \u201cNew and material evidence is furnished.\u201d Kaszer\u2019s second application was filed within four years of the date of the notice of the initial determination, and she alleges the \u201cgood cause\u201d requirement has been met in that she submitted \u201cnew material information that was not part of the December 1, 1993 application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">There is some ambiguity in our caselaw over whether we must find there was \u201cgood cause\u201d to reopen an application before we can find a <em>de facto </em>reopening occurred. The agency may reopen a prior application only for \u201cgood cause,\u201d yet we have no jurisdiction to review an agency decision not to reopen. <em>See Califano v. Sanders, </em>430 U.S. 99, 97 S.Ct. 980, 51 L.Ed.2d 192 (1977); <em>Coup, </em>834 F.2d at 317. In a typical case where we find that a <em>de facto </em>reopening has occurred, the agency made no mention of the prior application, so it made no decision on whether or not to reopen it. We then look at the whole record and conclude that, even though the agency did not discuss the prior application, it essentially reconsidered the prior application in its consideration of the new application. The unanswered question is, do we have to find that the agency would have been able to reopen the application if it wanted to? That is, do we have to find that the agency had \u201cgood cause\u201d to reopen the application even though the agency ignored the reopening issue?</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">One of our cases suggests that the answer to that question is \u201cyes.\u201d In <em>Purter v. Heckler, </em>771 F.2d 682 (3d Cir.1985), a case where we found the Secretary had <em>de facto </em>reopened the claimant\u2019s prior applications, one of our findings was that \u201cwe find that there was \u2018good cause\u2019 for reopening his earlier claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 695. In stating our holding, we said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-9\">Since the Secretary reconsidered Purter\u2019s claims on the merits and because there was \u201cgood cause\u201d for reopening the earlier claims, we find that there was a <em>de facto </em>reopening of Purter\u2019s prior claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 696. This language makes it sound like we need to find two things to find a <em>de facto </em>reopening: (1) reconsideration of the claims on the merits, and (2) \u201cgood cause\u201d for reopening. There is no further discussion in <em>Purter </em>about whether a finding of \u201cgood cause\u201d was a necessary condition for us to find a <em>de facto </em>reopening, but our language seems to imply it.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>In contrast, our decision in <em>Coup v. Heckler </em>indicates that a finding of \u201cgood cause\u201d is not necessary. There we said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVJ\">A reopening, and thus a waiver of any claim of administrative res judicata, will be found \u201cwhere the administrative process does not address an earlier decision, but instead reviews the entire record in the new proceeding and reaches a decision on the merits ...\u201d <em>Kane v. Heckler, </em>776 F.2d 1130, 1132 (3d Cir. 1985). <em>See also Purter v. Heckler, </em>771 F.2d 682 (3d Cir.1985). <em>It is not our role to determine whether the Secretary had good cause for reopening, for in that respect his decision is not judicially reviewable. </em>Rather, we look at the administrative record to determine whether an explicit or a <em>de facto </em>reopening has occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-4\"><em>Coup, </em>834 F.2d at 317 (emphasis added). This language implies that we do not have to find \u201cgood cause\u201d as a condition of finding a <em>defacto </em>reopening. We think the language in <em>Coup </em>is clearer and more directly on point than our language in <em>Purter, </em>and we will follow <em>Coup </em>for purposes of this appeal. We do not have to find that the Secretary had \u201cgood cause\u201d before we can consider whether the Secretary <em>de fac-to </em>reopened Kaszer\u2019s prior application.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The final question is whether a reopening of Kaszer\u2019s first application occurred at the administrative level. In conducting our analysis,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-7\">we will examine the record to determine whether or not a reopening has occurred. A reopening, and thus a wavier of any claim of administrative res judica-ta, will be found \u201cwhere the administrative process does not address an earlier decision, but instead reviews the entire record in the new proceeding and reaches a decision on the merits ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-10\"><em>Coup, </em>834 F.2d at 317 (quoting <em>Kane v. Heckler, </em>776 F.2d 1130, 1132 (3d Cir. 1985)). Even if a prior determination was not explicitly reopened, we may find that a <em>defacto </em>reopening has occurred. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">There is an initial question here of whether we have jurisdiction to find a <em>de facto </em>reopening. The ALJ\u2019s opinion notes that Kaszer had previously filed applications for SSI and SSDI in 1993 and that they were both denied. But the ALJ found that \u201c[i]t is not necessary to consider the question of whether the unfavorable decision made with respect to the prior claim should be reopened and revised.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If the ALJ had explicitly decided not to reopen Kaszer\u2019s first application, and Kaszer argued on appeal that the ALJ\u2019s decision was wrong, then we would not have jurisdiction because we cannot review the propriety of the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>Califano v. Sanders, </em>430 U.S. 99, 97 S.Ct. 980, 51 L.Ed.2d 192 (1977); <em>Coup, </em>834 F.2d at 317. But Kaszer is not contesting the propriety of the ALJ\u2019s reopening decision on appeal. Instead, she is arguing that the ALJ actually reopened her prior application, despite any statements by the ALJ to the contrary. We do have jurisdiction to consider this claim because if the ALJ did in fact reopen the prior application and reach a decision on merits, then she made precisely the sort of agency decision which we may review pursuant to \u00a7 205(h) of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>This finding of jurisdiction is supported by our decision in <em>Coup v. Heckler </em>where we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-5\">A decision of the Secretary declining to reopen a claim is not judicially renewable. <em>Califano v. Sanders, </em>430 U.S. 99, 97 S.Ct. 980, 51 L.Ed.2d 192 (1977). This court has held, however, that we will examine the record to determine whether or not a reopening has occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-6\"><em>Coup, </em>834 F.2d at 317. The key word here is \u201chowever.\u201d We recognized in Coup that we cannot review the propriety of the Secretary\u2019s decision not to reopen a claim, but in the next sentence we said \u201chowever\u201d\u2014 meaning \u201cnotwithstanding that fact\u201d \u2014 we still have jurisdiction to consider whether a reopening has actually occurred. Thus, we may consider whether the ALJ <em>de facto </em>reopened Kaszer\u2019s first application.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">We are aware that in a series of unpublished and per curiam opinions, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has said that an \u201cexpress refusal to reopen normally precludes a claim of <em>de facto </em>reopening by the administrative law judge and is also not reviewable by this court,\u201d <em>Cook v. Cha-ter, </em>No. 95-7095, 85 F.3d 640 (table), 1996 WL 223711, at *2 n.2. (10th Cir. May 3, 1996), but we do not find these opinions persuasive. <em>See also Gilbert v. Chater, </em>No. 96-1405, 110 F.3d 73 (table), 1997 WL 158139 (10th Cir. Apr. 2, 1997); <em>Brown v. Sullivan, </em>912 F.2d 1194, 1196 (10th Cir. 1990) (per curiam). All of these cases rely upon a footnote in <em>Taylor v. Heckler, </em>738 F.2d 1112, 1115 n. 6 (10th Cir.1984), as well as the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Califano v. Sanders, </em>430 U.S. 99, 107-08, 97 S.Ct. 980, 51 L.Ed.2d 192 (1977), for support. The footnote in <em>Taylor </em>says, \u201cWhen the Social Security Administration refuses to reopen a claim for benefits, that decision is unreviewable.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>738 F.2d at 1115 n. 6 (emphasis supplied). This is merely a restatement of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Califano </em>that when the agency refuses to reopen a claim, federal courts do not have jurisdiction to consider the propriety of that decision. It is an entirely different thing to say, as does <em>Cook, </em>that an explicit refusal reopen precludes a federal court from possibly finding that a <em>de facto </em>reopening has occurred. Neither <em>Califano </em>nor <em>Taylor </em>supports this latter proposition, and we think the statements to the contrary in the unpublished opinions cited above are incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">Finally we get to the question of whether or not a <em>de facto </em>reopening actually occurred in this case. In one formulation of our test for a <em>defacto </em>reopening, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-10\">A reopening, and thus a waiver of any claim of administrative res judicata, will be found \u201cwhere the administrative process does not address an earlier decision, but instead reviews the entire record in the new proceeding and reaches a decision on the merits ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-11\"><em>Coup, </em>834 F.2d at 317 (quoting <em>Kane v. Heckler, </em>776 F.2d 1130, 1132 (3d Cir. 1985)). The first question, then, is whether the ALJ \u201caddressed\u201d the earlier decision. It is true that the ALJ mentioned the earlier decision, but we are not convinced that mere mentioning is what we had in mind in <em>Coup. </em>The ALJ said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b711-12\">It is not necessary to consider the question of whether the unfavorable decision made with respect to the prior claim should be reopened and revised.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-13\">[Tr. 13]. The ALJ did not say that she was using the prior adjudication for its res judicata effects or that she was only considering the second application for the time period following the first decision. We think that <em>Coup </em>requires that the ALJ \u201caddress\u201d the earlier decision <em>vis-a-vis </em>res judicata. The agency must address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>whether the prior adjudication will be used for its preclusive effect or whether it will be reopened. No such expression was made here, so we move on to the second part of the <em>Coup </em>test to see if the ALJ \u201creviewed] the entire record in the new proceeding and reache[d] a decision on the merits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">In the section of her opinion entitled \u201cEvaluation of the Evidence,\u201d the ALJ went through Kaszer\u2019s medical evaluations and other evidence and concluded that she was not entitled to benefits. Some of the evidence she considered was relevant to Kaszer\u2019s first application which was filed in December 1993. For example, she found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-5\">The objective medical evidence establishes that the claimant was diagnosed with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus in June 1993. She had been controlling her diabetic condition with oral medical prior to June 1993 (Exhibit 23).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">[Tr. 15]. Similarly, she found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-7\">Ms. Kaszer complained of being severely depressed in October 1993, but was unwilling to begin anti-depression treatment (Exhibit 31, page 23).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">Among the exhibits listed in the administrative record as \u201cExhibits in Connection with Current Application\u201d are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-9\">Exhibit 23: Hospital Records for admission on June 4, 1993 through discharge on June 10, 1993, from Medical Center of Beaver County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-10\">Exhibit 24: Medical Reports dated August 10, 1993, by Dr. Gary Harvanich, M.D.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-11\">Exhibit 26: Emergency Room Records dated September 7, 1993 and November 24, 1995, from The Medical Center of Beaver County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-12\">Exhibit 27: Medical Reports dated July 26,1994 and June 7,1996, by Dr. George R. Zambelli, Jr., M.D., for services provided November 30, 1992 to December 13,1995.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-14\">Exhibit 31: Medical Records covering the period December 1, 1992 to November 8, 1996, from The Family Practic [sic] Center.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-15\">[Tr. 2], We assume the ALJ utilized these exhibits in reaching her decision because she says she made her conclusions \u201c[a]fter careful consideration of all the evidence.\u201d [Tr. 13].</p>\n<p id=\"b712-16\">It is apparent that the ALJ considered evidence that was relevant to Kaszer\u2019s first application and based its decision on all of the evidence. The second application was filed on September 6, 1995, so benefits could only be awarded back to September 6, 1994. Yet the ALJ considered evidence of Kaszer\u2019s condition back in 1992 and 1993, a period for which Kaszer would not be entitled benefits under her second application. This is consistent with reconsidering Kaszer\u2019s first application, which was filed on December 1, 1993 and could award benefits back to December 1, 1992. The ALJ did not narrow the time period under consideration by using the decision on Kaszer\u2019s first application for its res judica-ta effects. Instead, the ALJ \u201creviewed] the entire record in the new proceeding and reaeh[ed] a decision on the merits,\u201d which is what we said in <em>Coup </em>would constitute a <em>de facto </em>reopening. 834 F.2d at 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-17\">We are aware that some courts of appeals have held that a \u201creview of [a claimant\u2019s] medical history does not amount to the reconsideration \u2018on the merits\u2019 necessary to constitute a <em>de facto </em>reopening of the earlier application\u201d because such a review is often necessary to determine whether the claimant was disabled within the twelve months prior to filing the second application. <em>Rohrich v. Bowen, </em>796 F.2d 1030, 1031 (8th Cir.1986); <em>Frustaglia v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>829 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>F.2d 192, 193 (1st Cir.1987) (per curiam); <em>Moore v. Chafer, </em>No. 95-35764, 97 F.3d 1460 (table), 1996 WL 498916 (9th Cir. Aug. 8, 1996) (unpublished); <em>Boone v. Ap-fel, </em>No. 98-7176, 189 F.3d 477 (table), 1999 WL 668253 (10th Cir. Aug. 26, 1999) (unpublished). We, too, have indicated in <em>dicta </em>that \u201cwhere the agency explicitly considered such earlier evidence [of a claimant\u2019s medical history] solely for the purpose of determining whether the claimant was disabled within the twelve months preceding the most recent application\u201d we will not on that basis alone find a <em>de facto </em>reopening. <em>Coup, </em>834 F.2d at 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">There is, admittedly, a fine line between considering a claimant\u2019s medical history solely for the purpose of establishing whether the claimant was disabled and actually reconsidering that evidence. The Commissioner argues that the agency made a proper inquiry into the additional evidence without reopening Kaszer\u2019s prior application. That same argument was advanced in <em>Young v. Bowen, </em>858 F.2d 951, 955-56 (4th Cir.1988), but there the court found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-6\">despite the protestations on appeal that the medical evidence was reviewed simply to determine whether there was \u201cgood cause\u201d to reopen appellant\u2019s previous applications, a careful reading of the decision reveals an implicit analysis of the nature of Young\u2019s disability in 1979 and 1980. Since the Secretary has attempted to support his decision in some part by weighing the full range of medical evidence, we are thus free to determine whether that decision is supported by substantial evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-7\"><em>Id. </em>Similarly, the ALJ here analyzed Kaszer\u2019s medical history and supported her decision by \u201ccareful consideration of all the evidence\u201d, [Tr. 13], such that her actions were sufficient to reopen Kaszer\u2019s first application de <em>facto. See also Crady v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>835 F.2d 617, 620 (6th Cir.1987) (finding a reopening where \u201c[t]he ALJ made an extensive analysis of the claimant\u2019s medical condition ... [for] a period as to which no benefits could have been awarded absent a reopening\u201d); <em>Lewis v. Apfel, </em>236 F.3d 503 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cRes judicata does not apply when an ALJ later considers \u2018on the merits\u2019 whether the claimant was disabled during an already-adjudicated period.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-10\">Accordingly, for the above reasons, we find the ALJ reopened Kaszer\u2019s first application <em>de facto. </em>We will vacate in part and remand to the District Court for a determination of the appropriate date for Kaszer\u2019s benefits to commence in light of this reopening.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b708-7\">. We note in this regard that \u00a7 404.988 is different from several other regulatory sections. For example, \u00a7\u00a7 404.909, 404.968, and 404.981 all refer to \"the date you receive notice,\u201d That term is defined at 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.901, which states: \"Date you receive notice means 5 days after the date of the notice, unless you show us that you did not receive it within the 5-day period.\u201d Significantly different from these sections, \u00a7 404.988 refers to \u201cthe date of the notice.\u201d This is not a defined term, and we will interpret it to mean what it literally says.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b710-8\">. The Commissioner states in her brief that ''[t]he agency maintains that the ALJ found no good cause to reopen plaintiff's 1993 applications,\u201d We think the ALJ's own statement that it was not necessary to even consider the question of reopening demonstrates the fallacy of the Commissioner\u2019s argument that the ALJ answered the reopeneing question and found no good cause to reopen.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
