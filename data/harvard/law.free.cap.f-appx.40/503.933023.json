We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. Nabalta\u2019s counsel has filed a motion to withdraw as counsel and a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), identifying one potential issue for review. Nabal-ta has not filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">Counsel contends that the court may have abused its discretion by not granting a further downward departure under \u00a7 5K1.1, based on Nabalta\u2019s substantial assistance to the government. This court however lacks jurisdiction to review the extent of the district court\u2019s downward departure. <em>See United States v. Vizcarra-Angulo, </em>904 F.2d 22, 23 (1990) (concluding that appellate court lacks jurisdiction to review the extent of a downward departure).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">Our independent review of the record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 83, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), discloses no further issues for review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b522-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
