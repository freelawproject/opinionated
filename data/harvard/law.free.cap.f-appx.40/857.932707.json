Lockhart petitions this court for a writ of mandamus directing the district court to rule on his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (1994) petition, asserting the district court has unreasonably delayed action on his petition. Mandamus is a drastic remedy to be used only in extraordinary circumstances, and Lockhart\u2019s petition does not establish extraordinary circumstances warranting mandamus relief. <em>Kerr v. United States Dist. Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976). Moreover, our review of the district court docket sheet discloses that there has been significant action in this case in the past six months and therefore, there has been no undue delay in the consideration of Lock-hart\u2019s petition. Accordingly, we deny Lockhart\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>fore the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
