Schwartz, Judge), dated September 6, 2001, which dismissed one of his breach of contract claims against Defendant Appel-lee NatWest Markets, PLC. NatWest has abandoned its appeal from another part of the judgement.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The parties\u2019 dispute on appeal centers on whether plaintiff was properly terminated for \u201ccause\u201d according to the terms of their employment agreement. The district court\u2019s factual findings have not been disputed on appeal, and we agree with both the district court\u2019s legal analysis and its application of the law to the facts. Therefore, for substantially the same reasons as set forth in the opinion below, we AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
