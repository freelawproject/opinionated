We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>TwoRivers v. Lewis, </em>174 F.3d 987, 991 (9th Cir.1999). All factual allegations in the complaint must be accepted as true, and all reasonable inferences drawn in favor of Brunette. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b614-16\">We hold that Brunette has alleged facts sufficient to state claims for trespass and invasion of privacy, and we reverse and remand those causes of action. We affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Brunette\u2019s other causes of action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b614-17\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b614-18\">I Trespass</p>\n<p id=\"b614-19\">Under California law, the Media is subject to trespass liability, irrespective of whether it caused harm, if it intentionally entered land in possession of another. <em>Miller v. Nat\u2019l Broad. Co., </em>187 Cal.App.3d 1463, 232 Cal.Rptr. 668, 677 (Cal.Ct.App. 1986). The First Amendment is not a license to trespass. <em>See Shulman v. Group W Prods. Inc., </em>18 Cal.4th 200, 74 Cal.Rptr.2d 843, 955 P.2d 469, 496 (Cal. 1998). However, a peaceable entry onto land with the consent of a person in lawful possession or control of the property is not actionable. <em>See </em>5 Witkin, Summary of California Law \u00a7 607 (9th ed.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-20\">The Media claims the invitation and consent of the Humane Society absolved its entry onto Brunette\u2019s ranch of the taint of trespass. However, the Humane Society entered Brunette\u2019s ranch pursuant to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>invalid search warrant and thus, never gained lawful control of the premises. It appears the Humane Society had no authority to enter the property itself, much less grant lawful entry to the Media.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Brunette alleged that the Media\u2019s presence was neither authorized by the warrant nor necessary to the Humane Society\u2019s investigation. Even if the Humane Society\u2019s presence was permissible, the Media performed no law enforcement related activity during the search. In fact, Brunette alleged that the Media\u2019s presence was superfluous, as the Humane Society photographed and videotaped the scene independently. If proven, Brunette\u2019s allegations may demonstrate that the Media\u2019s entry onto her ranch constituted a trespass. Consequently, we reverse and remand the district court\u2019s dismissal of this cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">II Invasion of Privacy</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Brunette alleged a sufficient privacy interest in her home and property as well as a reasonable expectation of privacy in those items. Nevertheless, the district court determined that the Media committed no serious or offensive invasion of privacy because it entered Brunette\u2019s ranch legally, upon receiving consent from the Humane Society. As discussed above, Brunette alleged that the Media, in fact, entered her ranch illegally. Any illegal entry would be sufficiently serious and offensive to state a claim for invasion of privacy. <em>See Dietemann v. Time, Inc., </em>449 F.2d 245, 247-49 (9th Cir.1971) (applying California law) (finding invasion of privacy where reporter entered and photographed the plaintiff at home without authorization). Thus, we reverse and remand the district court\u2019s dismissal of this cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">III Conspiracy</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">Finding no underlying trespass or invasion of privacy, the district court dismissed Brunette\u2019s conspiracy claim. In the alternative, the district court dismissed this claim because Brunette failed to allege with particularity any behavior in furtherance of a conspiracy. We agree with the district court\u2019s alternative rationale. Brunette did not sufficiently allege any particular actions by the Humane Society or the Media in furtherance of a conspiracy to violate her rights. Instead the record reflects that the Humane Society unilaterally invited the Media to accompany its search of Brunette\u2019s ranch, and that the Humane Society and the Media never discussed how the search would be performed. There was no agreement to violate Brunette\u2019s rights; thus her conspiracy cause of action fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">IV Conversion</p>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">The district court dismissed Brunette\u2019s claim that the Media converted images of her property through photography. Although a claim of conversion may exist even if the allegedly converted property is intangible, <em>see A &amp; M Records, Inc. v. Heilman, </em>75 Cal.App.3d 554, 142 Cal.Rptr. 390, 400 (Cal.Ct.App.1977), not all intangible property is the proper subject of conversion. Courts have traditionally refused to recognize conversion of intangible assets that are not merged with something tangible. <em>See Thrifty-Tel, Inc. v. Bezenek, </em>46 Cal.App.4th 1559, 54 Cal.Rptr.2d 468, 472 (Cal.Ct.App.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">A photographic image is not generally an intangible property right protected by a conversion claim, <em>see Ault v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., </em>860 F.2d 877, 883 (9th Cir. 1988), and Brunette points to no California case in which a photographic image was the subject of a conversion. The district court properly dismissed this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>V Infliction of Emotional Distress</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Brunette alleged that she suffered emotional distress due to the Media\u2019s trespass on her ranch. As a part of Brunette\u2019s trespass action, she may recover damages for \u201cdiscomfort and annoyance that would naturally ensue therefrom.\u201d <em>Kornoff v. Kingsburg Cotton Oil Co., 45 </em>Cal.2d 265, 288 P.2d 507, 511 (Cal.1955) (internal citations and quotations omitted). She may not, however, seek duplicative recovery under the guise of an action for emotional distress. <em>Billmeyer v. Plaza Bank of Commerce, </em>42 Cal.App.4th 1086, 50 Cal.Rptr.2d 119, 126 (Cal.Ct.App.1995) (finding no authority that a trespass gives rise to an action for emotional distress). Brunette also alleged infliction of emotional distress stemming from the Media\u2019s publication of the photographs taken during the search. Although emotional distress may be considered as damage in a properly stated defamation action, it cannot form the basis of an independent infliction of emotion distress action on the same facts. <em>See Grimes v. Carter, </em>241 Cal.App.2d 694, 50 Cal.Rptr. 808, 813 (Cal.Ct. App.1966). Therefore, the district court properly dismissed these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">VI Declaratory Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The district court denied Brunette\u2019s request for declaratory relief. Declaratory relief is appropriate when (1) the judgment will serve a useful purpose in clarifying and settling legal relations; and (2) when it will terminate and afford relief from uncertainty, insecurity, and controversy giving rise to the proceeding. <em>Bilbrey v. Brown, </em>738 F.2d 1462, 1470 (9th Cir.1984). The district court\u2019s decision to deny declaratory relief is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Wilton v. Seven Falls Co., 515 </em>U.S. 277, 289, 115 S.Ct. 2137, 132 L.Ed.2d 214 (1995). In this case, declaratory relief served no purpose beyond the remedies Brunette sought on her claims at law. Therefore, the district court properly denied Brunette\u2019s request for declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">VII Injunction</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">Finally, Brunette sought an injunction restraining the Media from further publication of the images taken during the objectionable search. In essence, Bru-' nette asked us to impose a prior restraint \u2014 a heavily disfavored remedy. <em>See CBS, Inc. v. Davis, </em>510 U.S. 1315, 1317, 114 S.Ct. 912, 127 L.Ed.2d 358 (1994). Because post-publication remedies will adequately compensate Brunette for any injury, <em>see id., </em>the district court properly denied Brunette\u2019s request for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">VIII Statute of Limitation</p>\n<p id=\"b616-11\">The district court found that Brunette alleged facts in her complaint which sufficed to toll the statute of limitations for one day. Cal.Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7 357. The Media takes no appeal from this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b616-13\">We reverse and remand Brunette\u2019s claims for trespass and invasion of privacy. The district court properly decided all other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-14\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b614-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b614-14\">. In a separate, published opinion filed simultaneously with this memorandum, we recount the facts of Brunette\u2019s case in some detail. There, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Brunette\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim against the Media for violation of her Fourth Amendment rights because she did not allege facts sufficient to demonstrate the Media was a state actor.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
