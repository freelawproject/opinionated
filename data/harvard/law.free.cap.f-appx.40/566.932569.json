McCullough appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. McCullough argues that his drug-related convictions should be vacated because he received constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we review de novo McCullough\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>United States v. McMullen, </em>98 F.3d 1155, 1157 (9th Cir.1996). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-23\">We need not decide whether McCullough\u2019s counsel\u2019s performance \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d, <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), because McCullough has not demonstrated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>prejudice as a result of counsel\u2019s performance. <em>Id. </em>at 697; <em>see also Anderson v. Calderon, </em>232 F.3d 1053, 1084 (9th Cir. 2000) (if defendant fails to show prejudice, court need not decide whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient). The evidence of McCullough\u2019s guilt was overwhelming, and it cannot be said \u201cthat there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694. The motion, files, and records of the case, including the trial judge\u2019s own observations of McCullough and other witnesses throughout trial, showed \u201cconclusively\u201d that McCullough was not entitled to relief. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>Shah v. United States, </em>878 F.2d 1156, 1160 (9th Cir.1989) (judge properly relied upon his own recollection of the proceedings in considering \u00a7 2255 motion). Thus, the court did not err in denying McCullough\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b584-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Cir.
