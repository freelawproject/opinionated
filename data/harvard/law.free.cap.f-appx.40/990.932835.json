After he challenged his sentence on appeal, we reversed, finding that a previous conviction was not a crime of violence and therefore did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>qualify him as a career offender. We ordered remand for resentencing without consideration of the career criminal enhancement. On remand, the district court imposed a sentence of 100 months. Jones filed a timely notice of appeal, but his attorney has moved to withdraw claiming that he cannot discern a nonfrivolous issue for appeal. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Jones has filed his response to his attorney\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief and after considering both filings, we grant the motion to withdraw and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">Counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief is adequate; therefore, we will not conduct an independent review of the record. Instead we limit our review to the potential issues counsel has identified. <em>See United States v. Tabb, </em>125 F.3d 583, 584 (7th Cir.1997). Having reviewed the <em>Anders </em>brief and Jones\u2019s response, we conclude that no non-frivolous argument could be raised in support of Jones\u2019s appeal. First, the district court did not commit error in imposing sentence on remand. The sentence was well within the guideline range and did not result from an incorrect application of the guidelines. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a); <em>see also United States v. Hardy, </em>101 F.3d 1210, 1212 (7th Cir.1996) (We lack jurisdiction over a defendant\u2019s appeal of his sentence unless it was imposed in violation of the law, as a result of an incorrect application of the guidelines, or is greater than the specified guideline range.). As to Jones\u2019s arguments challenging his conviction, the district court did not address these arguments on remand, but correctly confined her analysis to the issue remanded \u2014 calculation of his sentence without the career offender enhancement. <em>See United States v. Buckley, </em>251 F.3d 668, 669 (7th Cir.2001). In any event, no nonfrivolous argument could be made. The judge did not explain the elements of the offense to Jones but this omission is not fatal because Jones was informed of the nature of the offense. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>289 F.3d 1023, 1029 (7th Cir.2002); see <em>also </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1). Furthermore, that the monies taken in the robbery may not have been federally insured deposits is of no moment. What is clear is that to be charged and convicted of bank robbery under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113, Jones must have taken money from a bank whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Nothing in the statute requires that the government prove the stolen funds were FDIC insured deposits, although we have no doubt that they were.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-8\">Therefore, we GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and DISMISS Jones\u2019s appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
