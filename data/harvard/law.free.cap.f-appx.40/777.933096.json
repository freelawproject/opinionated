R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion challenging the district court\u2019s prior denial of his motion filed under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp. 2001), and the district court\u2019s order denying his Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion requesting reconsideration of the court\u2019s denial of the Rule 60(b) motion. We have reviewed the record and find that the Rule 60(b) motion, filed nearly four years after the denial of the underlying \u00a7 2255 motion, is untimely. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). We also find that Williams\u2019 Rule 59(e) motion does not establish an appropriate ground for reconsideration. <em>See Collison v. International Chem. Workers Union, Local 217, </em>34 F.3d 233, 236 (4th Cir.1994) <em>(quoting Hutchinson v. Staton, </em>994 F.2d 1076, 1081 (4th Cir.1993)). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral arguments because the facts and legal contentions in the materials before the court are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-25\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
