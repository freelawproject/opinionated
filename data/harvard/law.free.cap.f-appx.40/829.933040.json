He appeals, arguing that the United States lacked jurisdiction because of the pendency of a peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>tion for change of status to that of permanent resident. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">A reclassification petition filed pursuant to 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1154(a)(1)(A)\u00a9, 1255ffl(l)(B) (West 1999 &amp; Supp.2002) \u201cdoes not excuse any ground of inadmissibility under ... 8 U.S.C.[A.] \u00a7 1182(a) [West 1999 &amp; Supp.2002].\u201d 66 Fed.Reg. 16383 (Mar. 26, 2001). Here, Castaneda-Ordaz was statutorily inadmissible by virtue of a conviction for possession of marijuana, his illegal entry into this country, and his previously having been ordered deported on at least two occasions. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), 1182(a)(6)(A)\u00a9, 1182(a)(9)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">More importantly, Castaneda-Ordaz has identified, and we have found, no authority for the proposition that the pendency of a petition for change of status, even in a case where the alien is not inadmissible under \u00a7 1182(a), divests the United States of jurisdiction to bring criminal proceedings against the alien under 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1326.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">We accordingly affirm the conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
