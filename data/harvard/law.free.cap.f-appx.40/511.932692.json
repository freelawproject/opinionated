Nakata appeals the 70-month sentence imposed following his guilty-plea conviction for possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and use of a communication facility to facilitate same, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm in part, and we dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Nakata contends that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 is facially unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). This argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Buckland, </em>289 F.3d 558, 571 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 2314, 152 L.Ed.2d 1067 (2002) (as amended en banc) (upholding facial constitutionality of \u00a7 841). Nakata also argues that <em>Apprendi </em>requires knowledge of drug type and quantity are elements of his offense. We recently rejected this argument <em>United States v. Carranza, </em>289 F.3d 634, 644 (9th Cir.2002) (holding that <em>Apprendi </em>does not change the \u201clong established rule\u201d that the government need only show that the defendant knew he imported or possessed some controlled substance).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">Nakata next challenges his sentence imposed under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 843(b), to the extent that the sentence is determined by reference to \u00a7 841. This contention fails because \u00a7 841 is constitutional. Moreover, <em>Apprendi </em>is not implicated because Nakata\u2019s 70-month sentence was less than the statutory maximum of 168 months. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Guizar, </em>234 F.3d 483, 489 (9th Cir.) <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 984, 121 S.Ct. 1629, 149 L.Ed.2d 490 (2001)(finding no <em>Apprendi </em>error where defendant\u2019s sentence is less than the statutory maximum).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">Nakata also contends that the district court erred by declining to grant a downward departure based on his efforts to seek rehabilitation. Because, as Nakata concedes, the district court did not rest its decision on an erroneous belief that it lacked the authority to do so, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s discretionary decision. <em>United States v. Morales, </em>898 F.2d 99, 101-02 (9th Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-12\">AFFIRMED in part, DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b530-9\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
