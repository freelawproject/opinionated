The District Court assumed for purposes of deciding the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment that the INS was Deravin\u2019s \u201cemployer\u201d for purposes of the ADEA, and granted the motion on the grounds that he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">We agree that Deravin faded to exhaust his administrative remedies, for substantially the reasons stated by the District Court in its August 14, 2001, opinion. As the District Court noted, however, a plaintiff\u2019s failure to timely comply with administrative filing deadlines is subject to the doctrine of tolling. In particular, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.105(a)(2) provides that a federal employee\u2019s failure to meet the 45-day deadline for filing a complaint with an EEO counselor after a discriminatory incident occurs shall be extended \u201cwhen the individual shows that he or she was not notified of the time limits and was not otherwise aware of them.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">On appeal, Deravin argues that he was unaware of the requirement that he pursue administrative remedies within the INS. The question of whether Deravin was aware of his remedies, and thus of the necessity of filing a complaint within 45 days of his termination, is closely linked to the issue of whether Deravin was a federal employee. In light of Deravin\u2019s <em>pro se </em>status, we deem it appropriate to remand to the District Court for a determination of whether Deravin\u2019s employment at Wacken-hut rendered him a federal employee within the meaning of Title VII, and if so, whether his failure to file an EEO complaint within 45 days of his termination should be tolled on the basis that he was unaware of his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-12\">While a plaintiffs failure to exhaust administrative remedies should typically, absent a defendant\u2019s waiver, result in a dismissal without prejudice, <em>see Criales v. American Airlines, </em>105 F.3d 93, 95 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 906, 118 S.Ct. 264, 139 L.Ed.2d 190 (1997), here the interests of efficiency will be served by a remand to the District Court to determine Deravin\u2019s employment status, and assuming that question is resolved in Deravin\u2019s favor, whether his failure to timely comply with the applicable administrative filing deadlines is subject to tolling. <em>See Boos v. Runyon, </em>201 F.3d 178, 183-85 (2d Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the District Court is hereby VACATED and REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
