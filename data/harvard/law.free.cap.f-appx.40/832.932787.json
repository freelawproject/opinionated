Ray received a seventy-two month prison term. Ray\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Counsel states that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but raises two issues: (1) whether Ray waived his right to an appeal; and (2) whether the district court erred applying the sentencing guidelines. Ray has also filed a supplemental pro se brief raising additional issues. We dismiss the appeal based upon Ray\u2019s waiver of appellate rights contained in his plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-27\">A defendant whose plea agreement contains an express waiver of the right to appeal may not appeal his sentence unless the waiver is shown to be unknowing or involuntary. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>232 F.3d 399, 403 (4th Cir.2000); <em>see also United States v. Marin, </em>961 F.2d 493, 496 (4th Cir.1992). Ray\u2019s plea agreement con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>tained a waiver of appellate rights. Our review of the plea agreement and the record of the plea colloquy reveal that Ray\u2019s waiver was knowing and voluntary. The sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum penalty, and there is no evidence that it was based on a constitutionally impermissible factor. <em>Marin, </em>961 F.2d at 496. Moreover, the sentence was not imposed pursuant to proceedings conducted in violation of Ray\u2019s right to counsel. <em>United States v. Attar, </em>38 F.3d 727, 732-33 (4th Cir.1994). We therefore dismiss his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record and conclude that there are no meritorious issues for appeal. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
