Prior to sentencing, the government filed a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion based on his cooperation. The District Court determined that Berges Romero\u2019s mandatory minimum penalty was 120 months, and that his sentencing guidelines range was 121 to 151 months. The District Court departed downward and imposed a sentence of 108 months of imprisonment, ten years of supervised release, and a special assessment of $200.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-10\">The sole issue raised in this appeal is whether the District Court erred \u201cin failing to give [Berges Romero] sufficient credit for his cooperation.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 3.
