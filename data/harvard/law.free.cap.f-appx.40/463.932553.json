He challenges his thirty-seven month sentence because he did not receive a one-level decrease in his offense level for timely notifying authorities of his intention to plead guilty. He also claims that the district court erred in counting a criminal history point for a prior state adult diversionary conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-19\">We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-20\">I. <em>Timeliness of guilty plea</em></p>\n<p id=\"b482-21\">Vassar claims that because he pled guilty before trial, the district court should have given him an additional one-level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(b)(2), which provides for an additional one-level reduction if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-22\">the defendant has assisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct by ... <em>timely </em>notifying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty, thereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial and permitting the court to allocate its resources efficiently.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b)(2) (2000) (emphasis added). This court reviews for clear error a district court\u2019s decision to withhold the additional one-level adjustment. <em>United States v. Villasenor-Cesar, </em>114 F.3d 970, 973 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The district court rejected Vassar\u2019s request for the additional reduction, because he had pled guilty on the Friday before the Monday of trial; The government had subpoenaed and interviewed all its witnesses, made travel arrangements for those who were out of state, immunized and interviewed the defendant\u2019s underage surrogate son whom Vassar had involved in the fraud, prepared all its trial exhibits, briefs, voir dire questions, and jury instructions, and had the court staff set up the courtroom with the visual aids it intended to use to present evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">Vassar\u2019s guilty plea on the eve of trial was not timely. <em>See United States v. Kimple, </em>27 F.3d 1409, 1413 (9th Cir.1994) (\u201cIf the Government establishes that it prepared for trial in conjunction with responding to pretrial motions, denial of the reduction may be justified.... [A] defendant who pleads guilty on the eve of trial is not entitled to the [one-level] reduction....\u201d); <em>United States v. Hopper, </em>27 F.3d 378, 384-85 (9th Cir.1994) (notification of plea must come early enough before trial to allow government to avoid substantial preparation). The district court did not clearly err in denying the additional one-level reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">II. <em>Criminal history points</em></p>\n<p id=\"a6b-dedup-0\">The district court added one criminal history point to Vassar\u2019s criminal history category, counting a 1992 deferred misdemeanor conviction after Vassar pled guilty in Washington state court for Attempted Violation of Uniform Controlled Substance Act, Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 69.50.401. Vassar claims this was error, because his conviction was later dismissed under Washington law. We review de novo whether a prior conviction falls within the scope of the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Gross, </em>897 F.2d 414, 417 (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">Guidelines \u00a7 4A1.1 details how many points should be added to a defendant\u2019s criminal history score for each prior conviction. Subsection (c) states \u201cAdd 1 point for each prior sentence not counted in (a) or (b).\u201d Vassar does not dispute that his misdemeanor conviction falls under subsection (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">He points out, however, that \u00a7 4A1.2(j) provides that \u201cSentences for expunged convictions are not counted.... \u201d Vassar\u2019s conviction was dismissed in September 1992 under Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7 3.66.067, which then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-13\">After a conviction, the court may defer sentencing the defendant and place the defendant on probation and prescribe the conditions thereof, but in no case shall it extend for more than two years from the date of the conviction. During the time of the deferral, the court may, for good cause shown, permit a defendant to withdraw the plea of guilty and to enter a plea of not guilty, and the court may dismiss the charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-14\">The issue is whether Vassar\u2019s \u201cdismissed\u201d conviction under Washington law qualifies as an \u201cexpunged\u201d conviction under Guidelines \u00a7 4A1.2(j).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-15\">In examining whether convictions set aside under state statutes are expunged for the purpose of calculating criminal history under the Guidelines, we have focused on the language of the state statute. <em>See United States v. Hayden, </em>255 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>768, 773-74 (9th Cir.2001) (conviction not expunged for Guidelines criminal history purpose if statute allows for use of dismissed convictions in subsequent prosecutions); <em>United States v. Hidalgo, </em>932 F.2d 805, 807 (9th Cir.1991) (state statute providing that defendant would \u201cthereafter be released from all penalties and disabilities resulting from the offense or crime for which he or she was committed\u201d expunged conviction; Supreme Court has equated \u201cset aside\u201d with \u201cexpunged,\u201d and state courts considered the statute to \u201cexpunge\u201d a prior conviction); <em>see also United States v. Kammerdiener, </em>945 F.2d 300, 301 (9th Cir.1991) (\u201ca set aside is equivalent to an expungement for sentencing purposes\u201d in the context of the Federal Youth Corrections Act).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Section 3.66.067 does not use the words \u201cset aside.\u201d Instead, the statute provides that a defendant may \u201cwithdraw\u201d his guilty plea and the conviction may be \u201cdismissed,\u201d and does not explicitly state what effect a dismissed conviction would have on subsequent proceedings. The Washington Court of Appeals has stated that \u00a7 3.66.067 does not expunge a conviction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ3\">The State incorrectly asserts that a dismissal would result in the charge and conviction not being part of Mr. Gallaher\u2019s record. Nothing in RCW 3.66.067 implies that a conviction is automatically deleted or expunged from the criminal record after dismissal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-5\"><em>State v. Gallaher, </em>103 Wash.App. 842, 14 P.3d 875, 876 (Wash.Ct.App.2000). In Washington, \u201c[t]o destroy means to obliterate a court file ... in such a way as to make it permanently irretreavable.... A motion to expunge is treated as a motion to destroy. Courts may destroy a record only if expressly permitted by statute.\u201d <em>State v. Noel, </em>101 Wash.App. 623, 5 P.3d 747, 749 (Wash.Ct.App.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). These state cases hold that RCWA \u00a7 3.66.067 does not expunge a conviction under Washington law; while the conviction is dismissed, it remains on the criminal record. The district judge properly counted the state conviction in calculating Vassar\u2019s criminal history category.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b482-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
