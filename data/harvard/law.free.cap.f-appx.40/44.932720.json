This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-20\">On July 11, 1996, Melton entered a guilty plea to the charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Melton was sentenced to serve 188 months in prison. Melton\u2019s sentence was enhanced under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). This court affirmed Melton\u2019s sentence on June 25, 1998. <em>United States v. Melton, </em>No. 96-2411, 1998 WL 381347 (6th Cir. June 25, 1998) (unpub.). Melton\u2019s application for a writ of certiorari was subsequently denied by the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-21\">In his \u00a7 2241 petition, filed on April 30, 2001, Melton asserted the following three grounds for relief: 1) he is actually innocent of the \u00a7 922(g) conviction because the State of Michigan had restored his civil rights before he engaged in the act giving rise to his \u00a7 922(g) conviction; 2) the enhancement of his sentence under the ACCA was improper because his \u00a7 922(g) conviction is invalid; and 3) the enhancement of his sentence under the ACCA violates the Ex Post Facto Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-22\">Hemingway filed a response to the petition, to which Melton replied. A magistrate judge filed a report recommending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>denial of the petition. Over Melton\u2019s objections, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and denied Melton\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The district court subsequently denied a certificate of ap-pealability. However, a federal prisoner seeking relief under \u00a7 2241 is not required to get a certificate of appealability as a condition to obtaining review of the denial of his petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1); <em>Sugarman v. Pitzer, </em>170 F.3d 1145, 1146 (D.C.Cir.1999). Melton filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">We review de novo the denial of a \u00a7 2241 petition for a writ of habeas corpus. <em>United States v. Peterman, </em>249 F.3d 458, 461 (6th Cir.2001); <em>Charles v. Chandler, </em>180 F.3d 753, 755 (6th Cir.1999). Such review indicates that the district court properly denied Melton\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">A person who has been convicted of a crime in Michigan will generally have his civil rights restored upon completion of his sentence and any period of probation or parole. <em>See United States v. Campbell, </em>256 F.3d 381, 391 (6th Cir.2001); <em>Hampton v. United States, </em>191 F.3d 695, 699-702 (6th Cir.1999). However, even after a person\u2019s civil rights have been restored, Michigan law restricts a convicted person\u2019s right to possess firearms for a period of time after the sentence imposed for a particular crime has been served. Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7 750.224f (West Group 2001). \u201cA person convicted of a specified felony shall not possess, use, transport, sell, purchase, carry, ship, receive, or distribute a firearm in [Michigan] until\u201d the expiration of five years after all fines have been paid, all terms of imprisonment have been served, and all conditions of probation or parole have been successfully completed. Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7 750.224f(2)(a) (West Group 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">The felon in possession charge against Melton was predicated upon his 1986 Michigan conviction for felonious assault. The felonious assault conviction constitutes a specified felony as that term is defined by Michigan law. <em>See </em>Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7 750.224f(6)(i) (West Group 2001). Thus, Melton was subject to the provisions of \u00a7 750.224f(2), and was restricted from possessing a firearm for five years after he completed his sentence on March 7, 1993. <em>See </em>Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \u00a7 750.224f(2)(a) (West Group 2001). Because Melton possessed a firearm in November and December 1995, prior to the expiration of his five-year firearm restriction, he was subject to prosecution under \u00a7 922(g) for being a felon in possession of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">Contrary to Melton\u2019s contention, the provisions of \u00a7 750.224\u00cd apply to him because that statute became effective prior to the date on which he completed his sentence for felonious assault. Furthermore, subjecting Melton to the provisions of \u00a7 750.224f does not offend the Ex Post Facto Clause. <em>See Lynce v. Mathis, </em>519 U.S. 433, 441, 117 S.Ct. 891, 137 L.Ed.2d 63 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">In addition, the provisions of the ACCA do not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause inasmuch as the ACCA penalizes the prospective conduct of possession of a firearm by a person who has had three prior felony convictions. The provisions of \u00a7 924(e) do not attach new consequences to, or increase the punishment for, past acts. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
