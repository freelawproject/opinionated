He sought damages for being held past his maximum release date, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief. The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> dismissed his action without prejudice for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. Smith appeals. Having carefully reviewed the record, we conclude dismissal was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-18\">Smith\u2019s implicit request for release was not cognizable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, <em>see Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 500, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973), and he did not show he had exhausted state court remedies as required for habeas relief, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1)(A); <em>Carmichael v. White, </em>163 F.3d 1044, 1045 (8th Cir.1998). Smith\u2019s request for damages was barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), because success on his claim would imply the invalidity of his continued detention, and he offered no support for his assertion that his sentence had been expunged. Finally, Smith had no federal right to have specific release and parole eligibility dates calculated. <em>See Bagley v. Rogerson, </em>5 F.3d 325, 328 (8th Cir.1993) (violation of state law, without more, is not federal constitutional violation). Accordingly, we affirm. We deny Smith\u2019s pending motion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b325-16\">.
