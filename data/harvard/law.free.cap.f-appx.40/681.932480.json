The question before us is whether substantial evidence supports the conclusion that Mazurek had the residual functional capacity to perform the limited range of light, sedentary, and medium ex-ertional jobs identified by the Secretary\u2019s vocational expert. Because we are satisfied that it does, we will affirm. The factual and procedural history are both long and complicated, but since they are well known to the parties, and this opinion is styled not precedential, we will confine our discussion to our ratio decidendi. We note preliminarily that the injury that precipitated Mazurek\u2019s physical problems (to his knee and back) was orthopedic in character. However, the key physicians in this area \u2014 Dr. Mackell, Dr. Wiggins, and Dr. Boland \u2014 reported that Mazurek\u2019s knee and back did not render him disabled.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Rather, the condition that we must address on this appeal is Mazurek\u2019s emotional state.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-23\">Mazurek\u2019s strongest piece of evidence is a report from Joseph M. Rodolico, M.D., a psychiatrist who examined him on a num<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>ber of occasions and reported that Mazu-rek had \u201cmajor depression \u2014 single episode.\u201d Dr. Rodolico prescribed Elavil, an anti-depressant, and opined that Mazurek had a \u201cGlobal Assessment of Functioning score of fifty-four.\u201d However, in terms of seeking disability for a closed period of five years, Dr. Rodolico\u2019s report does not carry the day, especially since he never opined that Mazurek was disabled. Rather, Mazurek\u2019s case depended upon the many reports of a therapist named Tina Morelli, who consulted with Mazurek at the Lenape Valley Foundation. But Ms. Morelli is not a physician; her degree is a B.A. Moreover, having read Ms. Morelli\u2019s reports, we find them to be simply accounts of sessions at which Mazurek unburdened himself. The reports are remarkably free from diagnoses of any kind, and they surely do not amount to a cognizable opinion of total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">Ms. Morelli did fill out a form requesting Medical Assessment of Ability to do Work-related Activities (Mental). The form contains some expression of concern about Mazurek\u2019s vocational abilities:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeO\">Anthony\u2019s physical condition inhibits his ability to be a reliable person. His anxiety and depression hinder his ability to maintain work and seek employment. Anthony has experienced a variety of losses in his life that have led to low self-esteem and feelings of depression. Anthony wants to be a viable person but, finds this difficult to accomplish at this time due to his physical limitations and depression he has over the losses sustained in his life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-5\">Anthony is an intelligent person who is able to function independently, but, has difficulty concentrating and dealing with stresses due to preoccupation with physical pain which limits his abilities to make occupational adjustments at this time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">On the other hand, Ms. Morelli\u2019s assessment of Mazurek\u2019s specific work-related capacity is positive: Mazurek\u2019s ability to relate to co-workers, use judgment, interact with supervisors, and function independently is described as good. His ability to follow work rules, deal with the public and maintain attention/concentration is at least fair. Ms. Morelli rates as \u201cgood with no limitations\u201d Mazurek\u2019s ability to: understand, remember and carry out complex job instructions; understand, remember and carry out detailed, but not complex, job instructions; and understand, remember and carry out simple job instructions. Also, Ms. Morelli rates Mazurek\u2019s ability to: maintain personal appearance; behave in an emotionally stable manner; and relate predictably in social situations as \u201cun~ limited/very good.\u201d Finally, she finds that Mazurek was \u201ccapable of managing his benefits in his own best interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">This rendering does not support total disability. At best, it is equivocal. In contrast, Stephen J. Overcash, Ph.D., the Secretary\u2019s consulting clinical psychologist, reviewed the entire medical record and concluded that although Mazurek had an anxiety disorder, and a substance abuse disorder, they were not of disabling severity. This in itself is substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-11\">In our view, the Commissioner complied with the governing regulations when she evaluated the psychological evidence. Also, we are satisfied that the ALJ evaluated Mazurek\u2019s credibility in accordance with the regulations. As we read the record it contains substantial evidence that Mazurek\u2019s limitations could not reasonably produce the level of pain and limitations that he alleges.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There was also evidence: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>(1) that Mazurek often did not comply with his medication regime; (2) of secondary gain in the form of a pending lawsuit, which ultimately settled;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (3) that Ma-zurek misrepresented his social life, his claim of isolation and depression being countervailed by admissions of frequent sexual activity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While concluding that Mazurek was not able to return to his past relevant work, the Commissioner found that Mazurek\u2019s impairments did not prevent him from performing a significant number of sedentary and light jobs that existed in the national economy. In light of the evidence as we have summarized it, we think that conclusion to be supported by the record. We are also satisfied, not withstanding Mazurek\u2019s contention to the contrary, that the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical question to the expert included all of Mazurek\u2019s limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Under all these circumstances, the ALJ\u2019s crediting of the vocational expert that a significant number of jobs existed for an individual of Mazurek\u2019s age, education and prior work history \u2014 who was able to stand, walk and sit an acceptable measure, was not disabled even though he was unable to' understand, remember or carry out complex instructions \u2014 is supported by substantial evidence. The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b699-18\">. Moreover, the Commissioner's reviewing physicians, Oliver E. Finch, M.D. and E.W. McGrath, M.D., reported that mazurek retained the ability to do medium exertional work.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b700-6\">.

It is also noteworthy that Mazurek\u2019s activities of daily living were not significantly impaired.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
