Kolawole pled guilty to conspiracy to utter forged securities and to transport stolen property in interstate or foreign commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. The plea agreement <em>{inter alia) </em>stipulated: \u201cBecause the defendant was in the business of receiving and selling stolen property, namely, stolen checks, a 4-level increase in offense level is required pursuant to [U.S.S.G.] Section 2Bl.l(b)(4)(B).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">On appeal, Kolawole challenges [1] the district court\u2019s application of the so-called \u201cfencing\u201d enhancement, and [2] the court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>application of a three-level enhancement for Kolawole\u2019s managerial role, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-11\">1. We do not reach the merits of Kola-wole\u2019s challenge to the \u201cfencing\u201d enhancement; Kolawole stipulated to the plea agreement and makes no challenge to the binding nature of the stipulation, the plea agreement as a whole, or (more generally) his plea. \u201cIf a written plea agreement is unambiguous as a matter of law, and there is no suggestion of government overreaching of any kind, the agreement should be interpreted and enforced accordingly. Neither side should be able, any more than would be private contracting parties, unilaterally to renege or seek modification simply because of uninduced mistake or change of mind.\u201d <em>In re Altro, </em>180 F.3d 372, 377 (2d Cir.1999) (internal quotation marks, emphasis, and alterations omitted); <em>see also United States v. Difeaux, </em>163 F.3d 725, 728 (2d Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Alexander, </em>869 F.2d 91, 94 (2d Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-13\">2. As to the enhancement for Kola-wole\u2019s managerial role, \u00a7 3B1.1 provides that a three-level enhancement is applicable \u201c[i]f the defendant was a manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader) and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b). \u201c[A] defendant acts as a \u2018manager\u2019 or \u2018supervisor\u2019 of a criminal enterprise involving at least five participants if he exercises some control over others involved in the commission of the offense, or plays a significant role in the decision to recruit or to supervise lower-level participants.\u201d <em>Ellerby v. United States, </em>187 F.3d 257, 259 (2d Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks, citations, and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-14\">The district court found <em>{inter </em>alia) that Kolawole oversaw and recruited several accomplices throughout the United States and abroad, and otherwise helped to expand the conspiracy\u2019s operations. None of these findings were clearly erroneous, and it therefore was no abuse of discretion for the district court to conclude based on these findings that Kolawole merited the role enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
