Because we conclude that the evidence is sufficient to support the conviction, that the district court did not err in denying Johnson\u2019s motion to dismiss the jury venire on racial composition grounds, and that the district court did not err in sentencing Johnson in conformity with the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 100:1 ratio of crack to powder cocaine, we will AFFIRM the judgment of conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-15\">Statement of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b120-16\">The following testimony came out at the trial, though this is by no means the whole of the evidence that the jury could have reasonably construed against Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-17\">Alfonzo Johnson (\u201cAlfonzo\u201d) testified that in September of 1997 he and defendant Steve Johnson (\u201cJohnson\u201d) agreed via phone that Johnson (who lived in the Chicago area) would deliver six kilograms of cocaine base to a man named Kenta Moore (\u201cMoore\u201d), Moore\u2019s job being to pick up the drugs and take three kilograms to Alfonzo and three to someone else. Alfonzo and Moore lived in Muskegon, Michigan. These purchases continued once a month or once every other month, though no longer through Moore\u2019s agency; rather, Johnson would either drive to Muskegon or Alfonzo would drive to Chicago, and each time Johnson would sell Alfonzo three to five kilograms. In early 1998 and thereafter until December 1999 Alfonzo bought cocaine powder instead of crack from Johnson, making trips on the same schedule as before but buying between five and eight kilograms each trip.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-18\">Alfonzo and Johnson also worked with Muskegon residents Moore, Kareem Robertson (\u201cRobertson\u201d), Kelly Petty (\u201cPetty\u201d); some of Alfonzo\u2019s purchases from Johnson were made with money pooled with that of these other Muskegon residents, and Johnson\u2019s Muskegon deliveries of crack, and later cocaine, were for all of them. Telephone records introduced at trial revealed numerous calls exchanged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>among Johnson and the four Muskegon residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Moore testified that he had started buying with Alfonzo in 1997. Moore recalled the occasion in 1997 when he had traveled to Chicago at Alfonzo\u2019s bidding and had retrieved six or eight kilograms from a hotel room closet. Moore also reported that he knew that subsequent deliveries of cocaine he received from Alfonzo came from Johnson, because Alfonzo had told him so.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Petty testified that in July of 1997 he began purchasing cocaine through Alfonzo and Robertson; he had bought drugs from Johnson previously and knew that Alfonzo and Robertson were getting it from Johnson, and indeed sometimes he would talk with Johnson himself to describe the amount he wanted or to negotiate the price. Petty testified that Johnson would travel to Muskegon regularly and that on some of these occasions Petty would buy drugs directly from Johnson. In July of 1999 Petty began personally making trips to Chicago to buy directly from Johnson-traveling once a month and purchasing a kilogram each time. On the last of these buys Petty and his father, Alvin Bolden (\u201cBolden\u201d), drove to Chicago together, where they picked up a kilogram from Johnson. As Petty and Bolden were on their way back to Muskegon they were stopped by the police and arrested. Bol-den also testified about this trip, generally corroborating Petty\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">I. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">This court may reverse the jury\u2019s finding only if-resolving all reasonable inferences in favor of the government-we find that no rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>United States v. Beddow, </em>957 F.2d 1330, 1334 (6th Cir. 1992). \u201cThe essential elements of conspiracy under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 are (1) an agreement by two or more persons to violate the drug laws, and (2) knowledge of, intention to join, and participation in the conspiracy on the part of each conspirator.\u201d <em>United States v. Maliszewski, </em>161 F.3d 992,1006 (6th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">Johnson argues that the witnesses were not credible, noting that the most important witnesses were Alfonzo, Petty, and Bolden-all convicted drug dealers testifying pursuant to plea bargains. For example, he points out that Alfonzo\u2019s testimony about the time he sent Moore to pick up cocaine in Chicago differed in certain details from Moore\u2019s version of the events. He similarly attacks minor defects or ambiguities in the testimony of Petty and Bolden.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-12\">Johnson also argues that the evidence was insufficient because the government\u2019s case rested mostly on witness testimony, and the government failed to produce hard evidence such as \u201cfinancial records, drug notes, memoranda or codes typically found in a drug conspiracy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b121-13\">Nevertheless, \u201cattacks on witness credibility are simply challenges to the <em>quality </em>of the government\u2019s evidence and not to the sufficiency of the evidence,\u201d <em>United States v. Adamo, </em>742 F.2d 927, 935 (6th Cir.1984), and when assessing the sufficiency of the evidence, \u201cwe do not weigh the evidence, assess the credibility of the witnesses, or substitute our judgment for that of the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Wright, </em>16 F.3d 1429, 1440 (6th Cir.1994). We conclude that there was more than enough evidence for a reasonable jury to find Johnson guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>II. Racial Composition of the Jury Venire</p>\n<p id=\"A-\">During the voir dire process Johnson\u2019s counsel objected to the composition of the jury venire: he himself was African-American, yet only 3 out of the 31 members of the venire were African-American. He repeats this argument on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">We note at the outset, although the government does not appear to have objected on these grounds and the district court did not address the issue, that Johnson\u2019s challenge to the racial composition of the veni-re was untimely and therefore barred. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1867(a) and (e) (providing that in criminal cases, challenges to the venire must be made before jury voir dire begins or within seven days of the date the defendant discovered or, with due diligence could have discovered, whichever is earlier, substantial failure to comply with statutory requirements governing selection of jury, and providing further that \u00a7 1867 is the exclusive means by which a defendant may raise such a challenge); <em>see also United States v. Ovalle, </em>136 F.3d 1092, 1098 (6th Cir.1998) (holding that failure to comply precisely with the requirements of \u00a7 1867, including its time limitations, bars a challenge under the Jury Selection and Service Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1861, et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">In any event, we would affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to dismiss the venire. \u201cWhether a defendant has been denied his right to a jury selected from a fair cross-section of the community is a mixed question of law and fact, which we review <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Buchanan, </em>213 F.3d 302, 308 (6th Cir. 2000) (quoting <em>United States v. Allen, </em>160 F.3d 1096, 1101 (6th Cir.1998)). To show a prima facie violation of the fair-cross-section requirement in a venire, Johnson must establish three things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-6\">(1) that the group alleged to be excluded is a \u201cdistinctive\u201d group in the community; (2) that the representation of this group in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community; and (3) that this un-derrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury-selection process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 309-10 (quoting <em>Duren v. Missouri, </em>439 U.S. 357, 364, 99 S.Ct. 664, 58 L.Ed.2d 579 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">The district court in the present ease accurately cited this three-part test. The court noted that it was a given that African-Americans are a distinctive group within the community. Of the second element, the court observed that it was established in Buchanan-another case from the Grand Rapids jury wheel of the Western District of Michigan-that this area is composed of 4.58% African-Americans, 2.86% of whom are eligible for jury service. Since in <em>Buchanan </em>the court found no violation where 2 of 70 (2.8%) jurors were African American, the district court here concluded that 3 out of 31 (9.6%) surely was no violation. Regarding the third element, the court had the jury administrator testify; after discussing the random selection means used, she affirmed that neither she nor anyone on her staff systematically excluded any member of any race from the pool. Based on this, the district court concluded that there was no violation, and overruled the objection. We see no reason to disturb this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">III. The 100:1 Ratio of Cocaine to Crack</p>\n<p id=\"AMl\">At sentencing Johnson argued that the 100:1 sentencing disparity between cocaine and crack is unconstitutional, under the Eighth Amendment. But it is a settled issue in the Sixth Circuit that the disparity is not unconstitutional, and we have no authority to disturb this holding. <em>United States v. Washington, </em>127 F.3d 510, 517 (6th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
