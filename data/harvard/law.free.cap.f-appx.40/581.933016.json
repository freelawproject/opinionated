Thus, we need not decide whether an ALJ conducting a disability hearing has an affirmative duty to request medical source statements \u2014 a question not yet resolved in any of this circuit\u2019s published opinions. We only need to consider whether the Berselli report warrants a remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-16\">II. <em>The Berselli Report Does Not Warrant a Remand</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-17\">A. <em>Remand For an Award of Benefits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-18\"><em>Smolen v. Chater,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> Ramirez v. Shalala,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Lester v. Chater</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>do not support Harris\u2019s argument that we should remand for an award of benefits. We remanded directly for benefits awards in those cases because the ALJs had improperly discredited certain testimony, and when the testimony was credited, it was clear that benefits were due. Thus, there were no further issues or evidence to consider on remand.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Here, the ALJ did not improperly discredit any testimony,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and even taking the Berselli report into account, it is far from clear that Harris is due any benefits. Thus, we would at most remand only for the ALJ to consider the Berselli report, rather than invoking the \u201climited exception\u201d of remanding directly for a benefits award.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-19\">B. <em>Remand for Consideration of the Berselli Report</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-20\">A remand to the ALJ to consider the Berselli report is not warranted. We remand disability determinations for consideration of new evidence such as the Ber-selli report only if the new evidence \u201cis <em>material </em>and [ ] there is <em>good cause </em>for the failure to incorporate such evidence into the record in a prior proceeding.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>Berselli report is not material and Harris has not shown good cause for failing to present it sooner.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">1. <em>Materiality.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">New evidence meets the materiality requirement if it \u201cbear[s] directly and substantially on the matter in dispute\u201d and \u201cthere is a <em>reasonable possibility </em>that the new evidence would have changed the outcome\u201d in the administrative adjudication.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The new medical report does not meet the materiality requirement because there is little chance the report would have changed the outcome of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">The fact that the new medical report stated that Harris is \u201cdisabled\u201d is of no special significance and does not control the ALJ\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In addition, the Ber-selli report conflicted with an earlier report by Dr. Berselli \u2014 which had been before the ALJ \u2014 because the earlier report did not state or imply that Harris was disabled or that he would encounter any serious difficulties in working a standard eight-hour day. The Berselli report submitted to the Appeals Council was not informed by any new examinations, tests, data or other information, however. The second report was merely a re-charaeter-ization of the same information upon which the first report had been based. The ALJ would have therefore been entitled to weigh the inconsistent reports and credit one over the other.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Given that the second report was submitted after the ALJ\u2019s decision and therefore is less persuasive than the first,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> there is little chance that the second report would have changed the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-14\">2. <em>Good Cause.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-15\">Harris has not explained his failure to submit the Berselli report to the ALJ, nor is any explanation apparent from the record. Thus, Harris has not shown good cause for his failure to provide the ALJ with the Berselli report.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-16\">III. <em>The ALJ Properly Discredited Part of Harris\u2019s Testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b601-17\">Harris argues that the ALJ should not have discredited portions of Harris\u2019s testimony. However, substantial evidence<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> shows that Harris was malingering. An SSA employee noted on Harris\u2019s Disability Report form that, when applying for benefits, Harris \u201ccalled attention\u201d to his back pain and walked \u201cbent over and with a grim face\u201d while in the employee\u2019s direct view, but that these pain symptoms suddenly disappeared when he was leaving the office. The ALJ also noticed that Har<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>ris had no problems walking during the hearing and appeared comfortable, even though his own testimony suggested the picture of a person in \u201cmisery\u201d due to constant, moderate-to-severe pain over most of his body. Finally, Harris testified that he had endured back problems for his entire life, but at least one of his medical reports indicated that he had few or no health problems prior to 1995. Thus, there was substantial evidence of malingering, which provided a clear and convincing reason for doubting Harris\u2019s credibility.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">IV. <em>The ALJ Considered Psychological Factors Regarding Harris\u2019s Pain</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">The record includes a detailed psychological evaluation, and the ALJ expressly stated that he considered the \u201ccombination of [Harris\u2019s] physical and mental impairments as they affect his capacity to work.\u201d Harris is thus incorrect in asserting that the ALJ did not consider the possibility of a psychological basis for Harris\u2019s perception of pain. In addition, Harris has cited no evidence affirmatively indicating that his pain had a psychological basis. Thus, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s implicit conclusion that Harris\u2019s pain did not have a psychological basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">V. <em>The ALJ Did Not Reject Any of Dr. Feldman\u2019s Medical Opinions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">The \u201cPersonal\u201d section of Dr. Feldman\u2019s report appears to recite background information supplied by Harris. In contrast, the \u201cPhysical Examination\u201d and \u201cImpression\u201d sections contain Dr. Feldman\u2019s medical observations and conclusions. These sections make no reference to a disabling back problem. Thus, substantial evidence supports the conclusion that the \u201cdisabled\u201d statement in the \u201cPersonal\u201d section was an assertion Harris made to Dr. Feldman, not one of Dr. Feldman\u2019s medical opinions. Accordingly, the ALJ did not improperly reject any of Dr. Feldman\u2019s medical opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-11\">VI. <em>The ALJ Did Not Err in Formulating The Vocational Hypothetical</em></p>\n<p id=\"b602-12\">\u201c[T]he [vocational] hypothetical posed must include \u2018all of the claimant\u2019s functional limitations, both physical and mental\u2019 supported by the record.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201cThe functional limitations referred to in the PRTF are those of concentration, persistence and pace. The \u2018failure to complete tasks in a timely manner\u2019 is not a functional limitation but the end result of deficiencies of concentration, persistence or pace.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Accordingly, Harris\u2019s argument that the ALJ was required to include in the hypothetical a statement that Harris \u201coften fails to complete tasks in a timely manner\u201d lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b600-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b600-12\">. 80 F.3d 1273 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b600-13\">. 8 F.3d 1449 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b600-14\">. 81 F.3d 821 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b600-15\">. <em>See Smolen, </em>80 F.3d at 1292; <em>Ramirez, </em>8 F.3d at 1455; <em>Lester, </em>81 F.3d at 834.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b600-21\">.
