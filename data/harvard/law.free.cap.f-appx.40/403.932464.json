After the Supreme Court decided <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Padilla-Aragon moved to withdraw his guilty plea and to dismiss the indictment against him, contending that <em>Appren-di </em>renders \u00a7 960 unconstitutional. The district court denied both motions and sentenced Padilla-Aragon to twenty-seven months imprisonment and three years supervised release. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-19\">Padilla-Aragon argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea under Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(e), which provides: \u201cIf a motion to withdraw a plea of guilty or nolo contende-re is made before sentence is imposed, the court may permit the plea to be withdrawn if the defendant shows any fair and just reason.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Padilla-Aragon essentially contends that the district court should have granted his motion to withdraw his guilty plea since he entered his plea without knowledge of <em>Apprendi. Apprendi </em>holds that \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. This Court reviews a district court\u2019s denial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Na-gra, </em>147 F.3d 875, 880 (9th Cir.1998). A district court should freely allow a defendant to withdraw a guilty plea where, as here, he has done so before sentencing. <em>United States v. Ruiz, </em>257 F.3d 1030, 1032 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc) (withdrawal of guilty pleas made prior to sentencing should be granted for \u201cany fair and just reason\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\"><em>Apprendi </em>has no application to this case. The maximum sentence for importing fewer than fifty kilograms of marijuana is five years. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(4). The district court never exposed Padilla-Aragon to a term of imprisonment greater than five years. Accordingly, <em>Apprendi </em>is not implicated in this case. In any event, any potential <em>Apprendi </em>error would be harmless, because the district court sentenced Padilla-Aragon to twenty-seven months in prison and three years of supervised release-well below the permissible statutory maximum. Finally, we reject Padilla-Aragon\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960. <em>United States v. Mendozar-Paz, </em>286 F.3d 1104, 1109 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">We AFFIRM the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b422-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
