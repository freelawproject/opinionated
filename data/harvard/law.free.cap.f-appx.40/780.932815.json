Azeez petitions this court for a writ of mandamus to compel the district court to rule on his pending petition under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254 (West 1994 &amp; Supp. 2001). The granting of a writ of mandamus is a drastic remedy to be used in extraordinary circumstances. <em>In re Beard, </em>811 F.2d 818, 826 (4th Cir.1987). Azeez\u2019s petition does not set forth exceptional circumstances as would warrant the issuance of a writ of mandamus at this time. We note, however, that no significant action has been taken in the district court for over seven months.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-21\">Accordingly, we deny Azeez\u2019s mandamus petition without prejudice to his refiling it should the district court fail to act within a reasonable time. We grant Azeez\u2019s application to proceed on appeal in forma pau-peris and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-22\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
