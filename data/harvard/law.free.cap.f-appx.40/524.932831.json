We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-16\">Mercado-Rosales contends that the district court erred by relying on insufficient evidence of a prior aggravated felony (Assault with Intent to Commit Rape under Cal. Pen.Code \u00a7 220) to enhance his base offense level by sixteen levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-17\">We review de novo whether the aggravated felony provision of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) is applicable to a particular conviction for illegal re-entry after deportation under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). <em>United States v. Trinidad-Aquino, </em>259 F.3d 1140, 1142 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-18\">An enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) is proper where, as here, an unchallenged presentence report cites the statute defining the aggravated felony and that statute facially qualifies as an aggravated felony under federal sentencing law. <em>See United States v. Romero-Rendon, </em>220 F.3d 1159, 1162-65 (9th Cir. 2000); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) (defining aggravated felony as \u201ca crime of violence\u201d); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 (defining \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as an offense involving \u201cthe use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-19\">Mercado-Rosales also contends that the district court erroneously believed it lacked the discretion to depart downward based on a proposed amendment to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 that, if adopted, would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>have provided for graduated enhancements to a defendant\u2019s base offense level based on the seriousness of the prior aggravated felony. The record shows, however, that the district court considered whether or not to depart downward based on the seriousness of Mercado-Rosales\u2019s prior aggravated felony and concluded that a downward departure was unwarranted. We therefore lack jurisdiction to review its decision. <em>See United States v. Webster, </em>108 F.3d 1156, 1158 (9th Cir.1997) (recognizing that where district court recognizes and exercises its discretion to deny a downward departure, appellate court lacks jurisdiction to review decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Mercado-Rosales further contends that the decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), overruled <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) (holding that a prior aggravated felony conviction used to enhance a sentence for illegal reentry need not be charged in an indictment nor proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt). As Mercado-Rosales concedes, this Court has addressed and rejected this contention. <em>See United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411, 414 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>532 U.S. 966, 121 S.Ct. 1503, 149 L.Ed.2d 388 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">We take notice of the fact that the district court\u2019s judgment also references 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b), which does not define a separate crime. <em>See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>United States v. Alviso, </em>152 F.3d 1195, 1199 (9th Cir.1998). We therefore affirm the judgment, but remand with directions to correct it by striking the reference to section 1326(b), so that the judgment will unambiguously reflect that Mercado-Rosales was convicted of only one punishable offense pursuant to section 1326(a). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106; <em>United States v. Rivera-Sanchez, </em>222 F.3d 1057, 1062 (9th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">AFFIRMED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b543-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
