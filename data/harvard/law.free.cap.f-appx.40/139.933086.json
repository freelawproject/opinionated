We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-24\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b165-25\">Pursuant to a written plea agreement, Houston entered a guilty plea to attempting to possess with intent to distribute marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Thereafter, Houston filed a motion for specific performance of the plea agreement, asserting that the government breached the agreement by failing to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for a downward departure. Relying on the language, \u201cthe Government will file the motion if the defendant complies with the requirements of cooperation discussed in paragraph 5,\u201d Houston asserted that he fully complied with the plea agreement\u2019s cooperation re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>quirements and therefore the government was obligated to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for substantial assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">The district court overruled the motion. First, it found that Houston failed to provide substantial assistance. Second, it assumed that: (1) Houston\u2019s mere cooperation, as opposed to substantial assistance, triggered the government\u2019s obligation to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion; (2) Houston cooperated with the government as required by the agreement; and (3) the government breached the agreement by fading to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. Nevertheless, it concluded that requiring the government to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion would be futile, given its initial ruling that Houston did not provide substantial assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Before sentencing, the district court offered Houston the opportunity to move to withdraw his guilty plea. Houston declined.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Because plea agreements are contractual in nature, we apply traditional rules of contract law in interpreting and enforcing them. <em>United States v. Lukse, </em>286 F.3d 906, 909 (6th Cir.2002). The district court\u2019s factual findings regarding the content of a plea agreement are reviewed for clear error. <em>Id. </em>Whether the government\u2019s conduct violated the agreement is a question of law reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Wells, </em>211 F.3d 988, 995 (6th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">Section 5K1.1 of the sentencing guidelines authorizes a sentencing court to depart from the sentencing guidelines upon the government\u2019s motion stating that \u201cthe defendant has provided substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense.\u201d A district court may depart under \u00a7 5K1.1 only upon a motion from the government. <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-13\">\u201cIn many plea agreements, the government refers to the possibility of a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion but ultimately reserves unilateral discretion to determine whether the motion is appropriate.\u201d <em>Lukse, </em>286 F.3d at 909. \u201cHowever, in order to induce a defendant to enter a plea agreement, the government may bargain away its discretion and simply promise to make the substantial assistance motion.\u201d <em>United States v. Benjamin, </em>138 F.3d 1069, 1073-74 (6th Cir.1998). In such a case, the government is obligated to make a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion unless the defendant breaches the plea agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 1074.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-14\">Houston contends that the government bargained away its discretion to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, citing the following language from the plea agreement: \u201cthe Government <em>will </em>file the motion if the defendant complies with the requirements of cooperation discussed in paragraph 5.\u201d In <em>Benjamin, </em>we held that \u201c[t]he use of \u2018will\u2019 indicates that the parties did not intend that the government retain its discretion\u201d and therefore the government was obligated to make a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion unless the defendant breached the plea agreement. <em>Benjamin, </em>138 F.3d at 1074.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-15\">Unlike the plea agreement in <em>Benjamin, </em>the plea agreement here contains language reserving the government\u2019s discretion to make a motion for substantial assistance in addition to the nondiseretionary language quoted above.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The use of both discretionary and nondiseretionary language creates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>an ambiguity which must be construed against the government. <em>See United States v. Randolph, </em>280 F.3d 243, 248 (6th Cir.2000). Accordingly, construing the plea agreement against the government, the government did <em>not </em>reserve discretion to make a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion and its obligation to file a motion was triggered unless Houston breached the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Houston next argues that the district court applied the wrong standard in determining whether he fulfilled his obligations under the plea agreement. Asserting that the plea agreement merely required that he \u201cfully cooperate\u201d with the government to trigger the government\u2019s obligation to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, Houston contends that the district court read the agreement to require that he \u201csubstantially assist\u201d the government instead of looking to his contractual duty to \u201cfully cooperate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Au\">\u201cSubstantial assistance is directed to the investigation and prosecution of criminal activities by persons other than the defendant....\u201d USSG \u00a7 5K1.1 cmt. (n.2). This court has recognized that \u201c[t]he difference between substantial assistance and full cooperation is not merely semantic\u201d and that \u201c[a] defendant might fully cooperate with the government yet fail to provide information that substantially assists it.\u201d <em>Wells, </em>211 F.3d at 996; <em>see also United States v. Maduka, </em>104 F.3d 891, 894-95 (6th Cir.1997) (making a distinction between providing substantial assistance and providing all the information that a defendant possesses). The district court here agreed with Houston that the plea agreement spoke in terms of \u201ccooperation\u201d rather than \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d and assumed that the plea agreement required only his \u201ccooperation\u201d to trigger the government\u2019s obligation to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion and that he cooperated with the government to the extent required by the plea agreement. Therefore, the district court applied the proper standard \u2014 \u201cfull cooperation\u201d as opposed to \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d \u2014 in determining whether Houston fulfilled his obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">The district court assumed, arguendo, that the government breached the plea agreement by failing to make a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion for substantial assistance and determined that the breach could not have prejudiced Houston under the circumstances. Even if Houston\u2019s mere cooperation triggered the government\u2019s obligation to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) and USSG \u00a7 5K1.1 mandate that a defendant must provide \u201csubstantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense\u201d before a court has the authority to grant such a motion. <em>See Maduka, </em>104 F.3d at 894-95 (stating that \u00a7 5K1.1 requires a defendant to provide \u201csubstantial assistance in fact,\u201d as opposed to providing the information that the defendant possesses, \u201cregardless of whether it actually proves helpful to the government\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">Although the district court did not order the government to make a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, it considered whether Houston provided substantial assistance and concluded that he was not entitled to a downward departure. Accordingly, it did not err in denying Houston\u2019s motion for specific performance of the plea agreement given its ruling that he failed to provide substantial assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b166-10\">. For example, the plea agreement provides that \"[i]f the defendant provides full, corn-p\u00edete, truthful, and substantial cooperation to the Government, the Government reserving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>the right to make the decision on the nature and extent of the defendant\u2019s cooperation, then the Government agrees to move for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1\u201d and that \u201cthe Government does not promise, solely by the terms of this agreement, to file a Section 5K1.1.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
