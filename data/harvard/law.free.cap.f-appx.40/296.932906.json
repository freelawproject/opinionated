Thus, the appeal is submitted on the briefs and the record. <em>See </em>Fed.

The district court dismissed the claims against Conn on the basis of sovereign and judicial immunity, entered what purported to be a final judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b), and Scott appeals. Because the district court has not entered a proper Rule 54(b) partial final judgment, we conclude that the district court\u2019s ruling is not a \u201cfinal decision\u201d and therefore is not appealable. Accordingly, we must dismiss Scott\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-15\">Federal appellate jurisdiction extends only to \u201cfinal decisions\u201d of the district courts. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. A final decision is one that disposes of all claims against all parties, or in the case of a partial dismissal, where the district court has made an \u201cexpress determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Ruiz v. Blentech Corp., </em>89 F.3d 320, 323 (7th Cir.1996). Here the district court\u2019s order disposed only of Scott\u2019s claims against Conn, and his claims against other defendants remain pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-16\">The district court has not yet issued a proper Rule 54(b) partial final judgment for its dismissal of Scott\u2019s claims against Conn. We have held that both the \u201cexpress determination\u201d and the \u201cexpress direction\u201d are essential to appellate jurisdiction. <em>Constr. Indus. Ret. Fund of Rockford v. Kasper Trucking, Inc., </em>10 F.3d 465, 467 (7th Cir.1993); <em>Auriemma v. City of Chicago, </em>906 F.2d 312, 313 (7th Cir.1990). Although the district court has met the second part of the test by expressly directing entry of judgment, Rule 54(b) requires that the district court \u201cexpress[ly] deter-min[e]\u201d that there is \u201cno just reason for delay.\u201d We have insisted that district courts state this finding when certifying a judgment for immediate appeal under Rule 54(b). <em>See Granack v. Continental Cas. Co., </em>977 F.2d 1143, 1144-45 (7th Cir.1992) (\u201cBy definition, an express determination cannot be made implicitly\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-17\">The district court\u2019s judgment did not determine that there was no just reason for delay, nor did it provide a reasoned analysis of the factors underlying its grant of Rule 54(b) certification. Instead, the court\u2019s opinion contains the statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>\u201cConn notes that the plaintiffs claims against other defendants remain for adjudication and thus unless final judgment is entered in her favor, she will be subject to the possibility of appeal unless all claims are brought to a conclusion.\u201d If this statement were sufficient, every judgment that partially resolves a case but leaves other parties in the litigation would be entitled to a Rule 54(b) certification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Conn concedes that the district court\u2019s judgment did not explicitly comply with the requirements of Rule 54(b), but argues that the court\u2019s intent is nonetheless manifest and obvious. We have held, however, that absent an express determination of \u201cno just reason for delay,\u201d the court\u2019s intention is \u201cirrelevant.\u201d <em>Willhelm v. Eastern Airlines, Inc., </em>927 F.2d 971, 978 (7th Cir.1991). While it may be possible to reconstruct the court\u2019s reasoning by examining other parts of the record, that is not our role. The district court remains free to enter a proper Rule 54(b) judgment with respect to Scott\u2019s claims against Conn, which would then confer jurisdiction upon this court to assess the merits of Scott\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
