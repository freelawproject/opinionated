Bower appeals, but his counsel, unable to identify a non-frivolous ground for appeal, has moved to withdraw. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). We invited Bower to respond to counsel\u2019s motion, <em>see </em>Cir. R. 51(b), but he declined. Because counsel\u2019s brief is facially adequate, we limit our review of the record to the potential issues he discusses. <em>United States v. Tabb, </em>125 F.3d 583, 584 (7th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-13\">Counsel first examines whether Bower could challenge his guilty plea because the government prosecuted him by information rather than indictment. We agree with counsel that such an argument would be frivolous because Bower waived his right to be prosecuted by indictment. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 7(b); <em>United States v. Mezzanatto, </em>513 U.S. 196, 202, 115 S.Ct. 797, 130 L.Ed.2d 697 (1995) (recognizing right to waive indictment); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>177 F.2d 476, 478 (7th Cir.1949) (same). Because the district judge advised Bower of the charge against him and fully explained his right to insist that the government allow a Grand Jury to decide whether to return an indictment, Bower\u2019s waiver of indictment in open court was valid and an appeal on this issue would be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-14\">Counsel next considers whether Bower could argue that his guilty plea was not knowing or voluntary, but counsel concludes that such an argument would be frivolous because the district court complied with Federal Rule of Criminal Pro-ceudure 11. We agree that Bower\u2019s plea colloquy reveals no errors, and moreover, nothing we have seen suggests that Bower wants to withdraw his plea. <em>See United States v. Knox, </em>287 F.3d 667, 671 (7th Cir.2002). Accordingly, an appeal based on the validity of Bower\u2019s plea would be frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-15\">Finally, counsel considers two potential sentencing challenges, but concludes that any claim of error would be frivolous. First, counsel observes that the district court relied on evidence bearing sufficient indicia of reliability to calculate the drug quantity attributable to Bower. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number><em>See United States v. Morrison, </em>207 F.3d 962, 967 (7th Cir.2000). Thus, Bower could not argue that the district court committed clear error in finding that the materials found in his home might have produced 39.2 grams of methamphetamine. <em>See United States v. Martin, </em>287 F.3d 609, 616 (7th Cir.2002). Bower also cannot legitimately assert that the district court committed clear error by increasing his base offense level by two levels because police found a gun in the house where he manufactured methamphetamine. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l); <em>United States v. Cain, </em>155 F.3d 840, 843 (7th Cir.1998). Because drug manufacturing equipment was found in proximity to the gun, it could not be \u201cclearly improbable\u201d that the weapon was connected to Bower\u2019s drug offense. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n.3); <em>United States v. Pigee, </em>197 F.3d 879, 892 (7th Cir.1999); <em>Cain, </em>155 F.3d at 843.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Accordingly, we GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
