(\u201cTurner\u201d) and Commercial Electric, Inc. (\u201cCommercial\u201d), appeal the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of debtor JGC Enterprises, LLC (\u201cJGC\u201d). Specifically, appellants challenge the district court\u2019s decision that their liens are invalid for failure to comply with the verification requirements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>of Idaho Code \u00a7 45-507. Alternatively, appellants contend that the voluntary dismissal of JGC\u2019s underlying bankruptcy proceeding restored their claims of lien by returning the parties to the status quo ante \u2014 the district court\u2019s previous grant of summary judgment notwithstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">We review the district court\u2019s decision on an appeal from a bankruptcy court <em>de novo. American Broad. Sys., Inc. v. Nugent (In re: Betacom of Phoenix, Inc., Debtor), </em>240 F.3d 823, 827-28 (9th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">We affirm for the reasons assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we recite here only those necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">In early 1998, both Turner and Commercial entered into subcontracting agreements with Pond Construction, Inc., to which JGC was a third party beneficiary, and pursuant to which both performed work on real property owned by JGC. Neither appellant was paid for its labor and materials, and both eventually filed separate claims of hen in Idaho district court. Turner\u2019s principal claim totaled $9,794.95, and Commercial\u2019s principal claim totaled $83,677.40.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">JGC subsequently filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and removed the state lawsuits to federal court as adversary proceedings. There, JGC filed a motion for summary judgment contending that neither hen complied with the verification requirements of Idaho Code \u00a7 45-507. The bankruptcy court agreed with JGC and granted its motion for summary judgment. Subsequently, JGC voluntarily dismissed its bankruptcy proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">Idaho Code \u00a7 45-507(4) states that a claim of hen \u201cmust be verified by the oath of the claimant, his agent or attorney, to the effect that the affiant believes the same to be just.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-12\">Despite the seeming clarity of this statutory requirement, neither Turner\u2019s nor Commercial\u2019s hen contains any verification under oath that the claims are just \u2014 in fact, they do not contain any statement under oath whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-13\">The argument advanced by appellants that the verification language of \u00a7 45-507(4) is not a material requirement of the statute is foreclosed by Idaho precedent. Most recently, in <em>Cornerstone Builders, Inc. v. McReynolds, </em>136 Idaho 843, 41 P.3d 271, 273 (Idaho Ct.App.2001), the court discussed the \u201cverification requirement of I.C. \u00a7 45-507.\u201d Claimants in that case filed claims of hen against the defendant after failing to be compensated for labor and materials. Those claims were presented using pre-printed forms that failed to comply with the terms of \u00a7 45-507(4), specifically, as in the case at bar, the claimants did not attest that the claims made were \u201cjust.\u201d <em>Cornerstone, </em>41 P.3d at 273. Defendants moved to dismiss the claims on the ground that they failed to comply with the verification requirements of \u00a7 45-507. Claimants responded, as they do here, that the hens \u201cmust only substantiahy comply with I.C. \u00a7 45-507.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court of appeals, reversing the district court, agreed with the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-14\">Relying in part on <em>Treasure Valley Plumbing and Heating, Inc. v. Earth Res. Co., </em>106 Idaho 920, 684 P.2d 322, 324 (1984) (noting that verification requirement of \u00a7 45-507 goes beyond mere requirement that document be \u201cacknowledged\u201d), the court in <em>Cornerstone </em>held that the mere statement of the claimant having appeared before a notary, and having sworn that he executed the document in his authorized capacity, was insufficient to satisfy \u00a7 45-507. <em>Id. </em>at 274 (\u201c[s]uch language does not fulfill the requirement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>I.C. \u00a7 45-507 that the claims be \u2018verified by the oath of the claimant ... to the effect that the affiant believes the same to be [] just.\u201d\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">In the case at bar, the liens at issue comply even less with the statutory requirements of \u00a7 45-507 in that they contain no claim that the affiant \u201cduly swore\u201d to the statements therein. <em>Id. </em>at 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Because both the unambiguous language of the statute, and Idaho precedent, make clear that appellants\u2019 hens are invalid, we affirm the district court\u2019s holding that the claims of lien are invalid for failure to comply with the verification requirements of \u00a7 45-507.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Appellants\u2019 contention that the summary judgment determinations of the bankruptcy court were rendered null and void upon the voluntary dismissal of the bankruptcy proceedings, causing an \u201cautomatic[ ] revival\u201d of their liens, pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 349(b),<footnotemark>***</footnotemark> is without merit. Section 349(b) is irrelevant here, where neither the bankruptcy court nor the district court relied on any provision of the Bankruptcy Code, including \u00a7 349, in reaching their respective conclusions that the liens are legally inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Even were we to accept appellants\u2019 argument that the \u201cunderlying bankruptcy was a material factor in the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s decision to invalidate the lien claims,\u201d it is not the case that \u00a7 349 necessarily restores the parties to the position in respect to their property rights that they held at the commencement of the case. We have decided otherwise. In <em>Gardenhire v. Internal Revenue Service (In re Gardenhire), </em>209 F.3d 1145, 1152 (9th Cir.2000), we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-16\">Although \u00a7 349 generally works to restore the parties to their pre-bankruptcy positions, it does so in very specific ways. <em>Section 8J\u00a1,9 refers to the specific Code provisions affected by dismissal </em>... In other words, Congress clearly knew how to provide for the effect of a dismissal ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-17\">(emphasis added). <em>See also Carraher v. Morgan Elecs., Inc. (In re Carraher), </em>971 F.2d 327, 328 (9th Cir.1992) (noting that the omission of an order from the list found at \u00a7 349 ordinarily means that dismissal does not affect the omitted order); 3 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>UK 349.03[2] (15th ed.2002) (\u201cdismissal does not always restore the prepetition status of property.... Nor-will dismissal necessarily eliminate the collateral estoppel or res judicata effect a bankruptcy court decision made during the case would have in a later proceeding.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-18\">Because it is clear that the decision of the bankruptcy court was based exclusively on Idaho state law, and failed altogether to rely on the provisions of \u00a7 349, specifically by not voiding the liens under \u00a7 506(d) of the Bankruptcy Code, we reject appellants\u2019 argument and affirm the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of JGC.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b580-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Cir.
