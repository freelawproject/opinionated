Having carefully reviewed the record and appellant\u2019s brief, we agree with the district court that the complaint failed to state a claim. <em>See Cooper v. Schriro, </em>189 F.3d 781, 783 (8th Cir.1999) (per curiam) (de novo review). Hodges\u2019s due process claim fails because the clemency statute imposes no standards, criteria, or factors which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>Board may or may not consider in making its recommendation, and he did not otherwise describe a due process violation. <em>See Perry v. Brownlee, </em>122 F.3d 20, 23 (8th Cir.1997) (per curiam) (because Arkansas clemency statute does not impose standards as to when clemency must be granted, it does not create constitutional right or entitlement sufficient to invoke Due Process Clause). Hodges\u2019s equal protection claim also fails because he has not alleged that he is a member of a protected class, <em>see Seltzer-Bey v. Delo, </em>66 F.3d 961, 964 (8th Cir.1995), or explained how he is similarly situated to those prisoners whose clemency applications were granted, <em>see Klinger v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>31 F.3d 727, 731 (8th Cir.1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 U.S. 1185, 115 S.Ct. 1177, 130 L.Ed.2d 1130 (1995). Accordingly, we affirm, and we deny Hodges\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b356-8\">.
