We review a dismissal for failure to comply with a court order for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Valentine v. Museum of Modem Art, </em>29 F.3d 47, 49 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-19\">We see no abuse of discretion. \u201cThe severe sanction of dismissal with prejudice may be imposed even against a plaintiff who is proceeding <em>pro se, </em>so long as a warning has been given that noncompliance can result in dismissal.\u201d <em>Valentine, </em>29 F.3d at 50. The district court expressly warned Beheshtitabar twice that failure to comply with the court\u2019s order might result in dismissal, first when it issued its initial order to file an amended complaint, and again when it granted his request for an extension of time to file the amended complaint. More than two weeks after the extended deadline passed, the district court dismissed the action with prejudice because it had \u201cnot received an amended complaint or any other correspondence\u201d from Beheshtitabar. Beheshtitabar\u2019s alleged latent heart condition, raised for the first time on appeal, is no excuse for failure to respond to the district court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-20\">The motion filed by Beheshtitabar on June 13, 2002, styled \u201cMotion for Summary Judgment,\u201d is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-21\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
