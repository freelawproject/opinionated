We affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the facts, we recount them here only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">1. Appellants contend that <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), requires that the prosecution prove to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew the quantity of drugs involved in the offense. This argument is foreclosed by the recent decision in <em>United States v. Carranza, </em>289 F.3d 634, 2002 WL 841175, at <footnotemark>*</footnotemark>7 (9th Cir. May 3, 2002) <em>(\u201cAp-prendi </em>did not change the long established rule that the government need not prove that the defendant knew the <em>type </em>and <em>amount </em>of a controlled substance that he ... possessed; the government need only show that the defendant knew that he ... possessed <em>some </em>controlled substance.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">2. Appellants contend that there was insufficient evidence to prove the single conspiracy alleged in the indictment. As a result, appellants maintain, their convictions must have been for multiple conspiracies, resulting in a constructive amendment of, or fatal variance from, the indictment. This question is essentially a question of sufficiency of the evidence to prove a single conspiracy. <em>United States v. Bibbero, </em>749 F.2d 581, 586 (9th Cir. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-12\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979), we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to enable a reasonable juror to find beyond a reasonable doubt that there was a single overall conspiracy. <em>Bibbero, </em>749 F.2d at 587 (\u201cA single conspiracy may involve several su-bagreements or subgroups of conspirators.\u201d). Moreover, the jury instructions were consistent with the indictment in requiring that the jury find the existence of a single conspiracy before it could convict any of the defendants. Thus, the resulting convictions were for participation in the single conspiracy alleged in the indictment and did not represent a constructive amendment of, or a fatal variance from, the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-13\">3. Appellants\u2019 argument that the jury instructions were misleading is also without merit. Because the government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>need not prove the defendant\u2019s knowledge of drug quantity to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt, the district court\u2019s failure to include such an instruction to the jury was not an abuse of discretion. <em>Carranza, </em>289 F.3d 634, 643. Additionally, the jury instructions properly stated that the jury must find enough evidence to establish beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of a single conspiracy as alleged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">4. Any <em>Apprendi </em>error resulting from the district court\u2019s failure to prove drug quantity to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt did not amount to plain error warranting reversal. <em>United States v. Buckland, </em>289 F.3d 558, 2002 WL 857751, at <footnotemark>*</footnotemark>8 (9th Cir. May 7, 2002). Hafoka\u2019s actual sentence was less than the 20-year statutory maximum authorized by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1)(C) for an indeterminate amount of cocaine. <em>Apprendi </em>does not prevent a judge from making drug quantity findings for the purposes of applying the sentencing guidelines when the resulting sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum. <em>United States v. Johansson, </em>249 F.3d 848, 861-62 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Although Taumoepeau received a sentence of 40 years and Liufau received a sentence of 293 months \u2014 both in excess of the 20-year statutory maximum authorized by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1)(C) \u2014 any <em>Apprendi </em>error did not affect their substantial rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To trigger the statutory maximum sentence of 40 years prescribed by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1)(B), the government need only have proved that the conspiracy involved 500 grams of cocaine. There was overwhelming evidence that the conspiracy involved in excess of 500 grams of cocaine, including a stipulation as to certain amounts \u2014 totaling 13 kilograms \u2014 seized from members of the conspiracy, testimony from many co-conspirators regarding the amount for which each defendant was responsible, and testimony and physical evidence provided by law enforcement who had intercepted cocaine from members of the conspiracy. Because the jury\u2019s verdict necessarily included a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that a <em>single </em>conspiracy existed, the failure to prove these amounts to the jury did not affect the outcome of the proceedings, and, accordingly, did not affect appellants\u2019 substantial rights. <em>Buckland, </em>289 F.3d 558, 569.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">Furthermore, the district court\u2019s specific findings of the quantity of cocaine for which each defendant was responsible were not clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Asagba, </em>77 F.3d 324, 325 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b480-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
