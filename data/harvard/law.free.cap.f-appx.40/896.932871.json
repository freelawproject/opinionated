Watson, Jr., proceeding pro se, appeals a district court judgment that affirmed the Commissioner\u2019s 1998 denial of his application for social security disability benefits. The case has been referred to this panel pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. We unanimously agree that oral argument is not needed. Fed. RApp. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-18\">In his timely appeal, Watson argues that, because an administrative law judge determined that he was disabled in a decision rendered in March 2001, the district court judge erred in affirming a March 1998 decision that he was not disabled. Both parties have filed briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-19\">Watson\u2019s appeal is frivolous. That he was determined to be disabled in March 2001 has no bearing on whether he was disabled three years earlier. The Commissioner treats later-filed applications as separate claims, which is \u201ceminently logical and sensible, reflecting the reality that the mere passage of time often has a deleterious effect on a claimant\u2019s physical or mental condition.\u201d <em>Albright v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>174 F.3d 473, 476 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-20\">Watson\u2019s theory of legal error is essentially an effort to invoke retroactive claim preclusion, which makes no sense. \u201cRes judicata bars attempts to relitigate the same claim, but a claim that one became disabled in 1990 is not the same as a claim that one became disabled in 1994.\u201d <em>Groves v. Apfel, </em>148 F.3d 809, 810 (7th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-21\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
