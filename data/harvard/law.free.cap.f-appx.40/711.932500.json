Because we write for the parties who are familiar with the facts, we need not review them in any detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-21\">Perez pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute heroin (over ten kilograms in one year) in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. He was assigned a total offense level of 46 and a criminal history category of I, yielding a sentence of life imprisonment, five years supervised release, and a $10,000 fine. We affirmed the judgment on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-22\">A number of years later, Perez filed a series of motions in the District Court and in this court seeking to correct or decrease the sentence, each of which was denied. Finally, in December 2000 Perez filed a motion to reduce his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10. The District Court denied that motion in January 2001. Perez appeals from the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-23\">The District Court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231, and this court has jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) as well as 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-24\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-25\">Perez seeks a retroactive two-level decrease in his sentencing range. He invokes 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), which states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-26\">in the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission ... the court may reduce the term of imprisonment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-27\">Perez relies on Amendment No. 591, effective November 1, 2000, which changed U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.2 to apply a two-level increase only when the defendant \u201cis convicted of a statutory violation of drug trafficking in a protected location ... or in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>case in which the defendant stipulated to such a statutory violation.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.2 app. n. 1. Although Perez stipulated that he distributed heroine on numerous occasion within 1,000 feet of a school, both parties agree that Perez was never \u201cconvicted of\u2019 nor \u201cstipulated to\u201d a \u201cstatutory violation\u201d of either 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 845(a) and its successor 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 860 (prohibiting drug distribution near a school). Perez argues that therefore the two-level \u00a7 2D1.2 increase that was imposed on his sentence should be subtracted from his offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">The District Court agreed that Perez may well fall within the Guidelines Amendment No. 591 but was disinclined to give Perez any relief as requested. The court stated, \u201ceven if defendant\u2019s Guideline Level is 44, the mandatory nature of the life sentence is unchanged and resentencing in this case would accomplish nothing at this point in time.\u201d App. at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Perez argues that his sentence should be viewed as 43, which is the Guideline level leading to life imprisonment, and that a two-level deduction would reduce it to 41. This argument has no support in the Guidelines. Perez\u2019s level when he was sentenced was 46. The District Court stated that the judgment should show the defendant\u2019s true offense level. The court stated that Perez\u2019s offense level without the two-level increase would be 44, and it would be treated as level 43, which requires a term of life imprisonment. To grant the decrease at this juncture would \u201caccomplish nothing.\u201d Id. The court left open the possibility that at some future time other amendments, combined with Amendment No. 591, \u201cwould allow [Perez] to reduce his sentence to a guideline level which no longer requires a mandatory life sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court stated, in that event, it would allow Perez to reassert his entitlement to the two-level deduction. We see no legal error in the District Court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">For the reasons set forth above, we will affirm the Order of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
