The District Court adopted the Report and Recommendation of Magistrate Judge George A. Yanthis dated October 3, 2001, to the extent it recommended dismissal of plaintiffs claims, but overruled that report to the extent it recommended dismissal <em>without prejudice. </em>The District Court held that because \u201c[rjecourse to the administrative remedies [is] now time barred,\u201d dismissal <em>with prejudice </em>was appropriate. <em>See De La Motte v. Menifee, </em>No. 00 Civ. 0555, slip op., at 2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 9, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-21\">We agree that dismissal for failure to exhaust administrative remedies was ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>propriate, for substantially the reasons stated by Magistrate Judge Yanthis in his October 3, 2001, Report and Recommendation. We hold, however, that the District Court erred in dismissing the claims with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">In <em>Morales v. Mackalm, </em>278 F.3d 126 (2d Cir.2002), we explicitly held that a dismissal pursuant to the PLRA for failure to exhaust administrative remedies should be <em>without prejudice. </em>278 F.3d at 128. Dismissal <em>without prejudice </em>is the appropriate course because \u201c[fjailure to exhaust administrative remedies precludes only the current lawsuit.\u201d <em>Id.; see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). Even where, as here, the plaintiffs time to file for administrative review has passed, dismissal <em>without prejudice </em>is required, as the Bureau of Prisons may find cause to extend the applicable time limit. <em>See </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7 542.14(b) (providing that \u201c[wjhere the inmate demonstrates a valid reason for delay, an extension in filing time may be allowed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Accordingly, we modify the judgment of the District Court to reflect a dismissal of plaintiffs claims without prejudice, and, as so modified, affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
