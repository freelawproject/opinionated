The University filed a motion to dismiss, claiming Eleventh Amendment immunity. The district court denied the University\u2019s motion and the University appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-19\">In <em>Popovich v. Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, </em>276 F.3d 808, 816-18 (6th Cir.2002), this court held that the Eleventh Amendment bars Title II claims against state entities that are based on equal protection discrimination principles. <em>See also Trustees of University of Alabama v. Garrett, </em>531 U.S. 356, 121 S.Ct. 955, 148 L.Ed.2d 866 (2001). Because Parr\u2019s claim is based on such equal protection principles, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s denial of the University\u2019s motion to dismiss and REMAND this case to the district court for further proceedings in light of <em>Popovich.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
