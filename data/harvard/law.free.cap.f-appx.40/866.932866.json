Thurston, Jr. seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s orders dismissing his civil actions for lack of jurisdiction. We dismiss the appeals for lack of jurisdiction because Thurston\u2019s notices of appeal were not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-20\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(1), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (I960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-22\">The district court\u2019s orders were entered on the docket on February 11, 2002. Thurston\u2019s notices of appeal were filed on April 9, 2002. Because Thurston failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeals. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-23\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
