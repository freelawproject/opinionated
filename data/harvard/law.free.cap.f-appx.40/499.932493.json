Because Macomber removed the criminal action against him pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443(1), we have jurisdiction to review the remand order pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d). We review <em>de novo </em>the district court decision to remand, <em>Hellon &amp; Assoc., Inc. v. Phoenix Resort Corp., </em>958 F.2d 295, 297 (9th Cir.1992), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">A criminal defendant claiming federally secured rights as a defense to a state prosecution may remove that prosecution to federal court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443(1); <em>California v. Sandoval, </em>434 F.2d 635, 636 (9th Cir.1971) (per curiam). All petitions for removal under \u00a7 1443(1) must satisfy two criteria:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-9\">First, the petitioners must assert, as a defense to the prosecution, rights that are given to them by explicit statutory enactment protecting equal racial civil rights.... Second, petitioners must assert that the state courts will not enforce that right, and that allegation must be supported by reference to a state statute or a constitutional provision that purports to command the state courts to ignore the federal rights. Bad experiences with the particular court in question will not suffice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-12\"><em>Sandoval, </em>434 F.2d at 636 (internal citations omitted). Although Macomber claims protection from criminal prosecution by the State of Hawaii under the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920 and the Admissions Act of 1959, nothing in those Acts protect \u201cequal racial civil rights\u201d or render Macomber immune from prosecution. <em>State v. Lorenzo, </em>77 Hawaii 219, 883 P.2d 641, 643-44 (Haw.1994); <em>United States v. Lorenzo, </em>995 F.2d 1448, 1456 (9th Cir.1993). Even if those Acts granted Macomber certain benefits based upon his race, such benefits are not federal in nature and cannot support removal under \u00a7 1443. <em>Keaukaha-Panaewa Comm. Ass\u2019n v. Hawaiian Homes Comm\u2019n, </em>588 F.2d 1216, 1226 (9th Cir.1978) (for all practical purposes, any benefits for native Hawaiians under the Commission Act lost their federal nature when the program was turned over to the State of Hawaii and the Act was made part of the Hawaii Constitution). Macomber\u2019s reference to the equal protection clause is also an insufficient basis for removal under \u00a7 1443(1). <em>Sandoval, </em>434 F.2d at 636. Thus, the district court properly remanded this case to state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b518-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
