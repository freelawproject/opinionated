At sentencing, defendant requested a downward departure on the ground that his illegal reentry had been motivated by extraordinary family circumstances. Specifically, Reci-nos-Recinos contended that his wife had been hospitalized and had requested that he return to take care of her. The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>court denied this request for a downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">On appeal, Recinos-Recinos argues that the district court misapprehended its authority to depart downward on the basis of his motive for the illegal re-entry, namely, extraordinary family circumstances. We approach challenges to the district court\u2019s understanding of its departure power with a strong presumption that the district court properly comprehended the scope of its authority. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>98 F.3d 690, 693-94 (2d Cir.1996) (per curiam). This presumption is overcome only where the record shows \u201cclear evidence of a substantial risk that the judge misapprehended the scope of his departure authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">In this case, the district court explicitly recognized its authority to depart due to extraordinary family circumstances, but then rejected defendant\u2019s argument that his motivation provided a sufficiently extraordinary basis for a downward departure. Because the district court properly recognized the scope of its authority, its discretionary decision not to depart is unappealable. <em>See United States v. Clark, </em>128 F.3d 122, 124 (2d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">For the reasons set forth above, the appeal from the district court is hereby DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
