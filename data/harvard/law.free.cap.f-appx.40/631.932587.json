Robertson alleged that CUNY Law\u2019s Academic Standing Committee (\u201cCommittee\u201d) wrongfully discriminated against him on the basis of race and denied him due process when it failed to waive the school\u2019s graduation requirements to allow him to graduate with four fewer credits than the 88 required under the school\u2019s regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-19\">The district court found that Robertson\u2019s claims accrued in 1991, when his petition was denied by the Committee in May 1991 and his appeal from the Committee\u2019s decision was denied in July 1991. Since Robertson did not file his complaint until November 1997, the court found that any claims he might have pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 1981, 1983, and 1985 and Title VI arising from the 1991 decisions were time barred under the applicable three-year statutes of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-20\">In 1996, Robertson again petitioned the Committee to allow him to graduate, and again his petition was denied. The district court found that Robertson failed to produce any evidence of a violation of his federally protected rights with regard to this meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-21\">The court also concluded that Robertson failed to state a claim under FERPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-22\">Finally, the court dismissed the supplemental state claims, declining to exercise jurisdiction over them.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-23\">Having reviewed all of Robertson\u2019s claims de novo, <em>Giordano v. City of New York, </em>274 F.3d 740, 746 (2d Cir.2001), we affirm the decision of the district court for substantially the same reasons given in its October 15, 2001 Memorandum and Order, except with regard to the FERPA claim, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>which fails for the reasons given in the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Gonzaga University v. Doe, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 2268, \u2014 L.Ed.2d -, 2002 WL 1338070 (June 20, 2002) (holding that FERPA does not confer personal rights enforceable under \u00a7 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">During the pendency of this appeal, Robertson filed on January 18, 2002 an Emergency Motion to Determine Fraudulent Concealment and filed on May 30, 2002 a Second Emergency Motion to Determine Fraud and Fraudulent Concealment, both of which are denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
