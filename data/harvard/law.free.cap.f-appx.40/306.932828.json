The district court<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>sentenced Pelchat to 262 months in prison. Pelchat appeals his sentence, claiming the district court should have departed downward because he offered substantial assistance to the Government, his assistance placed him at increased personal risk, and his sentence is greater than the sentences of his codefendants. In addition, Pelchat claims the Government cannot use his 1990 conviction to enhance his sentence under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>580 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) . Pelchat also filed a supplemental brief, rearguing issues raised in his initial brief, challenging the \u00a7 851 information, and attacking his current sentence under <em>Apprendi. </em>Having carefully considered the record and the applicable law, we reject each of Pelchat\u2019s claims, and affirm his sentence. <em>United States v. Rohwedder, </em>243 F.3d 423, 425 (8th Cir.2001) (reviewing district court\u2019s interpretation of the sentencing guidelines de novo and factual findings for clear error).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">We reject Pelchat\u2019s claim the district court impermissibly refused to depart downward based on his assistance to the Government. Pelchat\u2019s claim under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5K1.1 (2001) fails because the Government made no motion for a substantial assistance departure and Pelchat fails to show the Government refused to move for departure for an unconstitutional or irrational reason, or in bad faith. <em>United States v. Wolf, </em>270 F.3d 1188, 1190 (8th Cir.2001). Although Pelchat provided information to the Government, he did so without any promise of a departure motion, despite repeated warnings not to provide information with the expectation of receiving a substantial assistance departure, and his information proved worthless. Pelchat\u2019s claim he was entitled to departure under \u00a7 5K2.0 for increased personal risk stemming from his assistance to the Government also fails. Because the district court recognized its authority to depart, but concluded the facts did not warrant a \u00a7 5K2.0 departure, we cannot review the district court\u2019s decision not to depart on appeal. <em>Wolf, </em>270 F.3d at 1192.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">Pelchat\u2019s claim the district court impermissibly refused to depart downward because he received a greater sentence than his codefendants likewise fails. Sentencing disparities arising from the plea bargaining process or the exercise of prosecutorial discretion are hardly ever a proper basis for departure. <em>United States v. Buckendahl, </em>251 F.3d 753, 758-59 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 633, 151 L.Ed.2d 553 (2001). Here, the sentencing disparities reasonably resulted from differences in criminal histories among defendants and differences in useful cooperation with the Government. In addition, Pelchat admitted at sentencing that he could not show the Government selectively sought greater penalties for Pelchat than his codefendants for a discriminatory reason. <em>United States v. Armstrong, </em>517 U.S. 456, 465, 116 S.Ct. 1480, 134 L.Ed.2d 687 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">Pelchat cannot challenge his 1990 conviction (one of two convictions relied on in the Government\u2019s \u00a7 851 information seeking enhanced penalties) because Pelchat has exceeded the five-year limitations period to challenge convictions under \u00a7 851(e). <em>United States v. Carter, </em>270 F.3d 731, 736 (8th Cir.2001). Pelchat\u2019s contention that reliance on this earlier conviction to enhance his sentence violates <em>Apprendi </em>similarly fails. <em>Apprendi </em>specifically allows increases in a defendant\u2019s sentence based on earlier convictions. <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Pelchat\u2019s attempt to use <em>Apprendi </em>to attack his 1990 conviction, despite framing the argument in constitutional terms, fails because <em>Apprendi </em>cannot be applied to cases, like the 1990 conviction, not before the court on direct review. <em>United States v. Moss, 252 </em>F.3d 993, 997 (8th Cir.2001), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 848, 151 L.Ed.2d 725 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">We have carefully considered the additional claims raised in Pelchat\u2019s supplemental brief and conclude the claims are without merit. We reject the claims raised in the supplemental brief without extended discussion. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">We affirm Pelchat\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b326-14\"> The Honorable James M.
