Post appeals his conviction and sentence on charges of importation of marijuana and of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. <em>See 21 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841, 952, 960. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-15\">(1) On June 18, 2001, we vacated submission as to Post\u2019s claims under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). On that same date, we decided Post\u2019s other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-16\">(2) We have rejected Post\u2019s assertion that the statutes under which he was convicted are unconstitutional. They are not. <em>See United States v. Buckland, </em>289 F.3d 558, -, -, slip op. 6645, 6650 (9th Cir.2002) (en bane), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 2314, 152 L.Ed.2d 1067 (2002); <em>United States v. Mendaza-Paz, </em>286 F.3d 1104, 1109-10 (9th Cir.2002); We have also rejected his claim that the government was required to prove that he knew the quantity and type of the drugs involved in his offenses. It was not. <em>See United States v. Carranza, </em>289 F.3d 634, -, -, slip op. 6531, 6546 \u2014 47 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-23\">(3) Post\u2019s sentence was under the statutory maximum for an offense involving the lowest quantity of marijuana. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(D), 960(b)(4). Thus, his sentence of 27 months imprisonment and 3 years supervised release was proper. <em>See United States v. W. Coast Aluminum, Heat Treating Co., </em>265 F.3d 986, 994 (9th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Barragan, </em>263 F.3d 919, 925-26 (9th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Hernandez-Guardado, 228 </em>F.3d 1017, 1026-27 (9th Cir.2000); <em>cf. United States v. Nordby, </em>225 F.3d 1053, 1062 (9th Cir.2000), <em>overruled on other grounds by Buckland, </em>289 F.3d at -, slip op. at 6660.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-26\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b463-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
