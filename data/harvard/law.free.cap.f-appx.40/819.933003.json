Following his death, his widow applied for survivor benefits under the Black Lung Benefits Act, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-962 (BLBA). United States Steel Mining Company (U.S.Steel), Mr. Aleshire\u2019s former employer, challenged its obligation to pay the benefits. After an evidentiary hearing, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) awarded benefits to Mrs. Aleshire. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>U.S. Steel appealed to the United States Department of Labor (USDL) Benefits Review Board, and the Board affirmed. U.S. Steel now appeals to this Court. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">Chester Aleshire worked for over twenty-seven years at various coal mining operations, including approximately fourteen years with U.S. Steel. Mr. Aleshire died on August 20, 1997, while hospitalized following his second heart attack. His widow, Nessel Aleshire, applied for survivor benefits under the BLBA and the regulations promulgated thereunder, 20 C.F.R. Parts 718 and 725. The BLBA provides benefits for coal miners who are totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis or to survivors of miners who die from pneumoconi-osis. 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 901.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">Pneumoconiosis is a chronic dust disease of the lung arising out of coal mine employment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 902(b); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.201. To be eligible for benefits, a survivor must prove (1) the miner had pneumoconiosis; (2) the miner\u2019s pneumo-coniosis arose out of coal mine employment; and (3) the miner\u2019s death was due to pneumoconiosis. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.205(a). The claimant has the burden of establishing these elements by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>U.S. Steel Min. Co., Inc. v. Director, Office of Workers\u2019 Comp. Programs, </em>187 F.3d 384, 388 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-15\">The USDL Director of the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs (OWCP) made an initial finding that Mrs. Aleshire was eligible for benefits. U.S. Steel challenged its obligation to pay benefits to Mrs. Aleshire, and the matter was set for a hearing before an ALJ. At the hearing, U.S. Steel admitted Mr. Aleshire qualified under the Act as a miner for at least twenty-seven years, and that U.S. Steel is the employer responsible for paying any benefits awarded.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The company denied an obligation to pay benefits, however, because U.S. Steel contended Mr. Aleshire did not have pneumoconiosis, and, even if he had the condition, pneumoconio-sis did not significantly contribute to or hasten his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-16\">Under the Act and regulations, a miner or his survivor may establish the miner suffered from pneumoconiosis in four ways: (1) x-ray, (2) autopsy result, (3) presumption, or (4) reasoned medical opinion. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.202(a)(l)-(4). The ALJ determined Mrs. Aleshire failed to prove her husband had pneumoconiosis by x-ray,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> autopsy result,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or presumption.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>The ALJ found, however, Mrs. Aleshire successfully established pneumoconiosis under \u00a7 718.202(a)(4). Under that provision, notwithstanding a negative x-ray, a finding of pneumoconiosis may be made if a physician, exercising reasoned medical judgment, finds the miner suffered from pneumoconiosis as defined in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.201. Section 718.201 defines pneumoconiosis as \u201ca chronic dust disease of the lung and its sequelae, including respiratory or pulmonary impairments, arising out of coal mine employment. This definition includes both medical, or \u2018clinical\u2019, pneumoconiosis and statutory, or \u2018legal\u2019, pneumoconiosis.\u201d Medical pneumoconiosis is a clinical diagnosis of pneumoconiosis. Legal pneumoconiosis, on the other hand, includes various pulmonary and respiratory disorders which are not included in the medical diagnosis of pneumoconiosis. Thus, a coal miner may have legal pneumoconiosis even if he does not have medical pneumoconiosis. <em>See Hobbs v. Clinchfield Coal Co., </em>45 F.3d 819, 821 (4th Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">At the hearing, the parties presented various medical opinions. Dr. Curtis Dehmlow, Mr. Aleshire\u2019s attending physician at death, completed the death certificate. Although both parties contended the death certificate is illegible, the ALJ found the cause of death on the death certificate to be \u201coverwhelming sepsis and respiratory infection.\u201d Dr. Amano B. DeJosef conducted the autopsy. The autopsy report listed the cause of death as \u201csepticemia, klebsiella pneumoniae.\u201d The autopsy final diagnosis, however, included a host of conditions, including \u201cchronic obstructive pulmonary disease, marked interstitial fibrosis, marked with anthracotic pigments.\u201d Dr. Dehmlow subsequently reviewed the autopsy report and concluded the interstitial fibrosis with anthracotic pigments was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-7\">a classic pathological finding of \u201cblack lung\u201d and means that the ... coal dust [was] inhaled into his lung in such a fashion that ... this patient had black lung disease and ... that it contributed significantly to his respiratory failure and subsequent death because it predisposed him to ventilatory support and thus pneumonia and terminal sepsis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">Additionally, Mrs. Aleshire presented the opinions of physicians who had treated Mr. Aleshire during his life. Dr. Melchor F. Vidal, who treated Mr. Aleshire for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and heart problems, concluded that \u201cdue to the past histories such as a miner for 32 years &amp; treatment, &amp; diagnosis of co-worker<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> pneumoconiosis,\u201d the disease contributed \u201cto a significant degree\u201d to Mr. Aleshire\u2019s death. Dr. Martin Fritzhand treated Mr. Aleshire in 1980 for worsening shortness of breath. Dr. Fritzhand diagnosed Mr. Aleshire with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and concluded Mr. Aleshire\u2019s chronic shortness of breath was due to his long exposure to coal dust. Dr. Frit-zhand\u2019s conclusion was based on the miner\u2019s history of worsening shortness of breath, extensive coal mining history, physical examination, chest x-ray, pulmonary function test, and arterial blood gas tests. Dr. Pathom Thavaradhara, who examined Mr. Aleshire in 1986 for increased shortness of breath, diagnosed pneumoco-niosis based on Mr. Aleshire\u2019s history in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>coal mining, a chest x-ray, pulmonary function and blood gas studies.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">In addition to these medical opinions, the OWCP Director consulted Dr. Dominic J. Gaziano, a B-reader<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> who is Board-certified in Internal Medicine and Chest Disease, for an opinion in this case. Dr. Gaziano reviewed Mr. Aleshire\u2019s case file and answered a series of questions posed by the Claims Examiner on a form. Dr. Gaziano indicated (1) Mr. Aleshire had pneumoconiosis; (2) he was not totally disabled due to the condition prior to his death; (3) his death was not due to pneu-moconiosis; (4) his death was not caused by complications from pneumoconiosis, (5) he did not have complicated pneumoconio-sis; however, (6) pneumoconiosis was a substantially contributing cause or factor leading to Mr. Aleshire\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">U.S. Steel presented the sole contrary opinion of Dr. Stephen T. Bush, a well-eredentialed pathologist. Dr. Bush examined Mr. Aleshire\u2019s medical records, the autopsy report, Dr. Dehmlow\u2019s opinion, and thirty-five histologic slides of tissues from the autopsy. Dr. Bush concluded, \u201cI can state with reasonable medical certainty that the lungs show no occupational disease, specifically no coalworkers\u2019 pneu-moconiosis.\u201d Dr. Bush concluded Mr. Aleshire had adult respiratory distress syndrome as a result of hypotension and infection. Dr. Bush specifically rejected Dr. Dehmlow\u2019s diagnosis of black lung, by contrasting the findings in the autopsy with those normally associated with black lung.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">After reviewing these conflicting medical opinions, the ALJ determined that \u201calthough the evidence is inconclusive regarding whether the miner suffered from \u2018medical\u2019 pneumoconiosis, he clearly suffered from \u2018legal\u2019 pneumoconiosis (ie., a respiratory or pulmonary impairment significantly related to, or substantially aggravated by, dust exposure in coal mine employment.).\u201d The ALJ also found Mr. Ale-shire\u2019s death was \u201cdue to\u201d pneumoconiosis. Pursuant to \u00a7 718.205(c)(4), a miner\u2019s death will be considered \u201cdue to\u201d pneumo-coniosis if pneumoconiosis was a substantially contributing cause of death, even if another primary cause of death is identified. The ALJ found that although pneu-moconiosis was not the direct cause of Mr. Aleshire\u2019s death, the weight of the evidence indicated pneumoconiosis was a substantially contributing cause of his death. Specifically, the ALJ relied on the opinions of Drs. Dehmlow, Vidal, and Gaziano. Only Dr. Bush\u2019s report contradicted these opinions. The ALJ found that the opinion of the majority of physicians was consistent with Mr. Aleshire\u2019s lengthy employment in the coal mining industry, his long and worsening history of shortness of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>breath, abnormalities in clinical tests, and his death by a respiratory-related cause. Accordingly, the ALJ awarded benefits to Mrs. Aleshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">We review an order of the USDL Benefits Review Board by independently reviewing the record to determine whether the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact were supported by substantial evidence. <em>Island Creek Coal Co. v. Compton, </em>211 F.3d 203, 207 (4th Cir.2000). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 207-08. We review the legal conclusions of the Board and the ALJ de novo. <em>Id. </em>at 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">U.S. Steel first contends the ALJ\u2019s finding that Mr. Aleshire suffered from pneumoconiosis is not supported by substantial evidence. U.S. Steel argues the ALJ erred by failing to give the proper weight to the only two opinions \u2014 the autopsy report by Dr. DeJosef, and the consultation report by Dr. Bush \u2014 that were based on actually viewing the autopsy slides. Neither of these two reports diagnosed Mr. Aleshire with pneumoconiosis. U.S. Steel contends the other doctors rendered unsupported and eonclusory opinions based on Mr. Aleshire\u2019s employment history, and not on objective medical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">The ALJ specifically found Mr. Aleshire had \u201clegal\u201d pneumoconiosis, as opposed to \u201cmedical\u201d pneumoconiosis. As we have previously explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b842-9\">Although \u201ccoal workers\u2019 pneumoconio-sis\u201d may be used synonymously with pneumoconiosis in medical circles, the two terms are distinct legally. First, \u00a7 718.201 includes coal workers\u2019 pneu-moconiosis as only one of several possible ailments which could satisfy the legal definition of pneumoconiosis. Furthermore, the comparative breadth of the legal definition contained in \u00a7 718.201 is indicated by its inclusion of certain disorders which medically are different from pneumoconiosis.... Although all of the disorders explicitly mentioned in \u00a7 718.201 are medically similar, <em>what is important is that a medical diagnosis finding no coal workers\u2019 pneumoconio-sis is not equivalent to a legal finding of no pneumoconiosis. Clearly, the legal definition of pneumoconiosis contained in \u00a7 718.201 is significantly broader than the medical definition.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b842-11\"><em>Hobbs, </em>45 F.3d at 821 (emphasis added). For example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder is encompassed within the legal definition of pneumoconiosis under the Act. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.201(a)(2) (listing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as a type of \u201clegal\u201d pneumoconiosis); <em>Warth v. Southern Ohio Coal Co., </em>60 F.3d 173, 175 (4th Cir.1995) (\u201cChronic obstructive lung disease thus is encompassed within the definition of pneumoconiosis for purposes of entitlement to Black Lung benefits.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-12\">The ALJ relied on five concurring medical opinions, ranging from Mr. Aleshire\u2019s treating physicians to a board certified specialist, that Mr. Aleshire had pneumo-coniosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder as a result of his coal mining employment. These opinions were based on work history, medical history, physical examinations, x-rays, pulmonary function studies, blood gas tests, and Mr. Aleshire\u2019s death from a respiratory-related cause. The ALJ considered and rejected Dr. Bush\u2019s sole contrary opinion, which made a medical finding of no pneumoconiosis. Although Dr. Bush\u2019s report states that at death Mr. Aleshire suffered from adult respiratory syndrome resulting from hypo-tension and infection, Dr. Bush does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>explicitly address whether Mr. Aleshire\u2019s chronic respiratory problems dating back several years were a result of his work in the coal mines, <em>i.e., </em>whether he suffered from any form of legal pneumoconiosis. The ALJ\u2019s finding of legal pneumoconiosis therefore was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">U.S. Steel also asserts the ALJ\u2019s determination that pneumoconiosis substantially contributed to Mr. Aleshire\u2019s death was not supported by substantial evidence. Pneumoconiosis substantially contributes to a miner\u2019s death if the disease hastens death in any way. <em>Piney Mountain Coal Co. v. Mays, </em>176 F.3d 753, 757 (4th Cir.1999) (citing <em>Chuff v. Cedar Coal Co., </em>967 F.2d 977, 979-80 (4th Cir. 1992)). U.S. Steel again argues the ALJ erred by relying on several doctors\u2019 conclusory and unsupported statements that pneumoconiosis caused Mr. Aeshire\u2019s death. U.S. Steel argues the doctors\u2019 eonclusory opinions are not reliable, probative, and substantial evidence upon which to base a finding that pneumoconiosis hastened Mr. Aeshire\u2019s death. <em>See U.S. Steel Min. Co., </em>187 F.3d at 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">The ALJ\u2019s finding of causation was based on substantial evidence in the form of several doctors\u2019 opinions, which in turn were based on medical history, employment history, physical exams, x-rays, clinical tests, and the autopsy report which listed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a form of legal pneumoconiosis, as one of several causes of death. Drs. Dehmlow, Vidal, and Gaziano concluded pneumoconiosis was either a direct or contributing cause of Mr. Aeshire\u2019s death. Unlike the doctor in <em>U.S. Steel Min. Co. </em>who opined that it was \u201cpossible\u201d the miner died from pneumoconiosis, Drs. Dehm-low, Vidal, and Gaziano definitively concluded pneumoconiosis contributed to Mr. Aeshire\u2019s death. <em>Compare id. </em>at 389-90. The ALJ credited these opinions as most consistent with Mr. Aeshire\u2019s employment history, long history of chronic and worsening respiratory problems, abnormalities in Mr. Aeshire\u2019s clinical tests over the years, and his death from a respiratory-related cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">Dr. Bush\u2019s contrary opinion relied on his conclusion that Mr. Aeshire did not have pneumoconiosis. Because the ALJ had substantial evidence to find Mr. Aeshire had legal pneumoconiosis, the ALJ was free to reject Dr. Bush\u2019s contrary conclusion that Mr. Aeshire did not die from the disease. <em>Compton, </em>211 F.3d at 214 (where ALJ has found pneumoconiosis exists, ALJ may reject physician\u2019s opinion pneumoco-niosis did not cause death where the physician\u2019s causation analysis depends upon his opinion that the miner did not have pneu-moconiosis).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">In sum, the ALJ\u2019s findings that Mr. Aeshire had pneumoconiosis and that the disease hastened Mr. Aeshire\u2019s death are supported by substantial evidence. We therefore affirm the Benefits Review Board\u2019s decision affirming the ALJ\u2019s grant of survivor benefits to Mrs. Aeshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b839-10\">. U.S. Steel is the responsible employer because it was the coal mine operator that most recently employed Mr. Aleshire. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.495(a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b839-11\">. The ALJ determined the x-ray evidence was inconclusive under \u00a7 718.202(a)(1). Several x-ray readings indicated pneumoconiosis, while others did not. Further, Dr. Gaziano, the OWCP Director's reviewing consultant, found pneumoconiosis on one reading, yet found no pneumoconiosis on another reading a few months later. The ALJ noted that this finding was inconsistent with the progressive nature of pneumoconiosis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b839-17\">. The ALJ considered both the autopsy report by Dr. DeJosef, as well as Dr. Bush\u2019s consultation report. Based on these reports, the ALJ con-cluded Mrs. Aleshire failed to prove pneumoconiosis by autopsy results under \u00a7 718.202(a)(2) because the autopsy did not make a clear and definitive diagnosis of pneu-moconiosis, and Dr. Bush's examination of the autopsy tissues specifically rejected such a diagnosis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b839-18\">. The ALJ found Mrs. Aleshire failed to prove pneumoconiosis by pre-sumption under \u00a7 718.202(a)(3) because nothing in the record indicated she qualified for any of the three presumptions referred to in this section. First, Mrs. Aleshire was not entitled to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>presumption in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.304 because no evidence supported the finding Mr. Ale-shire suffered from complicated pneumoconi-osis. Second, Mrs. Aleshire was not entitled to the presumption in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.305 because she filed her claim for benefits after January 1, 1982. Finally, she was not entitled to the presumption under 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.306 because Mr. Aleshire died after March 1, 1978.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b840-10\">. Presumably the doctor meant \"coalworker.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b841-7\">. A B-reader has demonstrated proficiency in evaluating x-rays. <em>See 20 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 718.202(a)(l)(ii)(E).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b841-8\">. Dr. Bush explained in his report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-9\">The quoted portions of the microscopic description by the autopsy pathologist do not describe lesions resulting from coalmine dust exposure. Coalworker micronodules consist of black dust pigment in macrophages and free in the tissue associated with a fibrous reaction forming stellate lesions surrounded by dilated air spaces. In contrast, the histologic slides show black dust pigment beneath the pleura but virtually none in the lung substance. Groups of alveolar macrophages contain a yellowb-rown pigment most consistent with iron resulting from chronic congestive heart failure. Diffuse interstitial fibrosis is not a feature of coalworkers\u2019 disease. In this case the interstitial fibrosis is relatively young collagen rather than the dense collagen of a chronic process of long duration. The his-tologic changes in the lungs as observed and described by me and as observed and described by Dr. Dejosef bear no resemblance to the changes of coalworkers\u2019 pneu-moconiosis.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
