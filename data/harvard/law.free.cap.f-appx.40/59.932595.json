TARNOW, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">I. INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Defendant-appellant Barry T. Nance was charged with six counts of drug and gun-related activity. Count One alleged possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B). Count Two alleged a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c), which prohibits three different combinations of guns and drugs. Counts Three through Six alleged four separate instances of knowing possession of three firearms and ammunition by a convicted felon.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">A jury convicted on all six counts, but the District Court granted defendant\u2019s motion for acquittal on Count Two, the combination of guns and drugs count. On the other five counts, the District Court sentenced Nance to five concurrent 84-month sentences and five years supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">Three separate appeals have been consolidated. First, Nance appeals the supervised release portion of his sentence as beyond the statutory maximum. Second, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Tennessee (the \u201cGovernment\u201d) appeals the District Court\u2019s acquittal on Count Two, asserting a rational trier of fact could conclude that Nance violated \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s prohibitions against the combination of drugs and guns. Third, the Government cross-appealed Nance\u2019s sentence, arguing that even if there were not enough evidence to convict Nance under \u00a7 924(c), the district court should have enhanced Nance\u2019s sentence two levels under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) for the possession of guns in connection with a drug-trafficking crime. For the reasons stated below, we AFFIRM the district court on all three issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">II. FACTUAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b87-11\">On June 12, 1999, Nance and his girlfriend, Monica Whitt, were involved in an argument, and the Oak Ridge Police were called. The police left after receiving assurances from Whitt that she was fine and that the argument was resolved. However, after the police left, the fight resumed, and Nance hit Whitt and threatened her with a gun. She ordered him to leave, and he started packing his belongings with the help of two friends. While he was removing his belongings, Whitt called the police again to report the assault. When the police arrived, about an hour after their previous visit, Nance was in the parking lot of the apartment building with two males near a truck. The truck contained a bed and some furniture. One officer went upstairs to talk to Whitt. The officer observed a mark on Whitt\u2019s face. At that time, Whitt told the officer that Nance had drugs in his pocket and guns in his vehicle. Due to the mark on Whitt\u2019s face, the officers arrested Nance.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-12\">The police searched Nance\u2019s pockets and his car. In his pockets, the police found 10.5 grams of crack cocaine, a small amount of marijuana, a small amount of powder cocaine, a small scale, and $2,230 cash in his wallet. In the car, police found three guns, a flak jacket, and some ammunition. One of the guns, a loaded Lorcin nine millimeter semi-automatic handgun, was in a shoe box in the backseat within the driver\u2019s reach. The other two guns, a 12-gauge shotgun and a loaded .38 caliber revolver, were in the trunk.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-13\">The indictment on Count One did not allege a specific amount of drugs. However, the indictment did state that Nance was being charged under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), which prohibits possession of over 5 grams of crack. The jury returned a special verdict finding beyond a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>reasonable doubt that defendant possessed crack in excess of 5 grams with the intent to distribute. The jury convicted on all six counts, but the District Court granted defendant\u2019s motion for acquittal on Count Two. The government moved for a two-level enhancement due possession of a firearm in connection with a drug offense, but the District Court denied the motion. Three appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">There are three issues for our consideration: 1) whether the district court committed plain error in sentencing Nance to five years supervised release; 2) whether the district court erred in acquitting Nance on Count II, carrying firearms during and in relation to drug trafficking or possessing firearms in furtherance of drug trafficking; and 3) whether the district court committed clear error by not enhancing Nance\u2019s sentence by two levels for possession of a weapon in connection with his drug offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">A. Whether the district court committed plain error in sentencing Nance to a term of five years supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">1. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">Since Nance did not object at the time of sentencing, this Court must apply plain error review. <em>United States v. Cotton, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 1785, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002); <em>United States v. McGahee, </em>257 F.3d 520, 531 (6th Cir.2001). Under plain error review, an appellate court can correct an error not raised in the trial court if there was (1) error, (2) that was plain, and (3) the error affected substantial rights. <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 466-67, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (quoting <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)); <em>United States v. Koeberlein, </em>161 F.3d 946, 949 (6th Cir. 1998). \u201cIf all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error \u2018seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>520 U.S. at 467, 117 S.Ct. 1544 (internal citations omitted); <em>see also Koeberlein, </em>161 F.3d at 949.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-12\">Nance acknowledges that under the law of this Circuit, plain error review applies. He argues, however, that since the Government erred in failing to include the drug amount in the indictment, harmless error should apply instead, with the burden of showing harmlessness on the Government. The argument is based on notions of fairness, that where the Government made the error, the defendant should not have to shoulder the burden of showing plain error. Nance cites <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>214 F.3d 687 (6th Cir.2000) in support of his argument. Nance argues that in <em>Jackson, </em>this Court found a <em>Jones </em>violation, noted the Government\u2019s failure to assert harmless error review, and suggested that harmless error might apply in such circumstances. Nance asserts that the present case involves a similar fact situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-13\">Nance\u2019s argument that harmless error should apply ultimately fails. First, Nance could have avoided plain error review by objecting at sentencing. Plain error review seeks to strike a balance between the need for finality with the desire to correct \u201cmiscarriages of justice.\u201d <em>United States v. Frady, </em>456 U.S. 152, 163, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982). Thus, plain error review reflects \u201ca careful balancing of our need to encourage all trial participants to seek a fair and accurate trial the first time around against our insistence that obvious injustice be promptly redressed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nance\u2019s argument com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>pletely undermines plain error review, since it would apply to every alleged governmental error. Second, and more importantly, <em>Jackson </em>does not support Nance\u2019s argument. In <em>Jackson, </em>the defendant objected to the error at the hearing. 214 F.3d at 689. Here, defense counsel made no such objection. In addition, in <em>Jackson, </em>the Government failed to assert the alleged error should be subject to the harmless error standard. <em>Id. </em>at 690. By contrast, here, the Government has asserted plain error review applies. Thus, the <em>Jackson </em>case is inapposite to these facts. Accordingly, we review the district court\u2019s imposition of a supervised release term of five years for plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">2. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Nance challenges the term of five years supervised release imposed by the district court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Relying on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) and <em>Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999), Nance argues that since the indictment failed to charge the amount of drugs in the indictment, he stands convicted of the lesser offense contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) (\u201cClass C felony\u201d),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> rather than 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) (\u201cClass B felony\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under the Class C felony provisions, he argues that he should have been given no more than three years supervised release, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(b), rather than the five years the district court imposed. The Government counters that even assuming Nance was only properly convicted of a Class C felony, the five year term of supervised release is still proper under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-12\">Therefore, there are two issues raised by Nance\u2019s argument: 1) was he convicted of a Class C rather than a Class B felony, and if so, 2) does 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) or 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(b) control? On question one, we will assume for the sake of argument that Nance was merely convicted of a Class C felony.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-13\">On question two, Nance argues there is an apparent conflict between the supervised release term allowed by \u00a7 3583(b) and the term allowed by \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). Consequently, under the rule of leniency, he contends that the lesser term found in \u00a7 3583(b) should be imposed instead.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>The pertinent provision of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583ft&gt;) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-4\">Except as otherwise provided, the authorized terms of supervised release are- \u2014 (1) for a Class A or Class B felony, not more than five years; (2) for a Class C or Class D felony, not more than three years ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">The pertinent provision of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\">Any sentence imposing a term of imprisonment under this paragraph shall, in the absence of such a prior conviction, impose a term of supervised release of at least 3 years in addition to such a term of imprisonment ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">Nance concedes that the apparent conflict between the two provisions has been resolved against him in this Circuit; he is preserving the issue for possible Supreme Court review. In <em>United States v. Page, </em>this Court held that the higher term of supervised release provided in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) prevails over 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(b). 131 F.3d 1173, 1180 (6th Cir. 1997), <em>abrogated on other grounds, Johnson v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 694, 120 S.Ct. 1795, 146 L.Ed.2d 727 (2000). The Court reasoned that \u201cexcept as otherwise provided\u201d at the beginning of \u00a7 3583(b) means that \u00a7 3583(b) only applies in the absence of a more specific provision. <em>Id. </em>When there is a more specific provision, such as \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) in this case, \u00a7 3583(b) gives way. <em>Id. </em>at 1179. The <em>Page </em>Court was persuaded because, when Congress enacted enhanced drug penalties, including \u00a7 841, they simultaneously added the words \u201cexcept as otherwise provided\u201d to \u00a7 3583(b) so the statutes would not conflict. <em>Id. </em>at 1178. Thus, Congress was aware of the conflict and synthesized the statutes by adding the \u201cexcept as otherwise provided\u201d language. Further, <em>Page </em>held that, giving meaning to the words \u201cat least\u201d in \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), means that a higher term than three years can be imposed; \u201cotherwise the words \u2018at least\u2019 have no meaning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1180. <em>Accord United States v. Abbington, </em>144 F.3d 1003, 1006 (6th Cir.1998). Applying the logic of our prior precedents, we conclude that even under a Class C felony, the district court\u2019s imposition of five years supervised release was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-11\">B. Whether the District Court Erred in Granting Nance\u2019s Motion for Acquittal of Count Two (\u00a7 924(c)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-12\">Count Two of the indictment charged Nance under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). There are three bases for convicting under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A): 1) use a firearm during and in relation to drug trafficking; 2) carry a firearm during and in relation to drug trafficking; or 3) possess a firearm in furtherance of drug trafficking.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The jury convicted Nance on Count Two, but the district court granted Nance\u2019s motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>acquittal under Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The Government challenges the district court\u2019s ruling, asserting that the jury\u2019s conviction can stand on either the \u2018carry during and in relation to\u2019 alternative or \u2018the possess in furtherance of alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>the denial or grant of an acquittal motion. <em>U.S. v. Wall, </em>130 F.3d 739, 742 (6th Cir.1997). We examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution to find if <em>any </em>rational trier of fact could have found the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThis court must uphold a jury verdict if there is substantial evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, to support it.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Wells, </em>211 F.3d 988, 1000 (6th Cir.2000). Thus, the question is whether \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d supports the jury\u2019s verdict. If so, the jury verdict should be reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">1. <em>Carrying a firearm during and in relation to drug trafficking</em></p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">The Government argues that a rational trier of fact could have found Nance was carrying a firearm during and in relation to drug trafficking since the guns were found in Nance\u2019s car, and an expert testified regarding the connection between guns and drugs in drug trafficking crimes. Nance counters that it is not enough to state generally that guns are tools of the drug trafficking trade when there is no other proof connecting the guns and drugs to a drug trafficking offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">There are two aspects to the \u2018carry a firearm during and in relation to\u2019 prong: 1) carrying the firearm, and 2) it must be \u201cduring and in relation to\u201d the drug trafficking. As for carrying the firearm, the \u201cmost obvious connotation\u201d is bearing a firearm on one\u2019s person. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>76 F.3d 111, 113 (6th Cir.1996). According to the Supreme Court, \u201ccarry a firearm\u201d also means \u201cknowingly possess[ing] and convey[ing] firearms in a vehicle, including in the locked glove compartment or trunk of a car, which the person accompanies.\u201d <em>Muscarello v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 125, 127, 118 S.Ct. 1911, 141 L.Ed.2d 111 (1998). The Sixth Circuit, in response to <em>Muscarello, </em>has concluded that \u201cthe proper inquiry is physical transportation\u201d for whether a firearm was carried. <em>Hilliard v. United States, </em>157 F.3d 444, 449 (6th Cir.l998).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">As for \u2018during and in relation to\u2019 the drug trafficking offense, the firearm \u201cmust have some purpose or effect with respect to the drug trafficking crime,\u201d and \u201cat least must \u2018facilitate, or have the potential of facilitating,\u2019 the drug trafficking offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Layne, </em>192 F.3d 556, 571 (6th Cir.1999) (quoting <em>Smith v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 223, 238, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993)). Moreover, this Court has further explained that to satisfy the \u201cin relation to\u201d requirement, \u201cthe evidence must support a finding that the firearm furthered the purpose or effect of the crime and that its presence or involvement was not the result of coinci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>dence.\u201d <em>United States v. Warwick, </em>167 F.3d 965, 971 (6th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">In light of this precedent, the Court finds it is impossible for a rational finder of fact to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Nance carried a firearm during and in relation to drug trafficking. First, there were no guns found on Nance\u2019s person. Second, Nance was not physically transporting the firearms found in his car. He was not \u2018accompanying\u2019 or \u2018conveying\u2019 the firearms at the time of his arrest. Finally, there is no evidence that the firearms in the car \u2018facilitated\u2019 or \u2018furthered\u2019 drug trafficking. The Government\u2019s one expert, while generally making the connection between guns and drugs, does not satisfy reasonable doubt here, where no other evidence of a connection was introduced. Instead, the evidence shows that Nance was moving out of his apartment, so the guns were in his car for that purpose. Thus, the district court did not err in acquitting Nance on the \u201ccarry\u201d prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">2. <em>Possess a firearm in furtherance of drug trafficking</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">The Government asserts that a reasonable fact finder could find beyond a reasonable doubt that Nance \u2018possessed a firearm in furtherance of drug trafficking,\u2019 because the police found a loaded semiautomatic pistol, twenty-seven rounds of ammunition, a .38 caliber revolver, and a shotgun in his car when they arrested him for having over five grams of crack. In response, Nance asserts that the phrase \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 has a very particularized meaning that requires a greater link between his drug possession and the firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">The \u201cpossess in furtherance of\u2019 language is a relatively recent addition to \u00a7 924(c)(1). <em>See </em>Criminal Use of Guns, Pub L. No. 105-386, 112 Stat. 3469 (Nov. 13, 1998). According to the House Report, the \u201cpossess in furtherance of\u2019 language is intended to be a \u201cslightly higher standard\u201d than the two \u201cduring and in relation to\u201d prongs. H.R. REP. NO. 105-344, 1997 WL 668339, at *12 (1997). The House Report states that the higher standard operates as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-9\">The government must clearly show that a firearm was possessed to advance or promote the commission of the underlying offense. The mere presence of a firearm in an area where a criminal act occurs is not a sufficient basis for imposing this particular mandatory sentence. Rather the government must illustrate through specific facts, which tie the defendant to the firearm, that the firearm was possessed to advance or promote the criminal activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">H.R. REP. NO. 105-344, 1997 WL 668339, at *12 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\"><em>United States v. Mackey </em>is this Court\u2019s only published opinion interpreting the \u201cpossess in furtherance of\u2019 language. 265 F.3d 457 (6th Cir.2001); <em>see also United States v. Johnson, </em>39 Fed.Appx. 114 (6th Cir.2002) (unpublished table disposition). After reviewing the House Report, the <em>Mackey </em>Court stated, \u201c[b]y requiring that the possession be \u2018in furtherance of the crime, Congress intended a specific nexus between the gun and the crime charged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 462. One way to demonstrate \u2018possession in furtherance\u2019 is by showing the guns were strategically located for quick and easy use. <em>Id. </em>The <em>Mackey </em>Court also recognized as helpful the five factors identified by the Fifth Circuit in <em>United States v. Ceballos-Torres, </em>218 F.3d 409, 414-15 (5th Cir.2000). The non-exclusive list of factors includes: 1) whether the firearm was loaded; 2) the type of firearm; 3) whether the weapon was stolen or legitimately possessed; 4) the type of drug activity conducted; and 5) the time and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>circumstances under which the gun was found. <em>Mackey, </em>265 F.3d at 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\"><em>Mackey </em>cites an example from the House Report that has particular relevance to our facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-6\">The facts of the <em>Bailey [v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 147, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed\u00fcd 472 (1995)] decision... provide a good example. The Committee believes that the evidence presented by the government in that case may not have been sufficient to sustain a conviction for possession of a firearm \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 the commission of a drug trafficking offense. In that case, a prosecution expert testified at Mr. Bailey\u2019s trial that drug dealers frequently carry a firearm to protect themselves, as well as their drugs and money. Standing on its own, this evidence may be insufficient to meet the \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 test. The government would have to show that the firearm located in the trunk of the car advanced or promoted Mr. Bailey\u2019s drug dealing activity. The Committee believes that one way to clearly satisfy the \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 test would be additional witness testimony connecting Mr. Bailey more specifically with the firearm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b93-7\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting H.R. REP. NO. 105-344 (1997), 1997 WL 668339, at *12).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">Similarly, in our case, the only facts linking the guns to the drugs is the general testimony by a DEA agent stating that drug traffickers usually have guns to facilitate trafficking. There are no specific facts linking Nance\u2019s guns to the drugs found on his person. In fact, the evidence shows the guns were in the car because Nance was moving. Applying the <em>Cebballos-Torres </em>factors, while one of the guns was loaded, they were not stolen, near the drugs, or immediately accessible. In addition, the drugs were found due to Whitt\u2019s tip, rather than from leads arising out of Nance\u2019s drug possession. Without more, Nance\u2019s possession merely constitutes \u201cthe presence of a firearm in an area where a criminal act occurs,\u201d which the House Report indicated \u201cis not a sufficient basis for imposing this particular mandatory sentence.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 105-344 (1997), 1997 WL 668339, at *12. Thus, the district court correctly found no reasonable jury could convict Nance under the possession in furtherance of prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">C. Whether the district court committed clear error in refusing to enhance Nance\u2019s sentence by two levels for possession of a weapon in connection with a drug offense under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-12\">When one is convicted of a drug crime, United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) calls for a two-level sentencing enhancement when the defendant also possessed a weapon. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) (\u201cIf a dangerous weapon was possessed (including a firearm), increase by 2 levels.\u201d). The commentary to \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) states that the enhancement \u201cshould be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-13\">Under Sixth Circuit precedent, when deciding whether to enhance the sentence two levels for possession of a weapon under Guideline \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), the Government must first show by a preponderance that 1) a weapon was possessed or constructively possessed,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 2) during the corn-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>mission of the offense. <em>United States v. Hill, </em>79 F.3d 1477, 1485 (6th Cir.1996). If the Government does so, the burden shifts to defendant to show that it is \u201cclearly improbable\u201d that the weapon was connected to the drug offense. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">The district court concluded that the connection between the gun and drugs was clearly improbable and declined to enhance the sentence. The district court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMD\">The court finds that an adjustment to the offense level pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)l is not applicable. At the time of the defendant\u2019s arrest he was in the parking lot of an apartment building. The firearms were found in the defendant\u2019s vehicle. But he was not in close proximity to the vehicle at the time of his arrest. No drugs were found in the vehicle. And there was no testimony that anyone had seen the defendant sell drugs from the vehicle or that anyone had ever seen the defendant sell drugs at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-5\">It is clearly improbable that the weapons were connected with the offense of possession with the intent to distribute cocaine base. The court will deny the government\u2019s recommendation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">We review for clear error the district court\u2019s factual determination that Nance did not possess a weapon during a drug trafficking crime. <em>U.S. v. Peters, </em>15 F.3d 540, 546 (6th Cir.1994). This deferential standard applies since the district court has the opportunity to weigh the credibility of the witnesses. <em>Id. </em>The district court\u2019s decision should be upheld as long as it is supported by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Ivery, </em>999 F.2d 1043, 1045 (6th Cir.1993); <em>see also Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, N.C., </em>470 U.S. 564, 573-74, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985) (\u201cIf the district court\u2019s account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">In <em>Peters, </em>the Sixth Circuit found that the district court\u2019s refusal to apply enhancement was not clearly erroneous where the gun was found in the dresser and the cocaine was found on top of that dresser. 15 F.3d at 546. <em>See also United States v. Siebe, </em>58 F.3d 161, 162 (5th Cir. 1995) (\u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) enhancement does not apply for guns seized in defendant\u2019s residence when there was no evidence that drug activity occurred there). Similarly, here, as the district court indicated, Nance was standing in a parking lot, away from his car. There were no drugs found inside the car. The testimony did not show that the car was used for trafficking; instead, it suggested the guns were only in the car because Nance was moving. More importantly, there was no testimony that anyone ever saw the defendant selling drugs, much less using a gun while selling them. The only evidence that made this a drug trafficking crime was the testimony of the expert stating that the amount of crack Nance had was consistent with trafficking. Given our deferential standard of review, we uphold the district court\u2019s refusal to apply a two-level enhancement under \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court on all three appeals: the imposition of five years supervised release, the acquittal on Count Two, and the decision not to impose a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) for pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>session of a firearm in connection with a drug offense.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b89-7\">. He is only challenging the supervised release term, not the 84 months imprisonment term.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b89-8\">. If a defendant possessed less than five grams of crack, he is sentenced under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). The statute mandates an imprisonment term of not more than 20 years and a term of at least three years supervised release.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b89-9\">. If a defendant possessed five grams or more of crack, he is sentenced under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). The statute mandates an imprisonment term of not less than five years and not more than 40 years and a term of at least four years supervised release.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b89-10\">. It is by no means clear that Nance wins on this argument, though. While he is correct that the specific amount of drugs was not contained in the indictment, the Class B felony statute, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) was cited, giving him notice that he could be convicted under the higher statute. In addition, the jury found by special verdict the specific amount of drugs that Mr. Nance possessed beyond a reasonable doubt. Both of these things may cure the <em>Apprendi </em>issue Nance raises. <em>Cf. United States v. Cotton, </em>- U.S. -,-, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 1786, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002) (holding that failure to allege the amount of drugs in the indictment was not plain error where there was \"overwhelming\u201d and \"uncontroverted evidence\u201d of defendants\u2019 guilt). However, since we find that even under the Class C felony provisions, the district court did not err in imposing a five year term of supervised release, the Court declines to rule on the <em>Apprendi </em>issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b90-8\">. Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-9\">Except to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by this subsection or by any other provision of law, any person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime (including a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime that provides for an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device) for which the person may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6q\">(i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AW\">(ii) if the firearm is brandished, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 7 years; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AS0\">(iii) if the firearm is discharged, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 10 years.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b91-8\">. The district court cited <em>United States v. Ri-ascos-Suarez, </em>73 F.3d 616, 623 (6th Cir. 1996), holding that \"the firearm must be immediately available for use \u2014 on the defendant or within his or her reach\u201d for a defendant to convicted under \u00a7 924(c)). We note that <em>Ri-ascos-Suarez </em>represents the old test for whether a firearm is carried in a vehicle. After <em>Muscarello, </em>the firearm no longer must be \"immediately available for use.\u201d 524 U.S. at 138, 118 S.Ct. 1911; <em>Hilliard, </em>157 F.3d at 449 (\"In light of <em>Muscarello </em>the language pertaining to immediate availability of a gun in an automobile no longer describes the test.\u201d). However, we agree with the district court\u2019s ultimate resolution on the carry prong.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b93-9\">.
