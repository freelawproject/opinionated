Keeby brought this civil rights action, see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that various prison and other state government officials violated his constitutional rights when he was incarcerated at the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City. The district court dismissed several claims on the grounds of immunity and failure to state a claim. <em>See 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. Twenty-two months later a different district judge (the first district judge recused himself) adopted the recommendation of a magistrate judge, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 636(b)(1)(C), and entered summary judgment in favor of the remaining defendants. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">Keeby\u2019s brief on appeal is a rambling chronicle of indignities inflicted upon him, and makes few discernible arguments as to how the judges in the district court erred in dismissing his claims. He does contend that the entry of summary judgment violated his Seventh Amendment rights. But the right to a jury trial exists only when there is some genuine issue of material fact to be determined, <em>Fid. &amp; Deposit Co. v. United States, </em>187 U.S. 315, 319-21, 23 S.Ct. 120, 47 L.Ed. 194 (1902); <em>United States v. Stangland, </em>242 F.2d 843, 848 (7th Cir.1957), and here there were no triable issues. Keeby also argues that Judge Sharp erred by not allowing him to appear in open court, but this too is frivolous \u2014 the court was free to rule on the defendants\u2019 summary judgment motions without a hearing. <em>See Brown-Bey v. United States, </em>720 F.2d 467, 470 (7th Cir.1983); Fed. R.Civ.P. 78; N.D. Ind. L.R. 56.1(c). Kee-by\u2019s remaining arguments are frivolous and do not warrant discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
