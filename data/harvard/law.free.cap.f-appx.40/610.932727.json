The court has determined that the issues presented occasion no need for an opinion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 36; D.C.Cir. Rule 36(b). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b628-16\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s judgment filed June 19, 2001, be affirmed. Even assuming appellant\u2019s counsel did not acquiesce in the imposition of a term of imprisonment and the district court failed to consider alternatives to revocation and incarceration, the revocation of supervised release and imposition of a six-month sentence did not constitute plain error. <em>See United States v. Drew, </em>200 F.3d 871, 879 (D.C.Cir.2000). According to the language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g), the district court was required to impose a term of imprisonment for appellant\u2019s failure to comply with the condition of supervised release requiring participation in the Probation Office\u2019s drug testing program.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-17\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. RApp. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
