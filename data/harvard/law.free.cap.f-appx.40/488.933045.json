Bolton, United States District Court for the District of Arizona, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b507-16\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-17\">Defendant Aaron Castro-Cardenas appeals his convictions for importing 28.4 kilograms of marijuana into the United States, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952 and 960, and for possessing the 28.4 kilograms of marijuana with the intent to distribute it, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-18\">Defendant first argues that his statements to Customs agents should have been suppressed at trial because Defendant did not expressly waive his <em>Miranda </em>rights. The Spanish-language form the agents used did not include the word \u201cwaiver.\u201d Nevertheless, Defendant was advised orally of all his <em>Miranda </em>rights and provided with a form explaining those rights in Spanish. Defendant initialed each advisement and answered \u201cyes\u201d when asked, \u201cAre you willing to answer some questions?\u201d The district court did not err in finding that Defendant\u2019s waiver was knowing and voluntary in the circumstances. <em>See United States v. Cazares, </em>121 F.3d 1241, 1244 (9th Cir.1997) (noting that a waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights requires neither a waiver form nor an explicit question regarding waiver).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-19\">Defendant also argues that his importation conviction cannot be sustained because he was never free from official restraint while in the United States. Thus, he argues, the government cannot prove \u201centry\u201d into the United States. \u201cEntry,\u201d as Defendant uses the word, is a term of art that we have restricted to the immigration context; \u201centry\u201d is not necessary to sustain an importation conviction. <em>United States v. Carranza, </em>289 F.3d 634, 642 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>Next, Defendant contends that \u00a7 841 and \u00a7 960 are unconstitutional after <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). As to \u00a7 841, this court foreclosed that argument in <em>United States v. Buckland, </em>289 F.3d 558, 571 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc) (as amended), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 2314, 152 L.Ed.2d 1067 (2002). As for \u00a7 960, <em>United States v. Mendoza-Paz, </em>286 F.3d 1104, 1109-10 (9th Cir.2002), affirms its constitutionality after <em>Apprendi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Defendant further challenges his conviction because drug type and amount were neither charged in the indictment nor included in the instructions. Mens rea as to drug type and amount need not be proved, as long as the government proves that the defendant knew that the substance imported or possessed was a controlled substance. <em>Apprendi </em>does not change this rule. <em>Carranza, </em>289 F.3d 634, 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Finally, Defendant argues that the district court erred by not applying a four-level downward adjustment for \u201cminimal\u201d participation. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(a). Instead, the court decreased Defendant\u2019s offense level by two levels to reflect that Defendant was a \u201cminor\u201d participant. We review for clear error the district court\u2019s decision to apply the adjustment for minimal or minor participation. <em>United States v. Hursh, </em>217 F.3d 761, 770 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">Explaining the reasons for the \u201cminor\u201d versus \u201cminimal\u201d participation adjustment, the district court noted that Defendant was the driver and sole occupant of the vehicle carrying the marijuana. On this record, the district court\u2019s decision to apply the two-level adjustment from \u00a7 3B1.2(b) instead of the four-level adjustment from \u00a7 3B1.2(a) was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b507-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
