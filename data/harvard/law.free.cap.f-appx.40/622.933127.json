Bazile initially sued the city, the police department, and various officers. However, she later withdrew her claims against all but the arresting officer. The district court held that because the arrest for trespass was \u201cat least arguably reasonable,\u201d the arresting officer was entitled to qualified immunity. We affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Bazile v. City of New York, et al, </em>00 Civ. 4727(LAP) (S.D.N.Y. June 18, 2001).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
