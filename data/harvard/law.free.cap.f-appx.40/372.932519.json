Babb claims on appeal that the sentencing court erred by (1) applying a two-point abuse of trust sentence. enhancement, and (2) ordering her to pay restitution under the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (\u201cMVRA\u201d) for theft that occurred prior to that statute\u2019s date of enactment. We reject Babb\u2019s argument that the sentence enhancement should not have been applied, but remand for a redetermination of the restitution amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">The sentencing court was correct to assess a \u00a7 3B1.3 two-point sentence enhancement for abuse of a position of public or private trust. 2000 U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.3. The applicability of \u00a7 3B1.3 in Babb\u2019s case is controlled by this Circuit\u2019s very recent decision in <em>United States v. Hoskins, </em>282 F.3d 772 (9th Cir.2002). The Court in <em>Hoskins </em>held that a K-Mart security guard was not subject to a \u00a7 3B1.3 enhancement for his participation in a robbery of a K-Mart. <em>Id. </em>at 779. More importantly for our purposes, the Court endorsed the use of two criteria to determine when \u00a7 3B1.3 should apply: \u201c(1) \u2018the inability of the trustor objectively and expediently to determine the trustee\u2019s honesty\u2019 and (2) \u2018the ease with which the trustee\u2019s activities can be observed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 778-79 (quoting <em>United States v. Hill, </em>915 F.2d 502, 507 (9th Cir.1990). Babb\u2019s thefts were not easily observed given that she stocked vending machines both within and away from the Klamath Falls Post Office; in addition, it wasn\u2019t easy for the USPS to determine Babb\u2019s honesty because she was the only vending machine clerk in the post office and wasn\u2019t caught for <em>years </em>after her thefts began.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-15\">Although we affirm the \u00a7 3B1.3 enhancement, we hold that the sentencing court erred when it ordered restitution under the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (\u201cMVRA\u201d) for Babb\u2019s thievery that occurred prior to that statute\u2019s date of enactment. We held in a case decided five years ago that application of the MVRA to conduct that occurred prior to the statute\u2019s enactment date would violate the ex post facto clause. <em>See United States v. Baggett, </em>125 F.3d 1319, 1322 (9th Cir.1997). The government has two responses to <em>Baggett. </em>The first is a request to simply overrule the case \u2014 but, as the government grudgingly recognizes, circuit precedent does not allow one panel to overrule an earlier decision of another panel. <em>United States v. Gay, </em>967 F.2d 322, 327 (9th Cir.1992). The second is the argument that Babb\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>offense here is akin to a conspiracy, which is considered a continuing violation under Circuit precedent and would therefore make the ex post facto discussion in <em>Bag-gett </em>inapposite. No evidence, however, was introduced suggesting a conspiracy, save the characterization of the repeated thefts by the court below as a \u201cscheme.\u201d We therefore reject the government\u2019s attempt to circumvent <em>Baggett.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">On remand, the district court should determine Babb\u2019s responsibility to make restitution for any theft that is shown to have occurred prior to April 24, 1996 under the statutory landscape as it existed before passage of the MVRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The case is REMANDED for proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b391-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
