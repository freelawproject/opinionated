Thomas, </em>274 F.3d 655 (2d Cir. 2001) <em>(en </em>banc). He bases his claims on the contention that his plea was not \u201cknowingly and voluntarily\u201d made because (i) the indictment did not precisely state the drug quantity and (ii) because he was not informed at his plea proceedings of the precise quantity of drugs and of his right to have a jury determine at trial each element of the offenses, including drug quantity.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Adderley\u2019s claims have no merit. Examination of the record reveals that the indictment stated the drug quantity charged with sufficient specificity, and that Adderley was informed at his plea proceeding both of the precise quantity of drugs that he had- a right to have a jury-determine at trial each element of the offenses charged, including drug quantity. Adderley\u2019s claim that his plea proceeding was inadequate under Rule 11 is similarly unavailing in light of the District Court\u2019s thorough determination that Adderley knew and understood the charges against him and the consequences of his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Finally, our holding in <em>Thomas </em>is not implicated here because <em>Thomas </em>requires that the quantity of drugs be charged in the indictment and found by a jury \u201conly in cases where the quantity results in a punishment above a statutory maximum.\u201d 274 F.3d at 660 n. 3. Here, Adderley was sentenced to less than the statutory maximum \u2014 and was, in fact, sentenced to just over the statutory minimum. Thus, he had no right under <em>Thomas </em>to have the quantity of drugs specified in the indictment and found by a jury.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
