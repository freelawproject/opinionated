We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-23\">Brown began serving supervised release on September 21, 2001. On October 5, 2001, the probation office filed a petition alleging that Brown had stopped taking prescribed medication in contravention of the probation officer\u2019s instructions, and had indecently exposed himself to a mental health counselor, thereby violating supervised release conditions requiring him to follow his probation officer\u2019s instructions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>to participate successfully in mental health counseling, and not to commit another federal, state, or local crime. After considering the counselor\u2019s testimony at the revocation hearing, the district court found that Brown had violated his release conditions, revoked supervised release, and sentenced Brown to 14 months imprisonment and 3 years additional supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Brown\u2019s counsel argues on appeal that the district court clearly erred in finding a factual basis for revoking Brown\u2019s supervised release. In a pro se supplemental brief, Brown argues that the revocation was premised on fabricated statements, and that the probation officer wrongly required him tq take medication as he was not under a doctor\u2019s order to do so. He also challenges the district judge\u2019s impartiality and counsel\u2019s effectiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">We conclude that the district court had ample evidence to find that Brown violated his supervised release based on the witness\u2019s testimony, and that Brown\u2019s challenge to her credibility is without merit. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>281 F.3d 746, 748 (8th Cir.2002) (credibility determinations are virtually unreviewable on appeal). We also reject Brown\u2019s other arguments: the district judge\u2019s unfavorable ruling does not suffice to demonstrate bias, <em>see United States v. Edwards, </em>159 F.3d 1117, 1131 (8th Cir.1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 825, 120 S.Ct. 310, 145 L.Ed.2d 64 (1999), Brown\u2019s complaints concerning counsel\u2019s effectiveness should not be raised on direct appeal, <em>see United States v. Embrey, </em>250 F.3d 1181, 1183-84 (8th Cir. 2001), and the requirement that Brown take prescribed medication did not play into the district court\u2019s decision to revoke supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed. We also grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b358-24\">. The Honorable Scott O. Wright, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
