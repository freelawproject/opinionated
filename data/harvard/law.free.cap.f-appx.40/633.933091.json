The January 28, 2002 order denied Johnson\u2019s first habe-as corpus petition, which sought relief against the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d), and stated that the INS had properly denied Johnson\u2019s naturalization application. The April 30, 2001 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>order closed the administrative record for Johnson\u2019s second habeas corpus petition, which Johnson filed <em>pro se. </em>We affirm both orders because the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to entertain either petition. Johnson does not satisfy the \u201cin custody\u201d predicate of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c) because he was not in the custody of the INS at the time he submitted his petitions for habeas relief. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(c). Even if we construe Johnson\u2019s <em>pro se </em>petition liberally so as to conclude that it seeks relief from the Bureau of Prisons, we find that the petition would be premature because, at the time Johnson submitted the petition, his criminal trial had not yet commenced. For the reasons set forth above, we AFFIRM. Furthermore, Johnson\u2019s motion for summary judgment in the 01-2298 appeal is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
