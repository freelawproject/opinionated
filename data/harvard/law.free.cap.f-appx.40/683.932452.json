Counsel for Hampton submitted an <em>Anders </em>brief concluding that there were no non-frivolous issues for appeal in this matter. <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S. Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Counsel moved to withdraw and we will grant the motion. Hampton has also filed a <em>pro se </em>brief, challenging the five-level increase in his sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) and alleging ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-11\">The first robbery, for which Hampton was convicted, occurred on December 30, 1998, and the second robbery occurred on May 13, 1999. In the District Court, the two robberies were included in one indictment charging Hampton with one count of conspiracy to commit armed bank robbery, two counts of armed bank robbery, and one count of using, carrying, and brandishing a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence. Hampton pled guilty to all counts. The District Court accepted Hampton\u2019s plea and sentenced him to 192 months of confinement. Both the plea and the sentence had been negotiated with the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-12\">Hampton claims on appeal that the District Court engaged in \u201cdouble counting\u201d when it charged Hampton with one bank robbery under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) and then imposed a five-level increase pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) in connection with the other bank robbery. A District Court\u2019s application of Sentencing Guidelines is subject to plenary review. <em>United States v. Mobley, </em>956 F.2d 450, 451 (3d Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-14\">Hampton argues that where a \u00a7 924(c) offense has been charged, the application of specific offense characteristics, such as possession, brandishing, use or discharge of an explosive or firearm, is prohibited. Accordingly, Hampton asserts that the five-level increase of his sentence under \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) is prohibited because he was charged under \u00a7 924(c). Hampton accuses the District Court of \u201cdouble-counting\u201d his sentence in violation of Application Note 2 of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-15\">Hampton\u2019s claim lacks merit. While correctly citing to Application Note 2, Hampton failed to review Application Note 2 in its entirety. The Note specifically provides that \u201cif a defendant is convicted on two armed bank robberies, but is convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) in connection with one of the robberies, a weapon enhancement would apply to the bank robbery which was not the basis for the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) conviction.\u201d These are precisely the circumstances in this case. Hampton was charged under \u00a7 924(c) for only the May 13, 1999, robbery. Therefore, \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) is applicable to the sentence imposed for the December 30, 1998, robbery. The District Court did not \u201cdouble-count\u201d Hampton\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-16\">Next, Hampton alleges that his counsel was ineffective. However, we decline to entertain ineffective assistance claims on direct appeal, preferring to develop a fuller factual record through 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceedings. <em>United States v. Gambino, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>788 F.2d 938, 950 (3d Cir.1986). Hampton presents no reason to depart from such procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">We will, therefore, affirm the judgment of sentence of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
