NELSON, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b485-20\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-21\">We affirm Bert\u2019s convictions. We address all of the issues Bert raises on appeal in this unpublished memorandum. We address the Government\u2019s cross-appeal in a contemporaneously filed published opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>I. Bert\u2019s Motion To Suppress</p>\n<p id=\"AEN\">We reject Bert\u2019s argument that he was detained and searched in violation of the Fourth Amendment when he and the officers left the train terminal building. We conclude that the officers had reasonable suspicion to detain Bert outside the building and obtained the drugs in a valid search incident to arrest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">\u201c[T]he police can stop and briefly detain a person for investigative purposes if the officer has a reasonable suspicion supported by articulable facts that criminal activity \u2018may be afoot,\u2019 even if the officer lacks probable cause.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In determining whether reasonable suspicion supported a detention, a court \u201cmust look at the totality of the circumstances of each case to see whether the detaining officer has a particularized and objective basis for suspecting legal wrongdoing.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While mere correspondence to a drug courier profile does not provide reasonable suspicion,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the combination of a profile match with factors such as traveling under an assumed name, or the giving of evasive answers to an officer\u2019s questions, can supply reasonable suspicion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-12\">It is undisputed that Bert matched a drug courier profile. Moreover, in answering Officer Paskwietz\u2019s questions\u2014 while still inside the building \u2014 Bert gave Paskwietz a name that was different than that on Bert\u2019s train ticket, a home town that was different than the address on Bert\u2019s identification, and a ticket-purchase date that Paskwietz knew to be incorrect. Under the totality of these circumstances, Paskwietz had reasonable suspicion to detain Bert by the time he and the officers left the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-13\">Once outside, the officers had probable cause to arrest Bert after he unzipped his shoulder bag and the officers saw within an object wrapped in white plastic that, based on the officers\u2019 experience and training, was consistent with the type of package used to smuggle illegal drugs.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under the search incident to arrest exception to the warrant requirement, the officers were then justified in searching Bert\u2019s shoulder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>bag, which was in his \u201cimmediate control\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> because it was slung around his neck. Thus, the search of Bert\u2019s shoulder bag, and the events leading up to it, did not violate the Fourth Amendment. Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Bert\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">II. Bert\u2019s Request for an Evidentiary Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">\u201cAn evidentiary hearing must be held only when the moving papers allege facts which are sufficiently definite, clear, and specific to enable the trial court to conclude that contested issues of fact exist.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cA hearing is not required on a motion to suppress if the grounds for suppression consist solely of conelusory allegations of illegality.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Agent Delaney \u2014 who received the confidential information that \u201cErick Bert\u201d matched a drug carrier profile \u2014 stated under oath that the profile did not contain a racial element and that the confidential informant did not inform Delaney of \u201cErick Bert\u2019s\u201d race. Bert, on the other hand, alleged no specific facts other than his freestanding claim that he was a victim of racial profiling. Thus, Bert offered nothing more than a conelusory allegation of illegality. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Bert\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-13\">III. The Expert Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b487-14\">Federal Rule of Evidence 704(b) prohibits an expert from \u201cstaffing] an opinion or inference\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that would \u201cnecessarily compel the conclusion\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that the defendant had the required mental state for the crime with which the defendant is charged. Bert argues that Delaney directly testified that Bert intended to distribute the drugs, or that it necessarily follows from Delaney\u2019s testimony that Bert so intended. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-15\">Delaney\u2019s testimony is indistinguishable from that of the expert in <em>United States v. </em>Gomez-Norena,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> who \u201cmerely testified that possession of large amounts of cocaine is consistent with an intent to distribute it.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Such testimony does not amount to an \u201cexplicit opinion\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> or inference as to a defendant\u2019s mental state,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> nor does it necessarily compel any conclusion in that regard.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>did not err in admitting Delaney\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">IV. Bert\u2019s Motion to Acquit for Insufficient Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">We have expressly held that \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine \u201cis synonymous with \u2018rock\u2019 cocaine.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Both Paskwietz and Delaney testified that the substance at issue was \u201crock\u201d cocaine, either by directly identifying it as such or by agreeing with the examiner\u2019s characterization of the substance as \u201crock\u201d cocaine. Thus, there was ample evidence from which a rational finder of fact could have concluded that Bert possessed \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Bert\u2019s motion for acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">V. Bert\u2019s Knowledge of the Type and Quantity of Drugs</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\"><em>\u201cApprendi </em>did not change the long established rule that the government need not prove that the defendant knew the <em>type </em>and <em>amount </em>of a controlled substance that he imported or possessed; the government need only show that the defendant knew that he imported or possessed <em>some </em>controlled substance.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Bert\u2019s contrary argument that <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey </em><footnotemark>21</footnotemark> requires that drug types and quantities must now be viewed as elements of a \u00a7 841 offense is unpersuasive. <em>\u201cApprendi </em>eschews the distinction between sentencing factors and elements of a crime.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Section 841 merely has \u201cseparate statutory provisions governing [the] substantive offense and [the] sentencing factors,\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> a structure wholly acceptable under <em>Apprendi</em><footnotemark><em>24</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Thus, the district court did not err in instructing the jury that it need only find that Bert knew that he possessed some kind of prohibited drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-12\">VI. Bert\u2019s Prior Conviction</p>\n<p id=\"b488-13\">\u201c \u2018Under the current state of the law, the Constitution does not require prior convictions that increase a statutory penalty to be charged in the indictment and proved before a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d \u2019<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Bert does not dispute that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>had a valid prior conviction. Accordingly, the district court did not err in enhancing Bert\u2019s sentence even though his prior conviction had not been charged in the indictment nor proven to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Convictions AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b485-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b486-5\">. \"[W]e are not bound by the court\u2019s reasoning and may affirm on any ground having support in the record.\" <em>Miranda v.
