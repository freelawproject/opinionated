Kendricks\u2019 claimed disability allegedly resulted from an incident where he \u201cfell on Westhab grounds [and] hit [his] head.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-21\">In August 1999, Westhab moved to dismiss Kendrick\u2019s complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). Kendricks opposed Westhab\u2019s motion. In February 2000, Magistrate Judge Ellis issued a report and recommendation suggesting that Westhab\u2019s motion to dismiss should be granted. The Magistrate Judge also advised that because Kendricks was filing <em>pro se, </em>he should be granted leave to replead his disability and retaliation claims. Kendricks filed an objection. By order entered September 26, 2000, the district court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s report and recommendation in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-22\">Kendricks exercised his option to re-plead and filed an amended complaint in January 2001. In his amended complaint, Kendricks alleged (1) that Westhab violated the ADA by not accommodating his disability, which was the result of an accident on Westhab\u2019s premises; (2) that Westhab and its employees conspired to prevent his receipt of benefits by providing false information to the state insurance fund; and (3) that he was terminated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>retaliation for his activism in speaking out against Westhab\u2019s discriminatory practices. In February 2001, Westhab moved to dismiss Kendricks\u2019 complaint, arguing (1) that Kendricks\u2019 claims of retaliation were conclusory, vague, and not raised in his Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) complaint; (2) that falling and hitting one\u2019s head is not a disability under the ADA; (8) that Kendricks\u2019 claims of nonaccommodation were conclusory; (4) that Kendricks\u2019 remaining claims were conclusory; (5) that Kendricks\u2019 entire complaint was untimely; and (6) that Ken-dricks\u2019 claims were barred by the statute of limitations. Kendricks opposed Westh-ab\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">On September 5, 2001, the Magistrate Judge Ellis issued a report and recommendation suggesting that Westhab\u2019s motion to dismiss be granted. With respect to Kendricks\u2019 ADA discrimination claim, the Magistrate Judge found (1) that Kendricks had neither alleged nor shown that his head injury limited a major life activity or that he was regarded as being disabled and therefore hadn\u2019t alleged sufficient facts to show a disability under the ADA; (2) that even if he were disabled, Ken-dricks had not shown that Westhab knew of that disability; and (3) that Westhab had accommodated his head injury by granting him approximately three months leave of absence. With respect to Ken-dricks\u2019 retaliation claim, the Magistrate Judge found that Kendricks\u2019 allegations were vague and had indicated neither that his statements constituted protected activity nor that there was any causal link between the statements and his dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">Kendricks objected to the Magistrate Judge\u2019s report and recommendation. On October 17, 2001, after having received the objections, the court entered final judgment accepting the report and recommendation in its entirety. Kendricks appeals from this judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">The Magistrate Judge and the district court admirably gave the appellant any number of opportunities to amend, clarify, and correct his complaint. We have examined all of appellant\u2019s claims and find them meritless, for substantially the same reasons stated by the Magistrate Judge\u2019s report and recommendation of September 5, 2001, as adopted by the district court. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
