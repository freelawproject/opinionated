The district court sentenced Johnson to 360 months imprisonment. Johnson subsequently filed a petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (1994) in the Eastern District of North Carolina. In that petition, Johnson challenged his sentence based upon <em>Apprendi </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number><em>v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Johnson has never sought post-conviction relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Johnson stated that he filed a \u00a7 2241 petition because the one-year statute of limitations had run for a motion pursuant to \u00a7 2255. The district court concluded that \u00a7 2255 is not rendered inadequate or ineffective merely because an individual is unable to obtain relief under that provision, <em>see In re: Jones, </em>226 F.3d 328, 333 (4th Cir.2000), and accordingly construed Johnson\u2019s petition as an action filed under \u00a7 2255. So construed, the district court denied the motion as time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Subsequent to the district court\u2019s order, this Court held that <em>Apprendi </em>claims could not be initially raised in a \u00a7 2255 proceeding. <em>United States v. Sanders, </em>247 F.3d 139, 146 (4th Cir.2001). More recently, the Court has held that <em>Apprendi </em>claims are not cognizable in a \u00a7 2241 petition because <em>Apprendi </em>does not apply retroactively and \u00a7 2255 is not rendered inadequate or ineffective merely because a ha-beas petitioner, such as Johnson, is barred from filing a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See San Miguel v. Dove, </em>291 F.3d 257, 260-61 &amp; n. 2 (4th Cir.2002). Thus, Johnson\u2019s claim is not cognizable regardless of whether it is considered as a petition under \u00a7 2241 or a motion under \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
