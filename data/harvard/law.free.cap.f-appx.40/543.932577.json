Malcolm entered a guilty plea to the charge, and the district court sentenced her to twelve months and one day of imprisonment, followed by 60 months of supervised released. The United States appeals the sentence. The government assigns error to the district court\u2019s decision to make downward departures in Malcolm\u2019s sentence for aberrant behavior and diminished capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">A district court\u2019s decision to depart from the Federal Sentencing Guidelines is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Sabian, </em>114 F.3d 913, 916 (9th Cir.1997) (en banc) (citing <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 98-100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996)). \u201cA district court\u2019s decision to depart from the Guidelines ... will in most cases be due substantial deference, for it embodies the traditional exercise of discretion by a sentencing court.\u201d <em>Koon, </em>518 U.S. at 98, 116 S.Ct. 2035 (citation omitted). \u201cThat a departure decision, in an occasional case, may call for a legal determination does not mean, as a consequence, that parts of the review must be labeled de novo while other parts are labeled an abuse of discretion. The abuse-of-discretion standard includes review to determine that the discretion was not guided by erroneous legal conclusions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 100, 116 S.Ct. 2035 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">First, the government assigns error to the downward departure for aberrant behavior, arguing that Malcolm\u2019s criminal conduct does not meet the requirements set forth in the Federal Sen-fencing Guidelines: \u201c \u2018Aberrant behavior\u2019 means a single criminal occurrence or single criminal transaction that (A) was committed without significant planning; (B) was of limited duration; and (C) represents a marked deviation by the defendant from an otherwise law-abiding-abiding life.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (U.S.S.G.) \u00a7 5K2.20, cmt. n. 1 (2000). Malcolm had one criminal history point, based on a misdemeanor theft conviction. Also, the district court credited testimony that Malcolm had confessed to a recent, similar act of drug smuggling. (Malcolm was not charged with that prior act.) The court nevertheless found that \u201cin the overall scheme of her real life this [criminal behavior] is a departure from what her life had been.\u201d The aberrant behavior departure is not limited to persons with <em>no </em>criminal history. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.20(4) (stating that the court may not depart on the basis of aberrant behavior if the defendant has more than one criminal history point). While support for the departure is dubious, we will not characterize it as an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">Second, the government claims that the district court erred when it granted a downward departure for diminished capacity. \u201c \u2018Significantly reduced mental capacity\u2019 means the defendant, although convicted, has a significantly impaired ability to (A) understand the wrongfulness of the behavior comprising the offense or to exercise the power of reason; or (B) control behavior that the defendant knows is wrongful.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.13, cmt. n. 1. The only evidence presented by Malcolm that she qualified for this downward departure was a three-sentence letter from her treating psychiatrist stating that Malcolm suffers from \u201can anxiety disorder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>(panic disorder with agoraphobia).\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Malcolm\u2019s treating psychiatrist did not testify. Moreover, the clinical psychologist who evaluated Malcolm for sentencing purposes found that Malcolm\u2019s mental capacity was not reduced and that she was probably misrepresenting the extent of her psychological problems. At the June 28, 2001 sentencing hearing, the district court had the conflicting reports of the two experts. The court commented that \u201c[i]f you end up with two competing documents, one criticizing the other, then ... the defendant hasn\u2019t carried his burden in terms of proving diminished capacity.\u201d The court then continued the sentencing hearing in order to allow Malcolm to gather and present additional evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">At the July 9, 2001 sentencing hearing, the evidence before the court was materially identical to the evidence at the first sentencing hearing. Although the district court again acknowledged the inconsistency (\u201cHer psychiatrist says she has mental problems. The other psychiatrist says she is malingering.\u201d), it allowed a two level downward departure for diminished mental capacity, without any explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">A district court is required to articulate the reasons for its decision to depart and for the extent of the departure. <em>See United States v. Working, </em>224 F.3d 1093, 1102 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc) \u201cThe requirement that the district court explain its reasons for assigning a departure ... is indispensable to furthering the fundamental goal of the Sentencing Reform Act, which is to place federal sentencing on an objective, uniform, and rational (or at least articulable, nonintuitive) basis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The record here does not reveal how an anxiety disorder would significantly impair Malcolm\u2019s ability to \u201cunderstand the wrongfulness of [her] behavior,\u201d \u201cexercise the power of reason,\u201d or \u201ccontrol behavior that [Malcolm] knows is wrongful.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.13, cmt. n. 1. Accordingly, we remand to the district court to provide an adequate evidentiary basis for the downward departure for diminished capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">REVERSE and REMAND.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b562-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b563-7\">. The letter also states that Malcolm \u201chas some depression in reaction to current problems,\u201d but this is not relevant for sentencing purposes since it appears that the depression is a symptom of her arrest and prosecution. The letter also states that Malcolm \"has alcohol abuse problems in remission.\u201d This is irrelevant for two reasons: if the problem is in remission, it is not clear how, if at all, it affected her when she committed the crime. Second, the Sentencing Guidelines specifically prohibit a departure for diminished capacity if \u201cthe significantly reduced mental capacity was caused by the voluntary use of drugs or other intoxicants.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.13.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
