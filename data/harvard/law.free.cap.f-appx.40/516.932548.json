R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b535-8\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">Antonio Deagueros-Cortes appeals the 48-month sentence imposed following his guilty-plea conviction for illegal re-entry in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. We review sentencing issues raised for the first time on appeal for plain error. <em>See United States v. Randall, </em>162 F.3d 557, 561 (9th Cir.1998). We reverse and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">Deagueros-Cortes contends that the district court erred in imposing a 16-level upward adjustment under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) (1997) because his prior Arizona convictions for driving under the influence and attempted sexual assault were not aggravated felonies under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">Because Deagueros-Cortes only received a six-month sentence for the attempted sexual assault conviction, that offense does not qualify as an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F) (1997) (requiring imposition of one year sentence for violent crimes). <em>See also Alberto-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>215 F.3d 906, 910 (9th Cir.2000) (holding that the term of imprisonment as defined by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(f) (1997) refers \u201cto the actual sentence imposed by the trial judge\u201d). We have previously held that a prior California conviction for felony driving under the influence is not an aggravated felony conviction. <em>United States v. Trinidad-Aquino, </em>259 F.3d 1140, 1146 (9th Cir.2001); <em>Cf. United States v. Hernandez-Castellanos, </em>287 F.3d 876, 881 (9th Cir.2002) (holding that Arizona offense of felony endangerment was not categorically an aggravated felony). As a result, the 16-level enhancement was plain error, and it had a substantial effect on Deaguerros-Cortes\u2019s sentence. Accordingly, we exercise our discretion to notice the error, and we reverse. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-14\">REVERSED and REMANDED for RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b535-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
