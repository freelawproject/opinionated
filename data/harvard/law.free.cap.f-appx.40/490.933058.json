We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">Varela\u2019s argument that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960 is unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), is foreclosed by our recent decisions in <em>United States v. Mendozar-Paz, </em>286 F.3d 1104, 1109-10 (9th Cir. 2002) (applying <em>United States v. Buckland, </em>277 F.3d 1173 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to hold that \u00a7 960 is constitutional).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-14\">The district court did not err by concluding that the government was not required to prove that Varela was aware of the type and quantity of the drug that he imported. We recently determined that <em>\u201cApprendi </em>did not change the long established rule that the government need not prove that the defendant knew the <em>type </em>and <em>amount </em>of a controlled substance that he imported or possessed; the government need only show that the defendant knew that he imported or possessed <em>some </em>controlled substance.\u201d <em>United States v. Carranza, </em>289 F.3d 634, 2002 WL 841175, at *7 (9th Cir. May 3, 2002) (citing <em>United States v. Salazar, </em>5 F.3d 445, 446 (9th Cir.1993)). Varela acknowledged in his plea agreement that he \u201cintentionally brought marijuana into the United States\u201d and that he \u201cknew it was marijuana or some other prohibited drug;\u201d therefore, the mens rea requirement was satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-15\">The district court correctly denied Varela\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment based on his contention that the government failed to comply with the Speedy Trial Act (\u201cSTA\u201d) requirement that the government file an indictment within 30 days from the day of arrest. Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(d)(1), the STA \u201cclock\u201d was refreshed when the original indictment was dismissed upon Varela\u2019s own motion. <em>See United States v. Feldman, </em>788 F.2d 544, 548 (9th Cir.1986); <em>United States v. McCown, </em>711 F.2d 1441, 1446 (9th Cir. 1983). Because the dismissal of the first indictment caused the STA \u201cclock\u201d to be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>gin running anew, the government\u2019s August 23, 1999, filing of the second indictment, which charged Varela with the same offenses, came well within 30 days, and therefore, did not violate the STA. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Finally, Varela contends that the district court erred in failing to indicate whether dismissal of the original indictment was with or without prejudice and \u201cmade no findings in this regard____\u201d While Varela was correct when this appeal was commenced, we ordered a limited remand expressly for the purpose of enabling the district court to state whether its earlier dismissal was with or without prejudice. In response, the district court specifically found that the prior dismissal was without prejudice and further listed its reasons and findings in support of its determination. That being the case, there was no bar to the government filing and proceeding on a second indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b509-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Cir.
