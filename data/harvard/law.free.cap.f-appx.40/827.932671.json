(JA Vol. 1, 12-14, 183-84). He appeals his sentence, contending that the district court improperly enhanced his offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">The probation officer recommended that Whitaker\u2019s offense level be enhanced by two levels for obstruction of justice. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3C1.1 (2000). This recommendation was based upon Whitaker\u2019s flight from a police officer who unsuccessfully attempted to arrest him. After Whitaker objected to this enhancement, the probation officer noted that Whitaker fled from the officer at a high rate of speed, and referred to USSG \u00a7 3C1.2, Reckless Endangerment During Flight. The district court denied Whitaker\u2019s objection to the enhancement based upon the reasons provided in the addendum to the presentence report. The district court sentenced Whitaker to a total of 295 months imprisonment, five years supervised release, and a $500 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-11\">On appeal, Whitaker argues that his offense level was improperly enhanced for obstruction of justice because flight from arrest is an example of conduct to which the obstruction of justice enhancement does not apply. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.5(d)). While Whitaker correctly asserts that the probation officer incorrectly stated that avoiding or fleeing arrest is an example of conduct that is considered a proper basis for a \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement, we conclude that the district court correctly applied a two level enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-12\">We review the district court\u2019s determination that Whitaker\u2019s conduct constituted reckless endangerment under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>United States v. Slo-ley, </em>19 F.3d 149, 154 (4th Cir.1994). The adjustment applies if the defendant recklessly created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person while fleeing from a law enforcement officer. USSG \u00a7 3C1.2. A defendant\u2019s conduct is reckless when he \u201cwas aware of the risk created by his conduct and the risk was of such a nature and degree that to disregard that risk constituted a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise in such a situation.\u201d <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 3C1.2, comment. (n.2); \u00a7 2A1.4, comment, (n.l). We have previously held that \u201cthe endangerment of the lives of law enforcement officers and innocent bystanders\u201d is sufficient to support an obstruction of justice enhancement. <em>United States v. Hicks, </em>948 F.2d 877, 884 (4th Cir.1991).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-13\">The record indicates that Whitaker fled from the officer at speeds more than double the speed limit in the residential area <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>through which he traveled. Moreover, the officer testified that residents of the neighborhood, including children, were out in their yards at the time of the pursuit. We are convinced that \u201c[m]ore than mere flight was involved, and the district court could correctly make a two level adjustment for obstruction of justice on that basis.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Whitaker\u2019s convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b846-7\">. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b846-8\">. At the time Hicks was sentenced, \u00a7 3C1.2 of the Guidelines was not yet effective. This Court construed \u00a7 3C1.1 and determined enhancement was appropriate under that provision. <em>Hicks, </em>948 F.2d at 884 n. 5. We conclude that the facts in <em>Hides </em>clearly also support enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
