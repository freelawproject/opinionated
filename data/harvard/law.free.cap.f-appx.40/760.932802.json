We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-17\">NCRIC insures doctors against medical malpractice claims. In 1987, NCRIC insured Dr. George E. Daniel, a Maryland physician, under a \u201cclaims-made\u201d policy. The policy required NCRIC to indemnify Daniel for \u201c[a]ll sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages, to which this insurance applies, because of any claim or claims first made against the insured during the policy period caused by a medical incident.\u201d J.A. 109-10. It also obliged NCRIC \u201cto defend any suit against the insured seeking damages because of [an] injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-18\">From April to November 1987, Daniel treated Ball for migraine headaches and depression. During home visits, he would administer to Ball a variety of drugs, none of which had been prescribed to her. These drugs would put Ball into a state of stupor, during which time Daniel would sometimes coerce her into having sex with him. Ball <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>also became addicted to the drugs, causing her severe health problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">Daniel was arrested in November 1987 on separate charges of illegally selling narcotics. He was arraigned and released on $200,000 bond, after which he fled the country and did not return for his February 22, 1988 guilty plea date. Daniel was subsequently apprehended in May 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Ball learned of her potential malpractice claim in late 1987. Her attorney spoke with a NCRIC claims representative on December 14, 1987 and the following day prepared and had hand-delivered a letter advising NCRIC of Ball\u2019s medical malpractice claim against Daniel. As a result of this notice, NCRIC telephoned Daniel at his home and at his office in January 1988, but the phones were disconnected. NCRIC then advised Ball\u2019s counsel in May 1988 that it would investigate the claim. On approximately May 27, 1988, NCRIC sent letters requesting Daniel\u2019s cooperation to three different addresses, including one in Canada that Daniel had given NCRIC. By this time, however, Daniel was a fugitive, and NCRIC received no response.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Almost four years later, in April 1992, Ball filed a formal arbitration claim before the Maryland Health Claims Arbitration Office (HCA). Nothing happened regarding her claim for over a year, but on July 14, 1993, Ball\u2019s attorney wrote NCRIC informing it that Daniel had been served on April 3, 1993. Counsel also provided NCRIC with a claim statement and affidavit of service filed with the HCA panel on April 28, 1993 showing Daniel\u2019s then-current address in a federal prison in Seago-ville, Texas. After receiving the letter, NCRIC did not contact Daniel, nor did it take any other action with regard to the claim other than to maintain that the claim was made outside Daniel\u2019s policy period.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-10\">In March 1995, Ball moved for an order of default against Daniel, and she was awarded a default judgment on September 24, 1996. Ball then instituted this action against NCRIC to collect under Daniel\u2019s liability insurance policy. NCRIC raised several defenses, including that Ball\u2019s claim against Daniel fell outside of the policy period, that Daniel breached his duties to notify NCRIC of a claim and to cooperate with its investigation, and that the damage award was the result of an intentional tort and therefore outside the scope of the policy. Both parties moved for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-11\">The district court granted NCRIC\u2019s motion and denied Ball\u2019s. The court concluded that as a matter of Maryland law NCRIC made a good faith effort to investigate Ball\u2019s claim when it sent letters to Daniel at all of his known addresses, but that Daniel wilfully refused to cooperate. The court also concluded as a matter of law that NCRIC was prejudiced by Daniel\u2019s noncooperation because had he cooperated, he might have provided testimony that would have demonstrated either that he was not liable to Ball or that NCRIC had no duty to indemnify Daniel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court ruled that Daniel\u2019s noncooperation justified NCRIC\u2019s denial of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-14\">Ball contends that the district court erred in ruling as a matter of law that NCRIC was prejudiced by Daniel\u2019s noncooperation. We review the grant of sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>mary judgment de novo, viewing the disputed facts in the light most favorable to Ball. <em>See Figgie Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Destiler\u00eda Serradles, Inc., </em>190 F.3d 252, 255 (4th Cir. 1999). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Maryland law provides that a liability insurer may not deny coverage based on the insured\u2019s breach of a cooperation clause unless the insurer proves that it was prejudiced by the breach.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Md. Code Ann., Insurance \u00a7 19-110 (1997); <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>363 Md. 106, 767 A.2d 831, 840 (2001). In this regard, the insurer must establish that the insured\u2019s willful failure to cooperate \u201chas, or may reasonably have, precluded the insurer from establishing a legitimate jury issue of the insured\u2019s liability.\u201d <em>Allstate, </em>767 A.2d at 843.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Here, the district court erred in ruling as a matter of law that NCRIC met that standard. NCRIC has not demonstrated that Daniel\u2019s failure to cooperate while he was a fugitive hindered its ability to defend itself against Ball\u2019s suit. Even assuming that Daniel\u2019s cooperation might aid NCRIC\u2019s defense, there is nothing in the record to show that the value of such assistance diminished between 1988 (when he became a fugitive) and 1993 (when NCRIC was informed he had been apprehended). Moreover, there is no evidence that Daniel would not have cooperated in NCRIC\u2019s investigation had NCRIC contacted him when it learned he had been apprehended. Accordingly, because NCRIC has not demonstrated prejudice as a matter of law from any event other than its own decision not to investigate Ball\u2019s claim once it located Daniel, Daniel\u2019s failure to cooperate while he was a fugitive does not justify NCRIC\u2019s denial of coverage. <em>See Gen. Accident Ins. Co. v. Scott, </em>107 Md.App. 603, 669 A.2d 773, 780 (1996) (\u201cAn insurer cannot assert prejudice with regard to its ability to conduct an investigation that it never even tried to conduct.\u201d); <em>see also </em>14 <em>Couch on Insurance </em>\u00a7 199:21 (3d ed.1999) (explaining that liability insurer cannot deny claim based on insured\u2019s noncooperation unless insurer has exercised reasonable diligence in seeking insured\u2019s cooperation).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">NCRIC argues as an alternative basis for affirming the grant of summary judgment that, as a matter of law, it was prejudiced by Daniel\u2019s failure to notify it of Ball\u2019s claim. <em>See </em>Md.Code Ann., Insurance \u00a7 19-110 (providing that insurer may not deny coverage based on insured\u2019s breach of duty to provide notice of claim unless insurer proves prejudice from breach). Ball contends that her own notice to NCRIC prevented any prejudice. We agree with Ball.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-11\">Ball forecasted evidence that her attorney telephoned NCRIC regarding her claim on December 14, 1987 and had a follow-up letter delivered the next day. Indeed, NCRIC\u2019s May 27, 1988 letters to Daniel requesting his cooperation confirm that NCRIC was not prejudiced by any notice failure on Daniel\u2019s part. <em>See </em>J.A. 137 (letter from NCRIC to Daniel stating that \u201cNCRIC has been notified of a claim against you for alleged negligent treatment of [your] patient, Patricia [Ball]\u201d). Accordingly, we reject NCRIC\u2019s suggestion that the grant of summary judgment can be affirmed on this basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>C.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">NCRIC further maintains that the grant of summary judgment should be affirmed because Ball\u2019s claim was made outside of the policy period. NCRIC notes that Ball\u2019s HCA action was filed in 1992 and Daniel\u2019s policy expired January 1, 1988. Ball responds that claims are considered to be made under the policy when NCRIC receives written notice of the claim, which here was December 15, 1987. Again, we agree with Ball.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">As is relevant here, the policy obligates NCRIC to indemnify Daniel for \u201c[a]ll sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages, to which this insurance applies, because of any claim or claims first made against the insured during the policy period.\u201d Id. at 109-10. The policy provides that \u201c[a] claim shall be considered to be first made when [NCRIC] first receives written notice of the claim or occurrence.\u201d Id. at 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">NCRIC received written notice of the claim on December 15, 1987 in the form of the letter from Ball\u2019s attorney confirming his earlier telephone conversation concerning Ball\u2019s medical malpractice claim against Daniel.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> NCRIC argues that a claim is not considered to be made when NCRIC first receives written notice of the claim if the notice was provided by a third party rather than by the insured. NCRIC\u2019s interpretation is at odds with the unambiguous language of the policy, however. <em>See Fister v. Allstate Life Ins. Co., </em>366 Md. 201, 783 A.2d 194, 203 (2001) (explaining that if the language of an insurance policy is unambiguous, it is to be given its plain meaning). Although the policy does obligate Daniel himself to notify NCRIC of any occurrence, claim, or suit to which the policy applies, this obligation appears in a separate section of the policy from the language concerning when a claim is considered to have been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-10\">NCRIC also apparently argues that there could have been no claim for Ball to give notice of in 1987 because the terms \u201cclaim\u201d and \u201csuit\u201d are synonymous and Ball had not yet filed a lawsuit in 1987. We disagree. Although \u201cclaim\u201d and \u201csuit\u201d are not defined in the policy, the most common meaning of the noun \u201cclaim\u201d is \u201cdemand.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s 3d New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>414 (1981); <em>see Bushey v. N. Assurance Co. of Am., </em>362 Md. 626, 766 A.2d 598, 600 (2001) (explaining that words in an insurance policy are to be given their ordinary meaning unless another meaning is indicated). And, the language of the policy further suggests that a claim can exist before a lawsuit is filed. <em>See, e.g., </em>J.A. 110 (obligating NCRIC to defend a \u201csuit\u201d against the insured but giving NCRIC authority to settle any \u201cclaim or suit\u201d with the insured\u2019s consent).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-12\">Ball also argues that the district court erred in denying her cross-motion for summary judgment. Because the denial of Ball\u2019s motion is an unappealable interlocutory order, we decline to consider her challenge to that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-13\">An order denying a motion for summary judgment is generally an unappealable interlocutory order. <em>See O\u2019Connor v. United States, </em>956 F.2d 48, 52 (4th Cir.1992). Such an order does not become appealable merely by virtue of our review and reversal of a grant of summary judgment to the opposing party. <em>See id. </em>This court may have jurisdiction to review an otherwise unappealable order if (1) it is inextricably intertwined with an appealable order or (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>consideration of the unappealable order is necessary to ensure meaningful review of the appealable order. <em>See Swint v. Chambers County Comm\u2019n, </em>514 U.S. 35, 51, 115 S.Ct. 1203, 131 L.Ed.2d 60 (1995). Neither circumstance applies here, however. The orders are not inextricably intertwined since determining Ball\u2019s entitlement to summary judgment would require us to resolve NCRIC\u2019s contention that the policy does not provide coverage because Ball\u2019s damage award was the result of an intentional tort. And, review of the denial of Ball\u2019s summary judgment motion is clearly not necessary to ensure meaningful review of the grant of NCRIC\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">In sum, because NCRIC failed to establish as a matter of law that its own lack of reasonable diligence in investigating Ball\u2019s claim was not the cause of its inability to obtain Daniel\u2019s cooperation, the district court erred in granting summary judgment to NCRIC on the basis of Daniel\u2019s failure to cooperate. For this reason and because NCRIC\u2019s other asserted grounds for affirmance are without merit, we reverse the grant of summary judgment to NCRIC and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">\n<em>REVERSED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b780-7\">. The district court noted that Daniel could have stated that Ball consented to have sex with him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b781-7\">. The parties agree that Maryland law applies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b782-7\">. NCRIC does not argue in its brief that the contents of the December 15 letter were insufficient, and we do not decide whether they were.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
