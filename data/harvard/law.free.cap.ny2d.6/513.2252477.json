Driscoll was appointed to a position with the Troy Housing Authority. On February 7, 1957 he was discharged from that position without a hearing and without the submission of any charges. He contends that as an honorably discharged veteran of World War I (his status as such being conceded), he is entitled to the protection of section 22 [now \u00a7 75<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>] of the Civil Service Law. That section provides that such a veteran as Driscoll shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>not be removed \u2018 \u2018 except for incompetency or miscondnet shown after a hearing upon due notice upon stated charges \u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There are certain exceptions to that provision, specifically contained in the section, which are discussed <em>infra. </em>At the moment it will suffice to observe that the statute could not be invoked by any person, veteran or otherwise, who holds (or held) his position in the civil service unlawfully. \"Whether Driscoll held his position pursuant to law depends upon whether or not the position was in the exempt class of the service. The respondents maintain that it was not exempt, and that it would, therefore, fall into the catch-all competitive class (Civil Service Law, \u00a7 14 [\u00a7 44]); that since Driscoll had never taken a competitive examination and had been in office far beyond the maximum periods allowable for a provisional appointment (Civil Service Law, \u00a7 15, subd. 1 [\u00a7 65, subd. 2]), or for a temporary appointment (Civil Service Law, \u00a7 15, subd. 3 [\u00a7 64, subds. 1, 2]), he held his position unlawfully and was (and is) entitled to no relief whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">In a proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Act, brought by Driscoll for reinstatement to his position with back pay, Special Term granted the relief sought. The Appellate Division reversed that determination on the law, and dismissed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">All of the available evidence leads only to the conclusion that the position to which Driscoll was appointed was, in civil service contemplation, that of <em>Secretary </em>of the respondent Authority, which position is in the exempt class of the civil service. Section 32 of the Public Housing Law is the provision which authorizes the employment of a Secretary by a Housing Authority \u201c subject to the provisions of the civil service law applicable to the municipality in which it is established \u201d, and subdivision 2 of section 13 [\u00a7 41, subd. 1, par. (c)] of the Civil Service Law <em>and </em>paragraph Second of rule V of the Municipal Civil Service Rules for the City of Troy <em>both </em>exempt the position of Secretary. If Driscoll was appointed to and served in the position of Secretary as contemplated by both the statute and the rule, he was in the exempt class. We conclude that he was so appointed and did so serve, and our conclusion is necessitated by three items of evidence: (1) a roster card of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>the Troy Civil Service Commission, which carries Driscoll as \u201cExecutive Sec\u2019y \u201d of the Troy Housing Authority; (2) the minutes of the Troy Housing Authority meeting of April 8, 1948, at which Driscoll received his initial appointment; and (3) the terminology of section 64 of the old State Housing Law, precursor of the present-day section 32 of the Public Housing Law.</p>\n<author id=\"b548-3\">Opinion per Chief Judge Conway</author>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The roster card is ambiguous to the extent that it has check marks next to both \u201c Unclassified \u201d and \u201c Exempt \u201d. Of course, Driscoll could not be both, and he concedes that he was not unclassified. But the check mark next to \u201c Exempt \u201d should not be regarded as decisive, either. The check marks should both be disregarded as lacking evidentiary value because of the ambiguity they present.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Aside from the check marks appearing thereon, however, the roster card must be given evidentiary value because of the unequivocal \u201c Executive Sec\u2019y \u201d appearing on it. Bule V of the Troy Civil Service Commission Eules provides, under paragraph \u201c fifth \u201d, that all appointments to exempt positions must be brought to the attention of the commission within 24 hours after the same are made. The card is apparently the only record on file with the commission which relates to the original appointment of petitioner Driscoll, and to the card attaches a presumption of validity as the corollary of the well-settled presumption \u201c that public officials, as well as boards, act honestly and in accordance with law \u2019 \u2019 <em>(Matter of Magnotta </em>v. <em>Gerlach, </em>301 N. Y. 143, 149). A card on file with a commission supervising municipal civil service, containing data which the law requires the particular agency to forward to the commission, falls completely within the presumption that gives prima facie effect to the acts of public officials. The presumption is that the Authority gave notice of the appointment to the commission as required by the rule; the card being the only record the commission had for Driscoll, and its occupying the commission\u2019s own file, brings on the further presumption that the commission acted in accordance with legal requirements and recorded on the card the correct data concerning Driscoll\u2019s position as obtained from the notice that the Authority was required to give the commission. Of course, these presumptions are rebuttable, but they have in no manner been rebutted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>The respondent seeks to discount the roster card because there are no marks of authentication on it. But we are pointed to no requirement that such card be signed or dated or otherwise authenticated. It was part of the commission\u2019s files, and had been there for more than eight years. Its authenticity must be presumed, or we have presumed wrongdoing rather than honesty on the part of public officials \u2014 and without any item of evidence from which even an inference of wrongdoing could be drawn. (There is no contention that other than public officials had access to the commission\u2019s files.) Additional evidence would be required to <em>destroy </em>the validity of the card, not to <em>establish </em>it.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-3\">The respondent urges that the card has no value because \u201c There is no indication that the position was specifically classified as exempt by the Troy municipal civil service commission by modification of its existing rules so as to include the position among those specifically enumerated as exempt.\u201d To classify as exempt a previously nonexempt position, a detailed procedure must be followed which clearly was not followed here. But what seems to have been overlooked is the fact that no such procedure had to be followed here because no rule modification was necessary. Both the Civil Service Law and the Troy Civil Service Commission Rules already had provisions making the position of Secretary exempt. Rule V (Troy Civil Service Commission) reads in part: \u201c The Exempt Class shall include * * * Second'\u2014One secretary of each officer, board or commission authorized by law to appoint a secretary. * * * Fourth\u2014Other subordinate offices * * *, but no office or position shall be deemed to be in the Exempt Class unless it is specifically named in such class. * * * \u201d The rule is substantially the same as section 13 [\u00a7 41] of the Civil Service Law. Apparently, the respondent would have us interpret paragraph \u201c Fourth \u201d <em>(supra) </em>regarding the necessity of naming each specific exempt position in a rule, as applying to the positions enumerated in the preceding three paragraphs as well as to the \u201c other subordinate offices \u201d mentioned in the same paragraph which contains the requirement (par. \u201cFourth\u201d). We construe the proviso of paragraph \u201cFourth\u201d as relating only to the <em>positions </em>mentioned there, i.e., \u201c <em>other </em>subordinate offices \u201d. That would mean subordinate offices \u201c other \u201d than those previously mentioned in paragraphs First, Second and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Third. That construction seems unavoidable. Both the statute and the rule are worded mandatorily and not permissively. <em>Before </em>the requirement is arrived at which states that positions are exempt only if specifically exempted by rule, the position of Secretary is listed. And its listing follows the specific legislative instruction (\u00a7 13) that \u201cThe following positions <em>shall be </em>included in the exempt class \u201d (emphasis supplied) and the equally specific regulatory direction (rule V) that \u201c The Exempt Class <em>shall include \u201d </em>(emphasis supplied). The term \u201c other subordinate offices \u201d appears in both the old statute and the rule in paragraphs separate from and coming after those in which the position of Secretary is exempted, and the proviso is integrated as part of such paragraphs, thus applying to offices <em>other than </em>those previously enumerated in the statute and rule, respectively. The Secretary of the Troy Housing Authority is in an exempt position, and no rule is necessary to exempt it any more specifically than it is presently exempted by statute and rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The question arose below as to whether the Civil Service Law applies to the position of Secretary to a Housing Authority. Section 32 of the Public Housing Law is worded, in part, thus: \u201c 1. An authority * * * may employ, subject to the provisions of the civil service law applicable to the municipality in which it is established * * * a secretary * <em>* </em>Petitioner Driscoll argued (and argues) that the quoted provision makes applicable to the position of Secretary the commands of the Civil Service Law, including its section 13 [\u00a7 41]. That would seem to be an incontrovertible position. The statute itself (\u00a7 13 [\u00a7 41]) exempts one Secretary of \u201c each municipal board or commission \u2019 \u2019, but it is urged that the respondent Authority is not either. But if it were a \u201cmunicipal board or commission \u2019 \u2019, the quoted provision of section 32 of the Public Housing Law, subjecting the position of Secretary of a Housing Authority to the provisions of the Civil Service Law, would be unnecessary, because the latter would apply to the Authority by its <em>own </em>terms (Civil Service Law, \u00a7 2, subd. 3 [\u00a7 2, subd. 5]). The purpose of section 32 of the Public Housing Law is to <em>mahe </em>applicable to a Housing Authority\u2019s Secretary \u201c the provisions of the civil service law applicable to the municipality in which it is established \u201d. Such provisions <em>are </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number><em>already </em>applicable to municipal boards and commissions without any assistance from the Public Housing Law. If we were to hold that the Civil Service Law continues to apply only to boards and commissions despite an express legislative instruction that its provisions govern a <em>Mousing Authority </em>as well, we would have to hold that each different denomination of administrative agency to which the Legislature wished to apply civil service provisions would have to have a separately enacted body of them distinct from the present Civil Service Law. Such holding is untenable, and does violence to the plain words of section 32 of the Public Housing Law. There would appear to be no doubt that the position of Secretary is exempt; we return then to the question of whether or not petitioner Driscoll was appointed Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-3\">Respondent Authority contends that Driscoll\u2019s appointment was to the position of \u201c executive director \u201d, which is not exempted under any provision. It relies on the minutes of the meeting at which Driscoll was appointed. The minutes appear in part as follows: \u2018 \u2018 The name of Justin E. Driscoll was suggested for the position of Director of the project and he was formally appointed to this position at a salary of $3,600.00 per year. Mr. Driscoll has been approved by the State Authority.\u201d \u201c Mr. Stack resigned as Secretary of the Authority and Mr. Driscoll was named Secretary and Treasurer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">The minutes establish first that it was the directorship to which he was first appointed, with appointments as Secretary and Treasurer following. Even were the minutes silent as to a secretaryship appointment, the designation of \u201cDirector\u201d, when considered in its historical significance, would offer evidence of the strongest kind that the position of Director as regarded by the respondent <em>is </em>the very position of Secretary as regarded by the Troy Civil Service Commission. The old Housing Law (L. 1926, ch. 823) was amended in 1934 to add a section 64 (L. 1934, ch. 4), which section provided in part that \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>An authority * * * may employ a secretary, <em>who shall be executive director * </em>* * \u201d (italics added). Chapter 808 of the Laws of 1939, enacting the Public Housing Law, repealed section 64 <em>(inter alia) </em>of the old Housing Law, and section 32 of the new law became the authorization for an Authority\u2019s appointment of a Secretary. The legislative history <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>behind the statute, when the duties assigned to the position by the respondent Authority are considered, indicates that both the old and new law contemplate the same office. The old law had express provision for a Secretary \u2018 \u2018 who shall be executive director \u201d; the new law alludes only to a Secretary. Yet Driscoll\u2019s duties under the Authority, as manifested in the contract of employment recently made between them, establish that he functioned as both Director <em>and </em>Secretary of the respondent. In both old section 64 and later section 32, it is provided that the <em>Authority </em>shall determine the duties of the office, as the respondent at bar has done. In successor sections to old section 64, the direction that the Secretary \u201c shall be executive \u2022director \u201d was omitted. But it had obviously become custom and usage for the occupant of the position to be referred to as Director or Executive Director; and that conclusion is strongly corroborated by the duties incumbent upon the holder of the office. It is further corroborated by Driscoll\u2019s simultaneous appointment as Secretary to the Authority. The roster card is final proof, if any more were needed. It would be logical that the local Civil Service Commision be informed that Driscoll was appointed as Secretary for, despite the familiar title by which the incumbent is known within the particular agency involved, the local Civil Service Commission is concerned only with his official title for specific purposes regarding his status and, perhaps, his salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The aggregate of the roster card <em>and </em>the legislative history of section 32 of the Public Housing Law <em>and </em>the duties assigned to Driscoll <em>and </em>the minutes of the Authority\u2019s meeting establish conclusively, in our judgment, that petitioner Driscoll was appointed Secretary to the respondent Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The respondent contends that even if Driscoll did occupy an exempt position he was still not entitled to the protection of subdivision 1 of section 22 [\u00a7 75, subd. 1, par. b] of the Civil Service Law, which requires specific grounds and a hearing before a veteran such as Driscoll may be dismissed. The Authority relies on an express provision therein, which excludes a 1 \u2018private secretary\u201d from the protection afforded by the statute, and upon the case of <em>Matter of Glassman </em>v. <em>Fries </em>(271 N. Y. 116, 119), where we said that the words \u201c private secretary\u201d in that section \u2018 \u2018 embrace every person holding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>position of secretary under section 13.\u201d Our words in the <em>Glassmcm </em>case appear to have at least prima facie applicability, but we distinguished that case in our later decision in <em>Matter of Mercer </em>v. <em>Dowd </em>(288 <em>N. </em>Y. 381, 385). We quoted the <em>Glassmcm </em>words relied on by the Authority, and then said the following: \u201cWe think the respondents\u2019 argument disregards the duties assigned to the appellant as executive secretary. It is not the title which the position bears but the character of duties required of its incumbent which must control our decision. \u2018 The Legislature did not intend that rights of tenure to a position in [civil service] should be determined by the name given to the position. <em>The duties </em>of the position, as defined by some statute or by an ordinance or resolution of a body duly authorized by statute, <em>not its name, determine the status of the position </em>[Emphasis supplied.] <em>(Matter of Rohr </em>v. <em>Kenngott, </em>288 N. Y. 97, 105; <em>Matter of Byrnes </em>v. <em>Windels, supra </em>[265 N. Y. 403], pp. 406, 407.) \u201d We then added the following: \u201c The record at hand makes it clear that the duties of the position from which the appellant was removed were not within the class excepted by the Civil Service Law (\u00a7 22, subd. 2, or \u00a7 13, subd. 2).\u201d And at another point in <em>Mercer </em>(p. 386) we said this: \u201cIn the performance of those duties [those assigned to Mercer] the appellant was not * <em>* * </em>a * secretary,\u2019 under subdivision 2 of section 13 * *</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">In the above-quoted portions of our <em>Mercer </em>opinion our design was not to hold that his position was not \u201c secretary\u201d under section 13; we meant only to hold that it was not \u201cprivate secretary \u201d under section 22. Our words, it must be conceded, are not too clear, but the entire case was concerned not with whether Mercer was exempt under section 13, but with whether he was to be denied the protection afforded veterans under section 22. During all of our treatment of that subject we were endeavoring only to establish the nature of Mercer\u2019s true position\u2014examining its duties for the purpose\u2014in order to determine whether he was in any sense a \u2018 <em>\u2018 </em>private secretary \u2019 \u2019. When we cited section 22 in the course of our discussion, we simultaneously cited section 13, which was not germane to the specific question before us. There is no doubt that Mercer\u2019s position was Secretary and exempt <em>\u2018 \u2018 </em>under subdivision 2 of section 13 of the Civil Service Law\u201d (see 263 App. Div. 932). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>In any event Driscoll is in substantially the same position Mercer occupied, under our rationale in that case. The analogy is compelled by our words in <em>Mercer, </em>that our decision must be controlled by \u201c the character of duties required\u201d of the position\u2019s incumbent. Mercer\u2019s duties, which we described in our opinion, are strikingly similar to Driscoll\u2019s, as evidenced by the contract recently made between him and the Authority, which contract looked expressly to <em>\u2018</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>continuing the employment \u201d. Both performed clerical duties; both had supervision and direction of subordinate employees; both had duties of maintaining the properties of their respective agencies. Mercer\u2019s duties were clerical, supervisory and managerial, for which reason we held him entitled to the protection of section <em>22 </em>because he was not the <em>\u201c </em>private secretary \u201d excluded from such protection. Driscoll\u2019s duties are clerical, supervisory and managerial\u2014fully analogous to those of Mercer. The protective provisions of section <em>22 </em>are fully applicable to petitioner Driscoll. Without the \u201c incompetency or misconduct shown after a hearing upon due notice upon stated charges \u201d, Driscoll was wrongfully dismissed. He is entitled to reinstatement with back pay (less compensation received from other employment during the interim, as Special Term held).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The order of the Appellate Division in the article 78 proceeding is reversed and that of Special Term reinstated, with costs in this court and in the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The judgment entered on the order of the Appellate Division in the contract action, brought simultaneously with the proceeding, by Driscoll as plaintiff, which dismissed the complaint upon the merits, is affirmed on the ground that petitioner Driscoll has had full relief under our decision in the article 78 proceeding, decided simultaneously herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Judges Desmond, Dye, Fuld, Froessel, Van Voorhis and Burke concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">In <em>Matter of Driscoll </em>v. <em>Troy Housing Auth.: </em>Order of Appellate Division reversed and that of Special Term reinstated, with costs in this court and in the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">In <em>Driscoll </em>v. <em>Troy Housing Auth.: </em>Judgment affirmed, without costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b546-8\">As of April 1, 1959, a revision and reeodifleation of the Civil Service Law took effect (L. 1958, ch. 790).
