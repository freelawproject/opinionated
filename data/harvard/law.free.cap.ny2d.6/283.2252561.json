The commission\u2019s grant of rent adjustments in the case at bar conformed with the purpose and intent of the act and regulations. <em>(Matter of Cozzi </em>v. <em>McGoldrick, </em>307 N. Y. 748, 283 App. Div. 702; <em>Matter of Florell Equities </em>v. <em>Weaver, </em>2 A D 2d 542, 2 N Y 2d 982; <em>Matter of De Varco </em>v. <em>McGoldrick, </em>281 App. Div. 955.) II. Calculation of allowable net annual return on sale price valuation base was neither arbitrary nor capricious. <em>(Matter of Kaufmann </em>v. <em>Abrams, </em>286 App. Div. 998.) III. The commission properly held applicant eligible for the relief afforded by the <em>6% </em>net annual return provision. IV. The Administrator\u2019s determination that the rent adjustment granted must be effective as of the Local Rent Administrator\u2019s erroneous denial of landlord\u2019s application was entirely proper and in accord with settled case law. <em>(Levy </em>v. <em>1165 Park Ave. Corp., </em>305 N.

The landlord of property is entitled to a 6% return on the valuation as determined by a bona fide sale, whether the landlord be a lessee or an owner. <em>(Matter of Wile </em>v. <em>McGoldrick, </em>286 App. Div. 826; <em>Matter of Florell Equities </em>v. <em>Weaver, </em>2 N Y 2d 982; <em>Wasservogel </em>v. <em>Meyerowitz, </em>300 N.

There is no merit to respondents\u2019 contention that the landlord failed to maintain essential services. <em>(Matter of Kerbs </em>v. <em>State Rent Administrator, </em>7 A D 2d 839.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b315-5\"><em>Lewis M.

The Appellate Division properly held that a lessee \u201cas circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>stanced here \u201d may not procure a rent increase based on sale price paid for the fee by another long after the lease was made. <em>(Matter of Kaplan </em>v. <em>McGoldrick, </em>198 Misc. 440; <em>Matter of De Varco </em>v. <em>Temporary State Rent Comm., </em>281 App. Div. 955; <em>Matter of Abrams </em>v. <em>McGoldrick, </em>282 App. Div. 192; <em>Matter of Davis </em>v. <em>McGoldrick, </em>3 Misc 2d 830; <em>Matter of Monk </em>v. <em>Finkelstein, </em>194 Misc. 241, 275 App. Div. 905, 302 N.

Even if a lessee were entitled to rely on sale price, sale price here, because of the special circumstances existing at the time, did not reflect the value of the property and should not be used as a basis for calculating rents. <em>(Matter of Arnold, </em>114 App. Div. 244; <em>People ex rel. Stewart </em>v. <em>Feitner, </em>95 App. Div. 481; <em>People ex rel. Four Park Ave. Corp. </em>v. <em>Lilly, </em>267 App. Div. 102; <em>Matter of Empire State Bldg.

If the Administrator erred in finding that lessee could not net $75,000 in six months, then his finding that the property returned only $93,000 was necessarily erroneous too. IV. Even if an increase in rents were allowable it should not have been ordered effective to a date earlier than the one on which the Administrator found essential services to have been restored. <em>(Matter of Macan Estates </em>v. <em>McGoldrick, </em>281 App. Div. 810, 305 N.

An application for a rent increase filed \u201cblind\u201d by an agent for an undisclosed principal three times identified differently is in any case defective and should have been denied forthwith. VI. There was no error in refusing to include the excess management fees and legal expenses requested by Realty.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b316-6\"><em>Jacob B. Ward </em>and <em>Nathan Heller </em>for respondent in the second above-entitled proceeding.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ara\">I. Appellant is not before this court pursuant to any of the provisions of section 588 of the Civil Practice Act. Its appeal as of right should not lie. II. The Administrator properly limited the management expense allowance to the costs actually incurred by the lessee-operator of the property.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b317-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Feoessel, J.</author>\n<p id=\"An_\">We disagree with the Appellate Division that the appellant as agent for the landlord may not obtain a rent increase on the ground that the rental income from the property yields a net annual return of less than 6% of the valuation of the property (State Residential Rent Law [L. 1946, ch. 274, as amd.], \u00a7 4, subd. 4, par. [a], cl. [1]; State Rent and Eviction Regulations, \u00a7 33, subd. 5). The fact that the property is being operated under a lease by which the <em>owner </em>derives from its lessee greater than a 6% return is not material.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">It is undisputed that the <em>property itself </em>\u2014 to which the statute refers \u2014 is earning less than such percentage. The statute contemplates that tenants will be required to pay a reasonable rent. It does not intend them to benefit from an advantageous arrangement which the owner makes with a lessee <em>(Matter of Wile </em>v. <em>McGoldrick, </em>286 App. Div. 826, motion for leave to appeal denied 309 N. Y. 1033). We find no statutory requirement that an applicant for a rent increase must have invested capital in the property, nor do we think there is any warrant for reading such a requirement into the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Placing the statute in its proper perspective, it is clear that the Rent Administrator properly used the bona fide sale price as a basis for valuation, notwithstanding that the lessee was not a party to such sale. In mandating the use of bona fide sale price, the Legislature was not concerned with questions of investment, but simply recognized that such price provided \u201c a more accurate reflection of value\u201d (L. 1957, ch. 755; N. Y. Legis. Annual, 1957, p. 264). Nor does the existence of the cancelable lease here constitute a \u201c special circumstance \u201d under the statute which would require the Rent Administrator to disregard the sale price.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">With regard to the question of essential services, the Rent Administrator determined in accordance with the applicable statute (State Residential Rent Law, \u00a7 4, subd. 4, par. [d]) that the landlord was maintaining essential services \u201cas of the date of the issuance of the order adjusting the maximum rent \u201d, and granted an increase effective as of the date of the local administrator\u2019s erroneous order <em>(Matter of Neulist </em>v. <em>Weaver, </em>2 N Y 2d 889). While he no doubt has discretion to deny retroactivity in a case where services were seriously deficient, this was not such a case, as his findings indicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>In the landlord\u2019s proceeding, the court, on its own motion, dismisses the landlord\u2019s appeal upon the ground that it may not be taken as of right. We treat its application, however, as a motion for leave to appeal, as requested by the landlord, and, as so treated, deny the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">The order appealed from in the tenants\u2019 proceeding should be reversed, without costs, and the order of Special Term reinstated. The appeal by the landlord as of right in its proceeding should be dismissed. Treating the landlord\u2019s application as a motion for leave to appeal, the motion should be denied, without costs. (See 6 N Y 2d 707, 885.)</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b318-5\">Desmond, J. (dissenting).</author>\n<p id=\"AHn\">I dissent and vote to affirm. The amendment here construed (State Residential Rent Law [L. 1946, ch. 274, as amd.], \u00a7 4, subd. 4, par. [a]) had \u2014 and could have\u2014no purpose except to provide to the property owner a net <em>6% </em>return on the fair value of his ownership interest. This property, however, is being operated under a whole-building lease which concededly gives the owner more than that <em>6% </em>return. Thus, the whole purpose of the statute has already been satisfied. Any increase of the rents paid by the <em>apartment tenants </em>to the <em>lessee </em>of the building will give the latter a windfall, based on a purely literal construction of the words of the statute \u2014 an application which is at war with the legislative purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Chief Judge Conway and Judges Van Voobhis and Bubke concur with Judge Fboessel; Judge Desmond dissents in an opinion in which Judge Dye concurs; Judge Fuld taking no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Order reversed, without costs, and matter remitted to Special Term for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion herein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
