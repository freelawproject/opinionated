It was beyond the jurisdiction of Special Term to make the order appealed from, without service of the show cause order and the papers upon which it was based, upon the husband. II. Frederick E. M.

Due notice requirements of section 1171-b of the Civil Practice Act are satisfied, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>if husband is afforded ample opportunity to oppose application seeking judgment for arrears of support, by receipt of timely notification thereof from husband\u2019s purported former attorney. <em>(Massimino </em>v. <em>Massimino, </em>5 Misc 2d 1041; <em>Rosenthal </em>v. <em>Rosenthal, </em>201 App. Div. 27; <em>Karpf </em>v. <em>Karpf, </em>260 App. Div. 701; <em>Keller </em>v. <em>Keller, </em>100 App. Div. 325; <em>Wulff </em>v. <em>Wulff, </em>74 Misc. 213, 151 App. Div. 22.) II. A default order is not appealable as a matter of law. <em>(La Londe </em>v. <em>La Londe, </em>274 App. Div. 970; <em>People </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>277 App. Div. 1087.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b111-5\">Froessel, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ajh\">Several years after the entry of a judgment in plaintiff\u2019s favor in an annulment action awarding the sum of $30 per week for the support of the son of the parties, she procured an order directing the entry of a judgment for arrears. The order to show cause on the application for such latter judgment provided for service upon the defendant, a resident of Connecticut, or his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Service was effected on the defendant\u2019s attorney of record in the annulment action. Said attorney did not move under the provisions of section 237-a of the Civil Practice Act but merely submitted an affidavit \u201c in partial opposition \u201d, urging that he no longer represented defendant, that he had no authority to appear on defendant\u2019s behalf, and asked to \u201c be permitted to return the aforesaid moving papers and be relieved of all further responsibility in connection therewith \u201d. He thereupon communicated with defendant by mail advising him of the order to show cause, its purpose and the return day, and suggested the latter contact the attorney\u2019s office \u201c by telephone \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">After an adverse decision and before the entry of an order thereon, said attorney moved for reargument. While that application was under consideration, another attorney, who had represented defendant just a few months previously in another matter relating to the custody of the child of the parties, appeared in the Justice\u2019s chambers in relation to the motion for reargument under the guise of being from the first attorney\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">Under all the facts and circumstances of this c\u00e1se, Special Term was authorized to find that defendant was duly represented by counsel. For present purposes, an application under section 1171-b of the Civil Practice Act is treated as a motion in an action (see <em>Karlin </em>v. <em>Karlin, </em>280 N. Y. 32, 36; <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Fox, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>263 N. Y. 68, 70; <em>Lund </em>v. Lund, 196 Misc. 136, 137-138), so that no service of new process was necessary for the purpose of acquiring jurisdiction over defendant\u2019s person <em>(Durlacher </em>v. Durlacher, 173 Misc. 329, 331-333; see <em>Karpf </em>v. Karpf, 260 App. Div. 701, 703-704; see, also, <em>Ohlquist </em>v. <em>Nordstrom, </em>143 Misc. 502, 503-504, affd. 238 App. Div. 766, affd. 262 N. Y. 696; <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>327 U. S. 220).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Chief Judge Conway and Judges Desmond, Dye, Fuld, Van Voorhis and Burke concur; Judges Fuld and Van Voorhis, in concurring, would grant leave to defendant, as did the Appellate Division, to apply at Special Term to move for leave to interpose any defense thereto that he may have upon the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
