Plaintiff failed to prove a cause of action against defendant Levy.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b123-4\">Fuld, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AxD\">The plaintiff, as beneficiary, brought this action against defendant Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and defendant Levy, one of the company\u2019s agents, to recover death and accidental death benefits under a policy on the life of her husband. The defendant company opposed payment on the grounds that the policy had lapsed without value because of the nonpayment of a premium and that, in any event, the plaintiff was not entitled to accidental death benefits since the insured had died, not as the result of accident, but of natural causes. The plaintiff, not disputing that there was a failure to pay the premium when due, argues that the Metropolitan, by requesting payment of the next quarterly premium, waived the failure to pay the earlier premium. In addition, she seeks to hold defendant Levy on the ground that he promised to keep the insurance in Torce by paying the premium out of his own funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">After hearing the evidence, the trial court dismissed the complaint as to the company and directed a verdict in favor of Levy, and the Appellate Division affirmed the resulting judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Viewing the evidence, as we must, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, it appears that in November, 1952, the agent Levy who, over a 13-year period, had sold the deceased several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>small life insurance policies, wrote the application for the policy in issue and collected the first quarterly premium of $39.75. The application was approved and a policy for approximately $7,650, plus $3,000 if death resulted from accidental means, was issued and delivered. The second quarterly premium fell due on February 26, 1953, and the formal notice, notifying the insured of such fact, contained this further provision :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-5\"><em>\u2018 </em>\u2018 DO NOT PERMIT YOUR POLICY TO LAPSE</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-6\"><em>\u201c Effect of Failure to Pay Premium </em>\u2014 Unless the premium covered by this notice shall be paid * * * on or before the date when due (or within the 31-day grace period), the policy * * * will become forfeited and void \u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">Although the plaintiff paid Levy the premiums due on her husband\u2019s smaller and earlier policies, she advised him, on February 24, 1953, that she did not have the money for the new policy. The plaintiff testified, however, that Levy assured her that he would \u20181 take care of \u2019 \u2019 paying the premiums and would look to her for reimbursement when she obtained the money from the summer rental of her home at Long Beach. Then, toward the end of March, just a few days before the expiration of the 30-day grace period provided for by statute (Insurance Law, \u00a7 155), the plaintiff received another notice reminding her that the premium had not been paid and that the grace period was about to run out. On the very day this was received, the plaintiff testified, she spoke to Levy and in response to her query, \u201c <em>\u2018 </em>didn\u2019t you tell me that you were taldng care of this thing for me and not to worry, not to think about it: you were covering me? \u2019 he assertedly replied, \u201c \u2018 I told you I would take care of it, and I am taking care of it, and don\u2019t worry.\u2019 \u201d And, indeed, after the policy had, in fact, lapsed, the plaintiff declared that Levy, when collecting the other premiums, again assured her that he \u201c would take care of the big one.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">Had the policy remained in force, the next quarterly premium would have fallen due on May 26, and, during the early part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>that month, Metropolitan\u2019s home office inadvertently sent a notice of premium to the insured. This notice, upon which the plaintiff relies to establish a waiver, specifically recited, as do all of the company\u2019s premium notices, that the premium should be paid only if \u201c said policy be then in force.\u201d No premium was ever paid in response to this notice and on June 16, 1953, the insured, an electrician, died of a coronary thrombosis suffered while working in the normal course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">The plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the judgment in Metropolitan\u2019s favor may be quickly disposed of. Certainly, the due date of the premium was not extended, nor the lapsed policy reinstated, by virtue of any statements made by Levy that he would \u201c take care \u201d of the premium or policy. Quite apart from other considerations, it is enough to note that the policy explicitly provided that \u201cNo agent is authorized to alter or amend [it] * * # or to extend the due date of any premium.\u201d (See, e.g., <em>Drennan </em>v. <em>Sun Ind. Co., </em>271 N. Y. 182, 185-188; <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co., </em>281 N. Y. 375, 378-381.) Equally unavailing is the claim that the sending of a premium notice constituted a waiver; the purely mechanical act falls far short of proof that the company waived, or intended to waive, the insured\u2019s failure to pay the second premium. (See <em>Ross </em>v. <em>New York Life Ins. Co., </em>68 F. 2d 727; <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. of America, </em>55 F. 2d 97.) And, we would simply observe that no evidence was offered at the trial that the other policies on the insured\u2019s life could have been utilized for their loan or cash value to prevent the lapse of the policy in the suit. The complaint against the Metropolitan was, therefore, properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">However, the evidence presented did require that the case against the defendant Levy be submitted to the jury. He had promised to pay the second quarterly premium in order to keep the policy in force. In short, if the jurors believed, as the plaintiff in effect testified, that Levy had told her not to worry about the February premium, that <em>he </em>would pay it and look to her for reimbursement in the future, they would have been justified in holding him liable. (See <em>Siegel </em>v. <em>Spear &amp; Co., </em>234 N. Y. 479; <em>Joseph, Inc., </em>v. <em>Alberti, Carleton &amp; Co., </em>225 App. Div. .115, affd. 251 N. Y. 580; <em>Israelson </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>166 App. Div. 25, appeal dismissed 215 N. Y. 684; <em>Landusky </em>v. <em>Beirne, </em>80 App. Div. 272, 274, affd. 178 N. Y. 551; <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Francis, </em>223 Ark. 584, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>588-590; <em>Mansfield </em>v. <em>Federal Services Finance Corp., </em>99 N. H. 352, 354; <em>Elam </em>v. <em>Smithdeal Realty &amp; Ins. Co., </em>182 N. C. 599, 602-604; see, also, 16 Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice [1944], pp. 272-277, 294-295, 300-309;) In <em>Landusky </em>v. <em>Beirne </em>(80 App. Div. 272, affd. 178 N. Y. 551, <em>supra), </em>the defendant, an insurance agent, promised to obtain a \u2018 \u2018 good policy in a very good company \u201d upon the plaintiff\u2019s house in Pennsylvania. However, the defendant procured a policy from a company which had no authority to do business in Pennsylvania or New York. The property was destroyed by fire, but no insurance was ever paid. The defendant was held liable for the damage sustained, the Appellate Division writing that the plaintiff \u201cmade out a violation of the defendant\u2019s contract when he showed that the policy procured was not enforcible in New York or Pennsylvania \u201d and that the company issuing it refused to pay (80 App. Div., at p. 274). And, in the <em>Lawrence </em>case (223 Ark. 584, <em>supra), </em>the court wrote that, when an insurance agent \u201c undertakes to procure a policy of insurance for another, the law imposes upon [him] the duty * * * to perform the obligation that he has assumed, and the agent may be held liable for any loss * * * suffered * * * attributable to the agent\u2019s failure to provide such insurance\u201d (p. 589).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Although the cases cited deal with an agent\u2019s failure to obtain insurance after a promise to do so, the principle underlying the decisions applies with equal force to the situation now before us. An agent who fails to keep a policy in force after promising to do so is in no better position than one who neglects to procure a policy after agreeing to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The amount of Levy\u2019s liability will, of course, depend upon whether the insured did or did not die by \u201c accidental means \u201d. If he did not, then Levy \u2014 if the jury concluded that he made the promise to take care of the premium due \u2014 would be liable, at most, for the face or principal amount of the policy, $7,650. On the other hand, if the insured died as a result of an accident (within the meaning of the rider), then, Levy would be liable for the further sum of $3,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">The record before us is devoid of any evidence that death resulted from other than natural causes. The insured\u2019s fatal heart attack took place while he was engaged in the course of his employment as an electrician, and death was not the result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>of any \u201c unusual or extraordinary happening (Cf. <em>Burr </em>v. <em>Commercial Travelers Mut. Acc. Assn., </em>295 N. Y. 294, 301.) Since this issue was tried, the trial court would have been under the necessity, in any view of the case, of dismissing so much of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action as sought a recovery for death by accidental means. Accordingly, the issue upon the new trial will be limited to the question of Levy\u2019s liability for the face or principal amount of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The judgment insofar as it dismisses the complaint against the defendant Metropolitan Life Insurance Company should be affirmed, with costs. The judgment, insofar as it affects the defendant Levy, should be reversed and a new trial granted as to his liability in connection with the basic policy in the amount of $7,650, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Chief Judge Conway and Judges Desmond, Froessel and Burke concur with Judge Fuld; Judges Dye and Van Voorhis dissent insofar as the judgment appealed from is reversed and vote to affirm upon the ground that it was neither intended by the insurance agent nor understood by the beneficiary that the agent personally agreed to pay or to guarantee the payment of the premium or the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b124-11\">. A warning similar to this one is contained in the policy itself.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b124-12\">. It should, perhaps, he noted that Levy fatly contradicted the plaintiff\u2019s testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
