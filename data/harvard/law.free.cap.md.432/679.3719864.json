Montgomery County Bd. of Educ., </em>295 Md. 442, 444, 456 A.2d 894 (1983), this Court issued a writ of certiorari to decide \u201cwhether the common law doctrine of contributory negligence should be judicially abrogated in Maryland and the doctrine of comparative negligence adopted in its place as the rule governing trial of negligence actions in this State.\u201d In a comprehensive opinion by then Chief Judge Robert C. Murphy, the Court in <em>Harrison, </em>295 Md. at 463, 456 A.2d at 905, declined to abandon the doctrine of contributory negligence in favor of comparative negligence, pointing out that such change \u201cinvolves fundamental and basic public policy considerations properly to be addressed by the legislature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">The petitioner in the case at bar presents the same issue that was presented in <em>Harrison, </em>namely whether this Court should change the common law and abrogate the defense of contributory negligence in certain types of tort actions. After reviewing the issue again, we shall arrive at the same conclusion that the Court reached in <em>Harrison.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">The petitioner and plaintiff below, James Kyle Coleman, was an accomplished soccer player who had volunteered to assist in coaching a team of young soccer players in a program of the Soccer Association of Columbia, in Howard County, Maryland. On August 19, 2008, Coleman, at the time 20 years old, was assisting the coach during the practice of a team of young soccer players on the field of the Lime Kiln Middle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>School. While the Soccer Association of Columbia had fields of its own, it did not have enough to accommodate all of the program\u2019s young soccer players; the Association was required to use school fields for practices. At some point during the practice, Coleman kicked a soccer ball into a soccer goal. As he passed under the goal\u2019s metal top rail, or crossbar, to retrieve the ball, he jumped up and grabbed the crossbar. The soccer goal was not anchored to the ground, and, as he held on to the upper crossbar, Coleman fell backwards, drawing the weight of the crossbar onto his face. He suffered multiple severe facial fractures which required surgery and the placing of three titanium plates in his face. Coleman instituted the present action by filing a complaint, in the Circuit Court for Howard County, alleging that he was injured by the defendants\u2019 negligence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant and respondent, the Soccer Association of Columbia, asserted the defense of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">At the ensuing jury trial, the soccer coach who had invited Coleman to help coach the soccer players testified that he had not inspected or anchored the goal which fell on Coleman. The coach also testified that the goal was not owned or provided by the Soccer Association, and he did not believe that it was his responsibility to anchor the goal. During the trial, the parties disputed whether the goal was located in an area under the supervision and control of the Soccer Association and whether the Soccer Association was required to inspect and anchor the goal. The Soccer Association presented testimony tending to show that, because the goal was not owned by the Soccer Association, the Soccer Association owed no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>duty to Coleman. The Soccer Association also presented testimony that the condition of the goal was open and obvious to all persons. The Association maintained that the accident was caused solely by Coleman\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Testimony was provided by Coleman to the effect that players commonly hang from soccer goals and that his actions should have been anticipated and expected by the Soccer Association. Coleman also provided testimony that anchoring goals is a standard safety practice in youth soccer.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">At the close of evidence, Coleman\u2019s attorney proffered a jury instruction on comparative negligence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge declined to give Coleman\u2019s proffered comparative negligence instruction and, instead, instructed the jury on contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The jury was given a verdict sheet posing several questions. The first question was: \u201cDo you find that the Soccer Association of Columbia was negligent?\u201d The jury answered \u201cyes\u201d to this question. The jury also answered \u201cyes\u201d to the question: \u201cDo you find that the Soccer Association of Columbia\u2019s negligence caused the Plaintiffs injuries?\u201d Finally, the jury answered \u201cyes\u201d to the question: \u201cDo you find that the Plaintiff was negligent and that his negligence contributed to his claimed injuries?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">In short, the jury concluded that the Soccer Association of Columbia was negligent and that the Soccer Association\u2019s negligence caused Coleman\u2019s injuries. The jury also found that Coleman was negligent, and that his negligence contributed to his own injuries. Because of the contributory negligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>finding, Coleman was barred from any recovery. The trial court denied Coleman\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and subsequently entered judgment in favor of the Soccer Association of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">Coleman filed a notice of appeal, and the Soccer Association filed a notice of cross-appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Before briefing and argument in the Court of Special Appeals, Coleman filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari, which was granted. <em>Coleman v. Soccer Ass\u2019n of Columbia, </em>425 Md. 396, 41 A.3d 570 (2012). In his petition, Coleman posed only one question: whether this Court should retain the standard of contributory negligence as the common law standard governing negligence cases in the State of Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">We shall hold that, although this Court has the authority to change the common law rule of contributory negligence, we decline to abrogate Maryland\u2019s long-established common law principle of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">This Court last addressed the continuing viability of the contributory negligence doctrine in <em>Harrison v. Montgomery County Bd. of Educ., supra, </em>295 Md. 442, 456 A.2d 894. In <em>Harrison, </em>the Court held that the contributory negligence principle remained the valid standard in Maryland negligence cases and that \u201cany change in the established doctrine [was for] the Legislature.\u201d 295 Md. at 463, 456 A.2d at 905.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>Chief Judge Murphy, for the Court in <em>Harrison, </em>began his review of the contributory negligence standard by tracing the standard\u2019s historical origins to Lord Chief Justice Ellenborough\u2019s opinion in <em>Butterfield v. Forrester, </em>11 East 60, 103 Eng. Rep. 926 (K.B. 1809).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As <em>Harrison </em>explained the case,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEe\">\u201cButterfield left a public inn at dusk, mounted his horse and rode off \u2018violently\u2019 down the street. Forrester, who was effecting some repairs to his house, had placed a pole in the roadway. Although Butterfield could have seen and avoided the obstruction, he did not and was injured. The [English] court there noted:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">\u2018One person being in fault will not dispense with another\u2019s using ordinary care for himself. Two things must concur to support this action, an obstruction in the road by the fault of the defendant, and no want of ordinary care to avoid it on the part of the plaintiff.\u2019 [11 East] at 61, 103 Eng. Rep. at 927.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The <em>Harrison </em>opinion explained that, when the contributory negligence standard was first judicially adopted in the United States, the courts at the time were concerned that juries would award to plaintiffs sums that had the potential to stifle \u201cnewly developing industry.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Early American courts were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>also concerned that they should not adopt a policy in which \u201ccourts ... assist a wrongdoer who suffered an injury as a result of his own wrongdoing.\u201d <em>Harrison, </em>295 Md. at 450, 456 A.2d at 898. <em>See also Smith v. Smith, 2 </em>Pick. 621, 19 Mass. 621, 624 (1824) (a leading early American case incorporating the contributory negligence bar as part of common law).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">This Court, relying on <em>Butterfield v. Forrester, supra, </em>first adopted the standard of contributory negligence in <em>Irwin v. Sprigg, </em>6 Gill. 200, 205 (1847), stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\">\u201cThe established doctrine now is, that although the defendant\u2019s misconduct may have been the primary cause of the injury complained of, yet the plaintiff cannot recover in an action of this kind, if the proximate and immediate cause of the damage can be traced to a want of ordinary care and caution on his part. Under such circumstances he must bear the consequences of his own recklessness or folly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARL\">The contributory negligence standard was later modified in part by this Court\u2019s adoption of the last clear chance doctrine, <em>see N. C. R.R. Co. v. State, Use of Price, </em>29 Md. 420, 436 (1868), which allowed a plaintiff to recover \u201cif the defendant might, by the exercise of care on its part, have avoided the consequences of the neglect or carelessness\u201d of the plaintiff. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>The Court recognized another exception to the contributory negligence standard where the plaintiff is under five years old. <em>See Taylor v. Armiger, </em>277 Md. 638, 358 A.2d 883 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">The <em>Harrison </em>Court examined the origins and impact of comparative negligence, noting that early in the 20th century, the Maryland General Assembly had adopted a form of comparative negligence for \u201ccertain perilous occupations,\u201d but had subsequently repealed the provisions. The Court in <em>Harrison </em>also pointed out that, as of 1983, of the thirty-nine states that had adopted comparative negligence, thirty-one had done so by statute, with the eight remaining states having adopted the principle by judicial action. The Court noted that it was \u201cclear\u201d that legal scholars \u201cfavored\u201d the comparative negligence standard, as supported by \u201c[a]n almost boundless array of scholarly writings.\u201d 295 Md. at 453, 456 A.2d at 899.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Nevertheless, the <em>Harrison </em>Court pointed to other considerations involved in changing the standard from contributory negligence to comparative negligence (295 Md. at 454-455, 456 A.2d at 900-901):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">\u201cAlso to be considered is the effect which a comparative fault system would have on other fundamental areas of negligence law. The last clear chance doctrine, assumption of the risk, joint and several liability, contribution, setoffs and counterclaims, and application of the doctrine to other fault systems, such as strict liability in tort, are several of the more obvious areas affected by the urged shift to comparative negligence. Even that change has its complications; beside the \u2018pure\u2019 form of comparative negligence, there are several \u2018modified\u2019 forms, so that abrogation of the contributory negligence doctrine will necessitate the substitution of an alternate doctrine. Which form to adopt presents its own questions and the choice is by no means clear____That a change from contributory to comparative negligence involves considerably more than a simple common law adjustment is readily apparent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-9\"><em>Harrison </em>also examined those states which had abrogated the contributory negligence standard, pointing out that \u201cmost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>of the states which have adopted comparative negligence have done so by statute in derogation of the common law.\u201d 295 Md. at 456, 456 A.2d at 901. The Court observed that, in several of these states, the courts had refused to judicially abrogate the contributory negligence standard because they \u201cexpressly deferred on policy grounds to their respective legislatures.\u201d 295 Md. at 456, 456 A.2d at 901. Only eight state supreme courts, as of 1983, had adopted a comparative negligence standard by judicial decision.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-4\">The <em>Hmrison </em>opinion further held that, when this Court is \u201ccalled upon, as here, to overrule our own decisions, consideration must be given to the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>\u2014 -the policy which entails the reaffirmation of a decisional doctrine of an appellate court, even though if considered for the first time, the Court might reach a different conclusion. <em>Deems v. Western Maryland Ry., </em>247 Md. 95, 231 A.2d 514 (1966).\u201d 295 Md. at 458, 456 A.2d at 902.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Chief Judge Murphy in <em>Harrison </em>continued his assessment by explaining that the principle of <em>stare decisis </em>should not be construed to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-6\">\u201cinhibit [this Court] from changing or modifying a common law rule by judicial decision where we find, in light of changed conditions or increased knowledge, that the rule has become unsound in the circumstances of modern life, a vestige of the past, no longer suitable to our people.\u201d (295 Md. at 459, 456 A.2d at 903).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Nevertheless, <em>Harrison </em>concluded (295 Md. at 459, 456 A.2d at 903):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-8\">\u201c[I]n considering whether a long-established common law rule \u2014 unchanged by the legislature and thus reflective of this State\u2019s public policy- \u2014 is unsound in the circumstances of modern life, we have always recognized that declaration of the public policy of Maryland is normally the function of the General Assembly; that body, by Article 5 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, is expressly empowered to revise the common law of Maryland by legislative enactment. <em>See Felder v. Butler, </em>292 Md. [174], 183, 438 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>494 [499]; <em>Adler v. American Standard Corp., </em>291 Md. [31], 45, 432 A.2d 464 [472], The Court, therefore, has been particularly reluctant to alter a common law rule in the face of indications that to do so would be contrary to the public policy of the State. <em>See, e.g., Condore v. Prince George\u2019s Co., </em>289 Md. [516] 532, 425 A.2d 1011 [1019].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">In the years immediately prior to <em>Harrison, </em>from 1966 to 1982, the Maryland General Assembly had considered twenty-one bills seeking to change the contributory negligence standard. None of the bills had been enacted. The <em>Harrison </em>Court accorded a great deal of weight to the General Assembly\u2019s failure to enact any of these bills, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\">\u201c[T]he legislature\u2019s action in rejecting the proposed change is indicative of an intention to retain the contributory negligence doctrine.\u201d 295 Md. at 462, 456 A.2d at 904.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">The Court further pointed out that enactment of a comparative negligence standard is not a single issue; instead, such a decision would encompass a variety of choices to be made, beginning with the initial inquiry of what form of comparative negligence to adopt, \u201cpure\u201d or one \u201cof the several types of modified comparative negligence,\u201d 295 Md. at 462-463, 456 A.2d at 904. If Maryland\u2019s common law were to change, the <em>Harrison </em>opinion explained, the decision as to which form of comparative negligence to adopt \u201cplainly involves major policy considerations\u201d of the sort best left to the General Assembly. 295 Md. at 462, 456 A.2d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">Since the time of <em>Harrison, </em>this Court has continued to recognize the standard of contributory negligence as the applicable principle in Maryland negligence actions. <em>See, e.g., Thomas v. Panco Management of Maryland, LLC, </em>423 Md. 387, 417, 31 A.3d 583, 601 (2011); <em>Erie Insurance Exchange v. Heffernan, </em>399 Md. 598, 925 A.2d 636 (2007); <em>Dehn v. Edgecombe, </em>384 Md. 606, 865 A.2d 603 (2005); <em>Franklin v. Morrison, </em>350 Md. 144, 168, 711 A.2d 177, 189 (1998); <em>County Commissioners v. Bell Atlantic, </em>346 Md. 160, 695 A.2d 171 (1997); <em>Brady v. Parsons Co., </em>327 Md. 275, 609 A.2d 297 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>(1992); <em>Wegad v. Howard Street Jewelers, </em>326 Md. 409, 605 A.2d 123 (1992); <em>Liscombe v. Potomac Edison Co., </em>303 Md. 619, 495 A.2d 838 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">Although the contributory negligence principle has been part of this State\u2019s common law for over 165 years, petitioners and numerous amici in this case urge this Court to abolish the contributory negligence standard and replace it with a form of comparative negligence. They argue contributory negligence is an antiquated doctrine, that it has been roundly criticized by academic legal scholars, and that it has been rejected in a majority of our sister states. It is also pointed out that contributory negligence works an inherent unfairness by barring plaintiffs from any recovery, even when it is proven, in a particular case, that a defendant\u2019s negligence was primarily responsible for the act or omission which resulted in a plaintiffs injuries. It is said that contributory negligence provides harsh justice to those who may have acted negligently, in minor ways, to contribute to their injuries, and that it absolves those defendants from liability who can find any minor negligence in the plaintiffs\u2019 behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Petitioner correctly contends that, because contributory negligence is a court-created principle, and has not been embodied in Maryland statutes, this Court possesses the authority to change the principle. This Court has recognized that <em>(Ireland v. State, </em>310 Md. 328, 331-332, 529 A.2d 365, 366 (1987)),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">\u201c[bjecause of the inherent dynamism of the common law, we have consistently held that it is subject to judicial modification in light of modern circumstances or increased knowledge. <em>Harris v. State, </em>306 Md. 344, 357, 509 A.2d 120 (1986); <em>Kelley v. R.G. Industries, Inc., </em>304 Md. 124, 497 A.2d 1143 (1985). Equally well established is the principle that the common law should not be changed contrary to the public policy of this State set forth by the General Assembly. <em>Kelley, supra, </em>304 Md. at 141, 497 A.2d [at 1151]; <em>Harrison v. Mont. Co. Bd. of Educ., </em>295 Md. 442, 460-61, 456 A.2d 894 [903] (1983). In the area of civil common law this Court has not only modified the existing law but also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>added to the body of law by recognizing new causes of action. <em>Kelley, supra, </em>(recognizing cause of action against manufacturers or marketers for damages caused by \u2018Saturday Night Special\u2019 handguns); <em>Boblitz v. Boblitz, </em>296 Md. 242, 462 A.2d 506 (1983) (permitting negligence action by one spouse against another); <em>Moxley v. Acker, </em>294 Md. 47, 447 A.2d 857 (1982)(deleting force as a required element of the action of forceable detainer); <em>Adler v. American Standard Corp., </em>291 Md. 31, 432 A.2d 464 (1981) (recognizing tort of abusive or wrongful discharge); <em>Lusby v. Lusby, </em>283 Md. 334, 390 A.2d 77 (1978) (abolishing the defense of interspousal immunity in the case of outrageous intentional torts); <em>Harris v. Jones, </em>281 Md. 560, 380 A.2d 611 (1977) (recognizing tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">The Court\u2019s ability to modify the common law was further underscored in <em>Kelley v. R.G. Industries, Inc., </em>304 Md. 124, 140, 497 A.2d 1143, 1151 (1985):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\">\u201cThis Court has repeatedly said that \u2018the common law is not static; its life and heart is its dynamism \u2014 its ability to keep pace with the world while constantly searching for just and fair solutions to pressing societal problems.\u2019 <em>Harrison v. Mont. Co. Bd. of Educ., </em>295 Md. 442, 460, 456 A.2d 894 (1983). <em>See Felder v. Butler, </em>292 Md. 174, 182, 438 A.2d 494 (1981). The common law is, therefore, subject to judicial modification in light of modern circumstances or increased knowledge. <em>Jones v. State, </em>302 Md. 153, 161, 486 A.2d 184 (1985); <em>Boblitz v.

This Court in <em>Moore v.

Chief Judge Bell emphasized for the Court in <em>Baltimore v. Clark, </em>404 Md. 13, 36, 944 A.2d 1122, 1135-1136 (2008), the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-9\">\u201cIt is well settled that, where the General Assembly has announced public policy, the Court will decline to enter the public policy debate, even when it is the common law that is at issue and the Court certainly has the authority to change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>the common law. <em>Adler v.

As to the last premise, they are wrong. A dinosaur roams yet the landscape of Maryland (and Virginia, Alabama, North Carolina and the District of Columbia), feeding on the claims of persons injured by the negligence of another, but who contributed proximately in some way to the occasion of his or her injuries, however slight their culpability. The name of that dinosaur is the doctrine of contributory negligence.

The History of Contributory Negligence in Maryland</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Under the doctrine of contributory negligence, a plaintiff who fails to exercise ordinary care for his or her own safety, and thus contributes proximately to his or her injury, \u201cis barred from all recovery, regardless of the quantum of a defendant\u2019s primary negligence.\u201d <em>Harrison v. Montgomery Cnty. Bd. of Ed., </em>295 Md. 442, 451, 456 A.2d 894, 898 (1983). Contributory negligence is the \u201cneglect of duty imposed upon all men to observe ordinary care for their own safety,\u201d <em>Potts v. Armour &amp; Co., </em>183 Md. 483, 490, 39 A.2d 552, 556 (1944), and refers not to the breach of a duty owed to another, but rather to the failure of an individual to exercise that degree of care necessary to protect him or her self. <em>Baltimore Cnty. v. State, Use of Keenan, </em>232 Md. 350, 362, 193 A.2d 30, 37 (1963). An \u201call-or-nothing\u201d doctrine, contributory negligence operates in application as a total bar to recovery by an injured plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">The doctrine is of judicial \u201cBig Bang\u201d origin, credited generally to the 1809 English case of <em>Butterfield v. Forrester </em>(1809) 103 Eng. Rep. 926 (K.B.). In <em>Butterfield, </em>the court considered whether a plaintiff, injured while \u201cviolently\u201d riding his horse on a roadway, by a pole negligently placed in the roadway, could recover damages. Denying recovery, Lord Ellenborough penned the first recognized incantation of contributory negligence, declaring, \u201cOne person being in fault will not dispense with another\u2019s using ordinary care for himself. Two things must concur to support this action, an obstruction in the road by the fault of the defendant, and no want of ordinary care to avoid it on the part of the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 927.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>Soon after <em>Butterfield, </em>American courts began to recognize the doctrine of contributory negligence. <em>See Smith v. Smith, </em>19 Mass. (2 Pick.) 621 (1824); William L. Prosser, <em>Comparative Negligence, </em>51 Mich. L.Rev. 465, 468 (1953). Although early courts explained rarely the reasons for their adoption of the doctrine, scholars set forth later multiple reasons for its widespread acceptance in the U.S. in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. For example, its ascendance was considered a means of encouraging potential plaintiffs to comply with the relevant standard of care, 4 Harper, James &amp; Gray on Torts, \u00a7 22.2 at 340 (3d ed. 2006) (hereinafter \u201cHarper, James &amp; Gray\u201d); requiring plaintiffs to enter court with clean hands, Prosser &amp; Keeton on the Law of Torts, \u00a7 65 at 451 (5th ed. 1984) (hereinafter \u201cProsser <em>&amp; </em>Keeton\u201d); and, insulating developing industry from liability and fostering economic growth by keeping in check plaintiff-minded juries. <em>Id. </em>at 452; 4 Harper, James &amp; Gray, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 22.1 at 328-30. The doctrine was seen also as consistent with \u201cseveral unwritten policies of the [nineteenth and early twentieth century] common law\u201d \u2014 specifically, the idea that courts should not assist someone who contributes to causing his or her own injuries, and the \u201cpassion for a simple issue that could be categorically answered yes or no ...\u201d <em>Harrison, </em>295 Md. at 450, 456 A.2d at 897-98; <em>see also </em>Edward S. Digges, Jr. &amp; Robert Dale Klein, <em>Comparative Fault in Maryland: The Time Has Come, </em>41 Md. L.Rev. 276, 278 (1982); Prosser &amp; Keeton, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 65 at 452.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Whatever the initial justifications attributed to its birth, contributory negligence has been a mainstay of Maryland law since its adoption in <em>Irwin v. Sprigg, </em>6 Gill 200 (1847).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>that time, Maryland courts applied the doctrine of contributory negligence to bar recovery in negligence actions by at-fault plaintiffs. Exceptions evolved, however, to allow recovery in specific instances. For example, the defense of contributory negligence is not available against claimants under five years of age, <em>Taylor v. Armiger, </em>277 Md. 638, 649, 358 A.2d 883, 889 (1976), in strict liability actions, <em>Ellsworth v. Sherne Lingerie, Inc., </em>303 Md. 581, 597, 495 A.2d 348, 356 (1985), and in actions based on intentional conduct, <em>Tucker v. State, Use of Johnson, </em>89 Md. 471, 486, 43 A. 778, 783 (1899); <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Hill, </em>139 Md.App. 308, 316-18, 775 A.2d 476, 481-82 (2001). Additionally, the doctrine of last clear chance developed, <em>Northern Cent. Ry. Co. v. State, Use of Price, </em>29 Md. 420, 436 (1868), to allow a plaintiff to recover, despite his or her contributory negligence, if he or she establishes \u201csomething new or sequential, which affords the defendant a fresh opportunity (of which he fails to avail himself) to avert the consequences of his original negligence.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Sanner v. Guard, </em>236 Md. 271, 276, 203 A.2d 885, 888 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The all-or-nothing consequences of the application of contributory negligence have long been criticized nationally by scholars and commentators. <em>See, e.g., Hilen v. Hays, </em>673 S.W.2d 713, 717 (Ky.1984) (\u201cA list of the critics of contributory negligence as a complete bar to a plaintiffs recovery reads like a tort hall of fame. The list includes, among others, Campbell, Fleming, Green, Harper and James, Dreton, Leflar, Malone, Pound and Prosser.\u201d); Prosser, <em>Comparative Negligence, supra, </em>at 469 (\u201cCriticism of the denial of recovery was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>not slow in coming, and it has been with us for more than a century.\u201d); 2 Dan B. Dobbs, Paul T. Hayden &amp; Ellen M. Bublick, The Law of Torts, \u00a7 218 at 763 (2d ed. 2011) (hereinafter \u201cDobbs\u201d) (\u201cThe traditional contributory negligence rule was extreme not merely in results but in principle. No satisfactory reasoning has ever explained the rule.\u201d). Many have argued instead for, and most states have adopted,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a system of comparative negligence which apportions damages between a negligent plaintiff and a negligent defendant according to each party\u2019s relative degree of fault. Thus, under a comparative negligence system, a plaintiffs contributory negligence does not bar recovery, but rather reduces proportionately his or her damages in relation to his or her degree of fault.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 2 Dobbs, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 220 at 771.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">This Court considered previously whether to replace the common law doctrine of contributory negligence with a system of comparative fault. <em>See Harrison, </em>295 Md. 442, 456 A.2d 894; <em>Pittsburg &amp; Connellsville R.R. Co. v. Andrews, </em>39 Md. 329, 351 (1874) (noting that a doctrine requiring the relative fault of a plaintiff and defendant to be compared \u201chas never been sanctioned in this State, but the exact contrary is the settled rule here\u201d). We confronted this question most recently nearly thirty years ago. In <em>Harrison, </em>we considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>whether to abrogate judicially contributory negligence in the midst of a nation-wide movement to transition to a system of comparative fault.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We engaged first in a comparison of the historical and doctrinal principles of both contributory and comparative negligence. <em>Harrison, </em>295 Md. at 449-53, 456 A.2d at 897-99. Although recognizing the growing trend toward adopting principles of comparative fault, <em>id. </em>at 456-58, 456 A.2d at 901-02, we noted, on the other hand, Maryland\u2019s long history of applying the doctrine of contributory negligence. <em>Id. </em>at 458, 456 A.2d at 902. <em>See Irwin, </em>6 Gill at 205 (adopting the doctrine of contributory negligence); <em>Pittsburg &amp; Connellsville R.R. Co., </em>39 Md. at 351 (affirming Maryland\u2019s adherence to contributory, rather than comparative, negligence).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Although acknowledging further that jurisdictions transitioning from contributory negligence to comparative fault regimes experienced little difficulty in doing so, <em>Harrison, </em>295 Md. at 454, 456 A.2d at 900, we noted that making such a doctrinal change requires consideration of a multitude of options and implications. <em>Id. </em>at 462-63, 456 A.2d at 904-05. For example, this Court would have to choose between a pure or modified fault system, and consider \u201cthe effect which a comparative fault system would have on other fundamental areas of negligence law,\u201d such as the \u201clast clear chance doctrine, assumption of the risk, joint and several liability, contribution, setoffs and counterclaims, and application of the doctrine to other fault systems, such as strict liability in tort....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 455, 456 A.2d at 900. Noting the lack of uniformity among the systems adopted by new comparative fault jurisdictions in their treatment of these areas, we characterized the decision whether to adopt either pure or modified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>comparative fault as one \u201cplainly involving] major policy considerations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 462, 456 A.2d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">Perhaps overawed by the difficult choices inherent in adopting comparative negligence, however, the <em>Harrison </em>court declined to ride atop the tsunami of states abandoning contributory negligence. Instead, the <em>Harrison </em>majority observed that \u201cscant attention\u201d had been paid by the Maryland Bench and Bar to the relative merits of contributory and comparative negligence, <em>id. </em>at 458, 456 A.2d at 902, and that, although the Legislature had considered numerous bills proposing to adopt comparative fault, none were enacted ultimately. <em>Id. </em>at 461-62, 456 A.2d at 904. Thus, ignoring the great societal change nationally demonstrating the unsuitability of contributory negligence principles to modern life, but finding no evidence of that groundswell in Maryland, we deferred instead to the Legislature, inferring from its inaction an \u201cintention to retain the contributory negligence doctrine\u201d as the public policy of the State of Maryland. <em>Id. </em>at 462, 456 A.2d at 904. We concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">All things considered, we are unable to say that the circumstances of modern life have so changed as to render contributory negligence a vestige of the past, no longer suitable to the needs of the people of Maryland. In the final analysis, whether to abandon the doctrine of contributory negligence in favor of comparative negligence involves fundamental and basic public policy considerations properly to be addressed by the legislature.

In the absence of codification by the Legislature, the defense of contributory negligence remains a dependent of the common law, and as such, is within the province of its parent, this Court, to abrogate or modify that to which it gave birth and nurtured. <em>See, e.g., Price v.

I disagree. Principles of <em>stare decisis </em>do not require continued adherence to our decision in <em>Harrison, </em>nor does this Court owe continued deference to the General Assembly simply because of the difficult choices inherent in formulating a comparative negligence rule.

Similarly, in <em>Julian v.

For example, we declined for decades to abrogate the common law interspousal immunity doctrine prohibiting married women from maintaining actions in tort against their husbands, in each instance deferring expressly to the Legislature. <em>See Stokes v.

Boblitz, </em>296 Md. 242, 462 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>506 (1983). In so doing, we distanced ourselves from our prior cases and characterized the decision as one appropriate for judicial action.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We considered persuasive the evolution of society\u2019s conceptions regarding women and the trend toward abrogation in other states, concluding that the foundation of the doctrine no longer coincided with modern values. Thus, we determined that we could depart fairly from principles of <em>stare decisis </em>and overrule the doctrine\u2019s application in negligence actions as a \u201cvestige of the past.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 273-75, 462 A.2d at 521-22. We distinguished <em>Harrison, </em>however, as both possessing a history of legislative inaction on proposed bills (lacking in the context of interspousal immunity) and involving necessarily more complex issues, stating that <em>Harrison </em>represented an attempt to grant judicially that which \u201cthe Legislature repeatedly had rejected efforts to achieve legislatively.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 274, 462 A.2d at 521. Yet, we emphasized that, despite our decision in <em>Harrison, </em>it remains well within the authority of this Court to abrogate an outmoded rule of the common law. <em>Id. </em>at 274, 462 A.2d at 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">We abandoned completely the doctrine of interspousal immunity finally in <em>Bozman v. Bozman, </em>376 Md. 461, 830 A.2d 450 (2003). We noted that, because forty-six states had done so already, in full or in part, \u201cthe trend and, indeed, the great weight of authority\u201d was in favor of abrogating the common law doctrine as \u201coutdated and serving] no useful purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 487-88, 830 A.2d at 466. Although we acknowledged that certain aspects of the common law concept, upon which the doctrine rested at its conception, would be retained in various provisions of the Maryland Code, we found such remnants insufficient to shield the doctrine from judicial aboli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>tion. <em>Id. </em>at 489, 830 A.2d at 466-67. Considering the decisions of our sister jurisdictions to be persuasive authority in analyzing the arguments \u201cboth in support of, and against, retention of the interspousal immunity rule,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 490, 830 A.2d at 467, we determined that the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>did not require strict adherence to the doctrine or continued legislative deference. <em>Id. </em>at 494-95, 830 A.2d at 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Thus, as our abrogation of the interspousal tort immunity doctrine demonstrates, this Court has not only the power, but also the responsibility <em>(Harrison </em>notwithstanding) to abrogate the doctrine of contributory negligence if it concludes that the state of society and law have changed so that contributory negligence is a vestige of the past, unsuitable to the conditions of modern life. To that end, this Court reviews the foundation of the doctrine to determine its continued relevance in modern society, and considers persuasive, although not binding, the actions of other states on this issue. <em>See id. </em>at 490, 830 A.2d at 467. Additionally, we may analyze, to some degree (limited by the factual record before us), \u201cthe public policy concerns raised by the parties and by the other courts which have grappled with this issue.\u201d <em>State v. Wiegmann, </em>350 Md. 585, 607, 714 A.2d 841, 851 (1998) (quoting <em>Gaver v. Harrant, </em>316 Md. 17, 30, 557 A.2d 210, 217 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">As noted above, the widespread acceptance of contributory negligence as a complete defense is attributed principally to (1) the desire to protect the nations\u2019 newly-developing industry from liability and plaintiff-minded juries, E.A. Turk, <em>Comparative Negligence on the March, </em>28 Chi.-Kent L.Rev. 189, 201 (1950); 4 Harper, James &amp; Gray, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 22.1 at 328-30; and (2) \u201cthe concept prevalent at the time that a plaintiffs irresponsibility in failing to use due care for his own safety erased whatever fault could be laid at defendant\u2019s feet for contributing to the injury.\u201d <em>Scott v. Rizzo, </em>96 N.M. 682, 634 P.2d 1234, 1237 (1981) (citing F. Harper and F. James, Law of Torts, \u00a7 22.1 at 1198 (1956)). Neither of these justifications, however, carry weight in present-day Maryland. In today\u2019s soci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>ety,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> there has been no need demonstrated to protect any \u201cnewly-developing\u201d industry at the expense of injured litigants. Industry generally in this nation is no longer fledgling or so prone to withering at the prospect of liability. <em>See, e.g., Alvis v. Ribar, </em>85 Ill.2d 1, 52 Ill.Dec. 23, 421 N.E.2d 886, 893 (1981) (\u201cThere is no longer any justification for providing the protective barrier of the contributory negligence rule for industries of the nation at the expense of deserving litigants.\u201d); Frum<em>mer v. Hilton Hotels Int'l, Inc., </em>60 Misc.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>840, 304 N.Y.S.2d 335, 341-42 (N.Y.Sup.1969) (\u201cCourts now do not feel any need to act as a protector of our nation\u2019s infant industries, for their infancy has long since passed.... In an age where a defendant may through various means, such as insurance, readily protect himself from a ruinous judgment, the solicitude of nineteenth century courts for defendants is certainly out of place.... \u201d). Moreover, tilting the scales to favor industry is inconsistent with modern conceptions of justice, which focus instead on proportional responsibility and fundamental fairness. <em>See Hilen v. Hays, </em>673 S.W.2d 713, 718 (Ky.1984) (\u201cIt may well be that the 19th century judicial mind perceived of the need for courts to tilt the scales of justice in favor of defendants to keep the liabilities of growing industry within some bounds. But assuming such a rule was ever viable, certainly it no longer comports to present day morality and concepts of fundamental fairness.\u201d (internal citation and quotation marks omitted)); Robert H. Lande &amp; James MacAlister, <em>Comparative Negligence with Joint &amp; Several Liability: The Best of Both Worlds, </em>U. Balt. L.Rev. Online 1, 2 (2012) (noting that Maryland\u2019s system of contributory negligence \u201cfrustrated the interests of justice as to the litigants\u201d). Rather, the array of Amici lined up in support of the continuation of contributory negligence is populated by the entrenched and established business interests who seek to maintain an economic advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">The evolution of society\u2019s conceptions of justice is exemplified by the move of tort law away from traditional \u201call-or-nothing\u201d recovery rules and toward allocation of the burden of liability among at-fault parties. Guido Calabresi &amp; Jeffrey O. Cooper, <em>The Monsanto Lecture: New Directions in Tort Law, </em>30 Val. U.L. Rev. 859, 868 (1995). Liability, in negligence actions, \u201cfollows tortious conduct.\u201d <em>Austin v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>286 Md. 51, 83, 405 A.2d 255, 272 (1979) (Cole, J., dissenting); <em>Scott, </em>634 P.2d at 1241 (\u201cLiability based on fault is the cornerstone of tort law....\u201d). Contributory negligence is at odds with this fundamental premise. By barring recovery completely to a contributorily negligent plaintiff, the rule \u201cvisits the entire loss caused by the fault of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>two parties on one of them alone, and that one the injured plaintiff, least able to bear it, and quite possibly much less at fault than the defendant who goes scot-free.\u201d Prosser, <em>Comparative Negligence, supra, </em>at 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Respondent and its Amici count as a strength of the doctrine of contributory negligence its inflexibility in refusing to compensate any, even marginally, at-fault plaintiff. They argue that, in so doing, contributory negligence encourages personal responsibility by foreclosing the possibility of recovery for potential, negligent plaintiffs, and thus cannot possibly be outmoded.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> To the contrary, that the doctrine of contributory negligence grants one party a windfall at the expense of the other is, as courts and commentators alike have noted, unfair manifestly as a matter of policy. <em>See, e.g., Kaatz v. State, </em>540 P.2d 1037, 1048 (Alaska 1975) (\u201cThe central reason for adopting a comparative negligence system lies in the inherent injustice of the contributory negligence rule.\u201d); <em>Hoffman v. Jones, </em>280 So.2d 431, 436 (Fla.1973) (\u201cWhatever may have been the historical justification for [the rule of contributory negligence], today it is almost universally regarded as unjust and inequitable to vest an entire accidental loss on one of the parties whose negligent conduct combined with the negligence of the other party to produce the loss.\u201d); Lande &amp; MacAlister, <em>supra, </em>at 4 (\u201cThe \u2018all or nothing\u2019 system [of contributory negligence], disconnected from a party\u2019s degree of fault, is unfair and counterintuitive.\u201d); Prosser, <em>Comparative Negligence, supra, </em>at 469 (characterizing contributory negligence as \u201coutrageous\u201d and an \u201cobvious injustice\u201d that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>\u201c[n]o one has ever succeeded in justifying ..., and no one ever will\u201d). Moreover, if contributory negligence encourages would-be plaintiffs to exercise caution with respect to themselves, then so too does the doctrine of comparative fault by reducing the plaintiffs recoverable damages. Unlike contributory negligence, however, comparative fault deters also negligence on the part of the defendant by holding him or her responsible for the damages that he or she inflicted on the plaintiff. <em>See </em>Lande <em>&amp; </em>MacAlister, <em>supra, </em>at 5-6 (noting that, although contributory negligence systems \u201cburden[ ] only plaintiffs with the obligation to take precautions,\u201d comparative negligence provides a \u201cmixture of responsibility\u201d that is \u201cthe best way to prevent most accidents\u201d); Prosser, <em>Comparative Negligence, supra, </em>at 468 (\u201c[T]he assumption that the speeding motorist is, or should be meditating on the possible failure of a lawsuit for his possible injuries lacks all reality, and it is quite as reasonable to say that the rule promotes accidents by encouraging the negligent defendant.\u201d). Thus, Respondent\u2019s contention that contributory negligence encourages personal responsibility, and is therefore preferable to comparative negligence, is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Respondent contends also that the foundation of contributory negligence remains strong because, as we said in <em>Harrison, </em>\u201cMaryland cases do not reflect any general dissatisfaction with the contributory negligence doctrine.\u201d 295 Md. at 458, 456 A.2d at 898. That the courts of this State have applied uniformly the doctrine, however, does not mean that we did not recognize along the way its flaws.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>See Bozman, </em>376 Md. at 472, 830 A.2d at 457. For example, as Judge Eldridge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>noted recently, our retention of contributory negligence garnered extensive criticism \u2014 \u201cfew if any other legal principles have been criticized as much as this Court\u2019s continued adherence in negligence actions to the doctrine of contributory negligence and the Court\u2019s refusal to adopt comparative negligence.\u201d <em>State v. Adams, </em>406 Md. 240, 332, 958 A.2d 295, 351 (2008) (Eldridge, J., dissenting), <em>overruled by Unger v. State, </em>427 Md. 383, 48 A.3d 242 (2012). The Court of Special Appeals also noted similar criticism, calling the doctrine \u201charsh and pitiless,\u201d and noted that we are among the severe minority of states adhering still to it. <em>See Preston Carter v. Senate Masonry, Inc., </em>156 Md.App. 162, 175, 846 A.2d 50, 58 (2004); <em>see also Stewart v. Hechinger Stores Co., </em>118 Md.App. 354, 359, 702 A.2d 946, 949 (1997) (\u201cAlthough we are aware of the often harsh consequences of Maryland\u2019s common law doctrine of contributory negligence, and that it has been abandoned by a vast majority of states in favor of some form of comparative negligence, we are in no position summarily to do so.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Moreover, since our decision in <em>Harrison, </em>the doctrine of comparative negligence has continued to be accepted elsewhere as the superior legal principle. At the time <em>Harrison </em>was decided, thirty-nine states had replaced the doctrine of contributory negligence with some form of comparative negligence. <em>See </em>295 Md. at 453, 456 A.2d at 899. This trend has continued unabated. Today, the number of states applying comparative negligence is forty-six, and not one jurisdiction adopting it has since retreated and re-adopted contributory negligence. Rather, seven additional states have enacted comparative negligence systems since <em>Harrison. </em>What was at the time of <em>Harrison </em>a quickening trend within the United States is today an established principle of law in nearly every right-thinking common law jurisdiction in the world, <em>see Pla</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number><em>cek v. City of Sterling Heights, </em>405 Mich. 638, 275 N.W.2d 511, 515 (1979) (\u201c[Ajlmost every common-law jurisdiction outside the United States has discarded contributory negligence and has adopted in its place a more equitable system of comparative negligence.\u201d); John W. Wade, <em>A Uniform Comparative Fault Act</em>\u2014What <em>Should it Provide?, </em>10 U. Mich. J.L. Reform 220, 221 (1977) (noting that after England, Canada, and Australia abrogated contributory negligence, the United States became the \u201cprimary location of the contributory negligence rule\u201d), with the exception of Maryland, Alabama, the District of Columbia, North Carolina, and Virginia. <em>See </em>2 Dobbs, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 220 at 772.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">Respondent argues, in effect, that there has not been a significant change in the state of law or society since <em>Harrison, </em>and therefore there is no reason to depart from <em>stare decisis </em>and reconsider whether the doctrine of contributory negligence should be retained in the State of Maryland. I could not disagree more. At the time <em>Harrison </em>was decided, the country was in the midst of a broad reform effort sweeping the nation. The doctrine of comparative fault was of fairly recent vintage at the time <em>Harrison </em>was filed, adopted in most states in the ten years prior to our decision. <em>See </em>Robert D. Cooter &amp; Thomas S. Ulen, <em>An Economic Case for Comparative Negligence, </em>61 N.Y.U. L.Rev. 1067, 1075 (1986) (noting that most states adopted comparative negligence in the 1970s and early 1980s). Essentially, Respondent contends that, because our decision in <em>Harrison </em>was made when the movement toward reform of negligence principles was well underway, this Court is constrained to retain the doctrine forever, having missed the single opportunity to get on board the train. Respondent\u2019s argument seems to suggest that, so long as there is some delay in abandoning an unjust law, the unjust law remains irretrievably an albatross tied around the neck of our common law, unless and until the Legislature decides to save us.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As our decision in <em>Bozman </em>demonstrates, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>our authority to modify the <em>common </em>law and overrule prior decisions is not so limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Although only seven additional states have implemented comparative fault since <em>Harrison, </em>forty-six states now employ comparative fault.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Comparative fault is no longer a trend or a doctrine of recent vintage, but rather is an established and integral doctrine to the negligence systems of nearly every state in the country. Other jurisdictions, most notably those that abrogated contributory negligence judicially, have decades of experience applying comparative fault \u2014 experience that, in large part, was lacking at the time we decided <em>Harrison. </em>The twelve states to abrogate contributory negligence by judicial decision provide examples of how comparative negligence is applied, how it impacts collateral doctrines and fault systems, and how it is applied in reality.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In essence, this Court may foresee more clearly today potential impacts and complications, as well as the value of a comparative fault system, than was possible in 1983. Maryland is no longer at the crest of a wave of reform \u2014 instead, it has been left behind, one of the last bastions of contributory negligence in a world which has discarded it as unjust and outmoded. In my estimation, this qualifies certainly as a significant change warranting reconsideration of <em>Harrison.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Although I recognize certainly the value of the doctrine of <em>stare decisis, see, e.g., Unger v. State, </em>427 Md. 383, 418, 48 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>A.3d 242, 262 (2012) (Harrell, J., dissenting), I do not believe that in this instance, strict adherence is appropriate or warranted. <em>See, e.g., Alvis, </em>52 Ill.Dec. 23, 421 N.E.2d at 896 (\u201cClearly, the need for stability in law must not be allowed to obscure the changing needs of society or to veil the injustice resulting from a doctrine in need of reevaluation.\u201d); <em>McIntyre v. Balentine, </em>833 S.W.2d 52, 56 (Tenn.l992)(declining to \u201cmindlessfly]\u201d follow <em>stare </em>decisis). I do not believe that because <em>Harrison </em>reaffirmed the vitality of contributory negligence in this State, absent legislative action, this Court is muted forever on the topic. The bounds of <em>stare decisis </em>are not so strict. Continued adherence to the doctrine of contributory negligence as rote obeisance to the principles of <em>stare decisis </em>and legislative deference \u201crepresents judicial inertia rather than a reasoned consideration of the intrinsic value of the rule.\u201d <em>Kaatz, </em>540 P.2d at 1049. Contributory negligence is no longer justified, has been discarded by nearly every other jurisdiction, and is manifestly unjust. Thus, I conclude that contributory negligence is a vestige of the past, and that in considering whether to abrogate the doctrine of contributory negligence, we are not bound by our decision in <em>Harrison.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">B. This Court Need Not Defer to Continued Legislative Inaction</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Respondent argues that, notwithstanding our decision in <em>Harrison, </em>whether to abrogate contributory negligence in favor of comparative fault is a matter more properly suited to the legislative, rather than judicial, process. In <em>Harrison, </em>we noted that \u201cin considering whether a long-established common law rule \u2014 unchanged by the legislature and thus reflective of this State\u2019s public policy \u2014 is unsound in the circumstances of modern life, we have always recognized that declaration of the public policy of Maryland is normally the function of the General Assembly.\u201d 295 Md. at 460, 456 A.2d at 903. Because declaration of public policy is generally a matter for the Legislature, we declared our \u201cparticular! ] reluctance] to alter a common law rule in the face of indications that to do so would be contrary to the public policy of the State!,]\u201d <em>id., </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>noted that we owe \u201cinitial deference to the legislature where change is sought in a long-established and well-settled common law principle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461, 456 A.2d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">In considering whether the doctrine of contributory negligence was declared the public policy of the State of Maryland, we placed particular emphasis on the Legislature\u2019s consideration of numerous bills proposing to adopt the doctrine of comparative negligence. Specifically, we noted that between 1966 and 1982, the General Assembly considered twenty-one bills proposing the adoption of comparative negligence, yet none passed. Id. \u201cAlthough not conclusive,\u201d we stated, \u201cthe legislature\u2019s action in rejecting the proposed change is indicative of an intention [on the part of the Legislature] to retain the contributory negligence doctrine.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Our statements in <em>Harrison </em>did not circumscribe, however, our authority to alter judicially-created common law rules in the face of repeated legislative inaction on the subject. Although we have declined frequently to effect changes in decisional doctrine upon observing repeated legislative inaction, <em>see, e.g., Potomac Valley Orthopaedic Assocs. v. Md. State Bd. of Physicians, </em>417 Md. 622, 639-40, 12 A.3d 84, 94 (2011) (\u201cOur conclusion is confirmed by the fact that, in 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010, the General Assembly \u2018rejected efforts to achieve legislatively that which we [are being] asked to grant judicially.\u2019 \u201d (alterations in original) (citation omitted)); <em>Moore v. State, </em>388 Md. 623, 641, 882 A.2d 256, 257 (2005) (\u201cLegislative inaction is very significant where bills have repeatedly been introduced in the General Assembly to accomplish a particular result, and where the General Assembly has persistently refused to enact such bills.\u201d), we determined, on multiple occasions, that legislative inaction may not be a sufficient premise from which to draw a positive legislative intent in certain situations. <em>See, e.g., City of Balt. Dev. Corp. v. Carmel Realty Assocs., </em>395 Md. 299, 329, 910 A.2d 406, 424 (2006) (cautioning against drawing a positive inference from legislative inaction because \u201cthe General Assembly may well have ... decided not to enact the amendment for a myriad of other reasons\u201d); <em>Goldstein v. State, </em>339 Md. 563, 570, 664 A.2d 375, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>378 (1995) (\u201c[T]he mere fact that the General Assembly has declined to adopt a particular proposal does not preclude this Court from incorporating the substance of that proposal into the common law....\u201d); <em>Automobile Trade Assoc. of Md., Inc. v. Ins. Comm\u2019r, </em>292 Md. 15, 24, 437 A.2d 199, 203 (1981) (\u201c[T]he fact that a bill on a specific subject fails of passage in the General Assembly is a rather weak reed upon which to lean in ascertaining legislative intent.\u201d); <em>Cicoria v. State, </em>89 Md.App. 403, 428 n. 9, 598 A.2d 771, 775 n. 9 (1991) (noting that \u201c[tjrying to determine what the legislature intended (or did not intend) by rejecting those bills is no easy assignment\u201d and declining to draw either a positive or negative inference from the rejected bills).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Although the <em>Harrison </em>court opted to defer to the Legislature, the opinion in that case gives no indication that such deference was unlimited. No acknowledgment was advanced that we lack the authority to alter a long-standing common law rule where the Legislature declines to enact proposed legislation. Rather, we expressed that we are \u201cparticularly reluctant\u201d to do so, and that we give <em>\u201cinitial </em>deference\u201d to the Legislature when considering a change to long-standing common law principles. <em>Harrison, </em>295 Md. at 460-61, 456 A.2d at 903-04 (emphasis added). Further, we did not characterize the inaction of the General Assembly as a conclusive, definitive declaration of public policy \u2014 to the contrary, we specifically stated that legislative inaction is \u201cnot conclusive\u201d and merely \u201cindicative of an intention to retain the doctrine of contributory negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461, 456 A.2d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">I acknowledge, of course, that legislative consideration of comparative negligence did not cease with our decision in <em>Harrison. </em>The General Assembly considered numerous comparative negligence bills since <em>Harrison, </em>but has not to this date reached an agreement that comparative negligence should become the law of this State by legislative act.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>pace of consideration of comparative negligence bills slowed dramatically in recent years, however. Since 2003, the General Assembly considered the adoption of comparative negligence only once, <em>see </em>H.B. 110, 2007 Leg., 423d Sess. (Md. 2007), <em>crossfiled with </em>S.B. 267, 2007 Leg., 423d Sess. (Md. 2007), whereas in the ten years preceding <em>Harrison </em>(1974-83), the Legislature considered ten independent bills. <em>See </em>H.B. 1007, 1982 Leg., 388th Sess. (Md. 1982); H.B. 633, 1981 Leg., 387th Sess. (Md. 1981); H.B. 98, 1980 Leg, 386th Sess. (Md. 1980); H.B. 1484, 1980 Leg., 386th Sess. (Md. 1980); H.B. 1381, 1979 Leg., 385th Sess. (Md. 1979); H.B. 1386, 1979 Leg., 385th Sess. (Md. 1979); H.B. 2004, 1977 Leg., 383d Sess. (Md. 1977); H.B. 377, 1976 Leg., 382d Sess. (Md. 1976); S.B. 106, 1976 Leg, 382d Sess. (Md. 1976); H.B. 405, 1975 Leg, 380th Sess. (Md. 1975). No favorable committee action has been taken on a comparative negligence bill since 1988. <em>See </em>Department of Legislative Services, <em>Negligence Systems: Contributory Negligence, Comparative Fault, and Joint and Several Liability </em>31 (2004) (hereinafter <em>\u201cNegligence Systems </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Declining to perpetuate unmindful deference to the Legislature on such a topic would not be without precedent. For example, as noted above, this Court stated repeatedly its intention to defer to legislative action on the topic of inter-spousal immunity before acting. <em>See Stokes, </em>248 Md. at 692, 237 A.2d at 763; <em>Ennis, </em>222 Md. at 543, 161 A.2d at 702; <em>Fernandez, </em>214 Md. at 524, 135 A.2d at 889. Decades later, after noting the Legislature\u2019s continued stasis on the subject, we rescinded our deference and modernized an outdated common law rule. <em>See Bozman, </em>376 Md. 461, 830 A.2d 450; <em>Boblitz, </em>296 Md. 242, 462 A.2d 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>Other states, too, abrogated judicially the doctrine of contributory negligence in spite of legislative inaction on proposed bills of like objective.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> For example, during the approximate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>ly fifteen years prior to the Kentucky Supreme Court\u2019s abrogation of contributory negligence in 1984, the Kentucky Legislature considered a comparative negligence bill \u201cin most, if not all\u201d legislative sessions. <em>Hilen, </em>673 S.W.2d at 717. Yet, despite legislative consideration of (and inaction on) the issue, the Kentucky Supreme Court abrogated the doctrine, noting its systematic rejection, \u201cfirst legislatively, and then judicially where the legislature has refused to act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 716-17. Similarly, the Missouri Supreme Court deferred repeatedly to legislative consideration and an opportunity to act for over five years, noting that ordinarily the policy considerations implicit in making such a doctrinal change were more appropriate for the legislature, particularly in light of increased legislative interest in the topic. <em>See Steinman v. Strobel, </em>589 S.W.2d 293, 294 (Mo.1979); <em>Epple v. Western Auto Supply Co., </em>557 S.W.2d 253, 254 (Mo.1977). Indeed, even after applying a nudge to the legislature by abandoning \u201cactive-passive negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>gence\u201d in favor of comparative fault principles in cases involving multiple defendants, <em>see Missouri Pac. R.R. Co. v. Whitehead &amp; Kales Co., </em>566 S.W.2d 466 (Mo.1978), the Missouri Supreme Court continued to express its preference for legislative action. <em>Steinman, </em>589 S.W.2d at 294. By 1983, however, shortly after our decision in <em>Harrison, </em>the Missouri Supreme Court decided it had waited long enough and abrogated contributory negligence generally by judicial decision, stating, \u201cWe have remained quiescent more than five years while waiting for the legislature to act.\u201d <em>Gustafson v. Benda, </em>661 S.W.2d 11, 15 (Mo.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">The New Mexico Supreme Court asserted that its legislature\u2019s inaction on proposed bills could be \u201cindicative of its belief that it is more appropriate for the judiciary than the legislature to open the door which the judiciary initially closed.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>634 P.2d at 1238-39. It characterized further legislative inaction as resulting from \u201clegislative inertia,\u201d rather than from a principled policy decision. <em>Id. </em>The Illinois Supreme Court also noted that a stalemate caused by a \u201cmutual state of inaction in which the court awaits action from the legislature and the legislature awaits guidance from the court\u201d constitutes a \u201cmanifest injustice to the public.\u201d <em>Alvis, </em>421 N.E.2d at 896. In such a situation, the court said, \u201cit is the imperative duty of the court to repair that injustice and reform the law to be responsive to the demands of society.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Consequently, we should put an end to the staring contest in Maryland and act to conclude the Alphonse &amp; Gaston routine that has settled in between our two branches of government.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Respondent also contends that, the abstract principle of deference to legislative inaction notwithstanding, replacing the doctrine of contributory negligence is a task more appropriate for legislative action because that potential deliberative and comprehensive decision-making process is suited better to resolution of the complex policy considerations involved in adopting comparative fault and its collateral impacts. The <em>Harrison </em>court expressed a particular reluctance to abrogate contributory negligence due to the nature of comparative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>negligence as not being \u201ca unitary doctrine[,] but one which has been adopted by other states in either a pure or modified form.\u201d 295 Md. at 462, 456 A.2d at 904. Characterizing the choice between pure and modified comparative fault as \u201ca policy issue of major dimension,\u201d this Court opted in 1988 to leave the choice to the General Assembly. <em>Id. </em>at 463, 456 A.2d at 905. Respondent contends that, because this decision implicates policy considerations and this Court is limited in its consideration of the impact on collateral doctrines and principles by the facts of this case,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> we should continue to refrain from adopting comparative negligence and disrupting long-settled law to avoid confusion and disarray in our courts. Moreover, Respondent and its Amici argue that abolishing the doctrine of contributory negligence is bad public policy. They contend that in so doing, we would inject chaos and uncertainty into an area of settled law, and increase litigation, insurance rates, and taxes.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Although the transition from contributory to comparative negligence systems is plainly \u201ca policy issue of major dimen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>sion,\u201d I do not think that it is an issue on which awaiting legislative catharsis is appropriate any longer. Contributory negligence is a spawn of the court system \u2014 and as such, this Court is eminently able and uniquely situated to stay the course. Moreover, as the South Carolina Court of Appeals noted, the potential for a legislative body to affect comprehensively a doctrinal substitution has not proven out uniformly in execution. <em>Langley v. Boyter, </em>284 S.C. 162, 325 S.E.2d 550, 560 (App.1984), <em>quashed, </em>286 S.C. 85, 332 S.E.2d 100 (1984), <em>cited with approval, Nelson v. Concrete Supply Co., </em>303 S.C. 243, 399 S.E.2d 783, 784 (1991) (\u201c[T]he history of legislative action in the various states which have adopted the doctrine [of comparative negligence] by statute reveals that comprehensive statutes are not usually adopted.\u201d). Rather, most states adopting comparative negligence via legislative act have enacted short-form statutes that leave most doctrinal issues to be shaped and developed by the courts. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">Additionally, deferring this issue to a future court or legislative session on grounds that the present case offers insufficient facts to reach binding declarations regarding all collateral doctrines and principles does not weigh so heavily as this Court\u2019s responsibility to administer justice. As this argument goes, \u201cin essence, ... where a court cannot correct all injustice, it should correct none.\u201d <em>Id. </em>I am not persuaded that making the change by judicial decision, necessarily leaving some further development of the doctrine of comparative negligence to another day, will wreak havoc on our system of justice or the State\u2019s economy. To the contrary, the experiences of other states, having made an analogous change, \u201cprovide an accurate barometer of what can be expected after abrogation.\u201d <em>Bozman, </em>376 Md. at 496, 830 A.2d at 471. In the twelve other states to abrogate by judicial decision the doctrine of contributory negligence, there is scant evidence that the judicial system was thrown into unmanageable disarray. In fact, other courts noted that \u201cthe fears of administering the doctrine are greater than the reality,\u201d and that the difficulties presumed inherent in the adoption of comparative negligence \u201care outweighed by the injustices attendant upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>any delay in adopting the comparative negligence (fault) rule.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>634 P.2d at 1239, 1241.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">I recognize that a shift to comparative fault implicates numerous collateral doctrines. I expect fully that questions will arise about the application of comparative fault in practice in the State of Maryland that cannot be answered conclusively in the present case. This Court would be well-served, however, to place trust in the full array of the Judiciary of this State to administer faithfully the principles of comparative negligence in accordance with this Court\u2019s direction. Thus, I reject Respondent\u2019s contention that this matter is best left to a legislative enactment that <em>might </em>address all potential applications of the doctrine of comparative negligence in a single coup, rather than trusting to the incremental decisions that follow in the common law tradition, beginning with a seminal action by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">III. This Court Should Adopt Pure Comparative Fault</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Having concluded, as I have, that the doctrine of contributory negligence must fall, the question becomes: what form of comparative negligence should be adopted? Although the precise formulations of comparative fault systems may vary, there are essentially two basic forms: pure and modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Under a system of pure comparative fault, damages are apportioned among the parties according to the fact finder\u2019s determination of the percentage that each party\u2019s negligence contributed to the injury. Cooter &amp; Ulen, <em>supra, </em>at 1076. A plaintiff is permitted to recover from the defendant (or defendants) the portion of his or her damages which the defendant (or defendants) caused \u2014 regardless of the quantum of the plaintiffs contributory negligence. 4 Harper, James &amp; Gray, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 22.15 at 458. Thus, even if the plaintiffs degree of fault exceeds that of the defendant (or defendants), the plaintiff may recover damages reduced by the proportion that the plaintiff is at fault. <em>See id.; </em>Digges &amp; Klein, <em>supra, </em>at 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Modified comparative fault, by contrast, considers relevant the proportion of the plaintiffs relative fault in varying de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>grees, depending on the standard adopted. Under such systems, a plaintiff \u201cescapes the contributory negligence bar only if his share of the responsibility falls within a specified limitation.\u201d 4 Harper, James &amp; Gray, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 22.15 at 458. States that adopt a modified system generally choose one of two forms, allowing recovery of damages by a plaintiff reduced by the percentage of his or her own fault if either (1) the plaintiff\u2019s relative fault is less than the combined fault of all of the defendants;<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> or (2) the plaintiffs relative fault is not greater than the combined fault of all of the defendants.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">This Court should adopt for Maryland pure comparative negligence. Pure comparative negligence is favored almost universally by legal scholars and academics. It is \u201cthe fairest, most logical and simplest to administer of all available systems.\u201d <em>Goetzman, </em>327 N.W.2d at 754. Because pure comparative negligence emphasizes the relationship of an individual\u2019s fault to the ultimate damages, \u201c[njeither party is unjustly enriched[, and] [njeither party escapes liability resulting from his negligent acts or omissions.\u201d <em>Alvis, </em>421 N.E.2d at 897. The shades of gray in jury determinations<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> assigning propor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>tions of fault is not, in a pure system, the difference between substantial recovery and no recovery at all. <em>See </em>Prosser, <em>Comparative Negligence, supra, </em>at 493-94 (\u201cIt is obvious that a slight difference in the proportionate fault [under a modified system] may permit a recovery; and there has been much quite justified criticism of a rule under which a plaintiff who is charged with 49 per cent of the total negligence recovers 51 percent of his damages, while one who is charged with 50 per cent recovers nothing at all.\u201d). Critics of pure comparative negligence call it a \u201cradical break\u201d from the principles of contributory negligence, and view a modified version instead as a logical evolution away from contributory negligence. <em>See Bradley v. Appalachian Power Co., </em>163 W.Va. 332, 256 S.E.2d 879, 885 (1979) (noting an unwillingness \u201cto abandon the concept that where a party substantially contributes to his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>own damages, he should not be permitted to recover for any part of them\u201d). Pure comparative negligence, however, more closely hews to the principle on which comparative fault systems are based' \u2014 that liability should be commensurate with fault, and that individuals are responsible to the extent that their fault results in injury. <em>See Goetzman, </em>327 N.W.2d at 753-54; Lande &amp; MacAlister, <em>supra, </em>at 9 (\u201c[Ojnly a \u2018pure\u2019 system protects all the deserving injured, is fair to defendants, optimally deters negligent behavior, and fosters the greatest sense of justice, fairness, and respect for the law on the part of juries.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Moreover, although pure comparative negligence is the numerically minority choice nationally,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> it is the preferred version among states adopting comparative negligence by judicial decision. Nine of the twelve states adopting comparative negligence judicially have chosen a pure system,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> while three chose a modified version.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Modified systems \u201creintroduce in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>large measure the very same all-or-nothing feature of contributory negligence that the remedy of comparative negligence is designed to overcome,\u201d by establishing a new set point at which recovery for a contributorily negligent plaintiff is barred. 4 Harper, James &amp; Gray, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 22.15 at 463; <em>see also Li, </em>119 Cal.Rptr. 858, 532 P.2d at 1242 (criticizing a modified system as simply shifting the \u201clottery aspect\u201d of contributory negligence to a different set point); <em>Alvis, 52 </em>Ill.Dec. 23, 421 N.E.2d at 898 (\u201cThere is no better justification for allowing a defendant who is 49% at fault to completely escape liability than there is to allow a defendant who is 99% at fault under the old rule to escape liability.\u201d). Maryland courts should apply a system of pure comparative fault in negligence actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">IV. Some Ruminations on the Possible Effect on Collateral Doctrines of the Adoption of Comparative Fault</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Adopting a system of comparative fault will impact undoubtedly numerous collateral doctrines in the law of torts, as we recognized in <em>Harrison. </em>Indeed, as the Florida Supreme Court acknowledged, \u201cthe prospect of a general upheaval in pending tort litigation has always been a deterring influence in considering the adoption of a comparative negligence rule.\u201d <em>Hoffman v. Jones, </em>280 So.2d 431, 439 (Fla.1973). Although the facts of the present case and Petitioner\u2019s questions for which we issued a writ of <em>certiorari </em>do not permit a binding consideration of the possible effects on these collateral doctrines, it is prudent nonetheless to itemize and comment on here a few, but by no means an exhaustive list, of the potential impacts of a decision to adopt comparative negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>Even after the abrogation of contributory negligence, the spirit of that doctrine will remain in some statutory provisions. For example, as Respondent and its Amici point out, the principles of contributory negligence are codified in various limited contexts in the Maryland Code. That remnants of a discarded common law doctrine may remain after its abolition does not provide, however, a reason to retain it in its entirety for all purposes. <em>Cf. Bozman, </em>376 Md. at 488, 830 A.2d at 466 (acknowledging that despite the Court\u2019s abolition of the doctrine of interspousal immunity, remnants of the common law concept upon which the doctrine was based remain in Maryland law). We do not have the authority to overrule any principles of contributory negligence embedded currently in the statutory law of this State. <em>See </em>Md. Const. Decl. of Rts. art. 8. Thus, where the Legislature codified these principles as a complete bar to recovery in those limited contexts, it will continue to serve as a defense in those actions governed by the relevant statute, unless and until the General Assembly decides otherwise. <em>See </em>Md. Code (1977, 2009 Repl.

Where the principles of contributory negligence have not been codified, however, the doctrine of pure comparative negligence, as the common law of this state, should apply henceforth.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">Interestingly, concepts of contributory negligence will continue to be embedded in Maryland common law under a comparative fault system. The adoption of comparative fault abolishes the doctrine of contributory negligence as a complete <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>bar to a plaintiffs recovery, but an individual\u2019s \u201ccontributory negligence\u201d remains relevant as a consideration in determining his or her degree of fault in contributing to his or her injury. Thus, statutes that disallow presently certain conduct from consideration as evidence of contributory negligence may have continued applicability in a comparative fault system,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> while others may merit consideration for revision by the General Assembly to make their continued applicability in a comparative fault system, if any, more clear. <em>See, e.g., </em>Md. Code (1973, 2006 Repl. Vol.), Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 3-1607 (\u201cA defendant in an action under this subtitle may not raise a defense of assumption of risk or contributory negligence based on the use of a controlled dangerous substance by the deceased individual.\u201d); Md. Code (2007, 2012 Supp.), Human Services Article, \u00a7 7-704(b)(2) (\u201cThe failure of a blind or visually impaired pedestrian to carry a cane ... does not constitute contributory negligence per se.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Respondent and its Amici contend further that the adoption of comparative fault will have serious effects on the fiscal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>health of our State and local government. Because the unavailability of contributory negligence as an absolute bar to recovery will increase the number of \u201cmeritless claims presented,\u201d they argue, governments will face increased liability. The possibility that state and local governmental liability may increase following the adoption of comparative fault is by no means certain. There is no evidence, and indeed Amici provide none, that other states have experienced skyrocketing governmental liability and fiscal disaster following the adoption of comparative negligence. Moreover, the adoption of comparative fault by no means limits the reactive power of the General Assembly. To the contrary, the Legislature remains in the position to observe the actual impacts of a comparative fault system in Maryland and adopt or amend statutes accordingly, if it deems change necessary.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Moreover, if, as Amici contend, the General Assembly intended the defense of contributory negligence to apply to actions brought under the Local Government Tort Claims Act (\u201cLGTCA\u201d), despite failing to codify expressly that defense, <em>see </em>Md. Code (1973, 2006 Repl. Vol.), Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 5-303, the Legislature has the authority to amend explicitly the LGTCA to so provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">Respondent and its Amici express particular concern over the continued vitality of the principles of joint and several liability, and the attendant issue of contribution among joint tortfeasors, in a comparative fault system. I recognize that, following the adoption of a comparative fault system, the continued vitality and fairness of the doctrine of joint and several liability merits specific attention. Indeed, most states adopting comparative negligence have revisited this issue, <em>see, e.g., McIntyre, </em>833 S.W.2d at 58 (\u201cHaving thus adopted a rule more closely linking liability and fault, it would be inconsistent to simultaneously retain a rule, joint and several liability, which may fortuitously impose a degree of liability that is out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>of all proportion to fault.\u201d), although little consensus among states resulted.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Because joint and several liability is not implicated by the facts of the present case, however, we reserve the evaluation and determination of whether a departure from common law joint and several liability is warranted, and, if so, in what circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">We also recognize that, regardless of the impact of a reconsideration of the applicability of joint and several liability, there may exist at least a theoretical inconsistency between the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act (\u201cUCATA\u201d) as codified at Md. Code (1973, 2012 Supp.), Courts &amp; Judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>Proceedings Article, \u00a7\u00a7 3-1401-09, and a system of comparative negligence. While the touchstone of a system of comparative negligence is the imposition of liability in direct proportion to one\u2019s fault, the current provisions of the UCATA permit one joint tortfeasor to obtain contribution from another joint tortfeasor if he, she, or it has paid more than his, her, or its \u201cpro rata share.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 3-1402. A pro rata share is understood generally, however, as an equal share of the common liability, rather than a share based on an individual\u2019s proportion of fault, and thus may be inconsistent with the foundations of comparative negligence.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> <em>See Hashmi v. Bennett, </em>416 Md. 707, 719 n. 13, 7 A.3d 1059, 1066 n. 13 (2010) (quoting <em>Lahocki v. Contee Sand &amp; Gravel Co., </em>41 Md.App. 579, 616, 398 A.2d 490, 511 (1979), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds sub nom, General Motors Corp. v. Lahocki, </em>286 Md. 714, 410 A.2d 1039 (1980)). Abiding future legislative action and/or appellate opinions, however, contribution among joint tortfeasors should continue to apply in pro rata shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">Another potential issue for future resolution is the determination of which parties should be included in the pool of fault \u2014 specifically, how uncharged parties and released tortfeasors are treated under a comparative fault scheme in apportioning fault. The UATRA, for example, compares fault only among those individuals or entities that are actual parties to the litigation, but does not preclude any defendant from pursuing a nonparty. It contains an exception, however, for released tortfeasors, requiring that the responsibility of released tortfeasors be considered in apportioning fault among non-released parties. States are split on this approach \u2014 some follow the UATRA; others that initially adopted the UATRA approach amended their laws later to <em>require </em>apportionment of fault to nonparties; and, still others permit, but do not require, the consideration of nonparties in apportioning fault. <em>See </em>Rules Committee Report, <em>supra, </em>at 19-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>Although I would decide today to apply a system of pure comparative fault only to negligence actions, other states adopting systems of comparative fault have confronted the breadth with which a system of comparative fault should be applied \u2014 in particular, whether to expand the reach of comparative fault to strict liability and intentional torts. The defense of contributory negligence long has been held inapplicable to actions based on strict liability, <em>see Ellsworth v. Sheme Lingerie, Inc., </em>303 Md. 581, 597, 495 A.2d 348, 356 (1985), and intentional torts. <em>See Tucker v. State, Use of Johnson, </em>89 Md. 471, 486, 43 A. 778, 783 (1899); <em>State Farm v. Hill, </em>139 Md.App. 308, 316-18, 775 A.2d 476, 481-82 (2001). Approximately thirty-five states have opted to apply the doctrine of comparative fault to strict liability cases, in additional to negligence actions, although ten do not. <em>See Negligence Systems, supra, </em>at Appendix A, 37-41. Although many states do not endorse the application of comparative fault to intentional torts, <em>see, e.g., Florenzano v. Olson, </em>387 N.W.2d 168, 176 n. 7 (Minn.1986) (\u201cWe ... consider it bad policy to permit an intentional tortfeasor the defense of comparative negligence merely because he or she chooses a gullible or foolish victim.\u201d); <em>Davies v. Butler, </em>95 Nev. 763, 602 P.2d 605, 611 (1979) (declining to apply comparative fault to intentional acts), some do. <em>See, e.g., </em>Alaska Stat. \u00a7 09.17.900 (2012) (including intentional conduct in the definition of fault); <em>Blazovic v. Andrich, </em>124 N.J. 90, 590 A.2d 222, 231 (1991) (\u201cWe are unpersuaded by the decisions of other jurisdictions that reject apportionment of fault in actions involving intentional tortfeasors.\u201d). Consideration of the expansion of comparative fault beyond negligence actions is a bridge too far at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Additionally, this Court should consider eventually (in the proper case) the continued vitality of the ameliorative doctrine of last clear chance. Most states that abrogate contributory negligence by judicial decision abolished contemporaneously the doctrine of last clear chance. <em>See, e.g., Kaatz, </em>540 P.2d at 1050; <em>Hoffman, </em>280 So.2d at 438; <em>Alvis, </em>52 Ill.Dec. 23, 421 N.E.2d at 898. Because the doctrine of last clear chance is designed to mitigate the harsh results of contributory negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>gence, it seems likely that it may not survive the abrogation of contributory negligence. The facts giving rise to a traditional application of the doctrine may be relevant, however, in apportioning fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">As we recognized in <em>Harrison, </em>the handling of set-offs and counterclaims are implicated by a decision to adopt comparative fault. Although Maryland has only a permissive, not compulsory, counterclaim rule, <em>see </em>Md. Rule 2-331; <em>Fairfax Savings, F.S.B. v. Kris Jen Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>338 Md. 1, 11-12, 655 A.2d 1265, 1270 (1995), defendants in negligence actions will be able increasingly to raise counterclaims for damages arising from the same injury under a comparative fault rule. Thus, in a comparative negligence scheme, it may be the case that the plaintiff or counter-defendant owes the defendant or counter-plaintiff damages, and vice versa, raising the prospect of set-offs. In <em>Hoffman, </em>the Florida Supreme Court stated broadly that, in the case of a counterclaim, courts should \u201center one judgment in favor of the party receiving the larger verdict, the amount of which should be the difference between the two verdicts.\u201d 280 So.2d at 439. As the Florida court later recognized (and disavowed) in <em>Stuyvesant Ins. Co. v. Bournazian, </em>342 So.2d 471 (Fla.1976), however, a technical application of the <em>Hoffman </em>language resulted in a windfall to insurance liability carriers, as they would be responsible only for the set-off amount, and not the full damages incurred by the insured. <em>Id. </em>at 473-74. Thus, Florida applies set-offs in negligence actions only in instances where both parties are uninsured. <em>Id. </em>at 474. By contrast, some comparative negligence states ban set-offs altogether, <em>see, e.g., </em>R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 9-20-4.1 (2011), which may result in practical difficulties where only one party is uninsured. <em>See </em>John M. Rogers <em>&amp; </em>Randy Donald Shaw, <em>A Comparative Negligence Checklist to Avoid Future Unnecessary Litigation, </em>72 Kentucky L.J. 25, 73-79 (1983). Although we cannot decide definitively today how set-offs will operate in a comparative fault system, as appropriate cases work their way to us, lower courts should consider the just compensation of the parties in determining whether set-offs should apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>I acknowledge that adopting a system of pure comparative fault implicates numerous related doctrines and principles in the law of torts, and a decision to do so is not taken lightly. That many questions will result from such a shift is not, however, a justification for retaining the status quo of contributory negligence. I have confidence that our judicial system will not be thrown into disarray, as Respondent and its Amici contend, based on the experience of, at a minimum, the twelve states that adopted judicially comparative negligence. The collateral issues will be handled readily by our Legislature and/or State\u2019s judges until this Court is presented the opportunity to resolve each lingering question.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">V. Implementation of Pure Comparative Fault Should Apply Prospectively</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">The final decision to undertake in the present case, as I see it, is whether the decision adopting the doctrine of comparative negligence should be applied prospectively or retrospectively (to some extent). I would apply the doctrine of selective prospectivity, which is the \u201cmethod by which \u2018a court may apply a new rule in the case in which it is pronounced, then return to the old one with respect to all others arising on facts predating the pronouncement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Polakoff v. Turner, </em>385 Md. 467, 486, 869 A.2d 837, 849 (2005)(quoting <em>James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia, </em>501 U.S. 529, 537, 111 S.Ct. 2439, 115 L.Ed.2d 481 (1991)(plurality opinion)).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Selective prospectivity applies generally in cases where we announce a change in the substantive common law, <em>Polakoff, </em>385 Md. at 488 n. 14, 869 A.2d at 850 n. 14, rather than in cases changing procedural requirements in the trial courts, <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. Zenobia, </em>325 Md. 420, 470, 601 A.2d 633, 657-58 (1992), or overruling prior cases based on their erroneous interpretation of the law. <em>See Polakoff, </em>385 Md. at 488, 869 A.2d at 850 (noting that a new interpretation of a statute will apply to \u201cthe case before the court and to all cases pending where the issue has been preserved for appellate review\u201d); <em>Houghton v. Cnty. Comm\u2019rs of Kent Cnty., </em>307 Md. 216, 220, 513 A.2d 291, 293 (1986) (\u201c[T]he question of whether a particular judicial decision should be applied prospectively or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>retroactively, depends in the first instance on whether or not the decision overrules prior law and declares a new principle of law.\u201d). In adopting comparative fault, this Court would \u201cexercise! ] [its] constitutional authority to change the common law.\u201d <em>See Zenobia, 325 </em>Md. at 469, 601 A.2d at 657. <em>See, e.g., Tracey, </em>427 Md. at 639-42, 50 A.3d at 1081-83; <em>Julian, </em>320 Md. at 9-11, 575 A.2d at 739; <em>Kelley v.

Unlike in <em>Zenobia, </em>where we adopted a standard of clear and convincing evidence to justify punitive damages in tort cases, 325 Md. at 469, 601 A.2d at 657, the doctrine of comparative fault is not a procedural rule. <em>See Erie Ins. Exchange v. Heffernan, </em>399 Md. 598, 635, 925 A.2d 636, 658 (2007) (noting that the doctrine of contributory negligence relates to substantive tort law).

Comparative negligence (in one form or another) is applied in the United States overwhelmingly, with forty-six states abandoning contributory negligence in favor of comparative fault. Only four states\u2014 Alabama, Maryland, North Carolina, and Virginia \u2014 and the District of Columbia continue to apply contributory negligence in its traditional guise. 2 Dobbs, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 220 at 771-72.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b523-7\">. Comparative fault comes in two main forms: pure and modified. Under a pure comparative fault system, a contributorily negligent claimant\u2019s damages will be reduced based purely on his or her degree of fault (expressed as relative percentages of 100%), regardless of whether the claimant is as much or more at fault than the defendant. 4 Harper, James &amp; Gray, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 22.15 at 458; Prosser &amp; Keeton, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 67 at 471-72.

Although twelve states have abrogated contributory negligence by judicial decision, the prospect of judicial abrogation has been considered and rejected in numerous states. These states generally have not based their decisions on the intrinsic value of the rule of contributory negligence, but instead opted to defer to legislative action. <em>See, e.g., Golden v. McCurry, </em>392 So.2d 815 (Ala.1980); <em>McGraw v. Corrin, </em>303 A.2d 641 (Del.1973); <em>Maki v. Frelk, </em>40 Ill.2d 193, 239 N.E.2d 445 (1968); <em>Epple v.

Indeed, legislatures in most of these states have since adopted comparative negligence. <em>See, e.g., </em>Del.Code Ann. tit. 10, \u00a7 8132 (enacted 1984); N.Y. C.P.L.R. 1411 (enacted 1975); N.D.

Two state courts adopted comparative negligence by judicial decision after deciding explicitly to defer to legislative action in an earlier decision. <em>See Alvis v.

By contrast, the Alabama Supreme Court is the only court to revisit the adoption of comparative fault after deferring explicitly to its legislature (which remained inactive) and reaffirm the continued vitality of contributory negligence. The Supreme Court of Alabama stated summarily:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">We have heard hours of oral argument; we have read numerous briefs; we have studied cases from other jurisdictions and law review articles; and in numerous conferences we have discussed in depth this issue and all of the ramifications surrounding such a change.

As some scholars note, the deterrence rationale of contributory negligence (or comparative fault, for that matter) is dubious at best. \"If the prospect of losing life and limb does not make a plaintiff careful, little further inducement to care will be added by speculations as to the outcome of a lawsuit. The same thing is often true of defendants. Yet today those who bear the burden of accident liability are increasingly absentee defendants \u2014 corporate and other employers or insurance companies, whose lives and limbs are not at stake in the accident....

Further, Respondent and its Amici pointed out in oral argument that this Court reaffirmed the continued vitality of the doctrine recently in post <em>-Harrison </em>cases. <em>See, e.g., Thomas v.

Notably, there is no dispute about whether this Court has the authority to change the common law. Just because we have that power, however, is no good reason to change the law in the face of clear policy reasons, based upon our jurisprudence, directing that we exercise restraint.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">We pointed out in <em>Harrison v.

Bd. of Educ., </em>295 Md. 442, 463, 456 A.2d 894, 905 (1983), that \u201cthe contributory negligence principle [is] the valid standard in Maryland negligence cases and that \u2018any change in the established doctrine [was for] the Legislature.\u2019.\u201d Majority Opinion, at 685, 69 A.3d at 1152. In support of this conclusion, we acknowledged that the determination of public policy is generally a legislative prerogative. <em>See Harrison, </em>295 Md. at 460, 456 A.2d at 903 (\u201c[The] declaration of the public policy of Maryland is normally the function of the General Assembly[.]\u201d). This Court has stated that \u201c[we are] reluctant to alter a common law rule in the face of indications that to do so would be contrary to the public policy of this State.\u201d <em>Harrison, </em>295 Md. at 460, 456 A.2d at 903 (citing <em>Condore v.

In my view, this is sound public policy, especially in light of the long-standing adherence in this State to the rule of contributory negligence. Therefore, we should defer to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>General Assembly under the circumstances of this case. To do otherwise, we cast ourselves as a Court attempting to impose our will upon the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">In Maryland, we operate under a fault-based tort system. Fault also is the test for liability under contributory negligence and comparative negligence. In any given case, the negligence of a plaintiff may play a part in causing his or her injuries and the' damages he or she is allowed to recover should, therefore, be diminished to some extent. Of course, contributory negligence completely bars recovery, while comparative negligence prevents the plaintiff from recovering only that portion of his damages for which he is responsible. I am willing to concede that a system premised on comparative negligence for apportioning fault appears to be \u201ca more equitable system of determining liability and a more socially desirable method of loss distribution.\u201d <em>See Hoffman v. Jones, </em>280 So.2d 431, 437 (Fla.1973). Thus, under comparative negligence, losses are apportioned among those whose fault contributed to the occurrence. Hence, if we were writing on a clean slate, I might be persuaded to adopt the comparative negligence standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Because I would prefer a system of comparative negligence is neither the test nor the justification for abandoning contributory negligence and adopting comparative negligence in its place. In this case our duty is to construe or interpret the law. It is not our task to invade the province of the General Assembly and enact into law a sweeping revision of an established rule of law. Here the dissenting opinion advocates for a system of pure comparative negligence. Some might, however, prefer a system of modified comparative negligence because of a belief that a plaintiff who was more than 50% at fault should not be entitled to any recovery. Whether Maryland becomes a pure comparative negligence state or a modified comparative negligence state should not be decided by this Court on the basis of the record before us. The General Assembly, in my view, is best suited to make that determination given the current status of our laws and its ability to conduct a comprehensive study of how the changes in the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>will affect tort liability and insurance law in Maryland. In addition, as the dissenting opinion concedes, any change of the common law would not affect those statutes in Maryland that have enacted the concept of contributory negligence as a matter of law in some situations. See Dissenting Opinion, at 729-31, 69 A.3d at 1179-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Lastly, the General Assembly seems to be in the better position to study and resolve:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-5\">1. How comparative negligence will apply in cases of multitortfeasors?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">2. What will be the impact on the doctrine of joint and several liability if comparative negligence becomes the law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-7\">3. How or should the Uniform Contribution Among TortFeasors Act retain any viability?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-8\">4. If the last clear chance doctrine is abolished as a result of comparative negligence, should or would the doctrine of assumption of the risk also be abolished?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-9\">5. Should Maryland adopt pure comparative negligence or a modified version?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-10\"><em>See McIntyre v. Balentine, </em>833 S.W.2d 52, 57-58 (Tenn.1992). To be certain, the General Assembly is at liberty to consider the opinions of this Court and decide whether to conduct such studies. In my view, the General Assembly may be poised to engage in such a discussion in light of the differing views expressed in this opinion. We would be wise, however, to encourage the General Assembly to do so, rather than to attempt to force it to do so by adopting the doctrine of pure comparative negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">I am authorized to state that Judges Battaglia, McDonald and Raker join in the views expressed in this concurring opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
