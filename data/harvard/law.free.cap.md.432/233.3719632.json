Costanzo,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> charging him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>with various violations of the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMLRPC\u201d), other of the Maryland Rules, and provisions of the Maryland Code (which we shall enumerate <em>infra) </em>arising from his representation of seven clients, each of which filed complaints with the Commission. The matter was assigned to a judge of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City for an evidentiary hearing and to make findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding the matters asserted in the Petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Costanzo was constructively served, through the Client Protection Fund, with a copy of the Petition, a Writ of Summons, and this Court\u2019s order assigning the matter for hearing. Costanzo did not file an answer or other response to the Petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Bar Counsel sought, and the hearing judge grant<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>ed, an order of default. A hearing was held on September 18, 2009, on Bar Counsel\u2019s ex parte proof. Costanzo did not appear. Bar Counsel, at the hearing, abandoned five of the complaints and produced evidence only as to the remaining two, those of Gilbert Hoffman and Louis Haug. The hearing judge, on November 5, 2009, filed his written opinion, in which he concluded that Bar Counsel proved, by clear and convincing evidence, each violation alleged against Costanzo in his representation of Hoffman and Haug. No mitigating circumstances were found.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">No exceptions were filed to the judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. Bar Counsel recommended disbarment as the appropriate sanction. In addition to filing nothing, Costanzo failed to appear for oral argument before this Court. We agreed with Bar Counsel\u2019s recommendation and entered, on February 9, 2010, an Order disbarring Costanzo, with the Court\u2019s opinion to follow. This is that opinion explaining why we decided that disbarment was the appropriate sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">\n<em>Complaint of Gilbert Hoffman</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">In its Petition, Bar Counsel alleged that Costanzo agreed on May 30, 2007, to represent Hoffman in a breach of contract matter against an entity named Davidson &amp; Associates. Hoffman claimed to have hired Davidson &amp; Associates to assist him in obtaining a patent on a product idea for a \u201cgolf ball finder\u201d device. Although Hoffman paid $9,000 as a retainer to Costanzo, Costanzo performed no services for Hoffman, failed to refund or account for the retainer, and terminated his representation of Hoffman on March 28, 2008. Moreover, Costanzo failed to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s written request for information responsive to Hoffman\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>Based on these allegations, Bar Counsel charged Costanzo with the following violations:</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">\n<em>MLRPC</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-5\">Rule 1.1.

Misuse of trust money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">A lawyer may not use trust money for any purpose other than the purpose for which the trust money is entrusted to the lawyer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">By a standard of clear and convincing evidence (Md. Rule 16 \u2014 757(b)), the hearing judge rendered the following findings of fact, based on Bar Counsel\u2019s evidence, regarding the Hoffman complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-8\">1. The Complainant, Gilbert Hoffman, retained Respondent to represent him in a lawsuit to recover damages he allegedly suffered because of the failure of Davidson Company to develop and market his concept for a golf-ball finder. This finding is supported by the Complainant\u2019s testimony, retainer agreement, and copy of a personal check which listed the Respondent as the payee and was signed by the Complainant. The check was in the amount of $9,000.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-9\">2. On May 30, 2007, Respondent, on behalf of his law firm, Thomas, Connelly &amp; Costanzo, entered into a fee agreement whereby Respondent would represent Complainant for a fee of $9,000.00 plus 24 percent of any amount obtained as a result of settlement and 33.3 percent of any amount obtained as a result of trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-10\">3. The Fee Agreement provided that the fee was \u201cnonrefundable\u201d and earned and payable on 5/30/09 [sic], the date on which the agreement was signed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-11\">4. On May 30, 2007, Complainant gave the Respondent a check for $9,000.00 as the retainer required by the Fee Agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-12\">5. Respondent prepared a draft complaint which he forwarded to Complainant for comment. This draft complaint listed Blue Marlin D/B/A Scout and PDC, Co. as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>the Defendants. This draft complaint had nothing to do with the Davidson Company, which the Complainant retained Respondent to sue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-4\">6. After Respondent prepared this document, Complainant was unable to consistently communicate with Respondent. There were some emails, but they were woefully inadequate to the legal assignment at hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-5\">7. In an email dated November 22, 2007, Respondent advised Complainant that he was in India trying to adopt a child and that complications with this matter had required a massive amount of time away from his office. In the email, he asked for Complainant\u2019s patience and stated that he would like to keep him as a client.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\">8. Complainant did not hear from Respondent for several months afterwards. Complainant sent emails to Respondent without receiving any responses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-7\">9. On March 14, 2008, Respondent advised Complainant that he was home and that he would have a complaint to him that day with a summary of how they would move forward.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-8\">10. Respondent did not follow through on this promise. Moreover, Respondent never provided a complaint or a summary of how he planned to proceed in the case. Respondent never filed suit in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-9\">11. Beginning on March 25, 2008, in a series of emails, Complainant requested a refund of his retainer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-10\">12. On March 28, 2008, Respondent told Complainant in an email, \u201cI will refund your retainer and will pass the case seamlessly to forwarding counsel.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-11\">13. Respondent never refunded any part of Complainant\u2019s retainer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-12\">14. Respondent never filed a complaint on Complainant\u2019s behalf. Further, due to financial difficulties as a result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>of Respondent\u2019s failings, Complainant never got his invention on the market</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ag\">(Internal footnotes omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Based on these findings, the hearing judge concluded as follows regarding the alleged violations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-5\">1. <em>Respondent violated Rules 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 14.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-6\">The evidence demonstrates that in the eleven months after Complainant retained Respondent, the Respondent prepared a draft complaint for Mr. Hoffman and took no further action after receiving his comments. The draft complaint had nothing to do with the reason Complainant retained Respondent. Respondent was supposed to pursue legal action against Davidson for failing to develop a golf-ball finder. Respondent prepared a draft complaint against Blue Marlin and PDC.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-7\">By failing to file suit on Complainant\u2019s behalf, Respondent violated Rules 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. McCulloch, </em>404 Md. 388 [946 A.2d 1009] (2008) (where attorney\u2019s failure to pursue client\u2019s divorce case after filing suit was found to violate all three rules).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-8\">Respondent\u2019s failure to do anything more than prepare a draft complaint during the course of the representation shows a lack of competence in violation of Rule 1.1 and a lack of diligence in violation of Rule 1.3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-9\">Respondent\u2019s failure to carry out the purpose of the representation is a violation of Rule 1.2. Respondent\u2019s failure to communicate with Complainant for several months from November 2007 to March 2008 is a violation of Rule 1.4(a)(2), which requires attorneys to keep clients reasonably informed about the status of their matters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-10\">\n<em>2. Respondent\u2019s conduct violates Rule 1.15(a), Rule 1.16(d), Rule 8.4, Md. Bus. Occ. &amp; Prof. Code Ann. \u00a7 10-306, and Rule 1.5.[</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>3</em>\n</footnotemark>\n<em>]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Based on Respondent\u2019s failure to refund Complainant any money from the $9,000.00 retainer and his statement to the Florida Bar admitting that he misappropriated client funds, it is inferable that he spent Complainant\u2019s money. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Duvall, </em>384 Md. 234 [863 A.2d 291] (2004)(where the hearing judge infers from passage of time and lack of accounting to client that trust funds were expended by attorney). This conduct violates the requirement of Rule 1.15(a) that Respondent keep his own property separate from that of his clients. It also violates the requirement of Rule 1.16(d) that an attorney return any unearned fee at the termination of the representation. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Tinsky, </em>377 Md. 646, 652 [835 A.2d 542] (2003) (where Respondent was found to violate Rule 1.16(d) by failing to return unearned fees when he abandoned his practice).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-4\">The advance retainer payment made by Mr. Hoffman was trust money within the meaning of Md. BOP \u00a7 10-306, which should have been deposited in a trust account pursuant to Md. BOP \u00a7 10-306. Respondent\u2019s use of these funds for his own purposes is a breach of fiduciary duty in violation of Rule 8.4(c) and a misuse of trust money in violation of Rule 16-609 and BOP \u00a7 10-306. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. McCulloch, </em>404 Md. 388 [946 A.2d 1009] (2007)(where attorney\u2019s expenditure of advance fee payment was found to violate Rule 8\u20144(c)); <em>(Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Roberts, </em>394 Md. 137 [904 A.2d 557] (2006))(where expenditure of funds due to medical providers from personal injury settlements violated Rules 1.15(a) and 8.4(c), Rule 16-609, and BOP \u00a7 10-306).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-5\">It is not a defense to Respondent\u2019s use of the advance fee payment for his own purposes that the Fee Agreement stated that it was non-refundable. The Court of Appeals has stated in a case in which it was not directly presented with the issue that such provisions in fee agreements \u201cwould most likely violate Rule 1.5,\u201d which prohibits unreasonable fees, because it is unreasonable for an attorney to enter into a fee agreement which provides that he will be paid for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>work not performed. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Briscoe </em>[357 Md. 554], 745 A.2d 1037, 1042 n. 13 [13] (Ct. of App.2000). Because the advance fee payment belonged to the client until Respondent earned it, his appropriation of it to his own use violates the rules and statute Petitioner has cited.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">\n<em>Complaint of Louis C. Haug</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Bar Counsel\u2019s Petition alleged that, in August 2006, Haug retained Costanzo to defend him in a suit filed by the U.S. Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida. The SEC claimed that Haug and one Edward Diggs had marketed unregistered securities. As the result of mediation, a settlement in concept was reached whereby Haug agreed to pay $50,000, subject to submission of personal financial statement and execution of a formal settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">To effectuate the proposed settlement, Haug wired $50,000 into Costanzo\u2019s trust account on January 29, 2007. In mid-February 2007, Haug also delivered to Costanzo an additional $650 in post-settlement interest on the $50,000. Additionally, at Costanzo\u2019s request, Haug sent him $1,500, representing Haug\u2019s share of the mediator\u2019s fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Between April 2007 and March 2008, Haug did not receive any communications from Costanzo. In the last week of March 2008, Haug received from the Florida federal court a copy of an order suspending Costanzo from practice before the court for failure to pay Florida Bar dues and failure to answer a show cause order. On top of that, on April 1, 2008, the receiver in the federal SEC court action telephoned Haug to inquire: (1) if he had engaged new counsel yet; (2) why he had not responded to the SEC\u2019s rejection of the settlement agreement, after its review of Haug\u2019s personal financial statement; and (3) whether Haug intended to accept the SEC\u2019s counter-proposal that he pay (over time) an <em>additional </em>$50,000. Haug, dumbfounded, replied he knew nothing about this new information, had not heard from Costanzo for almost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>a year, and had sent him over $50,000 already. The receiver acknowledged that he also had not heard from Costanzo for several months.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">A couple of days after his enlightening conversation with the receiver, Haug received an email from Costanzo. In the email, Costanzo related his pilgrimage to India, getting sick while there, and, for the first time, told Haug about the rejected settlement proposal. Costanzo assured Haug that he maintained in trust all of the funds Haug had sent him. That representation notwithstanding, Costanzo, as of the filing by Bar Counsel of the Petition in April 2009, had not accounted for the funds or refunded any part of the funds to Haug. Costanzo failed to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s written request for a reply to Haug\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Based on these allegations, Bar Counsel charged Costanzo with the following violations:</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\"><em>MLRPC </em>(We shall not repeat the verbatim text of any Rule supplied previously in this opinion.)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-8\">Rule 1.1.

Misuse of trust money.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>By a standard of clear and convincing evidence, the hearing judge rendered the following findings of fact, based on Bar Counsel\u2019s evidence, regarding the Haug complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-4\">1. In July 2006, Complainant retained Respondent to represent him in litigation with the SEC. The SEC was seeking monetary damages from Complainant alleging that he had participated in a scheme to defraud.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-5\">2. Respondent agreed to represent complainant at an hourly rate of $225.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-6\">3. Complainant paid respondent an initial retainer of $50,000.00.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-7\">4. Respondent entered into negotiations with the SEC and in late January 2007 reached a tentative agreement whereby Complainant would settle the matter with the SEC for $50,000.00. The settlement was subject to a review of Complainant\u2019s financial statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-8\">5. On January 29, Complainant wired $50,000.00 to Respondent for him to hold in escrow while the proposed agreement was being reviewed. Respondent told Complainant that he would keep the funds in his trust account and would wire them to the receiver upon approval of the settlement agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-9\">6. In mid-February 2007, Respondent advised Complainant that the receiver wanted post-settlement interest from him. The receiver agreed to accept $650.00 and Complainant gave Respondent a check for this amount. Complainant never received credit for the $650.00 transferred to Respondent for the post-settlement interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-10\">7. On February 12, 2007, Respondent advised Complainant that he needed to pay his share of the mediator\u2019s fee, which was $1,500.00. Complainant gave Respondent a check for this amount. Respondent never paid this fee, nor did he reimburse Complainant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-11\">8. Between May and September 2007, Complainant received telephone calls from the mediator\u2019s office about the status of this payment. When Complainant called Respondent to ask him why he had not paid the mediator, Respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>dent advised Complainant that he would take care of the obligation immediately.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-4\">9. Eventually, Respondent asked Complainant to pay the mediator directly. Complainant made the payment on September 21, 2007. Respondent never reimbursed the complainant for the initial $1,500.00 payment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-5\">10. In the last week of March 2008, Complainant received an order from the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida suspending Respondent from the practice of law for failing to pay dues and for failing to answer a Show Cause Order.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-6\">11. On April 1, 2008, Complainant received a call from the receiver asking if he had retained new counsel after Respondent\u2019s suspension.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-7\">12. Complainant said that he had just learned of the suspension and had not had time to hire new counsel. The receiver then advised Complainant that this $50,000.00 offer had been rejected and that the SEC had proposed an additional payment of $50,000.00 to be paid over time. The receiver said he believed that this payment was warranted because of Complainant\u2019s financial situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-8\">13. Respondent did not advise Complainant of the SEC\u2019s rejection of the tentative settlement agreement or of the making of a counter-offer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-9\">14. After Complainant learned of Respondent\u2019s suspension, he began a series of emails with Respondent.

To better appreciate the charges in play (or not), see Appendix \u201cA\u201d to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The sum of the information reflected in Appendix \u201cA\u201d is that the hearing judge concluded expressly in the Hoffman matter that Costanzo violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4(a)(2), 1.15(a), 1.16(d), 8.4(c); Md.

Bar Counsel took no exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">In the Haug matter, the hearing judge concluded expressly that, of the charges levied in Bar Counsel\u2019s Petition, Costanzo violated MLRPC 1.4(a)(2), 1.15(a), 1.16(d), and 8.4(b) and (c); Md. Rule 16-609; and Md.Code, Bus. Occ. &amp; Prof. Art., \u00a7 10-306. Although Bar Counsel charged Costanzo with violating MLRPC 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 8.1(b) and 8.4(c) and (d), the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law are silent as to them. Moreover, the hearing judge appears to have concluded that Costanzo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>violated MLRPC 1.16(d) and MLRPC 8.4(b), violations of which he was not charged in Bar Counsel\u2019s petition, and Md.Code, Crim.

Here, Costanzo violated MLRPC 1.16(d) when he failed to take any meaningful step in pursuit of Hoffman\u2019s interest, abandoned his representation of Hoffman after November 2007 (if not earlier) without any prior notice, and failed to return to Hoffman his $9,000 retainer.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>\n<em>MLRPC 8.4(c)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Rules 8.4 prohibits generally attorney misconduct.

Based on the record before us, there is no question that Costanzo engaged in egregious misconduct under MLRPC 8.4(c) by misusing his clients\u2019 funds and failing to: (1) maintain those funds in trust; (2) account for his clients\u2019 funds; (3) provide his clients with meaningful legal services; and, (4) pursue his clients\u2019 claims and abide by the agreed terms of representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">We turn now to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions that Costanzo violated several MLRPC and statutory provisions that were not charged by Bar Counsel in its Petition. As discussed previously, the hearing judge found that Costanzo violated MLRPC 1.5 in the Hoffman matter, and concluded that Costanzo violated MLRPC 1.16(d) and MLRPC 8.4(b), as well as Md.Code, Crim. Law Art., \u00a7 7-104, in the Haug matter. It is well established, however, that, in attorney disciplinary proceedings, the \u201ccharge must be known before the proceedings commence.\u201d <em>In re Ruffalo, </em>390 U.S. 544, 551 88 S.Ct. 1222, 1226, 20 L.Ed.2d 117, 122 (1968). Otherwise, the tacking-on of disciplinary charges against an attorney without notice of such charges deprives the attorney of procedural due process. <em>Id. </em>(the \u201cabsence of fair notice as to the reach of the grievance procedure and the precise nature of the charges deprive[] petitioner of procedural due process\u201d); <em>Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v.

Thus, because Bar Counsel did not charge Costanzo in its Petition with violations of MLRPC 1.5, 1.16(d), MLRPC 8.4(b), or Crim.

Although Bar Counsel charged Costanzo in the Hoffman matter with violating MLRPC 8.1(b), the hearing judge made no mention of it in his Conclusions of Law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b82-33\">. Similar to the lack of an express conclusion as to MLRPC 8.1(b) in the Hoffman matter, the hearing judge neglected to mention MLRPC 8.4(d), although he made mention of 8.4 generically and addressed 8.4(c) specifically.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b82-34\">. Although not charged in the Haug matter with violating MLRPC 8.4(b) (criminal act adversely reflecting on lawyers\u2019 honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer), or by implication Md.Code, Crim. Law Art., \u00a7 7-104 (general theft provisions), the hearing judge apparently concluded that Costanzo violated these provisions when he misappropriated the funds sent to him by Haug.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
