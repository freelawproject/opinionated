On February 16, 2012, the Attorney Grievance Commission (\u201cBar Counsel\u201d), Petitioner, acting pursuant to Rule 16-751(a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a \u201cPetition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action\u201d against Jonathan,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> relative to his representation of Victoria Brunson-Hill as the plaintiff in an automobile accident case.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">In July of 1998, Jonathan had been a practicing attorney for approximately one month when Ms. Brunson-Hill retained the law firm of Sperling and Framm, in which Leonard Sperling, Jonathan\u2019s father, was a partner, to represent her after she had been struck by an automobile in a public parking lot in Prince George\u2019s County. On November 30,1998, Sperling and Framm filed suit on Ms. Brunson-Hill\u2019s behalf in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, naming Greta Renee Frank as the defendant. Jonathan Sperling, although having never entered his appearance, was responsible for the day-to-day tasks in the case, such as attending pre-trial conferences, drafting discovery, and engaging and interacting with a process server. Ms. Frank was never served, and on October 22, 1999, the suit was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Subsequently, in March of 2000, Leonard Sperling filed a Motion for Reconsideration of Dismissal, which was granted on April 3, 2000. A pre-trial conference was scheduled for May 5, 2000, but Ms. Frank, yet to be served, failed to appear, and the conference was rescheduled for August 4, 2000, and again <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>for September 29, 2000. When no one appeared for the latter of the conferences, the case was again dismissed, although Ms. Brunson-Hill was never informed of the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">On February 22, 2008, Ms. Brunson-Hill e-mailed Jonathan to inquire about the status of her case, to which he responded by e-mail three days later that the case was \u201cstill making its rounds with the clerk and she assures me she is working on it.\u201d Ms. Brunson-Hill was not told that her case had been dismissed, even though Jonathan became aware of the dismissal sometime prior to sending his response to Ms. Brunson-Hill.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Thereafter, on April 11, 2008, the Sperling Law Office, as it was then known, filed a Motion to Re-open Case. That pleading stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-6\">That Plaintiffs counsel has been in constant contact with the clerk\u2019s office, reported the events that had transpired \u25a0within the Court and was told the matter would be looked into and fixed and that Plaintiffs counsel should, \u201cnot worry, it would be fixed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">The Motion also asserted \u201c[t]hat the clerk\u2019s office did not fix the error, despite assurances to the contrary, and as a result the case was closed.\u201d The Motion further stated that \u201cPlaintiffs counsel has a good idea of where the Defendant is and if the matter were re-opened, Plaintiffs counsel would be able to proceed with due haste in completing this matter.\u201d Jonathan attached an affidavit to the Motion to Re-open Case in which he attested that \u201cI am familiar with this matter and that all statements made in the Motion are correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">On May 5, 2008, the Sperling Law Office filed a Supplemental Motion to Re-open Case. That motion reiterated the statements regarding \u201cconstant contact\u201d with the clerk\u2019s office, that the clerk\u2019s office assured plaintiffs counsel that the situation would be fixed, and that plaintiffs counsel had a good idea where the defendant was located. Again, Jonathan attached a verified affidavit to the Supplemental Motion to Re-open Case, attesting that he was \u201cfamiliar with this matter and that all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>statements made in the Motion are correct to the best of my knowledge.\u201d Jonathan also asserted in the affidavit that he \u201ccontacted the clerk\u2019s office on numerous occasions, explaining the error and was assured on numerous occasions the matter would be fixed and re-opened.\u201d Both Motions were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Ms. Brunson-Hill filed a complaint with Bar Counsel regarding Jonathan\u2019s handling of her case. Bar Counsel charged Jonathan with violations of the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct 1.1 (Competence),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 1.2(a) (Scope of Representation and Allocation of Authority Between Client and Lawyer),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 1.3 (Diligence),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 1.4(a)(1)-(3) and (b) (Communication),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 3.1 (Meritorious Claims and Contentions),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> 3.3(a)(1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>and (a)(4) (Candor Toward the Tribunal),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 4.1(a)(1) (Truthfulness in Statements to Others),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and 8.4(a), (c), and (d) (Misconduct).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">By an Order dated February 22, 2012, we referred the Petition to Judge Judith C. Ensor of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. Judge Ensor held a hearing on August 14, 2012, during which Ms. Brunson-Hill, Jonathan Sperling, Leonard Sperling, and Samuel Sperling testified. Documentation of communications between Ms. Brunson-Hill and Jonathan was entered into evidence as well as the deposition of Loretta E. Knight, who was the manager of the civil department of the Clerk\u2019s Office in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County from 1990 until 2006, at which time she was elected Clerk of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. Judge Ensor issued the following findings of fact and conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>sions of law, in which she found Jonathan violated Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4(a) and (b), 3.3(a), and 8.4(a), (c), and (d), but did not violate Rule 1.2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-5\"><em>FINDINGS OF FACT[</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">Jonathan graduated in December, 1997, from the University of Maryland School of Law, passed the bar on his first attempt, and was sworn in as a member of the Maryland Bar on June 24, 1998. Since that time, he essentially has worked for his father, Leonard Sperling. When Jonathan first began with the firm, it was known as Sperling and Framm. In 2003, the practice became known as the Sperling Law Firm, P.C. Since joining his father\u2019s firm, Jonathan has maintained a general practice; he has represented clients in both the civil and criminal arenas.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-7\">Jonathan had been practicing law for roughly four weeks when Victoria Brunson-Hill (sometimes \u201cMs. BrunsonHill\u201d) initially met with Leonard Sperling in late July, 1998. At that time, Ms. Brunson-Hill retained Leonard Sperling and the law firm of Sperling and Framm to represent her in connection with a claim for personal injuries. Leonard \u201csigned her up\u201d with the firm and filed suit on Ms. Brunson-Hill\u2019s behalf on November 30, 1998. The suit was filed in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, named Greta Renee Frank (sometimes \u201cMs. Frank\u201d) as a defendant, and sought damages as a result of injuries sustained on July 12, 1998. More specifically, in the complaint, it was alleged that, while walking at or near a parking lot located in Prince George\u2019s County, Ms. Brunson-Hill was struck by a vehicle driven by Ms. Frank. Ms. Brunson-Hill claimed to have been permanently injured as a result of the incident. She sought $945,000 in damages and requested that the matter be tried before a jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-8\">The clerk\u2019s office sent notice on December 1, 1998, that the matter was scheduled for a settlement/pre-trial confer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>ence on March 5, 1999. As Ms. Frank had not been served and was not present, the conference was postponed and reset for October 22, 1999. Four days prior to the new conference date, however, on October 18, 1999, the clerk\u2019s office sent a notice of contemplated dismissal pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-507. When no one appeared for the October 22, 1999, conference, the case was dismissed. On October 26, 1999, in response to the notice vis-\u00e1-vis contemplated dismissal, Leonard Sperling filed a pleading entitled \u201cMotion to Dismiss Contemplated 2-507 Dismissal.\u201d By the time that pleading was filed, the case had been dismissed as a result of the parties\u2019 failure to appear at the October 22, 1999, settlement/pre-trial conference. Therefore, when the Honorable Paul H. Weinstein reviewed the Motion to Dismiss Contemplated 2-507 Dismissal on November 8, 1999, he determined that it was moot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-4\">As a result of this finding, on December 28, 1999, Leonard Sperling filed a motion to reconsider dismissal under Maryland Rule 2-507. In that pleading, Leonard indicated that \u201cthe Plaintiffs\u2019 Counsel never received a copy of a hearing date for the said Motion.\u201d Leonard went on to say that \u201cPlaintiffs Counsel received a notice from the Court that the above matter had been dismissed on October 22, 1999, because Plaintiff did not appear for the said hearing.\u201d Leonard asked that the Court vacate its dismissal and reinstate the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-5\">On March 29, 2000, Leonard Sperling filed a pleading entitled \u201cMotion for Reconsideration of Dismissal,\u201d and indicated that it was a supplement to the initial motion. In the supplement, Leonard stated that, since Ms. Frank had not been served, he \u201cassumed\u201d that \u201che was not expected to be present at a pre-trial conference.\u201d Leonard also indicated that he had spoken with the clerk\u2019s office and had been \u201cinformed that it was not necessary for the Plaintiff or Plaintiffs counsel to be present\u201d for the pre-trial conference. The Motion for Reconsideration of Dismissal was granted by Judge Weinstein. The corresponding order was entered on April 5, 2000. In the same order, Judge Wein<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>stein provided a new settlexnent/pre-trial conference date of May 5, 2000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-4\">On May 5, 2000, Ms. Frank again failed to appear as she had not yet been served. The case was then set for a scheduling conference on August 4, 2000. The case was again re-set, and this time scheduled for a conference on September 29, 2000. The case was called on September 29, 2000, but the parties failed to appear; the matter was dismissed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-5\">More than three years later, as a result of Leonard\u2019s temporary suspension from the practice of law, Samuel Sperling moved to enter his appearance and strike that of his father. Four years after that, on April 11, 2008, Plaintiffs Motion to Re-open Case was filed. In that pleading, among other things, counsel indicated that he had \u201cbeen in constant contact with the clerk\u2019s office, reported the events that had transpired within the Court and was told the matter would be looked into and fixed.\u201d Moreover, plaintiffs counsel indicated that he was told he should \u201cnot worry, it would be fixed.\u201d Importantly, Jonathan Sperling provided an affidavit in which he vouched for the truthfulness of the statements made in the motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-6\">A Supplemental Motion to Re-open Case was filed on May 5, 2008. In the Supplemental Motion, plaintiffs counsel reiterated that he had \u201cbeen in constant contact with the clerk\u2019s office.\u201d He added that he \u201cmade repeated calls regarding this matter, went over the previous calls, the matters discussed in the Hearings and was assured the matter would be fixed.\u201d Jonathan Sperling provided an accompanying affidavit in which he affirmed that he was \u201cextremely familiar\u201d with the matter. He indicated that he had \u201ccontacted the clerk\u2019s office on numerous occasions, explaining the error and was assured on numerous occasions the matter would be fixed and reopened.\u201d The motion to re-open was denied on May 13, 2008, with notice sent to Samuel Sperling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-7\">According to Jonathan, he became involved in Ms. Brunson-Hill\u2019s case in August, 1998. By his own admission, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Jonathan was \u201cassigned principal responsibility for the day-to-day work on the case.\u201d Jonathan testified, however, that, by \u201cday-to-day work,\u201d he meant that he drafted the discovery and made sure that the process server was engaged and diligent in his efforts to locate Ms. Frank. Jonathan also testified that he went to at least some of the pre-trial settlement conferences that had been scheduled by the Court. Other attorneys associated with the law firm worked on the case as well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-4\">Jonathan never told Ms. Brunson-Hill that her case had been dismissed. He never told her that the statute of limitations had run. In fact, Ms. Brunson-Hill learned that the case had been dismissed only after she performed an internet inquiry through the Maryland Judiciary Case Search. She then followed up with Jonathan, specifically asking about the status of her case. Jonathan responded to her via email dated February 25, 2008, simply indicating that the case \u201cis still making its rounds with the clerk and she assures me she is working on it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-5\">Ms. Brunson-Hill was not the only individual concerned about the status of the case. Her treating physician, Dr. Lawrence F. Honick, made inquiry through his office staff. Specifically, on December 26, 2001, Lisa Kirkpatrick faxed paperwork to Leonard Sperling. On the fax cover sheet, Ms. Kirkpatrick mentioned that, back on April 5, 2001, \u201cMr. Sperling indicated that [the] case was still pending.\u201d Ms. Kirkpatrick also mentioned that she had \u201ccalled many times and left many messages without an answer.\u201d There is a response written on the fax cover sheet itself. In all capital letters it is written \u201cTHIS CASE IS STILL PENDING IN COURT.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">A similar inquiry from Dr. Honick\u2019s office was sent on November 13, 2002. Jonathan\u2019s response was provided the same day. He wrote: \u201cTHIS CASE STILL IN COURT!\u201d There was yet another inquiry from Lisa Kirkpatrick on June 21, 2005. This time, the correspondence was sent to the attention of Jonathan Sperling. In the body of the paperwork, Ms. Kirkpatrick stated that, on May 5, 2005, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Jonathan \u201cindicated to Dr. Honick that this account would be going to court soon. What is the status?\u201d Another request for this same information was sent on August 3, 2005. Ms. Kirkpatrick sent yet another inquiry on May 16, 2006.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-6\">With respect to Jonathan\u2019s alleged numerous conversations with the clerk\u2019s office, the Commission submitted the deposition of Loretta Knight, who was elected Clerk of the Circuit Court in 2006. Prior to that, she was a manager in the civil department. Ms. Knight testified that, back in 2000, there were in the neighborhood of 40 to 45 people working in the civil department, of whom perhaps 30 were trained to answer telephone inquiries. Ms. Knight indicated that there were periodic assignments to phone duty. According to Ms. Knight, if asked, a clerk was permitted to provide the status of any given case. Ms. Knight was adamant, however, that no clerk was authorized to provide additional information. She did indicate that a clerk might direct additional inquiries to a specific judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-7\">Jonathan Sperling never formally entered his appearance at any time during the pendency of the Montgomery County case. All pleadings were submitted under the signature of either Leonard Sperling or Samuel Sperling. All court notices were sent to either Leonard Sperling or Samuel Sperling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-8\">1. <em>Failure to Attend Hearings on October 22, 1999, and September 29, 2000.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-9\">It is the Commission\u2019s position that, by failing to attend the October 22, 1999, and September 29, 2000, court hearings, Jonathan violated Rules 1.1 and 1.3 of the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMLRPC\u201d). In pushing its position, the Petitioner acknowledges that \u201cLeonard Sperling, as the owner of the Sperling Law Firm, the name signed on the retainer agreement, and as the attorney whose appearance was entered in the case, was responsible for appearing on behalf of Ms. Brunson-Hill at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>all court proceedings.\u201d Petitioner adds, however, that \u201cLeonard Sperling\u2019s culpability does not absolve any subordinate attorney who may have shared the responsibility for appearing on behalf of Ms. Brunson-Hill.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-4\">Unlike many law firms, where cases are routinely assigned to and handled by a specific attorney, at this law firm, Leonard Sperling maintained almost complete control over all of the firm\u2019s clients and cases. According to the undisputed, credible testimony, Leonard brought in the clients, met with them, signed the retainer agreements, maintained the files, entered only his appearance in court, signed all of the pleadings, mandated that all notices, pleadings, and correspondence be directed to and reviewed by him personally, and managed the calendar for all court appearances. Except for specific tasks that he delegated to other attorneys, Leonard retained all responsibility and control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-5\">With respect to Ms. Brunson-Hill\u2019s case, Jonathan Sperling, who had been practicing law for roughly two months, was assigned the tasks of drafting discovery and insuring that the defendant was properly served. On at least some occasions, Leonard Sperling had Jonathan appear in court. He had other attorneys appear in court as well. Both Samuel Sperling and Andrea Babest worked on Ms. Brunson-Hill\u2019s case. Samuel drafted the designation of expert witnesses. Andrea Babest assisted in efforts to find Ms. Frank. Jonathan was never given full responsibility for the file. He was assigned discreet tasks to perform, as were other attorneys in the firm. Any court notices regarding hearings were sent directly to Leonard. Jonathan had only the information and assignments given to him by his father.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-6\">The manner in which Leonard Sperling chose to run his law firm is troubling. He kept virtually total control of every aspect of the cases. He does not appear to have developed or utilized any sort of reminder/tickler system or back up plan with respect to court appearances. It was only a matter of time before a court date was missed. The responsibilities for these failings rests with Leonard, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>with Jonathan, who never received prior notice of the court dates and was not assigned by Leonard to attend them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-4\">After considering all of the facts and circumstances presented by way of live testimony and documentary evidence, this Court finds that the Petitioner failed to establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that, by failing to take it upon himself to determine whether there were any upcoming court appearances, and by failing to attend the October 22, 1999, September 29, 2000, hearings, Jonathan violated either Rule 1.1 or Rule 1.3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">2. <em>Communications with Client.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-6\">The Commission alleges that Jonathan Sperling ran afoul of the MLRPC by failing to keep Ms. Brunson-Hill abreast of the status of her case. It is undisputed that Jonathan failed to inform Ms. Brunson-Hill that the case had been dismissed. He also failed to tell her that the statute of limitations had run. It is undisputed that, following a direct inquiry from Ms. Brunson-Hill, Jonathan indicated, via email on February 25, 2008, that the case was \u201cmaking its rounds with the clerk and she assures me she is working on it.\u201d By the time of his email communications, Jonathan knew that the case had been dismissed back in September, 2000. And, even if, somehow, Jonathan\u2019s conversation years earlier with the clerk\u2019s office led him to conclude that the dismissal would be vacated, he knew, given the passage of significant time, that the matter would not be resolved as he had hoped.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-7\">Ms. Brunson-Hill\u2019s case lay dormant for an inordinate and unacceptable period of time. Suit was filed on November 30, 1998; it was ultimately dismissed on September 29, 2000. Notwithstanding Jonathan\u2019s acknowledgment that he learned of the dismissal and his claim that he was in constant contact with the clerk\u2019s office, the motion to reopen was not filed until April 11, 2008. As Jonathan Sperling admitted during his testimony, once he learned of the dismissal, he \u201ctotally dropped the ball.\u201d In doing so, with respect to his representation of Ms. Brunson-Hill, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Jonathan violated Rule 1.1, Rule 1.3, Rule 1.4, and Rule 8.4 of the MLRPC.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-4\">3. <em>Communications with Dr. Honick\u2019s Office.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-5\">The Commission claims that Jonathan made false statements of material fact to Dr. Honick\u2019s office regarding the status of Ms. Brunson-Hill\u2019s case. The record makes clear that, over a number of years, Dr. Honick\u2019s office repeatedly sought this information. It is alleged that Jonathan indicated that the case was pending when he knew it was not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-6\">Initially, the inquiries from Lisa Kirkpatrick, with Dr. Honick\u2019s office, were sent to the attention of Leonard Sperling. Subsequent inquiries were sent directly to Jonathan. It appears that Jonathan responded to the December 26, 2001, and November 13, 2002, inquiries. There is no indication that Jonathan Sperling, or anyone else associated with the law firm, responded to Ms. Kirkpatrick\u2019s inquiries of June 21, 2005, August 3, 2005, and May 16, 2006.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-7\">The Commission did not call Dr. Honick, Lisa Kirkpatrick or anyone else associated with the medical office as a witness. The correspondence, however, was admitted without objection. It is clear from the documentary evidence presented that Dr. Honick\u2019s office, over a period of several years, repeatedly sought information regarding the status of Ms. Brunson-Hill\u2019s case. It is also clear that several requests were ignored. What is unclear, and what the Commission failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence, is that, at the time Jonathan responded, he knew that the information was false. The Commission has failed to prove that Jonathan violated Rule 4.1.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-8\">4. <em>Candor with the Tribunal.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-9\">On April 11, 2008, Jonathan Sperling provided an affidavit to the Court, in which he affirmed that he was familiar with the case and that all of the statements made in the plaintiffs Motion to Reopen Case were correct to the best of his knowledge and belief. In the motion itself, plaintiffs counsel stated that he had been \u201cin constant contact with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>clerk\u2019s office.\u201d He also told the Court that someone in the clerk\u2019s office had indicated that the matter would be \u201cfixed,\u201d and that plaintiff\u2019s counsel should not worry. In the motion, plaintiffs counsel also stated that he \u201chas a good idea where the defendant is\u201d and that, if the matter were reopened, \u201cplaintiffs counsel would be able to proceed with due haste.\u201d On May 5, 2008, plaintiffs counsel filed a supplemental motion to reopen the case. The motion was accompanied by an affidavit signed by Jonathan Sperling. Jonathan stated that he had \u201ccontacted the clerk\u2019s office on numerous occasions,\u201d and had been told that \u201cthe matter would be fixed and re-opened.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-4\">At the August 14, 2012 hearing, Jonathan testified regarding his communication with the clerk\u2019s office. He indicated that, \u201cearly on,\u201d once he learned of the dismissal, he contacted the clerk\u2019s office and spoke with someone \u201cwith an accent.\u201d Jonathan further testified that he called the clerk\u2019s office on more than one occasion. He indicated that, each time he called, he was told that the error would be rectified. Jonathan was not able, however, to provide any specific information regarding the number of times he called, the dates and times of those calls, or the identities of those with whom he spoke. In fact, Jonathan testified that, during the relevant time period, he did not keep notes of incoming or outgoing telephone calls.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-5\">Jonathan\u2019s testimony is in direct contrast to that of Loretta Knight, who was the manager of the civil department at the time. While Jonathan Sperling may have called the clerk\u2019s office on one occasion, he did not call repeatedly. He most certainly was not in constant contact with the clerk\u2019s office during the eight years following dismissal of this case. He was not told repeatedly by the clerk\u2019s office that the problem would be fixed. He was not told repeatedly that there was no need to worry. When Jonathan suggested otherwise to the Court, he was not candid. Moreover, the Sperling Law Firm had no more idea where defendant Greta Frank could be located in 2008 than it had in the period of time between 1998 and 2000, when the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>was dismissed. While the firm certainly attempted to locate Ms. Frank in the beginning, virtually no efforts were made to find Ms. Frank after the case was dismissed in September, 2000. Jonathan was not candid with the Court when he stated that he had been working diligently on this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-5\">Jonathan\u2019s assertions to the Court were not merely a poor choice of words. Rather, and unfortunately, they were provided in an attempt to place blame on others and thereby convince the Court to re-open the matter.

The Commission also met its burden with respect to Rule 1.4, Rule 3.3 and Rule 8.4 of the MLRPC. The Commission failed to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that Jonathan Sperling violated Rule 1.2 and Rule 4.1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">\u201c \u2018This Court has original and complete jurisdiction over attorney discipline proceedings in Maryland.\u2019 \u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v.

We conduct an independent, de novo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>review of the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law, pursuant to Rule 16\u2014759(b)(1).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">Jonathan excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions that he violated Rules 1.1, 1.3, and 3.3(a), but does not except to the conclusions that he violated Rules 1.4(a) and (b) or 8.4(a), (c), and (d). Bar Counsel excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Jonathan did not violate Rule 1.2(a). Because neither party filed any exceptions to the findings of fact relevant to these charges,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> we accept those findings as proven by clear and convincing evidence pursuant to Rule 16-759(b)(2)(A).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Attorney Grievance v. Nelson, </em>425 Md. 344, 359, 40 A.3d 1039, 1047 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Jonathan initially excepts to the conclusions that he violated Rules 1.1 and 1.3. Rule 1.1 provides that \u201c[a] lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client. Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation.\u201d Rule 1.3 provides that \u201c[a] lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The hearing judge made two separate findings with respect to Rules 1.1 and 1.3; she first concluded that Jonathan did not violate Rules 1.1 and 1.3 by failing to attend the pre-trial hearings on October 22, 1999, and September 29, 2000, because \u201cthe responsibility] for [missing these court dates] rests with Leonard, not with Jonathan, who never received prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>notice of the court dates and was not assigned them by Leonard,\u201d but did conclude that Jonathan violated both Rules 1.1 and 1.3 when he \u201cdropped the ball\u201d and did not communicate with his client upon learning of the case\u2019s dismissal. Jonathan asserts that he did not violate Rules 1.1 and 1.3 because at the time he learned the case was dismissed, the case was beyond resuscitation and \u201cthere was no course of action that reasonably could have been pursued.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">With regard to \u201cdropping] the ball,\u201d however, Jonathan testified at the hearing that his failure to attempt to remedy the dismissal when he learned of it in 2006 or 2007 was a \u201ctremendous error\u201d on his behalf and that he should have done more. Specifically, he testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-5\">At that time, I should have filed motions. I should have done more, but I didn\u2019t and that\u2019s really the ... that\u2019s ... a tremendous error.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-6\">Again, where I\u2019m looking in hindsight, I understand how this could be looked at. I should have done \u2014 I should have filed a written motion at that point. And I\u2019ll agree that I didn\u2019t____ I should have done it. It was a tremendous error on my behalf.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">As Jonathan admitted, upon learning that the case had been dismissed, he was required to use his legal knowledge and skill, with the requisite thoroughness and preparation, to attempt to remedy the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">In <em>Attorney Grievance v. Mooney, </em>359 Md. 56, 753 A.2d 17 (2000), the attorney was charged with violating Rules 1.1 and 1.3, <em>inter alia, </em>for his failure to file a reverse waiver in a criminal matter on behalf of a juvenile defendant. He admitted his conduct violated Rule 1.3, but argued that the failure to file the motion did not violate Rule 1.1 because the reverse waiver motion that was filed by a subsequent attorney in the same case was unsuccessful, therefore, \u201cnot enough facts exist[ed] to establish whether such a motion, if timely, had a reasonable possibility of success.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 84, 753 A.2d at 32. We disagreed and explained that, \u201c[t]he fact that the reverse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>waiver petition that was ultimately filed was unsuccessful generally has no bearing on whether respondent\u2019s failure, without explanation, to file it constituted incompetence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we determined that Mooney violated both Rules 1.1 and 1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">In this case, Jonathan\u2019s assertion that there was no reasonable course of action that could have been pursued in Ms. Brunson-Hill\u2019s case upon his learning of the dismissal is belied by his subsequent unilateral filing of two motions to reopen triggered by Ms. Brunson-Hill\u2019s request for a case status in 2008. The ultimate denial of these motions has no bearing, however, on whether Jonathan acted competently and diligently in this case. Jonathan, in addition to not filing a motion to reopen immediately, did not research whether there were means to legally circumvent the running of the statute of limitations, investigate whether there was a basis for arguing that the statute of limitations had not tolled, or inform his client of the issue, for instance. Jonathan\u2019s ultimate decision to do nothing promptly when he learned the case was dismissed violated Rules 1.1 and 1.3. His initial exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Jonathan also excepts to the conclusion that he violated Rule 3.3(a),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> which provides in pertinent part that a lawyer shall not knowingly \u201cmake a false statement of fact or law to a tribunal or fail to correct a false statement of material fact or law previously made to the tribunal or lawyer[.]\u201d The hearing judge found that Jonathan violated Rule 3.3(a) when he averred that he \u201ccontacted the clerk\u2019s office on numerous occasions.\u201d Moreover, she determined that Jonathan was not candid when he attested in his verified affidavit to the assertion that \u201cPlaintiffs counsel has a good idea where the defendant is and if the matter were re-opened, Plaintiffs counsel would be able to proceed with due haste in completing this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>matter.\u201d The hearing judge found that these misrepresentations \u201cwere provided in an attempt to place blame on others and thereby convince the Court to re-open the matter.\u201d According to Jonathan, however, he did not intend to make a knowing false statement to the court when he averred that he was in constant contact with the clerk\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Here, Jonathan\u2019s exception fails to account not only for his misrepresentations regarding the clerk\u2019s office\u2019s response that the matter would be fixed and reopened, and his assertion that he had a good idea where the defendant was and could proceed with due haste, but also that he submitted verified affidavits, with these misrepresentations, in support of the Motion to Re-open Case and again in the Supplemental Motion to Re-open Case. His statements, then, taken as a whole, are sufficient to support the conclusion that he intended to mislead the court by knowingly making false statements of fact. <em>See Attorney Grievance v. Fader, </em>481 Md. 395, 66 A.3d 18 (2013). Jonathan\u2019s exception regarding Rule 3.3(a) is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Bar Counsel excepts to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that Jonathan did not violate Rule 1.2(a), contending that Jonathan\u2019s failure to inform Ms. Brunson-Hill that the case had been dismissed and the statute of limitations had run deprived Ms. Brunson-Hill of the ability to make an informed decision as to the objectives of the representation. Rule 1.2(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-6\">(a) Subject to paragraphs (c) and (d), a lawyer shall abide by a client\u2019s decisions concerning the objectives of the representation and, when appropriate, shall consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued. A lawyer may take such action on behalf of the client as is impliedly authorized to carry out the representation. A lawyer shall abide by a client\u2019s decision whether to settle a matter. In a criminal case, the lawyer shall abide by the client\u2019s decision, after consultation with the lawyer, as to a plea to be entered, whether to waive jury trial and whether the client will testify.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>In support of his exception, Bar Counsel cites <em>Attorney Grievance v. Reinhardt, </em>391 Md. 209, 892 A.2d 533 (2006) and <em>Attorney Grievance v. Brown, </em>426 Md. 298, 44 A.3d 344 (2012). Jonathan argues in response that <em>Reinhardt </em>and <em>Brown </em>are distinguishable because the violations of Rule 1.2(a) in those proceedings involved cases that were pending, while Ms. Brunson-Hill\u2019s case had been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">In <em>Reinhardt, </em>391 Md. at 220, 222, 892 A.2d at 539-40, the hearing judge concluded, and we agreed, that the attorney violated Rule 1.2(a) \u201cby failing to follow the client\u2019s instruction to pursue [her] case and inform her of the status of the case.\u201d In <em>Brown, </em>426 Md. at 320, 44 A.3d at 357, the attorney was found to have violated Rule 1.2(a) based upon his neglect and lack of communication in several cases. We noted Brown\u2019s conduct with respect to his violation of Rule 1.2(a) \u201cmirror[ed] closely the misconduct in <em>Reinhardt,\u201d </em>and explained that two of the clients\u2019 \u201ccases were dismissed for lack of prosecution [and] Respondent failed subsequently to inform either client of the dismissals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Notably, applicable statutes of limitations had expired on several of the claims, and the clients were left without recourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Jonathan\u2019s response is based upon the notion that he did not violate Rule 1.2(a), because any alternative or choice that Ms. Brunson-Hill chose or made after the case had been dismissed would not have resulted in a successful outcome. Rule 1.2(a), however, does not require that a client\u2019s decision regarding the objectives of the representation necessarily result in a successful outcome. It was Ms. Brunson-Hill\u2019s choice that was offended by Jonathan\u2019s failure to inform her of the dismissal. Accordingly, Bar Counsel\u2019s exception is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Jonathan does not except to the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions that he violated Rules 1.4(a) and (b) and 8.4(a), (c), and (d). We conclude upon a de novo review that Jonathan violated Rules 1.4(a) and (b) and 8.4(a), (c), and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Rule 1.4(a) provides in pertinent part that a lawyer shall \u201cpromptly inform the client of any decision or circumstance to which the client\u2019s informed consent ... is required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>by these Rules\u201d; \u201ckeep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter\u201d; and \u201cpromptly reply to reasonable requests for information.\u201d When an attorney misrepresents the status of a case to a client, that conduct violates Rule 1.4(a). <em>See Attorney Grievance v. London, </em>427 Md. 328, 352, 47 A.3d 986, 1000 (2012); <em>Attorney Grievance v. Steinberg, </em>395 Md. 337, 368-69, 910 A.2d 429, 447-48 (2006). Here, Ms. Brunson-Hill asked Jonathan whether her case was still open, and Jonathan not only concealed from her that the case had been dismissed, but also misrepresented that the case was \u201cmaking its rounds with the clerk and she assures me she is working on it.\u201d Jonathan\u2019s conduct violated Rule 1.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">Rule 1.4(b) provides that \u201c[a] lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation.\u201d \u201cA lawyer\u2019s failure to inform his or her clients about a pending or granted motion to dismiss violates MLRPC 1.4(b).\u201d <em>Brown, </em>426 Md. at 322, 44 A.3d at 358. Here, Jonathan failed to inform his client that the case had been dismissed and thereby violated Rule 1.4(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Rule 8.4(c) provides that it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to \u201cengage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation[.]\u201d Here, Jonathan both misrepresented facts to the court in an effort to mislead the court into granting both motions to reopen and lied to his client regarding the status of her case. In so doing, Jonathan violated Rule 8.4(c). <em>Brown, </em>426 Md. at 324, 44 A.3d at 359-60; <em>Attorney Grievance v. Gordon, </em>413 Md. 46, 58, 991 A.2d 51, 58 (2010)</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Rule 8.4(d) provides that it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to \u201cengage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d Here, Jonathan lacked competence and diligence and lied to his client and the court in an effort to conceal his shortcomings. His dishonesty with his client violates Rule 8.4(d), <em>Reinhardt, </em>391 Md. at 222, 892 A.2d at 540-41, as do his attempts to overtly mislead the court, <em>Fader, </em>431 Md. at 417, 66 A.3d at 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>Rule 8.4(a) provides in pertinent part that it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to \u201cviolate or attempt to violate the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct[.]\u201d Jonathan violated Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.2(a), 3.3(a), 1.4(a) and (b) and 8.4(c) and (d). Jonathan, therefore, violated Rule 8.4(a). <em>See Attorney Grievance v. Garcia, </em>410 Md. 507, 519-20, 979 A.2d 146, 153-54 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">We now turn to the appropriate sanction. Bar Counsel, relying on <em>Attorney Grievance v. Lane, </em>367 Md. 633, 790 A.2d 621 (2002) and <em>Attorney Grievance v. London, </em>427 Md. 328, 47 A.3d 986 (2012), as well as the presence of a pattern of deceit and several other aggravating factors, recommends disbarment. Jonathan, conversely, cites to <em>Attorney Grievance v. Reinhardt, </em>391 Md. 209, 892 A.2d 533 (2006), <em>Attorney Grievance v. Harrington, </em>367 Md. 36, 785 A.2d 1260 (2001), and <em>Attorney Grievance v. Mooney, </em>359 Md. 56, 753 A.2d 17 (2000), to argue that only a 90-day suspension should be meted out.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Our intent in imposing sanctions is to protect the public, not to punish the offending attorney. <em>Attorney Grievance v. Chapman, </em>430 Md. 238, 277, 60 A.3d 25, 49 (2013). \u201cWe have also noted that \u2018[t]he public is protected when sanctions are imposed that are commensurate with the nature and gravity of the violations and the intent with which they were committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. Stinson, </em>428 Md. 147, 196, 50 A.3d 1222, 1251 (2012), quoting <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Awuah, </em>346 Md. 420, 435, 697 A.2d 446, 454 (1997). In determining the appropriate sanction, \u201c[w]e evaluate every attorney grievance matter on its own merits, taking into account the facts and circumstances involved.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance v. Bleecker, </em>414 Md. 147, 176, 994 A.2d 928, 945 (2010), citing <em>Attorney Grievance v. Gisriel, </em>409 Md. 331, 385, 974 A.2d 331, 362 (2009). For guidance in imposing sanctions, we often rely on the factors in Standard 9.22 of the American Bar Association Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">(a) prior disciplinary offenses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>(b) dishonest or selfish motive;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-4\">(c) pattern of misconduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\">(d) multiple offenses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-6\">(e) bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceedings by intentionally failing to comply with rules or orders of the disciplinary agency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-9\">(f) submission of false evidence, false statements, or other deceptive practices during the disciplinary process;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-11\">(g) refusal to acknowledge wrongful nature of conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-12\">(h) vulnerability of the victim;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-13\">(i) substantial experience in the practice of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-14\">(j) indifference to making restitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-15\"><em>Bleecker, </em>414 Md. at 176-77, 994 A.2d at 945-46 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-16\">Factor (b), \u201cdishonest or selfish motive,\u201d is present in this case, because Jonathan, according to the hearing judge, lied to the court in an effort \u201cto place blame on others and thereby convince the Court to re-open the matter.\u201d Factor (c), \u201cpattern of misconduct\u201d is also present in this case. An attorney engages in a pattern of misconduct by committing numerous actions in furtherance of a singular goal. <em>Fader, </em>481 Md. at 437-38, 66 A.3d at 43. Jonathan submitted two verified affidavits containing misrepresentations on two separate occasions in order to mislead the court into reopening Ms. Brunson-Hill\u2019s case and, additionally, lied to his client about the status of her case in an effort to conceal his neglect of Ms. Brunson-Hill\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-17\">Factor (d), \u201cmultiple offenses,\u201d is also implicated. An attorney commits multiple offenses when he or she committed multiple violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct. <em>See Stinson, </em>428 Md. at 194, 50 A.3d at 1250. Here, Jonathan violated various Rules stemming from his misrepresentations to the court and his client.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-18\">Factor (f), \u201csubmission of false evidence, false statements, or other deceptive practices during the disciplinary process,\u201d is implicated here also. In this regard, Jonathan testified in the hearing before Judge Ensor that he was assured by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>representatives of the Clerk\u2019s Office for the Circuit Court for Montgomery County that the matter would be fixed and the case would be reinstated, which was found to be a lie. <em>See Attorney Grievance v. Dominguez, </em>427 Md. 308, 327, 47 A.3d 975, 986 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">Finally, factor (g), \u201crefusal to acknowledge wrongful nature of conduct,\u201d is also implicated here. Since the time he made the misrepresentations, Jonathan continuously downplayed the significance of his misrepresentations to the court and his client and the effect of such conduct on the integrity of the legal profession. Although there has been a suggestion before us that Jonathan has been remorseful since committing the violations, there is no finding in mitigation.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Although Jonathan conceded that he should have contacted his client upon learning of the dismissal, he has not acknowledged the gravity of his misrepresentations to the court. Even in his exceptions, Jonathan did not appreciate the implications of his conduct. <em>See Stinson, </em>428 Md. at 195, 50 A.3d at 1251.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">While the sanction for dishonest conduct is generally disbarment, \u201c[w]e have not, however, always found disbarment to be the appropriate sanction when there is misrepresentation involved, especially when misappropriation of money is not involved.\u201d <em>Lane, </em>367 Md. at 646-47, 790 A.2d at 628. In <em>Lane, </em>367 Md. at 647, 790 A.2d at 629, however, we determined that disbarment was the appropriate sanction for an attorney who engaged in a pattern of outlandish misrepresentations \u201cof the most egregious nature,\u201d including telling a client that he had obtained an $11 million judgment on her behalf and to bring a suitcase and security to the courthouse to pick up the money, when, in fact, he had obtained nothing on her behalf. In <em>Attorney Grievance v. London, </em>427 Md. 328, 354-55, 47 A.3d 986, 1001-02 (2012), we disbarred London based on his pattern of continual deceit relating to his neglect of a client in several real estate transactions, but London had been disbarred before, which \u201cmilitate[d] toward disbarring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>him again.\u201d Jonathan\u2019s actions and lack of disciplinary history do not support disbarment based on <em>Lane </em>and <em>London.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Jonathan\u2019s citations to <em>Mooney, Harrington, </em>and <em>Reinhardt, </em>support the imposition of an indefinite suspension in this case, rather than a 90-day suspension. In <em>Mooney, </em>359 Md. at 97, 753 A.2d at 39, we imposed an indefinite suspension with the right to reapply in 90 days because of representation of clients marred by inattention, failures to appear, failure to properly manage staff, failures to communicate, misrepresentations, and a failure to appropriately prosecute his client\u2019s cases. In <em>Harrington, </em>367 Md. at 51-52, 785 A.2d at 1268-69, we imposed an indefinite suspension for representation of three clients involving serious neglect and, in addition, a complete lack of cooperation with Bar Counsel. In <em>Reinhardt, </em>391 Md. 209, 892 A.2d 533, the attorney violated Rules 1.1, 1.2(a), 1.3, 1.4(a) and (b), 3.2(a), and 8.4(c) and (d) after having filed a complaint on behalf of his client, taking minimal actions to prosecute that case, losing the file, and misrepresenting to the client that he was working on the case, when he was not; we imposed an indefinite suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Neither Bar Counsel\u2019s recommendation for disbarment nor Jonathan\u2019s recommendation of a 90-day suspension is appropriate in this case. Jonathan\u2019s misconduct involved one case and one client, but was marred by his lack of competence, diligence, and lack of candor with his client and the court, certainly grievous actions. We determine that an indefinite suspension is the appropriate sanction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING THE COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-761, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST JONATHAN DANIEL SPERLING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b299-8\">.
