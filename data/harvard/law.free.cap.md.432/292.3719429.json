Our answer is \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">Bellevale Farms Limited Partnership (\u201cBellevale\u201d) and Robert E. and Carol A. Prigel (\u201cthe Prigels\u201d) own and operate Bellevale Farms, Inc. (\u201cBellevale Farms\u201d), as an organic dairy farm, on 199 acres in the Long Green Valley area of Baltimore County.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 1997, Bellevale sold an agricultural preservation easement on Bellevale Farms (\u201cthe Bellevale Easement\u201d) to the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation (\u201cMALPF\u201d), a state agency that administers a program to preserve and stimulate Maryland\u2019s agricultural land and agrarian economy, respectively. A decade later, Bellevale requested the MALPF to permit, under the terms of the easement, the construction of a creamery operation (currently operated by Prigel Family Creamery, Inc.) on Bellevale Farms that would market to the public locally-produced dairy products. This venture was opposed by Petitioners here, the Long Green Valley Association (\u201cLGVA\u201d), a community association of Long Green Valley residents dedicated to the preservation of the \u201copen space, farmland, natural resources ... and the heritage and character of the Valley,\u201d and John W. and Susan M. Yoder (\u201cthe Yoders\u201d), who own real property adjacent to Bellevale Farms. The MALPF approved the proposal.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Petitioners filed a Complaint against Bellevale, Bellevale Farms, the Prigels, the Prigel Family Creamery, and the MALPF in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, seeking (as relevant to the question presented in the case before us) a declaration that the creamery violated the Bellevale Easement and an order prohibiting the construction and operation of the creamery. The Circuit Court concluded that Petitioners <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>lacked standing to enforce the Bellevale Easement. Petitioners appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, arguing that they possessed standing as third-party beneficiaries to the easement, as \u201caggrieved\u201d parties, and/or as \u201cinterested persons\u201d under Md.Code (1974, 2011 Repl.Vol.) Est. &amp; Trusts Art., \u00a7 14-302(a) because the Bellevale Easement constituted a charitable trust. With regard particularly to Petitioners\u2019 latter claim to standing, the intermediate appellate court held that the Bellevale Easement did not create a charitable trust. <em>Long Green Valley Ass\u2019n v. Bellevale Farms, Inc., </em>205 Md. App. 636, 683, 46 A.3d 473, 501 (2012). Accordingly, it affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court as to the Petitioners\u2019 lack of standing under the charitable trust theory. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">We granted Petitioners\u2019 Petition for Writ of Certiorari. 428 Md. 543, 52 A.3d 978 (2012). We shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">A. The Relevant Regulatory Scheme \u2014 The Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Program</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">The MALPF is a State agency within the Maryland Department of Agriculture. The agency\u2019s purpose is to preserve the State\u2019s agricultural land and economy by acquiring \u201cagricultural easements\u201d through a statutorily-created funding program called the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Fund (\u201cFund\u201d). <em>See </em>Md.Code (1973, 1999 Repl.Vol.), Agric. Art., \u00a7\u00a7 2-501,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 2-504(3), 2-510(k)(1). The MALPF is required \u201cto attempt to preserve the minimum number of acres which may reasonably be expected to promote the continued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>availability of agricultural supplies and markets for agricultural goods.\u201d Agric. \u00a7\u00a7 2\u2014502(d), 2\u2014509(d)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Any parcel of land preserved through these efforts by the MALPF must be suitable for profitable farming. Hence, each parcel easement considered for purchase must \u201cmeet productivity, acreage, and locational criteria determined ... to be necessary for the continuation of farming\u201d and must be \u201cactively devoted to agricultural use.\u201d Agric. \u00a7\u00a7 2\u2014509(d)(1), 2-509(b)(1). To this end, the MALPF may not purchase an easement unless (a) the land meets the minimum statutory criteria determined to be necessary for the continuation of farming; and, (b) the easement and the county regulations governing the use of land permit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-5\">(1) Any farm use ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-6\">(2) [The] [operation at any time of any machinery used in farm production or the primary processing of agricultural products.... [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-7\">(3) All normal agricultural operations ... including, but not limited to, [the] sale of farm products produced on the farm....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">Agric. \u00a7 2-513(a). The MALPF program requires also that farming of preserved land must be feasible; however, the MALPF has the discretion to allow a landowner, whose land is subject to an easement, to use the land for \u201cfarm and forest-related uses and home occupations.\u201d Agric. \u00a7\u00a7 2-514(a), 2-513(b)(1)(i).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">Participation in the MALPF program is quite competitive. Any owner of land that is committed to agricultural use may apply to sell to the MALPF an easement in his or her land.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Agric. \u00a7 2-510. According to Agric. \u00a7 2-511(a), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>MALPF may pay only \u201cthe [owner\u2019s] asking price or the difference between the fair market value of the land and the agricultural value of the land, whichever is lower.\u201d A statewide competition ensues among offerees hoping to receive an offer from the MALPF to buy easements. Generally, landowners discount their asking price in order to increase their chance of having an offer accepted. In the statewide stage of the competition, the landowner\u2019s asking price is a crucial factor because applications \u201care assigned a rank in ascending order with respect to the proportion obtained by dividing the owner\u2019s asking price by the State easement value.\u201d Agric. \u00a7 2-510(f)(2)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">Once the MALPF purchases an easement, the easement is enforceable by the landowner, the MALPF, and its Board of Trustees. <em>See </em>Agric. \u00a7 2-513(c) (stating that the \u201c[p]urchase of an easement by [the MALPF] does not grant the public a right of access or a right of use\u201d of the land subject to the easement). Standard deeds of easement provide that the MALPF has a right of entry for inspection and enforcement of the easement. <em>See </em>1974 Md. Laws, ch. 642. This provision has been a common part of the MALPF\u2019s typical deeds of easement since the MALPF\u2019s governing statute was enacted initially in 1974. <em>Id. </em>The MALPF may impose, moreover, civil penalties when a landowner violates the deed of easement or a regulation governing the MALPF program. <em>See </em>Agric. \u00a7 2-519.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">B. Establishment of the Bellevale Easement</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">As noted earlier, Bellevale owns and operates Bellevale Farms, an organic dairy farm, on approximately 199 acres in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>the Long Green Valley area of Baltimore County, Maryland. The Prigels are partners of Bellevale and owners of Bellevale Farms. They also operate a creamery business, called Prigel Family Creamery, on Bellevale Farms. The 199 acres is in the \u201crural conservation\u201d zone classification of the Baltimore County Zoning Regulations (\u201cB.C.Z.R.\u201d), entitled \u201cR.C.2.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A8\">On 12 January 1997, Bellevale, after competing in the rigorous MALPF program application process, offered to the MALPF an agricultural preservation easement (\u201cthe Bellevale Easement\u201d) on Bellevale Farms. The MALPF accepted Bellevale\u2019s offer and purchased the Bellevale Easement for $796,500.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Easement Agreement designated Bellevale Farm Limited Partnership as the \u201cGrantor,\u201d and \u201cthe State of Maryland, to the use of the Department of Agriculture on behalf of the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation, ... [as the] Grantee[.]\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The deed of easement stated that it is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-4\">the intention of the parties that the said land shall be preserved solely for agricultural use in accordance with the provisions of the Agriculture Article, Title 2, Subtitle 5[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>... and that the covenants, conditions, limitations and restrictions hereinafter set forth, are intended to limit the use of the above described land[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">The section of the Easement Agreement entitled \u201cCOVENANTS, CONDITIONS, LIMITATIONS, AND RESTRICTIONS\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-5\">[A](l)(a) Except as otherwise provided in this instrument, the above described land may not be used for any commercial, industrial, or residential purpose....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-6\">[A] (3) The Grantor reserves the right to use the above described land for any farm use, and to carry on all normal farming practices ... including any operation directly relating to the processing, storage, or sale of farm, agricultural or woodland products produced on the said above described land....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-7\">[B] (6) If the Grantor has any doubts concerning the easement, covenants, conditions, limitations or restrictions herein contained with respect to any particular use of the said land, the Grantor may submit a written request to the Grantee for consideration and approval of such use ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>[B](9) This easement shall be in perpetuity, or for so long as profitable farming is feasible on the Grantor\u2019s land and may be released only by the Grantee as provided by Agriculture Article, Section 2-514[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">The Bellevale Easement Agreement provides several methods by which the parties may enforce compliance with its \u201ccovenants, conditions, limitations and restrictions.\u201d First, if any provision of the Easement is violated or breached, the Agreement provides that the MALPF may pursue injunctive relief and \u201ctake such other legal action as may be necessary\u201d to enforce the conditions of the Easement Agreement. Second, if Bellevale has \u201cany doubts concerning the easement\u201d or its provisions \u201cwith respect to any particular use of the said land, [Bellevale] may submit a written request to [the MALPF] for consideration and approval of such use.\u201d The Agreement states that the Bellevale Easement creates rights and obligations only in Bellevale (and its representatives, successors, or assigns) and the State of Maryland, as represented by the MALPF, because the Easement \u201cdoes not grant the public any right to access or any right of use\u201d of Bellevale Farms. Third, the deed instrument entitles the MALPF to \u201center the land from time to time for the ... purpose of inspection and enforcement of the easement.\u201d Lastly, the Easement Agreement provides that it is \u201cgoverned by the laws of the State of Maryland[,] and the parties hereby expressly agree that the courts of the State of Maryland shall have jurisdiction to decide any question arising hereunder. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">On or about 1 August 2007, Bellevale proposed to construct a 10,000 square foot creamery operation on Bellevale Farms to process raw milk into organic dairy products, and to market these products to the general public. The Prigels stated that the aim of the operation is to keep the sale of the organic dairy products \u201cin house\u201d by processing and selling locally the products made under the Prigel Family Creamery label. The proposal included a retail farm store of an additional 1,500 square feet in which to sell organic dairy products directly to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>the public,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> a parking lot for eight vehicles, and employment of approximately fourteen full-time and part-time employees. The Prigels sought approval from the MALPF to commence the construction.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">Pursuant to its authority under Agric. \u00a7 2-513(b)(1)(i), and after being advised that the Baltimore County Agricultural Land Preservation Advisory Board reviewed Bellevale\u2019s request and endorsed it, the MALPF gave its approval on 23 October 2007.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The MALPF \u201cdetermined that the operation was a \u2018farm related use\u2019 that complements the Prigels\u2019 organic dairy operation \u2014 a use that is compatible with agriculture and [the] MALPF\u2019s program.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">RELEVANT DIRECT AND COLLATERAL PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">A. Before the Deputy Zoning Commissioner for Baltimore County</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">On 4 April 2008, the Yoders and the Long Green Valley <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Association<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> filed a \u201cPetition for Special Hearing\u201d before the Deputy Zoning Commissioner for Baltimore County asking that local official to determine, among other questions, \u201cwhether a dairy processing facility is permitted in an R.C.2 zone[,]\u201d pursuant to Sections 500.7 and 500.6 of the B.C.Z.R.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> One of those who testified at the public hearing was Wally Lippincott, Jr., an employee of the Baltimore County\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection and Resource Management with extensive experience working with the R.C.2 regulations. He stated that commercial agriculture is the preferred use in the R.C.2 Zone and is \u201cafforded preferential treatment over other permitted uses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">In his written decision, filed on 12 August 2008, the Deputy Commissioner concluded that the proposed creamery was consistent with being a \u201cfarm,\u201d under the definitions of \u201cfarm\u201d and \u201cdairying\u201d in the B.C.Z.R., because the \u201c[Ljegislature specifically intended to include the storage, production, distribution and sale of milk, butter, cheese, and milk byproducts as permissible uses in the R.C.2 Zone.\u201d Evidence found persuasive by the Deputy Commissioner was the MALPF\u2019s determination that the creamery was \u201ccompatible with agriculture\u201d and a permissible use under Maryland law. He determined that \u201csince \u2018Agriculture, Commercial\u2019 is defined in the B.C.Z.R. to include ancillary activities such as \u2018processing, packing, marketing or distributing,\u2019 the activities proposed for the Prigel Family Creamery are appropriate in the R.C.2 Zone[,]\u201d permitting Bellevale to construct the proposed facility. The LGVA and the Yoders appealed the Commissioner\u2019s decision to the local Board of Appeals, but dismissed that appeal before the Board decided the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>B. Before the Circuit Court for Baltimore County</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">On 15 May 2008, the Yoders filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County a Complaint for Injunctive, Mandamus, and Declaratory Relief against Bellevale Farms, Bellevale Limited Partnership, the Prigel Family Creamery, the Prigels, (\u201cthe Bellevale defendants\u201d) and the MALPF,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> advancing three requests for relief: (1) a Writ of Mandamus ordering the MALPF to enforce the terms of the Easement and provisions of State and County laws; (2) a declaration that the proposed creamery violates the Easement and State and County laws because it constitutes a commercial and/or industrial use;<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and, (3) an order enjoining permanently Bellevale from constructing and operating the creamery and as violative of the Easement and State and County laws. An Amended Complaint filed two weeks later added the LGVA as a plaintiff and alleged that the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm if the defendants were permitted to violate the Easement and the provisions of state and local law, and that granting permanent injunctive relief would serve best the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">The Bellevale defendants and the MALPF filed Motions to Dismiss and/or for Summary Judgment, suggesting commonly that the plaintiffs lacked standing to maintain the action.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The MALPF\u2019s motion asserted additionally that its decision to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>allow the creamery was within its statutory authority and discretion, and thus insulated from judicial scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">The case was assigned to Judge John F. Fader II of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. Judge Fader requested the parties to file additional memoranda in response to several issues raised in their pleadings that, in his view, required additional detail and information.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The parties responded.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> After a hearing, Judge Fader issued on 24 March 2009 an Order and Declaratory Judgment granting the defendants\u2019 Motions for Summary Judgment and denying the plaintiffs\u2019 Motions for Summary Judgment.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> He reasoned that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the action as third-party beneficiaries or \u201cinterested persons\u201d under the Easement, but noted that \u201c[i]t is the right of the Plaintiffs to carry their dispute with the Defendants through the zoning, planning and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>permit process of land use.... Any citizen who qualifies for standing in the administrative process may initiate that process with Baltimore County government.\u201d Judge Fader dismissed all other counts of the plaintiffs\u2019 Amended Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">C. Before the Court of Special Appeals</p>\n<p id=\"An\">The LGVA and the Yoders appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court, challenging the trial court\u2019s conclusion that they lacked standing to bring an action against Bellevale\u2019s proposed construction of a creamery operation on the basis that the Bellevale Easement is a charitable trust and, consequently, is enforceable by non-party interested persons as members of the public.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">In a reported opinion,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> the Court of Special Appeals held that the Easement Agreement did not reflect that Bellevale, the Grantor, had a charitable intent to benefit either the Yoders, LGVA, or members of LGVA, or that the Bellevale Easement had a charitable purpose and, therefore, the Belle-vale Easement did not create a charitable trust.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> <em>Long Green </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number><em>Valley Ass\u2019n v. Bellevale Farms, Inc., 205 Md.App. 636, 683, </em>46 A.3d 473, 501 (2012). The intermediate appellate court noted that the language of the Bellevale Easement belied Petitioners\u2019 contention that it was created with an intent to create a charitable trust or with a charitable purpose. <em>Id. </em>at 673-83, 46 A.3d at 497-502. The court concluded, rather, that the Easement Agreement\u2019s terms and the statutory scheme of the MALPF program indicated that the Bellevale Easement was a product of a state-funded program to improve the feasibility of profitable farming.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Appellants filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari to this Court. We granted the petition on 21 September 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">D. Questions Presented and the Parties\u2019 Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The parties dispute whether the grant of an agricultural preservation easement to the State, in the person of the MALPF, created a charitable trust, thereby entitling non-party interested persons, such as the LGVA and the Yoders, to file an action seeking to enforce that easement, when the State, in the Petitioners\u2019 view, \u201cfailed to do so[.]\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>In its Brief, the MALPF included a Motion to Dismiss Petitioners\u2019 appeal, contending that the doctrines of res judicata and/or collateral estoppel rendered moot Petitioners\u2019 asserted grounds for relief in the present case because the Court of Special Appeals addressed allegedly the same grounds in <em>Long Green Valley Ass\u2019n v. Prigel Family Creamery, </em>206 Md.App. 264, 47 A.3d 1087 (2012), a subsequently decided and related appeal.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The gravamen of the MALPF\u2019s and Bellevale Respondents\u2019 argument on the merits is that the Bellevale Easement did not create a charitable trust within the meaning of Title 14, Subtitle 3 of the Estates and Trust Article.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Consequently, Respondents contend the LGVA and the Yoders are not persons \u201chaving an interest in enforcement of the trust\u201d under the meaning of Est. &amp; Trusts \u00a7 14-302(a),<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and cannot challenge the Bellevale Respondents\u2019 right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>to construct and operate a creamery on Bellevale Farms, in accordance with the Easement Agreement and the MALPF\u2019s consent. Naturally, Petitioners aver that the Bellevale Easement created a charitable trust, and that they are entitled, as \u201cinterested persons\u201d under Est. &amp; Trusts \u00a7 14-302(a), to challenge the Prigels\u2019 construction and operation of a creamery on Bellevale Farms.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">First, we deny the MALPF\u2019s Motion to Dismiss because the matter at issue in <em>Long Green Valley Ass\u2019n v. Prigel Family Creamery, </em>206 Md.App. 264, 47 A.3d 1087 (2012), is distinct as a matter of law from that involved in the current case and, therefore, res judicata and/or collateral estoppel do not render Petitioners\u2019 present appeal moot. Next, we hold penultimately that the deed of easement does not reflect any indication that either Bellevale or the MALPF, in the sale and purchase of the Bellevale Easement, (1) manifested an intent for the Easement to be a charitable trust, or (2) had a charitable purpose in creating the Bellevale Easement. Therefore, we hold ultimately that the Bellevale Easement does not satisfy the elements required to create a valid charitable trust and Petitioners do not have standing to maintain a cause of action under Est. &amp; Trusts \u00a7 14-302(a) to seek to enforce the Easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">A. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">The trial court granted Respondents\u2019 motions for summary judgment, dismissed Counts I, II, and IV of the complaint, and issued a declaratory judgment that Petitioners lacked standing.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> We review an appeal from an order enter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>ing summary judgment by considering the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Gourdine v. Crews, </em>405 Md. 722, 735, 955 A.2d 769, 777 (2008); <em>Harford County v. Saks, </em>399 Md. 73, 82, 923 A.2d 1, 6 (2007) (In reviewing a grant of a motion for summary judgment, \u201cwe seek to determine whether any material facts are in dispute and, if they are, we resolve them in favor of the non-moving party.\u201d). <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2 \u2014 501(f) (a trial court grants a motion for summary judgment \u201cin favor of or against the moving party if the motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">Because there is no genuine dispute as to any fact material to the resolution of this case, we apply a non-deferential standard to determine whether the trial court erred as a matter of law in entering summary judgment. <em>Anderson v. Council of Unit Owners of Gables on Tuckerman Condominium, </em>404 Md. 560, 571, 948 A.2d 11, 18 (2008).

Prigel Family Creamery (\u201cPrigel </em>\u201d), 206 Md. App. 264, 47 A.3d 1087 (2012), \u201crejected the same legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>challenge to the creamery and retail operation that is asserted in the case now on appeal[.]\u201d Res judicata and collateral estoppel are common law doctrines designed to preclude the relitigation of either the same cause(s) of action or same legally determinative issue(s), respectively, decided in a prior action. <em>See Powell v. Breslin, </em>480 Md. 52, 68, 59 A.8d 531, 537-38 (2013) (discussing the affirmative defense of res judicata); <em>Rourke v.

The Prigels requested the special exception in order to construct the 10,000 square foot building to house the creamery, the 1,500 square foot retail store, and a parking area adjacent to the latter building to accommodate up to eight vehicles. <em>Id. </em>at 268, 47 A.3d at 1089.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The petition was granted in March 2010, over the opposition of the LGVA, the Yoders, Carol Trela, and Caroline Pine (Trela and Pine as apparent members of the LGVA). <em>Id. </em>at 266, 47 A.3d at 1088. The Board of Appeals\u2019s decision was brought before the Circuit Court for Baltimore County on judicial review (which affirmed), and then to the Court of Special Appeals in April 2011. <em>Id. </em>at 266-67, 47 A.3d at 1088.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">The questions presented to the intermediate appellate court were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>1.

None of the parties in <em>Prigel </em>asked the intermediate appellate court to decide whether the Bellevale Easement was a charitable trust. As <em>Prigel </em>and the current case are distinct significantly in their causes of action and legally determinative issues, we conclude that neither res judicata nor collateral estoppel preclude the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">2.

As explained above, our first step in interpreting whether Respondents intended the Bellevale Easement to constitute a charitable trust is to look at the language of the deed of easement. We resort to evidence extrinsic to the instrument only where the parties\u2019 language in the instrument is unclear and ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">We turn now to the crux of the dispute \u2014 whether the Respondents manifested an intent in the Bellevale deed of easement for the Easement to constitute a charitable trust, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>and whether the Bellevale Easement has a charitable purpose. Petitioners\u2019 argument concentrates on evidence extrinsic to the language of the deed to contend that the Bellevale Easement manifested an intent to create a charitable trust.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> We conclude, however, that Petitioners rush too quickly past the express terms of the Bellevale Easement Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">The Bellevale Easement Agreement does not indicate that Bellevale, as Grantor, intended for the MALPF to \u201cdeal with [the] property for the benefit of other persons[,]\u201d \u2014 a required element of a valid charitable trust. <em>From the Heart Church Ministries, </em>870 Md. at 181-82, 803 A.2d at 566. Rather, the deed of easement explains that it is \u201cthe intention of the parties that the said land shall be preserved solely for agricultural use in accordance with the provisions of the Agricultural Article.\u201d Who is entitled to preserve the land for agricultural use, and thus benefit from that use, is explained in each of the Easement Agreement\u2019s sub-parts. For example, the introductory sub-part to \u201cCOVENANTS, CONDITIONS, LIMITATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS,\u201d states that it is the <em>\u201cGrant- or </em>[who] covenants for and on behalf of Grantor, the <em>personal representatives, successors and assigns of the Grantor, </em>with the <em>Grantee, its successors and assigns, </em>to do and refrain from doing upon the above described land all and any of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>various acts set forth.... \u201d (Emphasis added.) Section B employs similar language providing that <em>\u201cthe parties, for themselves, their personal representatives, successors and assigns, </em>further covenant and agree as follows____\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Other clauses in the deed offer further indication that Bellevale and the MALPF intended the Easement to benefit the Grantor and Grantee only. For example, Section B(5) of the Easement Agreement provides that the State, \u201cto the use of the Department of Agriculture on behalf of\u2019 the MALPF, may enforce the Easement, but excludes expressly any other individual from enforcing it. Moreover, in Section B(4), it states that the Grantee, and not any member of the public, has \u201cthe right to enter on the above described land from time to time for the sole purpose of inspection and enforcement of the easement, covenants, conditions, limitations and restrictions----\u201d Lastly, it is the MALPF, and no other entity, that is entitled to determine whether any proposed use of Bellevale Farms may violate the provisions of the easement. Hence, the Bellevale Easement provides, in the first instance, only the Grantor and Grantee the authority to compel compliance with the Easement\u2019s restrictions, to the sole benefit of the named parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">The inclusion of these provisions indicates that the MALPF and the Bellevale Respondents intended for the Easement to track the principal objective of the MALPF program, which is to \u201cpromote the continued availability of agricultural supplies and markets for agricultural goods.\u201d Agric. \u00a7\u00a7 2-502(d), 2-509(d)(3). We need not resort to extrinsic evidence in parsing the plain meaning of the Respondents\u2019 intent because the language of the Bellevale Easement demonstrates clearly that the Respondents did not intend for the Easement to impose a charitable trust. <em>See Garfink, </em>392 Md. at 392-93, 897 A.2d at 217; <em>City of Bowie, </em>398 Md. at 681, 922 A.2d at 523-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">Petitioners argue that \u201c[t]he statutory and regulatory scheme governing the MALPF program demonstrates overwhelmingly that the primary and motivating purpose of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>program is to provide a public benefit through the preservation of rural land and open space, curbing urban blight, and providing a continued source for agricultural products.\u201d We are persuaded, however, that the language of the Easement Agreement and the MALPF program\u2019s statutory scheme demonstrate that the principal objective of the Bellevale Easement is not charitable, but rather concerned with maintaining agriculture as a profitable endeavor. We settle on this view by looking to the language of the Easement Agreement. Several terms and provisions included in the Bellevale Easement signal that the parties intended that the definition of \u201cagricultural use\u201d include making economic the ongoing use of farmland as such, and not primarily the preservation of \u201copen space [and] curbing urban blight[.]\u201d For example, Section [A](3) of the deed of easement identifies \u201cexceptions\u201d to the general prohibition against using the land for \u201cany commercial, industrial, or residential purpose.\u201d Specifically, it provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-4\">The <em>Grantor reserves the right to use the above described land for any farm use, </em>and to carry on all normal farming practices, <em>including the operation at any time of any machinery used in farm production or the primary processing of any agricultural products; </em>the right to conduct upon the said land any agricultural operation which is in accordance with good husbandry practices and which does not cause bodily injury ... <em>including any operation directly relating to the processing, storage, or sale of farm, agricultural, or woodland products produced on the said above described land; </em>and all other rights and privileges not hereby relinquished, including the Grantor\u2019s right of privacy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Section [A](3) does not propose as an express purpose of the Easement to conserve rural land and curb \u201curban blight\u201d\u2014 indeed, those phrases are not found in the deed of Easement. Instead, the Easement states expressly that the \u201cagricultural\u201d use to which Bellevale Farms is restricted includes farm operations \u201crelating to the processing, storage, or sale of farm, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>agricultural, or woodland products\u201d as long as they are \u201cproduced on the said above described land[.]\u201d Hence, the prohibition in Section [A][l] of using Bellevale Farms for a \u201ccommercial, industrial, or residential purpose\u201d excludes from its reach conducting development and sale operations on Belle-vale Farms of \u201cfarm, agricultural, or woodland products\u201d as permitted by Section [A](3).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">The language of Section [A](3) is consistent with Section 2-513 of the Agriculture Article as it existed at the time the Easement was executed in 1997, which also prohibited the \u201ccommercial, industrial, or residential\u201d use of farmland, but permitted the \u201c[operation at any time of any machinery used in farm production or the primary processing of agricultural products[,]\u201d and \u201c[a]ll normal agricultural operations performed in accordance with good husbandry practices which do not cause bodily injury ... including, but not limited to, sale of farm products produced on the farm where such sales are made.\u201d Agric. \u00a7 2-513(a)(2)-(3). Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that \u201cnormal agricultural operations,\u201d such as the sale and processing of farm products, are not included in the statute\u2019s definition of the prohibited \u201ccommercial [or] industrial\u201d uses of farmland. The same permitted uses of Bellevale Farms for purposes of profitable farming and sale of farm products, rather than for a charitable preservation of land for public use and enjoyment, are evident in Section [A](3) of the Bellevale Easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Resort, if need be, to the statutory scheme of the MALPF program provides further support for the conclusion that the Bellevale Easement has no charitable purpose. Petitioners seem to rely on the notion that, because the MALPF is a state agency, the undisputed objective of the MALPF program\u2014 which is to foster agriculture in Maryland and, in order to do so, encourage the maintenance of farming, practices \u2014 is charitable because the public-at-large benefits from the agricultural preservation easements purchased by the MALPF. Although public benefits potentially and incidentally flow from the MALPF program, we conclude that the overarching purpose of the program is not charitable because its primary goal is to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>promote and enable profitable farming by purchasing easements in privately-maintained land. <em>See </em>Bogert, <em>Trusts and Trustees, </em>\u00a7 34, at 42 (3d ed. 2007) (\u201cOften the word \u2018trust\u2019 is used in a non-technical sense denoting merely an obligation arising out of the acceptance of the dedicated property\u201d by a government agency, but that does not mean \u201cthe [government agency] became a trustee for charitable purposes.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">As we explained <em>infra, </em>the MALPF program aids landowners who seek to improve the profitability of their land for agricultural enterprise by providing restrictions and appraisal methods that increase land profitability while ensuring the agricultural use of farmland. <em>See </em>Agric. \u00a7 2-509(d). Although part of the legislative intent of the MALPF program is undeniably to \u201c[c]ontrol the urban expansion\u201d on Maryland\u2019s agricultural land and \u201cprotect agricultural land and woodland as open-space land[,]\u201d the Legislature intended these collateral consequences to serve the principal purpose of the MALPF to \u201c[p]rovide sources of agricultural products within the State for the citizens of the State[.]\u201d Agric. \u00a7 2-501. Thus, the objective of the MALPF program is a balanced scheme of employing agricultural preservation to improve the profitability of farming in Maryland. Moreover, the MALPF does not consider purchasing an easement in land that is unsuitable for profitable farming, <em>see </em>Agric. \u00a7 2-514. The MALPF requires each interested landowner to undergo a rigorous application process, acquire county designation of the land as an agricultural district, satisfy strict eligibility criteria, and, finally, obtain the approval of the MALPF. In reaching its decisions, the MALPF considers appraisals and rankings of potential properties, lower acquisition prices for the interests in properties so as to maximize its limited financial resources (which tends to explain why less than full market value prices are paid generally for easements), and offers made in accordance with a formula established by the MALPF. <em>See </em>Agric. \u00a7\u00a7 2-509, et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The competitive application process leading up to the acceptance of an offer of purchase from the MALPF is demonstrated by the fact that many landowners who discount their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>asking price improve their ranking in the competition to sell easements to MALPF. Lastly, and most importantly, the purchased easement must comply with the restrictions established by Agric. \u00a7 2-513. All of these moving parts in the MALPF program\u2019s statutory scheme reflect a program that is market-oriented and profit-driven, even if some consequential benefits flow to the general public in Maryland. The program and, therefore, the Bellevale Easement purchased through that program, are distinct significantly from those interests in property where we have found charitable trusts. <em>See, e.g., Register of Wills v. Cook, </em>241 Md. 264, 277-78, 216 A.2d 542, 548 (1966) (where this Court concluded that a trust was charitable because it was created to foster the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment and preclude the effects of sexual discrimination in the laws of Maryland and the United States, despite \u201cthe views of individuals, laymen, or judges.... \u201d); <em>Second National Bank v. Second National Bank, </em>171 Md. 547, 556-58, 190 A. 215, 219-20 (1937) (where this Court concluded that a trust establishing a home for \u201cunfortunate girls\u201d was charitable).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">In sum, because the instrument creating the Bellevale Easement, as well as the statutory scheme of the MALPF program through which the Easement was purchased, do not indicate that Respondents intended to or created a charitable trust with a charitable purpose, we hold that Petitioners do not have standing under Est. &amp; Trusts \u00a7 14-302(a) to maintain a cause of action to enforce the Easement according to their interpretation of its terms. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

Plaintiffs contended, specifically, that \"the proposed [operation] violates state law [Agric. \u00a7 2-513(a)(1)-(3) ] because it would (1) constitute a commercial and/or industrial use rather than a farm use; (2) involve the operation of machinery that is not normally used in production; (3) constitute secondary, rather than primary processing of agricultural products; and (4) involve the sale of products not produced on Bellevale Farm[s].\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b129-8\">. In their response to the defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss and/or for Summary Judgment, plaintiffs argued for their standing because (1) they are intended third-party beneficiaries of the Easement Agreement between the MALPF and the co-defendants; (2) the Easement is a charitable trust and, consequently, is enforceable by interested non-parties as members of the public; and, (3) they are harmed specially by the defendants\u2019 violations of the Easement Agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b130-5\">.

(2) Is there any persuasive case from another jurisdiction which relies on a similar statute? (3) Does the Restatement contain any guidance on the standing issue?

The trial court explained that \u201cneither the legislative history of the MALPF [sic] enactment, the wording of the Statutory scheme or any COMAR regulation enacted pursuant to the statute indicate any intent to allow a taxpayer, an adjoining property owner, or any other individual or entity to challenge file decision made by [the] MALPF to approve the creamery operation by direct application of the primary jurisdiction with this court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b131-6\"><em>. </em>Two other grounds were placed before the intermediate appellate court, but are not before us. Those assertions were that Appellants are intended third-party beneficiaries of the Bellevale Easement Agreement and that they are harmed specially by the Appellees\u2019 alleged violations of the Bellevale Easement Agreement. <em>Long Green Valley Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Bellevale Farms, Inc., </em>205 Md.App. 636, 653, 683-84, 46 A.3d 473, 483-84, 502 (2012). The Court of Special Appeals held that (1) the LGVA and its members were not third-party beneficiaries to the Bellevale Easement and, (2) the Yoders, as owners of property adjacent to Bellevale Farms, were prima facie aggrieved by the MALPF\u2019s alleged failure to enforce the easement. <em>Id. </em>at 653-59, 684-89, 46 A.3d at 484-87, 502-05.

Petitioners assign erroneous and undue weight to this non-precedential case. Mioreover, Petitioners misuse the Myrtle Grove case to contend (apparently) that, because the Office of the Attorney General of Maryland argued in that case that a property owner's grant of an easement to the State created a charitable trust for the benefit of Maryland citizens, the formal position of the Attorney General with respect to a \u201cconservation agreement\u201d in all cases and for all time is that it creates a charitable trust. Apart from the differences in the factual history of the Myrtle Grove case (the Myrtle Grove easement was donated as a gift to a non-profit charitable corporation) and this case, nothing in the record of the Myrtle Grove case supports the notion that all agricultural preservation easements are the equivalent of charitable trusts. <em>See </em>Nancy A, McLaughlin, <em>Conservation Easements: Perpetuity and Beyond, </em>34 Ecology L.Q. 673, 690-93 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
