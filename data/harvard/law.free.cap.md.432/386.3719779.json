A place of abode includes any dwelling or place where one sleeps, <em>Boer v. University Specialty Hospital, </em>421 Md. 529, 538, 27 A.3d 175, 180 (2011), and merely requires \u201cactual physical presence,\u201d <em>Bainum v. Kalen, </em>272 Md. 490, 496, 325 A.2d 392, 395 (1974), while domicile is the particular permanent home of an individual, \u201cto which place he has, whenever he is absent, the intention of returning.\u201d <em>Shenton v. Abbott, </em>178 Md. 526, 530, 15 A.2d 906, 908 (1940). A domicile serves as an individual\u2019s residence for \u201cvoting, income tax returns, driver\u2019s license, motor vehicle registration, school attendance, receipt of mail, banking, contracts and legal documents, the keeping of personal belongings, [and] membership in organizations^]\u201d <em>Blount v. Boston, </em>351 Md. 360, 367-68, 718 A.2d 1111, 1115 (1998). An individual may have several abodes, but he or she may have but one domicile. <em>Shenton, </em>178 Md. at 530, 15 A.2d at 908.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">The section of the Anne Arundel County Charter at issue provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-6\">(c) Change of Residence. If any member of the County Council during his term of office shall move his residence from the councilmanic district in which he resided at the time of his election, his office shall be forthwith vacated; but no member of the County Council shall be required to vacate his office by reason of any change in the boundary lines of his councilmanic district made during his term.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACG\">Based upon this provision, the Anne Arundel County Council, Appellee, enacted a bill that provided that Daryl Jones, Appellant, forfeited his elected councilmanic position. The County Council reasoned that Jones \u201cmove[d] his residence from the councilmanic district in which he resided at the time of his election\u201d to a correctional facility in South Carolina, after having been convicted of failing to file a federal tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">Jones, thereafter, in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County challenged the authority of the County Council to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>expel him as a member based upon its interpretation of \u201cresidence\u201d as a temporary place of abode. The Circuit Court granted summary judgment in favor of the County and County Council, concluding that the County Council had the authority to declare Jones\u2019s seat vacant under the Express Powers Act, Section 5(S), Article 25A of the Maryland Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that the County Council properly interpreted \u201cresidence\u201d under Section 202(c) as a temporary place of abode. Jones appealed and, prior to a decision in the Court of Special Appeals, filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari, which we granted. 427 Md. 62, 46 A.3d 404 (2012). Jones presents two questions for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-4\">1. Whether the County Council for Anne Arundel County may remove Jones from his seat as an elected official (a) for conviction of a misdemeanor when there is no local law in effect to govern the removal of a Councilmember for conviction of a crime and Section 2 of Article XV of the Maryland Constitution does not allow for removal under the circumstances presented here or (b) for Jones\u2019 inability to perform all of the daily duties of office for a period of five months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>when there is no local law that allows a Councilmember to be removed from office on this ground and local law with respect to the County Executive and Councilmembers called to active military duty allows a vacancy to be declared only if the elected official is unable to perform the daily duties of office for a period of six months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-4\">2. Whether the County Council for Anne Arundel County may remove Jones from his seat as an elected official for conviction of a crime or for an inability to perform all of the daily duties of office by interpreting a Charter residency requirement to mean \u201cplace of abode,\u201d rather than \u201cdomicile,\u201d when this Court has held for more than 100 years that a residency requirement in the context of qualifications for political office means \u201cdomicile\u201d and, specifically, that a similar residency requirement in the Baltimore City Charter means \u201cdomicile.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">In response, the County and County Council filed an Answer to Petition for Writ of Certiorari and Conditional Cross-Petition, which we also granted, 427 Md. 62, 46 A.3d 404 (2012), to consider the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">Does the Clean Hands Doctrine bar the Petitioner\u2019s claims for relief seeking removal of the incumbent member of the County Council who now represents the First Councilmanic District from office and restoration of the Petitioner to office for the remainder of the term that expires in December 2014?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">We shall hold that the County Council did not have the authority, under Section 5 of the Express Powers Act, to declare Jones\u2019s seat vacant and that \u201cresidence\u201d in Section 202(c) embodies the notion of domicile, such that Jones did not \u201cmove his residence\u201d by virtue of his five-month incarceration. We finally shall hold that the clean hands doctrine does not bar Jones\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">In 2006 and again in 2010, Daryl Jones was elected to serve as a member of the Anne Arundel County Council for the First Councilmanic District. In November of 2011, however, Jones pled guilty pursuant to a plea agreement in federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>district court to one count of willful failure to file income tax returns, in violation of Section 7203 of Title 26 of the United States Code, and was sentenced to a 5 month term, commencing on January 23, 2012, in a federal correctional facility in South Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">In December of 2011, pursuant to the advice of the County Attorney, Councilmember Benoit of the Anne Arundel County Council introduced Bill 85-11 and Councilmember Grasso introduced Resolution 65-11, which declared that Jones\u2019s seat would be vacated, according to Section 202(c) of the Charter, \u201con the date that Councilman Jones begins \u2018residence\u2019 in a federal correctional facility that is located outside of Council-manic District I.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Bill and Resolution were scheduled to be considered by the County Council on January 17, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>On January 4, 2012, Jones filed a three-count Complaint for Declaratory, Injunctive, and Other Relief in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. In Count One, Jones sought a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>declaratory judgment that \u201c(A) Councilman Jones\u2019 temporary absence from Councilmanic District I does not constitute a change in residence under Section 202(c) of the Anne Arundel County Charter and (B) his office as a Councilman does not become vacant by virtue of the temporary absence.\u201d Counts Two and Three reiterated the substance of Count One, and included requests for injunctive relief and mandamus to prevent the declaration of a vacancy of Jones\u2019s seat and the removal of Jones from office. On January 17, 2012, the County Council, with Jones abstaining, voted to adopt Bill 85-11. Peter I. Smith was later appointed to fill the vacancy for the First Councilmanic District.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Thereafter, on January 25, 2011, Jones filed a Motion for Summary Judgment and for the Entry of Expedited Declaratory Relief, alleging that the County Council lacked the authority to declare his seat vacant and misinterpreted \u201cresidence\u201d to mean place of abode rather than domicile. The County and County Council also filed a Motion for Summary Judgment as to all counts, arguing that the removal of Jones from his council seat was a nonjusticiable political question and, nonetheless, that the County Council was authorized to remove Jones pursuant to Section 5(Q) of the Express Powers Act, which provides that the County Council may enact local laws \u201cto govern the conduct and actions of all such county officers in the performance of their public duties, and to provide for penalties, including removal from office, for violation of any such laws or the regulations adopted thereunder.\u201d In answering Jones\u2019s summary judgment motion, the County and County Council raised the \u201cclean hands\u201d defense to Jones\u2019s allegations, contending that Jones committed \u201cfraud perpetrated upon the voters of the First Councilmanic District of Anne Arundel County [because he] deliberately withheld information about his criminal behavior and pending plea agreement with the United States Attorney because he knew that such information would have a material effect on the election held on November 2, 2010.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The Circuit Court Judge denied Jones\u2019s Motion, but granted the County and County Council\u2019s Motion. The Circuit Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>rejected the County Council\u2019s argument that its authority to remove Jones was derived from Section 5(Q), which provides the County with the power to \u201cenact local laws designed ... to provide for penalties, including removal from office, for violation of any such laws or the regulations adopted thereunder,\u201d because this provision \u201cmerely delegate[s] to the County Council the power to enact local laws.\u201d The judge, nonetheless, determined that the removal was authorized by the General Welfare Clause of the Express Powers Act, Section 5(S), which provides that the Act shall not limit the County\u2019s power \u201cto pass all ordinances ... as may be deemed expedient in maintaining the peace, good government, health and welfare of the county,\u201d and based on a need to avoid vacancies on the County Council that would \u201cdeadlock\u201d votes regarding \u201cimportant tasks in front of [the Council] when it holds its legislative session in May.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">In so doing, the court concluded that the County Council acted within its authority because Jones \u201cmove[d] his residence,\u201d under Section 202(c) of the Anne Arundel County Charter, when he reported to the correctional facility in South Carolina, even though his domicile remained in the First Councilmanic District, because \u201cresidence\u201d equates to a place of abode. Thus, the Circuit Court denied Jones\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, which sought a declaratory judgment, and granted the County and County Council\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment as to all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Before us, Jones challenges as error the Circuit Court\u2019s conclusion that the County Council had the authority to expel him from office under the General Welfare Clause, Section 5(S) of the Express Powers Act, because this provision does not empower the County Council to enact a specific expulsion of a sitting member. He also contends that the Circuit Court should have heeded our longstanding jurisprudence defining \u201cresidence\u201d as domicile.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The County and County Council counter that the removal of a councilmember, for the failure to meet the qualifications of his or her office, is within the exclusive purview of the County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>Council and is, thereby, a political question from which this Court must abstain. They reason that this exclusive power comes from Section 5(Q) of the Express Powers Act, which provides the County with the sole authority to \u201cenact local laws designed ... to govern the conduct and actions of all such county officers in the performance of their public duties, and to provide for penalties, including removal from office, for violation of any such laws or the regulations adopted thereunder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">They alternatively contend that, if not a political question, the County Council\u2019s action was taken pursuant to Section 5(Q) of the Express Powers Act, as opposed to the provision that the Circuit Court held to provide the County Council\u2019s authority, Section 5(S), the General Welfare Clause. They contend that the Circuit Court was correct in its interpretation of \u201cresidence\u201d in Section 202(c) of the Anne Arundel County Charter to mean a place of abode, rather than domicile, and point to a comment written by the Reporter and Counsel to the Charter Board, the drafters of the original Proposed Anne Arundel County Charter, which stated that the purpose of Section 202(c) was to \u201crequire[] that each councilmanic district shall be represented in the Council by a member who actually resides therein during his full term.\u201d \u201cActually resides,\u201d they contend, means the place of abode where the councilmember sleeps and is physically present.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">As a threshold matter, the County and County Council contend that under the political question doctrine, the Court must abstain from intervening in the removal of a councilmember. They maintain that the County Council has the sole authority to judge the qualifications of a councilmember, citing Section 5(Q)(1) of the Express Powers Act, which provides the County with the power to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-6\">enact local laws designed to prevent conflicts between the private interests and public duties of any county officers, including members of the county council, and to govern the conduct and actions of all such county officers in the performance of their public duties, and to provide for penalties, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>including removal from office, for violation of any such laws or the regulations adopted thereunder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">The Circuit Court rejected this very argument and concluded that Section 5(Q)(1) \u201cmerely delegated] to the County Council the power to enact local laws\u201d and that there was no provision of the Anne Arundel County Code pertaining to the removal of councilmembers.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The political question doctrine embodies judicial abstention and depends on the notion that an issue is solely \u201ccommitted to an elected branch of government and thus should not be heard in ... court.\u201d <em>James R. May, AEP v. Connecticut and the Future of the Political Question Doctrine, </em>121 Yale L.J. Online 127 (2011), <em>available at </em>http://yalelawjournal.org/2011/09/13/may.html; <em>see also Nixon v. United States, </em>506 U.S. 224, 252-53, 113 S.Ct. 732, 747-48, 122 L.Ed.2d 1, 24 (1993) (Souter, J., concurring) (\u201c[T]he political question doctrine is essentially a function of the separation of powers, existing to restrain courts from inappropriate interference in the business of the other branches of Government, and deriving in large part from prudential concerns about the respect we owe the political departments.\u201d (Internal citations and quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The existence of politics in a case, however, does not define whether a case involves a political question. <em>INS v. Chadha, </em>462 U.S. 919, 942-43, 103 S.Ct. 2764, 2780, 77 L.Ed.2d 317, 339 (1983) (\u201cIt is correct that this controversy [involving the congressional authority to veto a determination that an individual should not be deported] may, in a sense, be termed \u2018political.\u2019 But the presence of constitutional issues with significant political overtones does not automatically invoke the political question doctrine.\u201d). In <em>Baker v. Carr, </em>369 U.S. 186, 217, 82 S.Ct. 691, 710, 7 L.Ed.2d 663, 685-86 (1962), the Supreme Court outlined the essential aspects of a political question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">Prominent on the surface of any case held to involve a political question is found a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>department; or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion; or the impossibility of a court\u2019s undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government; or an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made; or the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">In a case close to point, <em>Powell v. McCormack, </em>395 U.S. 486, 89 S.Ct. 1944, 23 L.Ed.2d 491 (1969), the United States House of Representatives expelled Congressman Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., based in part on his misuse of government funds. Powell challenged the constitutionality of the expulsion, which the Speaker and other members of the House of Representatives contended to be a political question, because, they alleged, Section 5 of Article I of the United States Constitution,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was a \u201ctextually demonstrable\u201d commitment to that body to adjudicate the qualifications of its members. Powell acknowledged that Section 5 committed to the House of Representatives the duty to judge the qualifications of its members, but countered that it empowered Congress to \u201cexclude him only if it found he failed to meet the standing requirements of age, citizenship, and residence contained in [Section 2 of Article I] of the Constitution \u2014 requirements the House specifically found Powell met.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 489, 89 S.Ct. at 1947, 23 L.Ed.2d at 498. After the District Court dismissed the case as nonjusticiable under the political question doctrine, and the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>Supreme Court interpreted the House\u2019s \u201ctextually demonstrable constitutional commitment\u201d to adjudicate the qualifications of its members to be limited to the \u201cstanding qualifications expressly prescribed by the Constitution,\u201d such that the House\u2019s expulsion of Powell for misuse of funds, which was not a standing qualification of office, was subject to judicial scrutiny. <em>Id. </em>at 519-20, 89 S.Ct. at 1962-63, 23 L.Ed.2d at 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The Supreme Court then proceeded to the merits of the case, involving whether the House had the power to expel Powell. The Court concluded, similar to its analysis under the political question doctrine, that the power to remove a member for the failure to meet qualifications of office under Section 5 of Article I was limited \u201cto the standing qualifications prescribed in the Constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 550, 89 S.Ct. at 1979, 23 L.Ed.2d at 533. Therefore, \u201cthe House was without power\u201d to remove Powell because he met all standing qualifications. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">We have had occasion to consider whether a political question is present in a case in <em>Lamb v. Hammond, </em>308 Md. 286, 518 A.2d 1057 (1987), involving a contest between two candidates, John R. Hammond and Donald E. Lamb, in a neck-and-neck election for a House of Delegates seat from Anne Arundel County. While Lamb appeared to have one more vote than Hammond, the latter was declared the winner after he learned that some absentee ballots had not been counted by the Board of Canvassers and filed an action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, and the Circuit Court, over Lamb\u2019s objection, ordered that these absentee ballots be counted. Lamb argued that the court should not have intruded into the House election process, because the House of Delegates had the \u201ctextually demonstrable constitutional commitment\u201d to judge the qualifications and elections of its members under Section 19 of Article III of the Maryland Constitution, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">Each House shall be judge of the qualifications and elections of its members, as prescribed by the Constitution and Laws of the State, and shall appoint its own officers, determine the rules of its own proceedings, punish a mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>ber for disorderly or disrespectful behaviour and with the consent of two-thirds of its whole number of members elected, expel a member; but no member shall be expelled a second time for the same offence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">We rejected Lamb\u2019s argument. <em>Lamb, </em>308 Md. at 304, 518 A.2d at 1066.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">We opined that this legislative power to adjudicate the qualifications and elections of its members was \u201cnot unbridled,\u201d but instead limited by its express language: \u201cas prescribed by the Constitution and Laws of the State.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A law of this State, we continued, did limit the House\u2019s sole adjudicatory authority because Section 27-10 of Article 33, Maryland Code (1957) provided that, \u201c[a]ny candidate or absentee voter aggrieved by any decision or action of such board shall have the right of appeal to the circuit court for the county to review such decision or action, <em>and jurisdiction to hear and determine such appeals is hereby conferred upon said courts. \u201d Id. </em>at 291, 518 A.2d at 1059 (emphasis in original), quoting Maryland Code (1957), Article 33, Section 27-10. We proceeded, then, to the merits of Lamb\u2019s appeal, and concluded that the absentee ballots at issue should not have been counted because they were submitted late, under Section 27-9 of Article 33, Maryland Code (1957), and reversed the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The instant removal of Jones is akin to the removal of Congressman Powell in <em>Powell v. McCormack, </em>in which the Supreme Court did not abstain from reaching the merits based upon the United States Constitution. Both Section 5 of Article I of the U.S. Constitution and Section 19 of Article III of the Maryland Constitution provide legislative bodies with express power to adjudicate the qualifications of its members; but as <em>Powell </em>and <em>Lamb </em>demonstrate, that power is limited by its very language, either to standing qualifications, under Section 5 of Article I of the U.S. Constitution, or prescription by the Constitution and Laws of the State, under Section 19 of Article III of the Maryland Constitution. The political question doctrine is narrowly applied; courts will not abstain from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>reviewing actions that are not within the express purview of the \u201ctextually demonstrable constitutional commitment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">In the present case, Section 5(Q) of the Express Powers Act embodies less of a commitment to sole legislative purview than those constitutional provisions which name legislative bodies the sole judges of its members\u2019 qualifications, because there just is no commitment rendering the County Council the sole arbiter of its members\u2019 qualifications. We conclude, thus, that the issue of Jones\u2019s removal, based on his qualifications for office, is not a political question.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Turning now to the merits, the Circuit Court held that Section 5(S) of the Express Powers Act, known as the General Welfare Clause, provided the County Council with the authority to remove Jones from his elected seat, as an exercise of its \u201cpolice power.\u201d Section 5(S) provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">The foregoing or other enumeration of powers in this article shall not be held to limit the power of the county council, in addition thereto, to pass all ordinances, resolutions or bylaws, not inconsistent with the provisions of this article or the laws of the State, as may be proper in executing and enforcing any of the powers enumerated in this section or elsewhere in this article, as well as such ordinances as may be deemed expedient in maintaining the peace, good government, health and welfare of the county.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0d\">Jones argues that Section 5(S) only gives the County Council power to adopt local laws, and that Bill 85-11 is not legislative in nature because it \u201caffects Jones \u2014 and Jones alone\u201d \u2014 and \u201cis not a \u2018new law\u2019 of \u2018general application\u2019 that sets forth a \u2018new plan or policy.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">The Express Powers Act, we explained in dicta in <em>McCrory Corporation v. Fowler, </em>319 Md. 12, 16-17, 570 A.2d 834, 835 (1990), was enacted pursuant to the Home Rule Amendment \u201cto transfer the General Assembly\u2019s power to enact many types of county public local laws\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">Article XI-A was proposed by Ch. 416 of the Laws of Maryland of 1914 and ratified by the voters on November 2, 1915. The Article, known as the Home Rule Amendment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>enabled counties, which chose to adopt a home rule charter, to achieve a significant degree of political self-determination. Its purpose was to transfer the General Assembly\u2019s power to enact many types of county public local laws to the Art. XI-A home rule counties. <em>See generally, e.g., Bd. of Election Laws v. Talbot County, </em>316 Md. 332, 344, 558 A.2d 724 (1988); <em>Griffith v. Wakefield, </em>298 Md. 381, 384, 470 A.2d 345 (1984); <em>Town of Forest Heights v. Frank, </em>291 Md. 331, 342, 435 A.2d 425 (1981); <em>Cheeks v. Cedlair Corp., </em>287 Md. 595, 597-598, 415 A.2d 255 (1980).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-4\">Sections 1 and 1A of Article XI-A empower Baltimore City and the counties of Maryland to adopt a charter form of local government. Section 2 directs the General Assembly to provide a grant of express powers for charter home rule counties. The General Assembly followed that directive and enacted the Express Powers Act by Ch. 456 of the Laws of Maryland of 1918, codified as Code (1957, 1987 RepLVol.), Art. 25A. Section 3 of Article XI-A provides (emphasis supplied):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">\u201cFrom and after the adoption of a charter by the City of Baltimore, or any County of this State, as hereinbefore provided, the Mayor of Baltimore and City Council of the City of Baltimore or the County Council of said County, subject to the Constitution and Public General Laws of this State, shall have full power to enact <em>local laws </em>of said city or county ... upon all matters covered by the express powers granted as above provided.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">Article XI-A \u201cdoes not constitute a grant of absolute autonomy to local governments.\u201d <em>Ritchmount Partnership v. Board, </em>283 Md. 48, 56, 388 A.2d 523, 529 (1978). This Court\u2019s decisions and the above-quoted passage make it clear that the Home Rule Amendment limits the ... County Council to enacting \u201clocal laws\u201d on matters covered by the Express Powers Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Local laws, in this respect, refer to any laws that \u201capply to all persons within the territorial limits prescribed by the Act.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number><em>Prince George\u2019s County v. B &amp; O. R.R. Co., </em>113 Md. 179, 186, 77 A. 433, 435 (1910) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">The rub of the present case involves whether Bill 85-11 pertaining to Jones is really a \u201clocal law\u201d or a \u201cspecial law.\u201d Special laws \u201crelate[] to particular persons or things of a class, as distinguished from a general law which applies to all persons or things of a class,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 183, 77 A. at 434, and are enacted \u201cfor the relief of particular named parties, or providing for individual cases.\u201d <em>Montague v. State, </em>54 Md. 481, 490 (1880).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Bill 85-11 expressly applies only to Jones and so by its very terms is a special law. Although the Circuit Court determined that the County Council exercised its police power, to transform a law that applied only to Jones into a local law, which applies to all people in Anne Arundel County, the Bill remained a special law by virtue of its lack of breadth, and the exercise of the County Council\u2019s police authority does not expand its scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">The enactment of a special law is prohibited \u201cfor any case, for which provision has been made, by an existing General Law.\u201d Maryland Constitution Article 3, Section 33. If the General Assembly cannot enact a special law when a general law applies, then under the Express Powers Act, Anne Arundel County cannot be empowered to enact a special law where an applicable local law exists. Section 202(c) affected residency qualifications of councilmembers at the time Bill 85-11 was enacted. The County Council, therefore, lacked the authority under Section 5(S) Express Powers Act to enact Bill 85-11 to remove Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Turning now to the centerpiece of the present controversy, members of the Anne Arundel County Council are required under Section 201(a) to reside in the councilmanic district that they represent, for six months prior to the election until the end of the term of office:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-8\">(a) Residence Requirement. There shall be a County Council of Anne Arundel County composed of seven mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>bers, each one of whom, at the time of his election and for six months immediately prior thereto and during his full term of office, shall reside in a different one of the seven councilmanic districts described in Section 206 of this Article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">A second residency requirement, a qualification to run for office in' Section 202(a), requires that each councilmember shall have resided in the County for at least one year immediately before the election:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-5\">(a) In General. In addition to the requirement of residence as provided in Section 201(a) of this Article, each member of the County Council shall be a qualified voter of the County and not less than twenty-five years of age at the time of his election and shall have resided within the County for a period of one year immediately preceding this election.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASk\">Section 202(c), which provides the fodder for the present case, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">(c) Change of Residence. If any member of the County Council during his term of office shall move his residence from the councilmanic district in which he resided at the time of his election, his office shall be forthwith vacated; but no member of the County Council shall be required to vacate his office by reason of any change in the boundary lines of his councilmanic district made during his term.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">The Circuit Court concluded that \u201cresidence\u201d in Section 202(c) meant a place of abode, as differentiated from domicile. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">For over one hundred years, we consistently have equated \u201cresidence\u201d to domicile in constitutional, statutory, and charter provisions, unless a contrary intent be shown:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-9\">\u201cFrom <em>Thomas v.

We have interpreted domicile as the norm in myriad and varied circumstances, including voting, <em>Howard v.

In <em>Boer v. University Specialty Hospital, </em>421 Md. 529, 27 A.3d 175 (2011), for example, we were asked to interpret \u201cresidence\u201d in Section 8-104(c) of the Estates and Trusts Article, Maryland Code (1974, 2011 Repl.Vol.),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which permits a creditor to file a claim, prior to the appointment of a personal representative, in the county of (1) the decedent\u2019s domicile, (2) the decedent\u2019s residence on the date of his or her death, or (3) the location of the decedent\u2019s real property or leasehold interest. We determined that residence could not mean domicile because domicile already had been referenced in another part of the statute as an alternative. <em>Id. </em>at 537, 27 A.3d at 180.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">In <em>Cathey v.

We interpreted the fact that the child was not a domiciliary of Maryland as not dispositive, because the regulation clearly contemplated out-of-state individuals for the remedial purpose of \u201cprotect[ing] individuals with developmental disability <em>in this State.\u201d Id. </em>at 607, 31 A.3d at 100 (emphasis in original), quoting Maryland Code (1982, 2009 Repl.Vol.), Section 7-102 of the Health-General Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">In <em>Best Drywall, Inc. v.

The homeowners in that case did not owe the general contractor any payments, but the subcontractor, who had not been paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>for labor and materials, argued that a mechanic\u2019s hen could apply to the vacation home because it was secondary to the domicile owned in New Jersey. 108 Md.App. at 884, 672 A.2d at 118. The intermediate appellate court explained that Section 9\u2014104(f)(3) of the Real Property Article was protective of homeowners by \u201cshift[ing] responsibility for insuring payment of a subcontractor from the owner of the dwelling to the prime contractor, <em>ie., </em>to limit the subcontractor\u2019s ability to hen the single family residence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 394, 672 A.2d at 123. This general protective purpose for the homeowner lead the court to construe the term \u201cresidence\u201d to include a non-domiciliary home. <em>Id. </em>at 395, 672 A.2d at 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The County and County Council seek succor in this regard from the legislative history of Section 202(c). In 1963, the Proposed Anne Arundel County Charter was drafted by the Anne Arundel County Charter Board (\u201cCharter Board\u201d) and released to the public for consideration, along with Notes of the Reporter and Counsel to the Charter Board. Bennett Crain, Jr., Reporter and Counsel to the Anne Arundel County Charter Board, Notes to the Proposed Home Rule Charter of Anne Arundel County (1963). The Reporter\u2019s Note comments that Section 202(c) \u201crequires that each councilmanic district shall be represented in the Council by a member who actually resides therein during his full term.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 73. \u201cActually resides,\u201d the County Council contends, demonstrates an intent to require the councilmember\u2019s physical presence in his or her district and, thus, \u201cresidence\u201d should be construed as a place of abode, not domicile.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The interpretation of the Reporter\u2019s Note must be construed in the context of the larger framework of the Charter Board\u2019s wholesale review of residency requirements for councilmembers. The residency requirements review was of extant provisions that included Sections 2-14 and 2-15 of the Anne Arundel County Code (1957), which provided the qualifications for county commissioners, then the governing body of the County. <em>See id. </em>at 72. The phrase \u201cactually resided\u201d appeared in Section 2-14, which required that a person must have \u201cactually resided\u201d in the County for at least 10 years:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>A person to be eligible to the office of county commissioner shall have actually resided in the county for at least ten years[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Section 2-15 provided that candidates for the office of county commissioner be selected in district primary elections; to run in the primary, an individual had to be a resident of that district at the time of the primary election,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but there was no residency requirement during the county commissioner\u2019s term of office.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">When the Anne Arundel County Charter was drafted in 1963 and adopted in 1964, district residence, as a qualification of office, was provided in Section 201(a): \u201cThere shall be a County Council of Anne Arundel County composed of seven members, each of whom, at the time of his election and for two years immediately prior thereto and during his full term of office, shall reside in a different one of the seven councilmanic districts.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Section 202(a) provided the qualifications to run for office: \u201cIn addition to the requirement of residence as provided in Section 201(a) of this Article, each member of the County Council ... shall have resided within the County for a period of four years immediately preceding this election.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Section 202(c) and these related provisions of the Anne Arundel County Charter extended the residency qualification from candidacy to incumbency. The purpose of this district residence requirement was clearly representational, a \u201cguarantee\u201d that the Charter Board understood as absent from the earlier electoral scheme. Anne Arundel County Charter Board, Report to the Voters of Anne Arundel County, at xvi (1963). District residence, the Charter Board explained, would \u201cgive the voters of the County the maximum degree of district representation possible [and] insure representation on the Council for each section of the County, with its unique problems and interests.... The <em>guarantee </em>of district representation does not exist under the present form of government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). Thus, the Reporter\u2019s Note to Section 202(c), in commenting that the council member \u201cactually reside[ ]\u201d in the district \u201cduring his full term,\u201d is a reference to the previous County Code\u2019s requirement that a candidate \u201chave actually resided\u201d in the County prior to the election. \u201c[A]ctually resides\u201d does not, therefore, refer to \u201cplace of abode.\u201d Neither the express language of Section 202(c), nor its legislative purpose, thus, demonstrates any intent to vary the jurisprudential norm that the term residence is domicile.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">The County and County Council, though, state that our holding in <em>Gallagher v. Board of Elections, </em>219 Md. 192, 203, 148 A.2d 390, 396 (1959), warrants a different conclusion. Gallagher involved the eligibility of Governor Theodore R. McKeldin to run for mayor of Baltimore City after having lived in Annapolis during his tenure in office. Section 7 of the Baltimore City Charter required that a candidate for mayor must be a resident of Baltimore City for ten years immediately prior to the election. The allegation was that Governor McKeldin did not meet the residency requirement of Section 7, because he had been residing in Annapolis during his eight years in office and thereby had moved his domicile to Annapo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>lis, pursuant to Section 21 of Article II of the Maryland Constitution, which requires that the Governor \u201cshall reside at the seat of government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">We interpreted \u201creside\u201d under Section 21 of Article II to mean \u201ctemporary actual place of abode,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 205, 148 A.2d at 397, based upon the fact that the Governor was compelled to live in Annapolis during his tenure. We further noted that this conclusion was consistent with \u201cthe myriad of cases which hold that a change in residence or abode to enable a person to perform the duties and functions of a civil office not of life tenure, whether elective or appointive, does not, of itself, constitute a change of domicile,\u201d and not contravened by constitutional debates and proceedings, which we noted as indicating a desire for the Governor to \u201cbe available at all reasonable times in Annapolis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 203, 148 A.2d at 396. We, then, concluded that the residency requirement in Section 7 of the Baltimore City Charter referred to domicile, in line with our longstanding jurisprudence and consistent with the purpose of the Charter provision, to ensure that a candidate \u201creasonably be expected to be familiar with the business and government thereof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 207, 148 A.2d at 399. We determined that Governor McKeldin had not removed his domicile to Annapolis during his tenure in office and was eligible to run for mayor of Baltimore City, because he continually owned a home in Baltimore City and intended to return there after his governorship.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Accordingly, we hold that \u201cresidence\u201d means domicile under Section 202(c). Therefore, Jones did not move his residence to the correctional facility in South Carolina, because, as the Circuit Court concluded, it is undisputed that his domicile remained in the First Councilmanic District.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">The final issue before us pertains to whether Jones is barred from bringing an action challenging the County Council\u2019s determination that he vacated his seat by the clean hands doctrine, which is a \u201cdoctrine ... intended to protect the courts from having to endorse or reward inequitable conduct.\u201d <em>Adams v. Manown, </em>328 Md. 463, 475, 615 A.2d 611, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>616 (1992) (citations omitted). \u201cIt is only when the plaintiffs improper conduct is the source, or part of the source, of his equitable claim, that he is to be barred because of this conduct. \u2018What is material is not that the plaintiffs hands are dirty, but that he dirties them in acquiring the right he now asserts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 463, 476, 615 A.2d at 617, quoting D. Dobbs, Remedies \u00a7 2.4, at 46 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Jones\u2019s \u201cimproper conduct,\u201d as alleged by the County Council, relates to concealing from voters during the 2010 election that he knew that he was being investigated for having failed to file one or more federal income tax returns. Jones\u2019s claim of having been improperly ousted is derived from the County Council\u2019s interpretation of the residency requirement in Section 202(c) of the Anne Arundel County Charter. Ergo, the allegations of failure to disclose are not the source of the claim that Jones was unlawfully removed from office.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Our consideration of the County Council\u2019s clean hands defense is appropriate, although the dissent challenges the sufficiency of the factual findings. The Circuit Court found that the County Council removed Jones as a result of Bill 85-11, under which a vacancy was declared because of Jones\u2019s incarceration in South Carolina, while the basis of the clean hands defense, articulated by the County Council in its Amended Response to Jones\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, was that Jones \u201cwithheld information about his criminal behavior and pending plea agreement with the United States Attorney\u201d from the voters of the First Councilmanic District of Anne Arundel County prior to the 2010 election. The juxtaposition of the purpose of Bill 85-11 with the County Council\u2019s assertion in its response to the motion for summary judgment regarding the basis for its clean hands affirmative defense establishes that Jones\u2019s claim is not negated by the County\u2019s allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">In conclusion, we hold that the Anne Arundel County Council did not have the authority, under the Express Powers Act, to remove Jones from his seat as elected councilmember for the First Councilmanic District, and that Jones did not \u201cmove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>his residence\u201d under Section 202(c) because his domicile remained in that district. Finally, Jones\u2019s claim is not barred by the clean hands doctrine.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY REVERSED.

Op. at 404, 69 A.3d at 436-37. As a result, it is more than happy to accept Jones\u2019s \u201cdefault\u201d position \u2014 that this Court must assume that his \u201cresidence\u201d refers to his \u201cdomicile.\u201d The Majority brushes aside arguments that it should examine the context of the Charter, ignoring direct evidence that the drafters intended that, within Section 202(c), the term \u201cresidence\u201d would mean \u201cactual residence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">The Meaning of \u201cResidence\u201d Depends on Context</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines the word \u201cresidence\u201d as \u201c[t]he place where one actually lives, as distinguished from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>domicile.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1423 (Bryan A. Garner et al. eds., 9th ed.2009). It goes on to explain that, <em>\u201cResidence </em>usu[ally] just means bodily presence as an inhabitant in a given place; <em>domicile </em>usu[ally] requires bodily presence plus an intention to make the place one\u2019s home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Majority and countless judicial opinions state, however, that \u201cresidence\u201d means \u201cdomicile,\u201d \u201cunless a contrary intent be shown.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Bainum v. Kalen, </em>272 Md. 490, 496, 325 A.2d 392, 396 (1974). Indeed, as the Majority points out, we have stated in an earlier case that \u201c[f]rom <em>Thomas v. Warner, </em>83 Md. 14, 20, 34 A. 830 (1896), and <em>Howard v. Skinner, </em>87 Md. 556, 559, 40 A. 379 (1898), until the present, this Court has consistently held that the words \u2018reside\u2019 or \u2018resident\u2019 in a constitutional provision or statute delineating rights, duties, obligations, privileges, etc., would be construed to mean \u2018domicile\u2019 unless a contrary intent be shown.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Upon a closer look at the cases that equated \u201cresidence\u201d with \u201cdomicile,\u201d however, it becomes clear that \u2014 although in those cases the specific circumstances may have justified that broad statement as applied to that particular set of facts\u2014 those cases did not purport to command a firmly fixed rule for all future cases involving the term \u201cresidence.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For instance, in <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Howard, </em>the Court discussed \u201cresidence\u201d in the context of voter registration only. 83 Md. at 18-21, 34 A. at 830-31, 87 Md. at 559, 40 A. at 380-81. And, in <em>Bainum, </em>we held that the term \u201creside\u201d meant \u201cdomiciled,\u201d only as used in Article III, Section 9 of the Maryland Constitution, which established eligibility to run for a seat in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>General Assembly. 272 Md. at 496, 325 A.2d at 395-96; <em>see also Blount v. Boston, </em>351 Md. 360, 366, 718 A.2d 1111, 1114 (1998) (qualification while serving as a member of General Assembly); <em>Dorf v. Skolnik, 280 </em>Md. 101, 116, 371 A.2d 1094, 1102 (1977) (eligibility for office of delegate in the General Assembly); <em>Hawks v. Gottschall, </em>241 Md. 147, 149, 215 A.2d 745, 746 (1966) (eligibility to file a claim against the former Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund); <em>Rasin v. Leaverton, </em>181 Md. 91, 92-94, 28 A.2d 612, 613-14 (1942) (eligibility to run for office of State\u2019s attorney); <em>Shenton v.

In all those cases, we arrived at the conclusion that \u201cresidence\u201d meant \u201cdomicile\u201d only after considering the context in which the word \u201cresidence\u201d was used.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">Our opinion in <em>Gallagher v. Board of Elections </em>provides an excellent illustration of the importance of context in interpreting the words \u201creside\u201d and \u201cresidence.\u201d 219 Md. 192, 202, 148 A.2d 390, 395 (1959). That case offers an interesting interplay between two residence provisions: (1) contained within the Baltimore City Charter, and (2) found in Article II, Section 21 of the Maryland Constitution. The Baltimore City Charter provision required that a candidate for the mayor \u201creside\u201d in Baltimore City within the ten-year period preceding the election. <em>Id. </em>at 196, 148 A.2d at 392. In turn, Article II, Section 21 of the Maryland Constitution requires the Governor to \u201creside at the seat of government\u201d in Annapolis. <em>Id. </em>at 201, 148 A.2d at 395 (quotation marks omitted) (quoting Md. Const. art. II, \u00a7 21). The meaning of these two provisions clashed when former Governor Theodore R. McKeldin registered to run for the mayor of Baltimore City, and his certificate of candidacy was challenged because, for some time during the ten-year period preceding the election, he lived in Annapolis. <em>Id. </em>at 196-97, 201, 148 A.2d at 392, 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">Confronted with these two provisions, we acknowledged that the words \u201creside\u201d and \u201cresidence\u201d are \u201csusceptible of different meanings\u201d and called them \u201clegal legerdemains of no small <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>importance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 202, 148 A.2d at 395 (citation and quotation marks omitted). That is so because the words \u201creside\u201d and \u201cresidence\u201d are often \u201cused to signify different things\u201d and are known to \u201cbear different shades of meaning according to the context.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and quotation marks omitted). Thus, we stated, the term \u201cresidence\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-4\">may mean something more than domicil: a domicil, namely, at which the party actually dwells. On the other hand, it may mean something less than domicil: a dwelling-place adopted for the time being, but without such an intention of permanent abode as to create a domicil there.... As used in a statute, the word may mean a domicil; or it may mean a dwelling-place, which lacks the legal requirements of domicil.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-5\"><em>Id. </em>(citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">Accordingly, in interpreting the meaning of the words \u201creside\u201d in the Baltimore City Charter and Article II of the Constitution, we emphasized the importance of \u201cthe context and the purpose of the [instruments] in which they are found.\u201d <em>Id., </em>148 A.2d at 396. Guided by the purpose of the charter provision, we rejected the appellants\u2019 view that, as used in the Baltimore City Charter, \u201cthe word \u2018resident\u2019 ... means a resident in fact and in actuality as distinguished from one\u2019s domicile.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 205, 148 A.2d at 397. We observed that \u201cthe framers of the Charter intended to set up ... a qualification for any candidate for Mayor a requirement that would reasonably assure the electorate that a candidate for such office would be familiar with the business and governmental affairs of the City.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 205-06, 148 A.2d at 397-98. But, if \u201can actual and physical residence for the ten consecutive years prior to an election were intended, there would be few who would be eligible to seek the office.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 207, 148 A.2d at 399. Thus, we concluded that \u201cthe framers of the Charter intended the residence required by Section 7 to be the equivalent of a \u2018present, fixed domicile,\u2019 \u201d not actual residence or place of abode. <em>Id., </em>148 A.2d at 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>We reached the opposite conclusion in \u201cthe context and the purpose of\u2019 Article II, Section 21, and we held that there the term \u201creside\u201d meant \u201cthe governor\u2019s temporary actual place of abode during his incumbency in that office.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 205, 148 A.2d at 397. We reasoned that \u201c[b]y requiring the Governor to live in Annapolis during his term of office, the framers of the Constitution were merely seeking to insure that the Chief Executive would be available at all reasonable times in Annapolis, and to prevent the establishment of a <em>de facto </em>seat of government in the governor\u2019s \u2018home town.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 203, 148 A.2d at 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">\u201cActual residence,\u201d as opposed to domicile, was also at issue in <em>Boer v. University Specialty Hospital, </em>where we examined the word \u201creside\u201d in Section 8-104(c) of the Estates and Trusts Article. 421 Md. 529, 531, 27 A.3d 175, 176 (2011). That statute permitted a creditor to file a claim with the register of wills in a county: (1) where the decedent was domiciled, (2) where the decedent \u201cresided\u201d at the time of his death, or (3) where the decedent\u2019s real property or a leasehold interest in real property was located. <em>Id. </em>We held that, under the plain meaning of the statute, \u201cresidence\u201d was to be read to retain its meaning as a place where the decedent \u201cactually live[d],\u201d distinct from the word \u201cdomicile.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 538, 27 A.3d at 180 (alterations in original). Thus, although the decedent\u2019s domicile was at her home in Catonsville in Baltimore County, for the purposes of Section 8-104(c), at the time of her death she \u201cresided\u201d at the University Specialty Hospital in Baltimore City. <em>Id. </em>at 538, 540, 27 A.3d at 180, 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Likewise, in <em>Cathey v. Board of Review, Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, </em>we held that under the applicable provision of the Code of Maryland Regulations (\u201cCO-MAR\u201d), \u201cresidence\u201d was not synonymous with \u201cdomicile.\u201d 422 Md. 597, 600, 31 A.3d 94, 95 (2011). The regulation in question provided that, in order to be eligible for Developmental Disability Administration services, an individual must be a \u201cresident of Maryland.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 601, 31 A.3d at 96. Petitioner, who lived with her mother in New Jersey for two weeks a month and with her father in Maryland for the remaining two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>weeks a month, was denied services on the residence grounds. <em>Id. </em>at 599, 602, 31 A.3d at 95, 97. When the Petitioner appealed, the Administrative Law Judge equated the term \u201cresidence\u201d with \u201cdomicile,\u201d which finding was adopted by the Secretary and affirmed by the Board of Review. <em>Id. </em>at 602-03, 31 A.3d at 97. We reviewed the purpose of the underlying statute, however, and reached a different conclusion, finding it \u201cinappropriate to use the restrictive domicile analysis to determine \u2018residence\u2019 under COMAR 10.22.12.03.B(27).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 609, 31 A.3d at 101. Rather, we held that \u201c[a] better way to \u2018advance the remedy\u2019 here is to use a concept previously explained by this Court, defining \u2018residence\u2019 as the place where one \u2018actually lives.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Boer, </em>421 Md. at 537, 540, 27 A.3d at 180, 182).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Our intermediate appellate court followed the same context-based approach in <em>Best Drywall, Inc. v. Berry, </em>108 Md.App. 381, 672 A.2d 116 (1996). In that case, the word \u201cresidence\u201d appeared in Section 9-104(f)(3) of the Real Property Article of the Maryland Annotated Code, which prohibited placement of mechanic\u2019s liens on \u201ca single family dwelling being erected on the land of the owner for his own residence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 383, 672 A.2d at 117 (quotation marks omitted). The owners in that case were residents of New Jersey but planned to use a home in Ocean Pines, Maryland as their vacation home. <em>Id. </em>at 383-84, 672 A.2d at 117-18. Relying on the legislative intent, the Court refused to treat the word \u201cresidence\u201d as synonymous with \u201cdomicile\u201d in that context, stating \u201cthat the legislature\u2019s intent in using the word \u2018residence\u2019 in \u00a7 9-104(f)(3) of the mechanic\u2019s lien law was contrary to equating it with the term \u2018domicile.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 393, 672 A.2d at 122. The Court of Special Appeals reasoned that \u201c\u00a7 9-104(f)(3) clearly has as its purpose an intent to shift responsibility for insuring payment of a subcontractor from the owner of the dwelling to the prime contractor, <em>ie., </em>to limit the subcontractor\u2019s ability to lien the single family residence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 394, 672 A.2d at 123. The Court added: \u201chad the legislature intended to distinguish between a primary and a secondary residence in parsing out the protection afforded by the statutory limitation on a sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>contractor\u2019s ability to lien a single family dwelling, it would have explicitly done so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 395, 672 A.2d at 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The divergent views in these cases, equating the words \u201cresidence\u201d and \u201cdomicile,\u201d on the one hand, and distinguishing them, on the other, demonstrate that there is no \u201cdefault\u201d position with respect to the meaning of the words \u201creside\u201d or \u201cresidence.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, to decipher the correct meaning of these words, \u201cthey must be construed in accordance with the context and the purpose of the constitution, charter, statute or instrument in which they are found.\u201d <em>Gallagher, </em>219 Md. at 202, 148 A.2d at 396. Therefore, in this case, in order to determine what the word \u201cresidence\u201d means in Section 202(c) of the Anne Arundel County Charter, this Court should have examined the context and the purpose of that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The Context and Purpose of Section 202(c)</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">An examination of Section 202(c) and its legislative history shows there is direct evidence that the drafters of the Charter intended the term \u201cresidence\u201d in Section 202(c) to mean \u201cactual residence\u201d \u2014 evidence which the Majority fails to sufficiently explain away.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">The history of the Anne Arundel County Charter is well-documented. As the needs of the county grew, several members of the House of Delegates encouraged citizens to form a \u201ccommittee to petition for a charter form of government.\u201d Bennett Crain, <em>Government Under the Charter, </em>in Anne Arundel County: A Bicentennial History 1649-1977, 216 (James C. Bradford ed., 1977). That effort was successful: a committee was formed, and a charter board, \u201cwhose duty would be to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>prepare a county charter,\u201d was elected during the 1962 general election. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The Charter Board consisted of five members and had a Reporter and Legal Counsel. <em>Id.; see also Report to the Voters of Anne Arundel County, in </em>Proposed Charter for Anne Arundel County, Maryland xiii (1963). The Board met regularly over a six-month period, in the end producing a proposed charter. Crain, <em>Government Under the Charter, </em>at 216; <em>see generally Charter of Anne Arundel County Maryland, in </em>Proposed Charter for Anne Arundel County, Maryland (1963). Section 202(c) was part of this original Charter and was ratified by the voters in 1964. <em>See Charter of Anne Arundel County Maryland </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">When the proposed Charter was released to the public for consideration, it was accompanied by a Report prepared by the Board and Reporter\u2019s and Counsel\u2019s Notes. The Report provided \u201can outline of some of the major provisions of the Charter and ... some of the views formulated by the Charter Board during the course of its studies.\u201d <em>Report to the Voters of Anne Arundel County, </em>at xiii-xiv. The Notes represented the Reporter and Counsel\u2019s \u201ccomment upon each section of the Charter, many of them actually written contemporaneously with the discussion of each section leading to the Charter as finally presented.\u201d Bennett Crain, <em>Notes to the Proposed Home Rule Charter of Anne Arundel County, in </em>Proposed Charter for Anne Arundel County, Maryland 69 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Both the Report and the Notes mentioned the words \u201creside\u201d and \u201cresidence.\u201d With respect to a councilman\u2019s residence, the Report explained: \u201cThe proposed Charter establishes a seven member legislative body, each of whom must reside in a separate councilmanic district of the County, and each of whom is elected by all the voters of the County.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number><em>Report to the Voters of Anne Arundel County, </em>at xv. The Notes elaborated on this residence requirement, stating that the \u201cBoard believes that the members of the Council should be both nominated and elected County-wide with the safeguard providing that each area of the County shall be guaranteed a representative residing in that area.\u201d Crain, <em>Notes to the Proposed Home Rule Charter, </em>at 72. In expanding upon the term \u201cresidence\u201d as specifically used in Section 202(c) \u2014 the exact provision we are interpreting in this case \u2014 the Notes explained: \u201cThis section requires that each councilmanic district shall be represented in the Council by a member who actually resides therein during his full term.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 73 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Thus, the legislative history provides us with the exact meaning of the word \u201cresidence\u201d as it is used in Section 202(c). The meaning of the phrase \u201cactually resides\u201d is clear. The American Heritage Dictionary defines the word \u201cactually\u201d as \u201c[i]n fact; in reality.\u201d <em>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language </em>18 (4th ed.2006). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines the word \u201cactual\u201d as \u201c[ejxisting in fact; real,\u201d and contrasts it to the word \u201cconstructive,\u201d which means \u201cIllegally imputed; existing by virtue of legal fiction though not necessarily in fact.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>at 40, 356. Thus, there is only one way to read the phrase \u201cactually resides\u201d\u2014 the councilmember must in fact live in the councilmanic district he represents, not that he may live elsewhere but have the intent to return at some point in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">The Majority, however, gives short shrift to this Reporter\u2019s Note. Rather, it attempts to explain away the Note\u2019s express requirement of \u201cactually\u201d residing in the councilmanic district by announcing that the Note was merely referring to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>language used in the pre-Charter 1957 Anne Arundel County Code. Specifically, the Majority focuses on Sections 2-14 and 2-15 in the 1957 Code, which concerned qualifications for running for office. Maj. Op. at 408-09, 69 A.3d at 439-40. Section 2-14 provided that, before a person could run for County Commissioner, he \u201cshall have actually resided in the county for at least ten years.\u201d Under Section 2-15, in primary elections, candidates for County Commissioner could be placed only on the ballot of their local district.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">The Majority compares these two sections to Section 201(a) in the 1964 Charter, which refers to a councilmember\u2019s residence in the councilmanic district not only \u201cat the time of his election and for two years immediately prior thereto,\u201d but also \u201cduring his full term of office.\u201d Based on this additional qualification in Section 201(a), the Majority maintains that \u201cSection 202(c) and these related provisions of the Anne Arundel County Charter extended the residency qualification from candidacy to incumbency.\u201d Maj. Op. at 410, 69 A.3d at 440 (emphasis added). For reasons unclear to me, the Majority apparently believes this establishes that the \u201cactually reside\u201d language in the Reporter\u2019s Note \u201cis a reference to the previous County Code\u2019s requirement that a candidate \u2018have actually resided\u2019 in the County prior to the election.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 410, 69 A.3d at 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">This reasoning defies logic. It makes no sense that the Note \u2014 written in 1963, designed to accompany a specific section of the new Charter to be presented to the voters, and with the purpose of explaining the new provisions of the Charter \u2014 would somehow be translated as describing the old 1957 Code, which was about to be extinct, and which it never even mentions. Also, by its own language, the Note cannot be discussing the 1957 Code because the Note speaks of a councilmember actually residing in the district \u201cduring his full term.\u201d Crain, <em>Notes to the Proposed Home Rule Charter, </em>at 73 (emphasis added). As the Majority admits, under the 1957 Code, \u201cthere was no residency requirement during the county commissioner\u2019s term of office.\u201d Maj. Op. at 409, 69 A.3d at 439-40. The only residency requirement in the 1957 Code pertained to a candidate\u2019s residency prior to the elec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>tion. The residency requirement during the full term was introduced \u2014 for the first time \u2014 in the Charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Moreover, the Majority\u2019s entire effort to find the meaning of Section 202(c) within the old 1957 Code is misguided. The Majority acknowledges that the change from the 1957 Code to the 1964 Charter was a \u201cwholesale review,\u201d but even this is an understatement. In drafting the Charter, the drafters did not revise the 1957 Code; they created a completely new form of government. Thus, the Majority\u2019s attempts to neatly line up Sections 2-14 and 2-15 of the old Code with Sections 201 and 202 of the new Charter are unconvincing. Section 202(c) is a brand new provision, which appeared for the first time in the new 1964 Charter. There is simply no section of the old 1957 Code to compare it to.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Just as unconvincing is the Majority\u2019s rejection of the \u201cactually reside\u201d language in the Note, utilizing a statement by the Charter Board that referred to the 1957 Code in a completely different context. Namely, the Majority relies on the Report to the Voters of Anne Arundel County, in which the Charter Board, referring to the 1957 Code, explained that \u201c[t]he <em>guarantee </em>of district representation does not exist under the present form of government.\u201d Maj. Op. at 410, 69 A.3d at 440 (bold emphasis added) (citation and quotation marks omitted). Based solely on this statement, the Majority decides that the Reporter\u2019s Note to Section 202(c) \u2014 which is contained in an entirely different document \u2014 must also be referring to the old 1957 Code. This conclusion is unfounded.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>The Majority is left with a vast logical leap \u2014 between its reliance on the old Code and its attempt to explain away the Reporter\u2019s Note to Section 202(c) \u2014 which it is unable to traverse. The answer to the question before this Court lies not in the 1957 Code, but in the documents explaining the thoughts of the drafters of the Charter when Section 202(c) was first created \u2014 specifically, the Reporter\u2019s and Counsel\u2019s Notes.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">As explained above, these notes were \u201cwritten contemporaneously with the discussion of each section leading to the Charter\u201d and \u201cattempt to clarify the purpose and scope of each section.\u201d Crain, <em>Notes to the Proposed Home Rule Charter, </em>at 69. The Notes were \u201cmeant to serve as a running commentary on the thoughts and conclusions of the men who were elected to study and revise the County government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70. The Reporter and Counsel envisioned that \u201c[t]he notes may also, in appropriate cases, serve an additional useful purpose to the Bench and the Bar in interpreting the Charter itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Reporter\u2019s Note accompanying Section 202(c) specifically provides \u201cthat each councilmanic district shall be represented in the Council by a member who actually resides therein during his full term.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 73 (emphasis added). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>The Majority, as I have explained, has no valid rebuff to this Reporter\u2019s Note.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">In this case, we were tasked with discovering the legislative intent behind the words \u201cmove his residence,\u201d as used in Section 202(c). In this effort, we could not have asked for a more clear pronouncement of the meaning of the word \u201cresidence\u201d than a statement in the Reporter and Counsel\u2019s Notes, and particularly the specific Note accompanying Section 202(c) itself, that \u201cresidence\u201d means \u201cactually resides.\u201d Thus, I would agree with the Council\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cresidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The Council\u2019s Application of the Term to Jones\u2019s Situation</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">While this Court indeed owes no deference to the Council\u2019s interpretation of the word \u201cresidence,\u201d <em>see Talbot Cnty. v. Miles Point Prop., LLC, </em>415 Md. 372, 384, 2 A.3d 344, 351 (2010), the Council\u2019s application of that interpretation to Jones was a \u201cmixed question of law and fact,\u201d <em>Charles Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. v. Vann, </em>382 Md. 286, 296, 855 A.2d 313, 319 (2004), subject to review for substantial evidence, <em>Montgomery Cnty. v. Butler, </em>417 Md. 271, 284-85, 9 A.3d 824, 832 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">The substantial evidence standard of review \u201ccalls both for appellate deference and for appellate discipline. It matters not whether we think the circumstances constituted [a particular finding], so long as there was some substantial basis\u201d supporting it. <em>See Tochterman v. Balt. Cnty., </em>163 Md.App. 385, 406, 880 A.2d 1118, 1130 (2005). \u201cIf such substantial evidence exists, even if we would not have reached the same conclusions ... based on all of the evidence, we must affirm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 409, 880 A.2d at 1132 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">Applying this deferential test, I would hold that, when Jones did not step foot in the First Councilmanic District (or Anne Arundel County for that matter) for five months, the Council had substantial evidence before it to conclude that Jones\u2019s \u201cactual residence\u201d was not in the First Councilmanic District during that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Clean Hands Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">I would affirm the Circuit Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the Council and thereby would not reach the Council\u2019s defense of unclean hands. Yet, given the Majority\u2019s cursory rejection of the Council\u2019s \u201cclean hands\u201d argument, I am moved to address this topic.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The Majority is certainly correct in stating that the doctrine of unclean hands will only bar a plaintiff from recovering \u201cwhen the plaintiffs improper conduct is the source, or part of the source, of his equitable claim.\u201d Maj. Op. at 412, 69 A.3d at 441 (citation and quotation marks omitted). What the Majority fails to acknowledge, however, is that \u201c[t]he clean hands doctrine is one resting in the sound discretion of the court.\u201d <em>Space Aero Products Co. v. R.E. Darling Co., </em>238 Md. 93, 120, 208 A.2d 74, 88 (1965). Courts are not required to apply this doctrine, but rather have discretion to do so to ensure that they do not \u201cendorse or reward inequitable conduct.\u201d <em>Adams v. Manown, </em>328 Md. 463, 475, 615 A.2d 611, 616 (1992). Therefore, this Court must review a trial court\u2019s decision of whether to apply the clean hands defense under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Space Aero Products, </em>238 Md. at 120, 208 A.2d at 88; <em>Hicks v. Gilbert, </em>135 Md.App. 394, 401, 762 A.2d 986, 990 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">In this case, the Circuit Court granted summary judgment for the Council based on its holding that Jones had moved his residence. As a result, the court made no findings as to whether it should apply the doctrine of clean hands, whether Jones\u2019s conduct was \u201cfraudulent, illegal, or inequitable,\u201d or whether there was a sufficient nexus between Jones\u2019s alleged improper conduct and the relief he seeks in this case. <em>See Hlista v. Altevogt, </em>239 Md. 43, 48, 210 A.2d 153, 156 (1965). Without these findings, we have nothing to review for abuse of discretion. The Majority, however, reached the merits of this issue, holding that \u2014 regardless of any facts which the trial court could find on remand \u2014 it would be an abuse of discretion for the trial court to apply the doctrine of clean hands in this case. Not only is such a holding inappropriate without the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>trial court\u2019s first deciding the issue, but it is not supported by the facts. <em>See </em>Maj. Op. at 412, 69 A.3d at 441-42. I explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">The Majority holds that Jones\u2019s alleged improper conduct (failure to disclose his legal troubles to the electorate) is not related to this litigation because \u201cthe allegations of failure to disclose are not the source of the claim that Jones was unlawfully removed from office.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In so concluding, the Majority attempts to restrict Jones\u2019s claim to his \u201chaving been improperly ousted\u201d from the Council. <em>Id. </em>But Jones\u2019s \u201couster\u201d claim is nothing more than the vehicle by which Jones seeks to enforce his ultimate right to be on the Council, which he claims title to as the winner of the election for the First Councilmanic District seat. In this regard, the question is not necessarily limited to considering whether Jones dirtied his hands in being ousted from the Council. The Circuit Court may also consider whether Jones dirtied his hands in winning the councilman\u2019s seat, which he now claims to have a right to retain.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">In answering this question, the trial court could certainly find facts that link Jones\u2019s failure to disclose the investigation and his ongoing plea negotiations with the United States Attorney to his acquiring of the First Councilmanic District seat. For example, the Council argues before this Court that Jones (1) had been in negotiations about a plea bargain for a period of \u201csix to ten months\u201d prior to the November 2, 2010 election; (2) won the election by a relatively small margin of 914 votes; and (3) signed his plea agreement on November 8, 2010 \u2014 only six days after the election. If the trial court found these facts to be true, then it could find that Jones intended to withhold highly material facts from the public, and that he would not have won the election had he disclosed his criminal conduct. Under these facts, the trial court may conclude that Jones directly dirtied his hands in acquiring the First Council-manic District seat \u2014 the right he now seeks to keep. A further connection between Jones\u2019s unclean hands and the ouster is that the five-month absence from his district was a direct and foreseeable consequence of his criminal conduct that he withheld from the voters. Certainly, we cannot say at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>this stage \u2014 as the Majority inappropriately <em>does </em>\u2014 that <em>a </em>trial court would abuse its discretion in applying the clean hands doctrine to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">In its refusal to properly examine the context of Section 202(c), the Majority fails to apply its own test that depends on the absence of contrary intent. It ignores the Reporter\u2019s Note to Section 202(c), which specifically states that a council-member must \u201cactually reside\u201d in the district. Instead, the Majority creatively constructs its own contradictory legislative history by combining irrelevant provisions of the 1957 Code with irrelevant provisions of the 1964 Charter. Ultimately, the Majority cannot get around the fact that the Note expressly defines \u201cresidence\u201d within Section 202(c) as meaning \u201cactual residence.\u201d By ignoring this, the Majority has created a test, under which the term \u201cresidence\u201d will hereinafter always mean \u201cdomicile,\u201d regardless of what the context or contrary intent may show.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Properly defining the term \u201cresidence\u201d to mean \u201cactual residence\u201d under the circumstances, I would hold that the Council had sufficient supporting evidence before it to conclude that, when Jones began to serve his sentence in South Carolina, he no longer actually \u201cresided\u201d in the First Council-manic District within the meaning of Section 202(c). Thus, I would affirm the Circuit Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the Council and against Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Judge Harrell and Judge Barbera have authorized me to state they join in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b238-5\">.
