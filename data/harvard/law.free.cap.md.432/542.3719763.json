Petitioner charged Bell with violating various Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMLRPC\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or \u201cRule\u201d), specifically Rule 1.1 (Competence),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rule 1.15(a) (Safekeeping Property);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Rule 8.4(a) and (d) (Misconduct).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Petitioner also charged Bell with violating several Maryland Rules of Procedure (\u201cMaryland Rule\u201d or \u201cMd. Rule\u201d), including Maryland Rule 16-606.1(a)(l), (Attorney Trust Account Record-Keeping);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Maryland Rule 16-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>607(a) (Commingling of Funds);<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Maryland Rule 16-609(a)-(e) (Prohibited Transactions).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-752(a) (Order Designating Judge), this Court referred the matter to Judge DaNeeka L. Cotton of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County to conduct an evidentiary hearing and to render findings of fact and recommend conclusions of law pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-757.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">On November 1, 2012, Judge Cotton conducted an evidentiary hearing, during which Bell was represented by counsel, and thereafter the hearing judge issued \u201cFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law,\u201d in which she found that Bell\u2019s acts constituted violations of MLRPC 1.1, 1.15(a), 8.4(a) and 8.4(d), as well as Maryland Rules 16-606.1(a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3), 16-607(a), 16-609(a)-(c). In doing so, Judge Cotton stated the procedural history and made the following findings of fact:<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-5\">\n<em>Procedural History</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">This case arises from a Petition for Disciplinary Action filed against the Respondent, Jimmy Anthony Bell, in the Court of Appeals of Maryland on May 23, 2012. The Court of Appeals designated the undersigned judge of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County to hear the action. The Respondent was served with the Petition for Disciplinary or Remedial Action on July 11, 2012. On August 9, 2012, Petitioner filed a Motion for Order of Default against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Defendant for his failure to file an answer to the petition pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-754(a). On August 21, 2012, Respondent simultaneously filed an Answer to the Petition for Disciplinary Action and an Opposition to Petitioner\u2019s Motion for Default. On August 22, 2012, Petitioner withdrew its Motion for Order of Default. A hearing on this matter took place on November 1, 2012.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-4\">\n<em>Findings of Fact</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\">Respondent attended law school at American University, Washington College of Law, and earned his Juris Doctor in 1999. Respondent was admitted to the Maryland Bar on December 14, 1999. Respondent maintains a law office located in Fort Washington, Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\">On February 15, 2011, Respondent filed a lawsuit on behalf of Tracy Wiggs in the Circuit Court of Prince George\u2019s County. Respondent received a check from Tracy Wiggs in order to pay for the filing fees. However, Respondent wrote a check from his Bank of America IOLTA (hereafter the trust account) to pay for the filing fee before depositing the check received from Mr. Wiggs.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On February 16, 2011 Respondent disbursed trust account check number 1177 in the amount of $145.00 made payable to \u201cthe Clerk of Court.\u201d This disbursement caused Respondent\u2019s trust account balance to fall to -$143.62. Respondent intended to deposit the check he received from Mr. Wiggs into his trust account immediately, but became ill before he was able to do so. On February 18, 2011, Respondent made a $145.00 cash deposit into his trust account; restoring the overall account balance to $1.38. On February 18, 2011, Petitioner received notification from Bank of America that an overdraft had occurred on Respondent\u2019s attorney trust account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>In a certified letter dated March 4, 2011, Petitioner requested that Respondent provide an explanation for the trust account overdraft and provide \u201cclient ledgers, deposit slips, canceled checks, and monthly bank statements\u201d between November 2010 and March 4, 2011. Respondent failed to respond to Petitioner\u2019s March 4, 2011 letter, which led Petitioner to docket a complaint against Respondent. Petitioner sent a second letter to Respondent on April 12, 2011, requesting an explanation for the trust account overdraft and documentation regarding his trust account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-4\">On June 14, 2011, Respondent submitted a response to Petitioner explaining the events surrounding the overdraft of Respondent\u2019s trust account. In his letter to Petitioner, Respondent provided a copy of check number 1177, the check that caused the overdraft, but failed to produce any other requested documentation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">The Court notes that the investigation of Respondent\u2019s case was delayed due to the lack of financial records provided. Respondent waited four months to reply to Petitioner\u2019s initial letter. Consequently, Petitioner subpoenaed Respondent\u2019s bank records from Bank of America. Once Respondent finally provided client ledgers, they were unclear and appear hastily and haphazardly prepared. Respondent later admits that he failed to keep proper records, and that the documents produced into evidence were created from memory, after Petitioner initiated the current investigation. The Court finds that Respondent\u2019s client ledgers were created retrospectively and in anticipation of disciplinary action, rather than contemporaneously maintained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">Mr. John DeBone, a paralegal for the Attorney Grievance Commission, reviewed bank statements for Respondent\u2019s trust account. As a result of his review, Mr. DeBone testified that he categorized deposits and withdrawals made from the Respondent\u2019s trust account based on client name. Mr. DeBone noted that there were a number of transactions which could not be attributed to a specific client; Mr. DeBone categorized these transactions as \u201cUnidentified.\u201d During the hearing, Mr. DeBone testified that these \u201cUn<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>identified\u201d transactions consisted of four deposits which totaled $25,650.00. Mr. DeBone also discovered forty-five (45) cash disbursements Respondent made to himself from his trust account, amounting to $61,950.45.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-4\">Mr. DeBone also noted disbursements, categorized as \u201cBell-Expenses,\u201d that were made to various business vendors, such as, DirecTV, AT &amp; T, and Verizon. Respondent made twenty-four (24) \u201cBell-Expenses\u201d from September 2009 to February 2011. Mr. DeBone\u2019s analysis also indicates that Respondent made a number of cash deposits into his trust account which he could not attribute to a specific client matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-5\">Based on his review of Respondent\u2019s file, and his seventeen years of experience with the Attorney Grievance Commission, Mr. DeBone concluded that Respondent was clearly keeping earned attorney\u2019s fees in his trust account, as evidenced by the fact that Respondent was paying his expenses from that account. Mr. DeBone stated that keeping some money in the account is permissible for covering maintenance fees, however the amount of money Respondent stored in his account far exceeded what is considered as an acceptable amount. At some point after his initial review of Respondent\u2019s file, Mr. DeBone received Respondent\u2019s client ledgers. Mr. DeBone testified that the funds in Respondent\u2019s trust account generally seemed to \u201cmatch up,\u201d and that he did not believe Respondent was intentionally misappropriating funds from his clients. The Court finds Mr. DeBone\u2019s testimony credible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">Petitioner\u2019s initial investigation led to further concerns about Respondent\u2019s trust account for the following clients.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">A. <em>Lloyd Carter</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">Respondent filed an employment discrimination lawsuit against the District of Columbia Government on behalf of his client, Lloyd Carter. On October 13, 2009, Respondent settled Mr. Carter\u2019s case and received a contingency fee in the amount of $20,000. Respondent received the settlement check for Mr. Carter\u2019s case on February 1, 2010. Shortly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>thereafter, Respondent discovered that the settlement cheek included funds designated for Respondent, as well as Mr. Carter. Instead of $20,000 in attorney\u2019s fees, Respondent was only entitled to a portion of the check, specifically $14,448.55, while the remaining $5,551.45 belonged to Mr. Carter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\">On February 2, 2010, Respondent wrote check number 1137 from his trust account, made to \u201cCash,\u201d in the amount of $15,742.45. According to the client ledger for Lloyd Carter, check number 1137 represented attorney\u2019s fees earned from the Lloyd Carter case, however this amount is $1,243.55 greater than the amount actually earned on the Carter matter. When confronted about the discrepancy between attorney\u2019s fees actually earned on the Carter matter and money received, Respondent admitted that \u201c[he] was mistaken.\u201d On February 2, 2010, Respondent did write a cashier\u2019s check to Mr. Carter in the amount of $5,551.45, however the funds for this check did not originate from Respondent\u2019s trust account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">B. <em>Briana Green</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">On September 2, 2009, Respondent deposited $3,500.00 into his trust account for the Briana Green case. Between September 8, 2009 and September 11, 2009, Respondent made the following disbursements from his trust account, categorized as \u201cearned fees from Briana Green case:\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-7\">9/8/09 Direct TV payment -$ 308.09</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-8\">9/8/09 Cheek # 1119 to Cash -$2,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-9\">9/11/09 Check # 1121 to Cash -$1,200.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-10\">The disbursements Respondent made to himself amount to $3,508.09, thus disbursing $8.09 more than was earned from the Briana Green client matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-11\">C. <em>Derrick Hunter</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-12\">Respondent represented Derrick Hunter on a child support and visitation matter. On March 2, 2010, Respondent deposited $460.00 into his trust account as attorney\u2019s fees earned in the Hunter matter. Respondent then made the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>following disbursements between March 3, 2010 and March 5, 2010:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-14\">3/3/10 AT &amp; T payment -$206.44</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADF\">3/4/10 Direct TV -$141.47</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AC-\">3/5/10 Check # 1144 to Cash -$120.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-5\">Respondent disbursed a total of $467.91 to himself in the Hunter matter, exceeding the attorney\u2019s fees actually earned by $7.91.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">D. <em>Charles Smith</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-7\">On November 16, 2010 Respondent entered his appearance on behalf of Charles Smith. On February 2, 2011, Respondent deposited $700.00 in attorney\u2019s fees for his representation of Charles Smith. Between February 4, 2011 and February 14, 2011, Respondent made the following disbursements from his trust account:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-8\">2/4/11 AT &amp; T -$366.64</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-9\">2/4/11 Direct TV -$204.04</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-10\">2/14/11 Check # 1178 to Cash -$160.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-11\">Respondent withdrew a total of $730.68 in attorney\u2019s fees from the Smith matter; thus receiving an excess of $30.68.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-12\">Furthermore, testimony from Mr. Lindale Alston, Respondent\u2019s accountant, revealed more egregious failures in Respondent\u2019s record keeping. Mr. Alston was hired to prepare Respondent\u2019s 2010 and 2011 taxes, however, Respondent failed to provide Mr. Alston with client records for 2010. Respondent has apparently now provided client records, trust account statements, and checks in order to prepare his 2011 taxes; however, as of the date of the hearing, Respondent has not filed taxes for 2011.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-13\">Judge Cotton further entered conclusions of law, concluding that Bell violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.15(a), 8.4(a) and (d), Md. Rule 16-606.1(a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3), Md. Rule 16-607(a), and Md. Rule 16-609(a)-(c). She explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>Conclusions of Law</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-4\">^ ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-5\">\n<em>Respondent violated MRPC 1.1; Competence</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">^ ^ ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-7\">\u201cThoroughness and preparation reasonably necessary for competent representation includes the proper management of case files.\u201d <em>See Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Ober, </em>350 Md. 616, 630, 714 A.2d 856, 863 (1998). Incorporated within the competence requirement is a lawyer\u2019s duty to properly maintain his trust account. <em>See Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Brown, </em>380 Md. 661, 667-68, 846 A.2d 428, 432 (2004) (finding that an attorney\u2019s failure to properly maintain settlement monies in his escrow account demonstrated his incompetence pursuant to Rule 1.1 of the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct). Failure to properly maintain a client\u2019s settlement monies in an escrow account may also demonstrate incompetence under MRPC 1.1. <em>See Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Maignan, </em>390 Md. 287, 296-97, 888 A.2d 344, 349 (2005).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-8\">As evidenced in his client ledgers, Respondent has exhibited a pattern of improperly handling client funds. Client ledgers indicate that Respondent has made a number of disbursements from his trust account for personal expenses, such as DirectTV, and AT &amp; T. Furthermore, Respondent admitted during his deposition that he was not maintaining his client records as required by Maryland Rule 16-606.1, and attempted to create ledgers from memory once prompted by Petitioner. Therefore, the Court finds that Respondent incompetently handled client funds, in violation of MRPC 1.1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">\n<em>Respondent violated MRPC 1.15(a); Safekeeping of Property</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\"><em>% </em>^ ^</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-11\">\u201cThe mere fact that the balance in an attorney trust account falls below the total amounts held in trust supports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>a <em>prima facie </em>finding of [a] violation of [Rule 1.15].\u201d <em>See Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Glenn, </em>341 Md. 448, 472, 671 A.2d 463, 475 (1996) (noting that improper intent is not an element to Rule 1.15; \u201c[t]he Court has consistently found inadvertent conduct that results in an escrow account deficit to be in violation of Rule 1.15\u201d). On February 16, 2011, Respondent\u2019s trust account dropped to - $143.62, thus supporting a finding that Respondent has violated Rule 1.15. Though Respondent was able to replenish the account with Mr. Wiggs check just two days later, the fact that Respondent\u2019s trust account fell to a negative balance is indicia of Respondent\u2019s failure to properly safeguard client funds. Additionally, payment of filing fees in the Wiggs matter should have been paid from an operating account rather than Respondent\u2019s trust account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-4\">Furthermore, withdrawing funds from a trust account for personal matters also constitutes a violation of Rule 1.15(a). <em>See Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Moeller, </em>427 Md. 66, 71, 46 A.3d 407, 410 (2012); <em>see also Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Powell, </em>369 Md. 462, 468-69, 800 A.2d 782, 786 (2001[2002]) (concluding that there was clear and convincing evidence of a violation of MRPC 1.15(a) and Maryland Rule 16-607 where an attorney deposited earned fees and money received from his father into a bank account titled as an attorney trust account and used this account for personal and business purposes). As illustrated above, Respondent has made numerous disbursements from his trust account for personal expenses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-5\">Finally, failure to maintain a complete record of the receipt and disbursement of client funds constitutes a violation of Rule 1.15. In <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Obi, </em>the Court of Appeals affirmed the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion that a violation of Rule 1.15(a) occurred where the attorney\u2019s \u201ccash receipt journal, check register, statement of account, and cancelled checks failed to provide an adequate accounting of the origin of the funds in [the attorney\u2019s] escrow account.\u201d 393 Md. 643, 657, 904 A.2d 422, 430 (2006). Similarly, the documents that Respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>has provided makes it difficult for one to discern how much money Respondent received from clients, what money placed in the account was Respondent\u2019s personal funds, and, most importantly, where the money was disbursed. In addition, Mr. Alston, Respondent\u2019s accountant, testified that Respondent had failed to provide client ledger information needed in order to prepare Respondent\u2019s 2010 taxes; further supporting the finding that Respondent failed to keep accurate accounting. Therefore, the Court finds that Respondent violated MRPC 1.15(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-4\">\n<em>Respondent violated MRPC 8.4(a) and (d); Misconduct</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">[T]he Court finds that Respondent violated MRPC 1.1 and 1.15(a); therefore, the Court also finds that Respondent engaged in professional misconduct in violation of MRPC 8.4(a). <em>See Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Cherry-Mahoi, </em>388 Md. 124, 159, 879 A.2d 58, 80 (2005) (reasoning that because respondent violated \u201cseveral Rules of Professional Conduct, she necessarily violated Rule 8.4(a) as well, which finds professional misconduct where a lawyer \u2018violates or attempts to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct\u2019 \u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. James, </em>the Court of Appeals opined that an attorney\u2019s actions violated MRPC 8.4(d) where he was found to have used his escrow account for personal and business matters and failed to keep his client\u2019s settlement money intact until disbursement. 385 Md. 637, 649-50, 870 A.2d 229, 236 (2005); <em>see also Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Zuckerman, </em>386 Md. 341, 374-75, 872 A.2d 693, 713 (2005) (agreeing that a violation of Rule 8.4 occurred where the attorney misused his trust account and commingled client funds in his trust account). Similarly, Respondent has consistently used his trust account for personal matters, stored attorney\u2019s fees in his trust account, and made several disbursements from the trust account to himself. These actions constitute a prejudice to the administration of justice, in violation of Rule 8.4(d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>\n<em>Respondent violated Maryland Rule 16-606.1; Attorney Trust Account Record-keeping</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-4\">ifc <em>%</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-5\">Maryland Rule 16-606.1 requires attorneys to keep a record of their trust accounts that \u201cchronologically shows all deposits and disbursements,\u201d as well as provide the \u201cpayee and the check number or other payment identification.\u201d <em>Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Patterson, </em>421 Md. 708, 727-28, 28 A.3d 1196, 1207 (2011) (overruling an attorney\u2019s exceptions to the hearing judge\u2019s determination that Rule 16-606.1 was violated when the evidence showed that the attorney failed to provide payment identification for all deposits and disbursements from his IOLTA account). In the present case, Respondent admitted that he did not maintain client ledgers in compliance with Rule 16-606.1. An examination of Respondent\u2019s client ledgers shows a number of occasions where Respondent failed to provide a purpose or description for deposits and disbursements made from his trust account. Respondent\u2019s ledgers also fail to provide the balance of funds remaining in the trust account in connection with a specific client. Respondent also stated that he created client ledgers based on his recollection of client matters, rather than \u201cat or near the time of the deposit\u201d or disbursement as required by the Rule. Therefore, the court finds that Respondent has violated Maryland Rules 16-606.1(a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">\n<em>Respondent violated Maryland Rule 16-607(a); Commingling of Funds</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">Pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-607, an attorney is permitted to deposit advanced fees in a trust account, however, depositing <em>earned fees </em>into a trust account is prohibited. The Court of Appeals has consistently found that Rule 16-607 has been violated when an attorney has deposited money into a trust account that was not an advancement of fees, or has used money in the trust account for personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>expenses. <em>See, e.g., Att\u2019y Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Nwadike, </em>416 Md. 180, 199, 6 A.3d 287, 298 (2010) (finding a violation of Rule 16-607 where an attorney failed to keep her earned fees and reimbursed expenses in her attorney trust account separate from her client\u2019s property); <em>Powell, </em>369 Md. at 469, 800 A.2d at 786 (finding that an attorney had commingled funds by depositing earned fees and personal money into his attorney trust account).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-4\">There is no evidence that Respondent used any other bank account in connection with his law practice. To the contrary, Respondent\u2019s trust account was used to safeguard settlement money, pay filing fees to the Clerk of the Court, accept cash deposits, and pay personal bills. Review of Respondent\u2019s client ledgers demonstrates that he consistently deposited money designated as earned attorney\u2019s fees into the trust account. For example, in the Green client matter Respondent deposited earned attorney\u2019s fees into his trust account; however said income should have been deposited in an operating account and kept separate from client funds.

Respondent disbursed an extra $8.09 than he was entitled to, thus creating a negative balance for the Green case. In March 2010, Respondent made one AT &amp; T payment, one Direct TV payment, and issued a check to cash as attorney\u2019s fees earned in the Hunter case. Respondent disbursed an extra $7.91 in this case, causing a negative balance in the Hunter matter. Most recently, in February 2011, Respondent made one AT &amp; T payment, a Direct TV payment, and issued a check to cash, as attorney\u2019s fees in relation to the Smith matter. Respondent disbursed $30.68 more than he earned, thus resulting in a negative balance for the Smith case.

After a review of the record, and because neither Petitioner nor Bell filed exceptions to the Circuit Court\u2019s Findings of Fact, we conclude that Judge Cotton\u2019s determinations as to the facts are supported by clear and convincing evidence. As to her conclusions of law, the hearing judge determined that Bell violated MLRPC 1.1; 1.15(a); 8.4(a) and (d); Md. Rule 16-606.1(a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3);<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Md.

Obi, </em>393 Md. 643, 658, 904 A.2d 422, 430 (2006) (quotation omitted).

We have said that for unintentional misappropriations, not resulting in financial loss to a client, and out of concern for the protection of the public as a result of an attorney\u2019s violations, an indefinite suspension is ordinarily the appropriate sanction. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Khandpur, </em>421 Md. 1, 25, 25 A.3d 165, 179 (2011); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Seiden, </em>373 Md. 409, 423-24, 818 A.2d 1108, 1116-17 (2003); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

We also look to our past cases involving attorney discipline when imposing sanctions.\u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Paul, </em>423 Md. 268, 284-85, 31 A.3d 512, 522 (2011) (citations omitted). Bar Counsel points to two aggravating factors that often guide our assessment of the appropriate sanction, namely, (a) prior disciplinary offenses and (b) the multiple offenses committed. According to Bar Counsel, the appropriate sanction for Bell\u2019s misconduct is an indefinite suspension with the right to reapply after ninety (90) days. Here, Bell made \u201cforty-five (45) cash disbursements ... payable to himself and transferred funds twenty[-]four (24) times to various vendors (including Verizon, AT <em>&amp; </em>T, etc.) originating from his trust account.\u201d In addition, it is undisputed that, in 2005, Bell received a reprimand for attempting to obtain from a client an unreasonable fee in violation of MLRPC 8.4(a).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Bell recommends that the we impose no sanction beyond a reprimand.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">There are several mitigating factors present that we generally consider in deciding whether to lessen what would be otherwise an appropriate sanction. <em>See Paul, </em>423 Md. at 285-86, 31 A.3d at 523. Here Bell emphasizes that he voluntarily took corrective actions with regard to his mishandling of his trust account. In February 2012, he participated in a course, apparently presented by the Maryland State Bar Association, to address his record-keeping problems. Also not one of Bell\u2019s clients alleges that he owes them money. Moreover, Bell maintains that he did not intend to misappropriate any funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>Essentially, Bar Counsel relies on two cases that he maintains are analogous to the present case to support its recommendation that we impose the sanction of indefinite suspension with the right to reapply after ninety (90) days. The two cases cited are <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. DiCicco, </em>369 Md. 662, 802 A.2d 1014 (2002) and <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Mba-Jonas, </em>397 Md. 690, 919 A.2d 669 (2007). Petitioner also points to <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Goff, </em>399 Md. 1, 922 A.2d 554 (2007) as a case where an attorney mishandled and commingled trust funds and we suspended the attorney indefinitely but permitted Goff to reapply for admission after 60 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">In <em>DiCicco, </em>we imposed a sanction of indefinite suspension with the right to reapply after ninety (90) days. We held that \u201c[wjhere there is no finding of intentional misappropriation ... and where the [attorney\u2019s] misconduct did not result in financial loss to any of the respondent\u2019s clients, an indefinite suspension ordinarily is the appropriate sanction.\u201d <em>DiCicco, </em>369 Md. at 687, 802 A.2d at 1028. In that case, the hearing judge determined that DiCicco violated, among other rules, MRPC 1.15(a) by commingling client funds and using his trust account as \u201chis personal bank account.\u201d In support of the sanction, we noted the absence of any fraudulent intent, the lack of evidence that any client suffered financial loss from DiCicco\u2019s misconduct and the lack of evidence of any prior disciplinary problems in DiCicco\u2019s thirty eight years as an attorney. <em>DiCicco, </em>369 Md. at 688, 802 A.2d at 1028.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">In <em>Mba-Jonas, </em>the attorney mishandled his attorney trust account and trust account records in violation of MRPC 1.15, 8.4(a) and (d), Md. Rules 16-604, 16-607, and 16-609 and Md.Code, \u00a7 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article. The hearing judge determined that Mba-Jonas was out of trust with regard to several clients \u201cdue to sloppiness [and] not dishonesty.\u201d 397 Md. at 697, 919 A.2d at 674. The attorney\u2019s misconduct also involved causing overdrafts, creating inaccurate settlement records and maintaining only a few records relating to settlement transactions. We imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>a sanction of indefinite suspension with the right to reapply for admission after ninety (90) days.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Goff, </em>399 Md. 1, 922 A.2d 554 (2007), an attorney was charged with misconduct for, among other violations, being out of trust on numerous occasions and depositing client funds into his operating account. The attorney\u2019s misconduct stemmed, in part, from issues with his computer software and hard drive. 399 Md. at 14, 922 A.2d at 562. The hearing judge noted the presence of mitigating factors, including \u201cthe respondent\u2019s lack of a prior disciplinary history,\u201d and that he \u201cderived no personal benefit\u201d from his misconduct, although this Court concluded that this did not mitigate his culpability. 399 Md. at 23, 31, 922 A.2d at 554, 572. We imposed the sanction of indefinite suspension with the right to reapply after sixty (60) days for violation of MLRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.15, 8.1, 8.4, and Maryland Rule 16-609 and Md.Code, \u00a7 10-306 of the Business Occupations and Professions Article. 399 Md. at 31, 922 A.2d at 572.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Consistent with the cases of <em>DiCicco, Mba-Jonas, </em>and <em>Goff, </em>we agree with Petitioner that aggravating factors should be considered in the calculus of an appropriate disposition of this case. Bell\u2019s continuous mishandling of his trust account and prior reprimand are factors to be considered. In mitigation of his misconduct, however, we recognize that Bell corrected the trust account overdrafts, did not intend to defraud his clients and attended (after being contacted by Bar Counsel regarding the problems revealed in this case) a course to improve his record-keeping skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">In view of the facts of the present case and the need to balance the aggravating and mitigating factors, we hold that the appropriate sanction is an indefinite suspension with the right to reapply for admission after thirty (30) days. We emphasize that the gravamen of Bell\u2019s misconduct was his commingling and mishandling of client trust funds and his \u201chastily and haphazard]\u201d attempt to create records to satisfy Bar Counsel\u2019s inquiry. Our response sends a clear message that such conduct, consistent with our case law, is unaccepta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>ble and notwithstanding Bell\u2019s efforts to correct his misconduct and protect his clients are important mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">In reaching the conclusion that Bell should \u201csit-out\u201d 30 days rather than 90 days, as suggested by Bar Counsel, we note that Bell\u2019s misconduct falls within that range of sanctions imposed in <em>DiCicco, Mba-Jonas, </em>and <em>Goff </em>as well as <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Khandpur, </em>421 Md. 1, 25 A.3d 165 (2011) and <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Seiden, </em>373 Md. 409, 818 A.2d 1108 (2003). The common thread running through the cases mentioned above is that an attorney\u2019s careless or uninformed mishandling or commingling of client trust funds in violation of the safekeeping requirements of MLRPC 1.15, absent any intent to defraud the client or financial loss to the client, will ordinarily result in a sanction of indefinite suspension. The weighing of aggravating versus mitigating factors ordinarily will bear on whether and how long a minimum \u201csit-out\u201d period may be imposed before reinstatement may be sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">In <em>Khandpur, </em>421 Md. at 26, 25 A.3d at 180, we imposed a sanction of indefinite suspension with the right to reapply after sixty (60) days where an attorney, who had no intent to defraud his clients, failed to represent them with reasonable diligence, failed to keep proper records for his attorney trust account, failed to properly hold client payments in trust until earned, and frustrated Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation by carelessly making false statements. <em>Khandpur </em>violated MLRPC 1.3, 1.15(a) and (c), 8.1(b), and 8.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">In <em>Seiden, </em>we pointed out that this Court has \u201cissued sanctions ranging from a public reprimand to a 90-day suspension where ... the lawyer\u2019s violative conduct did not amount to an intentional misappropriation or dishonesty.\u201d 373 Md. at 423-24, 818 A.2d at 1116-17; <em>see also </em>cases cited therein. Specifically in <em>Seiden, </em>we imposed a sanction of indefinite suspension with the right to reapply after thirty (30) days where Seiden unintentionally misappropriated client funds from his attorney trust account and in doing so violated MLRPC 1.1, 1.15(b), and 8.4(a) and (b). Seiden\u2019s failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>follow proper procedures to obtain his fee from his trust account for services rendered to an estate (the client), although unauthorized, did not amount to theft or dishonesty. We determined that there was an abundance of \u201cmitigating evidence that provide[d] for a lesser sanction than the three-year ... [\u201csit-out\u201d period] sought by Bar Counsel.\u201d 373 Md. at 424-25, 818 A.2d at 1117.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">The sanction imposed in <em>Seiden </em>is the most appropriate sanction to be applied in the ease <em>sub judice. </em>Although Seiden violated fewer rules than Bell, we have held that \u201cthe gravity of misconduct is not measured solely by the number of rules broken but is determined largely by the lawyer\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Culver, </em>371 Md. 265, 280, 808 A.2d 1251, 1260 (2002) (quotation omitted). Similar to Bell, Seiden had mitigating and aggravating factors that were relevant to the ultimate disposition of the case. Not unlike Seiden, Bell did not intend to defraud his clients, and hopefully will not repeat his misbehavior based upon the February 2012 training in the area of proper record keeping and the resulting consequences of his misconduct. Although Seiden had no prior disciplinary actions, Bell\u2019s initiation of remedial training helped to mitigate his prior reprimand. Finally, Bell does not escape responsibility for the misuse of his trust account which involved numerous disbursements for cash and record keeping errors relating to that account over a period of approximately nineteen months. As a result, he will be indefinitely suspended from the practice of law. Although he will have the right to reapply for admission after thirty (30) days, there is no guarantee that he will be readmitted immediately after he files an application.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING THE COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO RULE 16-761, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST JIMMY ANTHONY BELL.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b369-6\">.
