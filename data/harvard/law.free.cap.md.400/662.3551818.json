The Baltimore County Zoning Commissioner and Board of Appeals approved the proposed development. The Circuit Court for Baltimore County, on judicial review of that action filed by neighbors of the proposed development, reversed, holding that placement of the SWM facility on the R.C. 2 portion of the development violated existing zoning regulations. The Circuit Court, however, found no zoning problem with regard to the access road. The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, reversed-in-part and affirmed-in-part the judgment of the Circuit Court, holding that there existed \u201cno zoning impediments\u201d whatsoever to the development plan. We shall affirm, but for reasons different than those relied on by the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">The basic facts underlying the present case are as follows, divergent inferences advocated by the parties aside. The controversy arises from a development plan submitted to Baltimore County by Respondents, Dorothy Surina and Jeanne Gough (the land owners) and Gaylord Brooks Realty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>Company (the developer). The development project, identified as \u201cLynch Property\u2014Sweet Air Road,\u201d is proposed for a 47 acre tract of land located near the intersection of Sweet Air Road and Manor Knoll Court, east of Jacksonville, a rural area in the northeastern portion of Baltimore County (the \u201cProperty\u201d). Under the \u201cRural Protection and Resource Conservation\u201d (\u201cR.C.\u201d) area zoning in the County, Baltimore County Zoning Regulations (\u201cBCZR\u201d) \u00a7 \u00a7 1A00.1-1A09.8, the Property and immediately adjacent parcels of land<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> are subject to various development requirements aimed at agricultural, watershed, critical area, and rural resource preservation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Property is divided by Sweet Air Road, a public road which runs in an east-west direction. Approximately 32.3 acres of the Property is located south of Sweet Air Road. The remaining 14.7 acres is located to the north. The portion lying to the south of Sweet Air Road is zoned, in its entirety, in the R.C. 2 zone under the Zoning Regulations, <em>see </em>BCZR \u00a7\u00a7 1A01.1-1A01.4, and is improved with an existing residential structure.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The part of the Property located to the north of Sweet Air Road is split-zoned, meaning that there exists multiple zoning boundaries within that portion. <em>Alviani v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number><em>Dixon, </em>365 Md. 95, 100 n. 2, 775 A.2d 1234, 1236 n. 2 (2001). On the west side of the northern parcel are 10.8 acres of R.C. 5 zoned land.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There are two smaller areas on the eastern section of the northern portion of the Property, collectively shaped like a wedge and approximately 3.9 acres in size, zoned R.C. 2.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The development plan proposes eight single-family dwelling lots for the entire Property. Specifically, the proposal provides for the development of six new homes predominantly within the R.C. 5 zone,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> one new dwelling on the northeasterly wedge-shaped R.C. 2 zoned parcel,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the retention of the existing dwelling located at 4501 Sweet Air Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">1. Private Access Road</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Part of the infrastructure proposed in support of the subdivision, to be located on the part of the Property north of Sweet Air Road, fuels the instant controversy. Vehicular access to the lots, according to the development plan, is to be provided by a private road leading from Sweet Air Road into the interior of the R.C. 5 zoned land. The access road enters the proposed subdivision in the R.C. 5 zone, crosses briefly into the R.C. 2 zone, and then back into the R.C. 5 zone, where it eventually terminates in a cul-de-sac. The road is intended to provide owners of the R.C. 2 lot and the otherwise land<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>locked R.C. 5 zoned lots with access to Sweet Air Road. The design and location of the interior access road follows generally the existing natural topography of the Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">2. Stormwater Management Facility</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Also at issue is the placement of a stormwater management (\u201cSWM\u201d) facility on the R.C. 2 zoned section of the Property which, according to the record, is intended to accommodate stormwater runoff from the R.C. 5 lots and surrounding areas.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The SWM facility is proposed to be located entirely within the R.C. 2 zoned land, adjacent to the private access road.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Section 4-204 of the Environment Article of the Maryland Code (1982, 2007 RepLVol.) provides that all counties in Maryland shall adopt laws to implement a comprehensive stormwater management program.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Pursuant to this mandate, Balti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>more County adopted a regulatory scheme which provides generally that, unless the proposed development qualifies under one of the enumerated exceptions in Baltimore County Code \u00a7 33^4-104(b), no proposed land development in the County may commence unless the developer/landowner obtains from the local government approval of a stormwater management plan. The exceptions to this requirement are: \u201c(1) Agricultural land management practices; (2) Additions or modifications to existing single-family, detached, or semidetached residential structures, if the additions or modifications [do not disturb more than 5,000 square feet of land area]; (3) Developments that do not disturb more than 5,000 square feet of land area; and (4) Land development activities that the administration determines will be regulated under specific state laws which provide stormwater management no less stringent than the provisions of this title.\u201d. <em>See also </em>Baltimore County Code \u00a7\u00a7 32-6-107 (providing that no building permit may issue unless the applicant first meets the requirements of Article 33, Title 4 of the Baltimore County Code<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> as well as \u00a7 32-4-410(c)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> of that same Code). None of the exceptions apply to the subject development plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Stormwater management facilities may be located either on a proposed development site or off-site. If a facility is considered \u201con-site,\u201d it is intended to control stormwater runoff originating from within the site upon which the facility is located. Baltimore County Code \u00a7 33-4-101(v). An \u201coff-site\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>facility, on the other hand, is intended to collect stormwater runoff from more than one site. Baltimore County Code \u00a7 33-4-101(v). \u201cSite\u201d is broadly defined by the Baltimore County Code and refers to \u201cany tract, lot, or parcel of land, <em>or combination of tracts, lots, or parcels of land, that are in one ownership, </em>or are contiguous and in diverse ownership, <em>where development is to be done as part of a unit, subdivision, or </em>project____\u201d Baltimore County Code \u00a7 33-4-101(dd) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">As part of a proposed development plan, a SWM facility may also be designated for public or private maintenance. Baltimore County Code \u00a7 33-4-110. If designated for public maintenance, \u201c[t]he county shall take in-fee ownership of the stormwater management devices and practices.... \u201d Baltimore County Code \u00a7 33\u20144\u2014110(1). If the facility is designated for private maintenance, however, the property owner (or its successor) is responsible for maintaining the facility in accordance with standards spelled out by the County \u201cin a recorded deed of declaration for maintenance and access.\u201d Baltimore County Code \u00a7 33^1-110(2). To that end, the Baltimore County Code defines \u201cpublic improvements\u201d as those \u201cimprovements [which are] required by the county as a condition of development <em>that are intended to be dedicated to the county in fee simple or by other interests in title\u201d </em>Baltimore County Code \u00a7 32-4r-101(nn) (emphasis added). \u201cPrivate improvements,\u201d on the other hand, are those improvements which are \u201crequired by the county as a condition of development that are <em>not intended to be dedicated </em>to the county.\u201d Baltimore County Code \u00a7 33-4-101(mm) (emphasis added). <em>See also </em>Baltimore County Code \u00a7 32-4-302(c) (\u201cThe applicant shall prepare, execute, and deliver to the county those improvements ... required to convey to the county all rights-of-way <em>that are determined to be necessary and appropriate for the county to accept and maintain the public </em>improvements.\u201d) (emphasis added). As indicated on the approved development proposal, the stormwater management facility in the present case is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>intended to be conveyed by the Respondents in-fee to the County for public maintenance.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">The present case began at the Zoning Commissioner / Hearing Officer (Commissioner) level when Respondents filed with the County a concept plan for the Property, pursuant to Baltimore County Code \u00a7 32-4-213. The concept plan included a simple, clean, and straight-forward schematic representation of the proposed subdivision. The review process continued according to \u00a7 32-4-216<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> with the scheduling and completion of a Concept Plan Conference between the Department of Permits and Development Management, the Department of Environmental Protection and Resource Management, the Office of Planning, and the applicants. Subsequent to that meeting, a \u00a7 32-4-217 Community Input Meeting<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> was conducted, at which time, the owners of neighboring properties were given the opportunity to review and offer comments on the proposed development. After consideration and incorporation of the suggestions proposed during the earlier phases of the development approval process, the developers submitted a Development Plan for review and comments by the County at a Development Plan Conference. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>Baltimore County Code \u00a7 \u00a7 32-4-221 to 32-4-226.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Subsequent to the Development Plan Conference, a quasi-judicial public hearing was scheduled before the Commissioner. Baltimore County Code \u00a7 32-4-227.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">The Long Green Valley Community Association, and three individuals, Charlotte Pine, Steve Preston, and Gary Elser, at some point prior to this hearing, filed with the Commissioner a Petition for Special Hearing pursuant to BCZR \u00a7 500.7.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It was at the \u00a7 32-4r-227 public hearing that counsel for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>neighbors advised the Commissioner that the petition had been filed. Pursuant to Baltimore County Code, \u00a7 32-4-230(a), \u201c[i]f the Development Plan requires a special exception, variance, special hearing, or interpretation of the Baltimore County Zoning Regulations, the applicant may combine the public hearing required under Title 3, Subtitle 3 of this article and under the Baltimore County Zoning Regulations with the public hearing held by the Hearing Officer on the Development Plan.\u201d The applicants consented to a single public hearing, which was held on 2 December 2003. The Commissioner filed on 16 December 2003 an opinion and order approving Respondents\u2019 development plan, pending the outcome of a traffic study aimed at determining if there existed a safe sight distance at the intersection of the interior access road and Sweet Air Road. Subsequent to receipt of that study, Respondents filed a red-lined development plan incorporating necessary changes indicated by the traffic study. The amended development plan was approved on 3 June 2004 by the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">Petitioners noted with the Board of Appeals (\u201cCBA\u201d) a timely administrative appeal. The CBA heard the matter on 7 September 2004. After the submission of legal memoranda from the parties and open deliberation on 26 October 2004 regarding the issues presented by the Petition for Special hearing, the CBA rendered its final decision on 10 November 2004, affirming the Commissioner\u2019s decision to approve the amended Development Plan. The Long Green Valley Community Association and the People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County filed on 6 December 2004 a Petition for Judicial Review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The Circuit Court reversed the decision of the CBA, concluding that the SWM facility contemplated by the development plan violated Baltimore County\u2019s resource conservation zoning regulations. Specifically, the Circuit Court held that, even though the facility was to be conveyed to and maintained by the County, the SWM system, by virtue of the fact that the need for stormwater management at all was precipitated by and served only the new development, was not a \u201cpublic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>facility.\u201d In other words, the Circuit Court found that presumed government ownership and maintenance of the facility was insufficient indicia that the SWM facility would be a \u201cpublic improvement,\u201d where the facility was required by and served only the proposed subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">The Circuit Court rejected the developer\u2019s argument that the SWM pond constituted, pursuant to BCZR \u00a7 101, an \u201cuncontrolled excavation,\u201d and, therefore, a permitted accessory use, in the R.C. 2 zone. The Circuit Court concluded that \u201ca permitted principal use [such as housing] in one zone cannot be served by [an] accessory use[,] [the SWM facility], if that accessory use is located in a separate zone having its own, specific regulations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">As to the access road, the Circuit Court found that the development plan approved by the Zoning Commissioner \u201cshow[ed] only a small piece of the roadway that extends through the R.C. 2 zone, as most of the road is located in the R.C. 5 zone. Clearly, the access road [] serv[ed] both the R.C. 2 and R.C. 5 zones separately, and this type of road [wa]s a use permitted by right in each zone according to BCZR \u00a7 1A01.2B.5 and \u00a7 1A04.2A.7.\u201d The Circuit Court reasoned further that \u201cthere is no requirement in the BCZR that requires a street or way in one particular zone to provide access to that zone only. Stated differently, each zone is supported by that part of the access road through which it travels, and it is therefore not in violation of the BCZR.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Respondents here noted a timely appeal with the Court of Special Appeals, raising the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-7\">(1) Did the Circuit Court substitute improperly its judgment for the County Board of Appeals in ruling that a stormwater management facility, an improvement required as part of the development approval for a split-zoned residential subdivision, is prohibited in a portion of the R.C. 2 zoned area of the subject property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-8\">(2) Does the spirit, intent and scope of the BCZR prohibit the location of the SWM facility in a portion of the R.C. 2 zoned area of the subject property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>(3) Did the County Board of Appeals apply the correct law and is its written opinion supported by substantial evidence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, agreed with the Commissioner and the CBA \u201cthat the proposed SWM facility is a public facility that is exempt from [the] R.C. 2 zoning restrictions [established in the BCZR].\u201d Relying on our holding in <em>Glascock v. Baltimore County, </em>321 Md. 118, 581 A.2d 822 (1990) (\u201c \u2018[I]t is a basic long-standing principle of statutory construction that the State is not deemed to be bound by an enactment of the General Assembly unless the enactment specifically names the State or manifests a clear and indisputable intention that the State is to be bound.\u2019 \u201d) (citations omitted), the intermediate appellate court concluded that the to-be-County-owned SWM facility would fall outside the purview of the BCZR by virtue of the fact that it would be a public facility serving an important governmental function. The appellate court placed significant emphasis on the fact that the facility, pursuant to the approved development plan, was to be conveyed in-fee to the County and that it was to be maintained by the County for the purposes of stormwater runoff serving and protecting also neighboring tracts of land, thereby serving broadly the public\u2019s health, safety, and welfare. The panel therefore remanded the matter to the Circuit Court with instructions to affirm the CBA\u2019s approval of the amended development plan. The intermediate appellate court found it unnecessary to address the other two issues before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">The People\u2019s Counsel of Baltimore County, along with Long Green Valley Community Association, filed with this Court on 8 November 2006 a timely Petition for Writ of Certiorari. We issued the writ, 396 Md. 12, 912 A.2d 648 (2006), in order to consider the following questions:<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>1. Whether the Court of Special Appeals confused subdivision restrictions with zoning use law in a way reminiscent of <em>Remes v. Montgomery County, </em>387 Md. 52, 874 A.2d 470 (2005).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-4\">2. Whether a storm water management facility, required as a condition of private development approval, and serving that development, is a \u201cpublic facility\u201d or \u201cpublic use\u201d exempt from county zoning law under the reasoning in <em>Glascock v. Baltimore County, </em>321 Md. 118, 581 A.2d 822 (1990), that county governmental uses and land development activities are exempt from local and municipal zoning regulations. In other words, whether the Court of Special Appeals confused conditions for private land development with dedications of land for public use, disregarding distinctions illustrated in <em>City of Annapolis v. Waterman, </em>357 Md. 484, 745 A.2d 1000 (2000).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-5\">3. Whether the more-restricted R.C. 2 Agricultural Zone area may be used for a SWM facility and private access road in support of lots developed in the adjoining Rural-Residential Zone Area, where the Agricultural Zone would not permit the lot density those pieces of infrastructure were designed to support.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>4. Whether the Court of Special Appeals allowed the equivalent of a disguised <em>de facto </em>rezoning of the R.C. 2 zoned property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">When this or any appellate court reviews the final decision of an administrative agency such as the CBA, the court looks through the circuit court\u2019s and intermediate appellate court\u2019s decisions, although applying the same standards of review, and evaluates the decision of the agency. <em>Mastandrea v. North, </em>361 Md. 107, 133, 760 A.2d 677, 691 (2000) (citing <em>White v. North, </em>121 Md.App. 196, 219, 708 A.2d 1093, 1105 (1998), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>356 Md. 31, 736 A.2d 1072 (1999) ). We therefore shall focus our attention in the main on the decision of the CBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">In doing so, this Court may not substitute its judgment for the administrative agency\u2019s in matters where purely discretionary decisions are involved, particularly when the matter in dispute involves areas within that agency\u2019s particular realm of expertise, <em>see, e.g., Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 68-69, 729 A.2d 376, 381 (1999), so long as the agency\u2019s determination is based on \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d <em>See White, </em>356 Md. at 44, 736 A.2d at 1079-80; <em>Mayor of Annapolis v. Annapolis Waterfront Co., </em>284 Md. 383, 398, 396 A.2d 1080, 1089 (1979). In that latter regard, we inquire whether the zoning body\u2019s determination was supported by \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.... \u201d <em>Annapolis Waterfront Co., </em>284 Md. at 398, 396 A.2d at 1089; <em>see also Annapolis Waterfront Co., </em>284 Md. at 398-99, 396 A.2d at 1089 (\u201cThe heart of the fact-finding process often is the drawing of inferences made from the evidence____The court may not substitute its judgment on the question whether the inference drawn is the right one or whether a different inference would be better supported. The test is reasonableness, not rightness.\u201d) (citations omitted); <em>Snowden v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>224 Md. 443, 447-48, 168 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>390, 392 (1961) (quoting 4 Kenneth Culp Davis &amp; Richard J. Pierce, Administrative Law \u00a7 29.11, at 186 (1958)). Thus, we will uphold the administrative decision of the zoning body, here the CBA, to approve the development plan if that action was \u201cfairly debatable\u201d on the facts as found by it. <em>White, </em>356 Md. at 44, 736 A.2d at 1079-80; <em>Sembly v.

Montgomery County Bd. of Appeals, </em>261 Md. 153, 156, 274 A.2d 379, 381 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">We are less deferential in our review, however, of the legal conclusions of the administrative body and may reverse those decisions where the legal conclusions reached by that body are based on an erroneous interpretation or application of the zoning statutes, regulations, and ordinances relevant and applicable to the property that is the subject of the dispute. <em>Belvoir Farms Homeowners Assoc., Inc. v. North, </em>355 Md. 259, 267-68, 734 A.2d 227, 232 (1999) (citing <em>Catonsville Nursing Home, Inc. v. Loveman, </em>349 Md. 560, 569, 709 A.2d 749, 753 (1998)); <em>see also Mombee TLC, Inc. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>165 Md.App. 42, 884 A.2d 748 (2005) (finding that an appellate court\u2019s role \u201cis precisely the same as that of the circuit court,\u201d and that \u201clike that court, we are \u2018limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law5 \u201d) (citations omitted). When determining the validity of those legal conclusions reached by the zoning body, however, \u201ca degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency\u201d whose task it is to interpret the ordinances and regulations the agency itself promulgated. <em>Marzullo v.

When considering these uses, it is important to keep in mind the overarching principles of the Rural Conservation zones, which are to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-7\">(A) Discourage present land use patterns of development and to create a framework for planned or orderly development;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-8\">(B) Provide sufficient and adequate areas for rural-suburban and related development in selected and suitable areas;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-9\">(C) Protect both natural and man-made resources from compromising effects of specific forms and densities of development; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-10\">(D) Protect areas desirable for more intensive future development by regulating undesirable forms of development <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>within these areas until such time as intensive development commences.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">BCZR \u00a7 1A00.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">\n<em>A The R.C. 2 Rural-Agricultural Zone</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The R.C. 2 agricultural zone\u2019s primary purpose is to \u201cfoster conditions favorable to continued agricultural use of the productive agricultural areas of Baltimore County by preventing incompatible forms and degrees of urban uses.\u201d BCZR \u00a7 1A01.1.B.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> This stated purpose is based on the premise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b710-7\">a.

Although agricultural operations obviously are the preferred use permitted as of right in a R.C. 2 zone, BCZR \u00a7 1A01.2.A, other uses are permitted as of right, BCZR \u00a7 1A01.2.B, or by special exception. BCZR \u00a7 1A01.2.C. Uses permitted as of right, which are pertinent to the present case, include \u201cstreets and ways,\u201d BCZR \u00a7 1 A01.2.B.5, and single-family detached dwellings, BCZR \u00a7 1A01.2.B.1.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Stormwater management facilities are not mentioned explicitly in the enumeration.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">The construction of single-family detached dwellings is subject to height and density regulations found at BCZR \u00a7 1A01.3.B.

Tracts having a gross area of between two and 100 acres may not be subdivided into more than two lots total. <em>Id. </em>For tracts above 100 acres in size, they may be subdivided at a density of no more than one lot per 50 acres. <em>Id. </em>In terms of minimum lot size, no lots having a gross area of less than one acre may be created in a R.C. 2 zone.

The R.C. 5 Rural-Residential Zone</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The R.C. 5 rural-residential zone was established by Baltimore County on the premise that, among other things, rural-residential development \u201cconstitutes a wasteful use of land and is fiscally expensive to serve with respect to the provision of basic services.\u201d BCZR \u00a7 lA04.1.A.l.b.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In that vein, the R.C. 5 zone was created in order to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-6\">1.

Permitted uses of right in the R.C. 5 zone pertinent to the present case are single-family detached dwellings, BCZR \u00a7 1 A04.2.A.2, and streets and ways, BCZR \u00a7 1A04.2.A.7. Stormwater management facilities are not mentioned as such in the list of permitted uses within the R.C. 5 zone.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-11\">A primary difference between the R.C. 2 and R.C. 5 zones, presumably because of the divergent foci between them in terms of residential and agricultural development, are the density levels permitted in each. Minimum lot size and density levels permitted within the R.C. 5 zone are more generous than those allowed in the R.C. 2 zone. The regulations provide that no lot may be created within the R.C. 5 zone with a total gross area of less than 1.5 acres, BCZR \u00a7 lA04.2.B.a, and the maximum allowable residential density within the zone is 0.5 dwellings per acre. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>II.

Rather than constituting a \u201cuse\u201d in and of itself, Md.Code (1982, 2007 Repl.Vol.), Environment Article, \u00a7 4-204; Baltimore County Code \u00a7 33-4-104(b), Respondents contend that, because development regulations and zoning laws are separate, but interrelated bodies of law, the SWM facility, at least under the circumstances of the present case, falls outside regulation by the BCZR, notwithstanding Petitioners\u2019 assertion to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">It must be conceded, as general rule, that, when a zoning ordinance enumerates specifically the permitted uses within a particular zone, the ordinance \u201cestablish[es] that the only uses permitted in the [] zone are those designated as uses permitted as of right and uses permitted by special exception. Any use other than those permitted and being carried on as of right or by special exception is prohibited.\u201d <em>Kowalski v.

For example, where the subdivision regulations provide that a subdivision must be compatible with the county master plan and the proposed plat shows a greater density than called for in the master plan, the subdivision may be rejected although the zoning ordinance permits the density proposed.\u201d). While zoning laws define the uses that are permitted in a particular zoning district, <em>ie., </em>the R.C. 5 and R.C. 2 zones, subdivision regulations inform how, when, and under what circumstances a particular tract may be developed. <em>Remes, </em>387 Md. at 74, 874 A.2d at 482 (\u201c[Zjoning dictates what one can build on, or how one may use his property while subdivision or planning determines how the land is divided\u201d).

Zoning regulations and subdivision/development controls, along with the establishment of a master plan in a particular locality, serve additional common objectives in terms of the effective, efficient, and consistent use of land within similarly-situated districts. <em>Coffey, </em>293 Md. at 30, 441 A.2d at 1044.

Although each of these devices has an independent purpose and may be subjected to a separate development and approval procedure, their functions, to some extent, coalesce, in that they are all designed to assure that land development occurs in a manner that is consistent with overall legislative policy and community welfare.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">347 Md. at 129, 699 A.2d at 436 (citing generally <em>Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs v. Gaster, </em>285 Md. 233, 401 A.2d 666 (1979)). Thus, although zoning laws and subdivision regulations are separate forms of regulation, and typically are administered by different governmental agencies or bodies, they operate in practical application to ensure that land in a particular locality is developed in a relatively uniform and consistent manner, especially when Euclidian zones,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> such as the R.C. zones, are concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>Nowhere in any of the relevant cases explaining the differences between zoning and subdivision regulation is there an indication that improvements required by a subdivision regulation may be placed anywhere the developer wishes, regardless of an improvement\u2019s location relative to internal zoning boundaries and their requirements.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> To the contrary, all proposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>subdivision developments must comply with the applicable zoning ordinances in effect at the time the subdivision is proposed. Baltimore County Code \u00a7 32-4-104 (\u201cProposed development shall be in compliance with the present zoning classification on the property to be developed.\u201d); Baltimore County Code \u00a7 32-4-114(a) (\u201cExcept as otherwise provided in this title, all development shall comply with this title and all other applicable laws or regulations of the county.\u201d); <em>Wesley </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number><em>Chapel Bluemount Ass\u2019n, </em>347 Md. at 129, 699 A.2d at 436 (\u201c[Z]oning decisions take into account the provisions of the applicable master plan and subdivision and development approvals take into account compliance with applicable zoning regulations.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">Respondents\u2019 interpretation, however, that a SWM facility is not contemplated by, and therefore not subject to the BCZR generally and the R.C. 2 and R.C. 5 regulations specifically, when required in conjunction with single-family residential permitted use, defies logic and common sense because, at the same time, it is required by the subdivision controls as a condition of approval of that subdivision. The fault in Petitioners\u2019 reasoning is particularly apparent when the BCZR, read in broader context, contemplates expressly the construction of SWM facilities despite the absence as an enumerated permitted \u201cuse\u201d as such in any of Baltimore County\u2019s resource conservation zones. In the R.C. 6 (Rural Conservation and Residential) zone, for example, no specific reference is made to stormwater management in terms of \u201cuses\u201d permitted, as of right or otherwise. BCZR \u00a7 1A07.3. Yet, the BCZR provisions governing use of land in the R.C. 6 classification provide that \u201c[s]tormwater management facilities must be integrated with the <em>topography of the site </em>and consistent with the visual appearance of the surrounding natural features.\u201d BCZR \u00a7 1A07.8.C.1. The BCZR follow an identical pattern in its provisions relating to the R.C. 7 (Resource Preservation) zone. While stormwater management facilities are not mentioned as \u201cuses\u201d permitted in the R.C. 7 zone, BCZR \u00a7 1A08.3, another provision otherwise makes specific reference to stormwater management. SWM facilities located in R.C. 7 zones \u201cmust be integrated with the topography of the site and consistent with the visual appearance of the surrounding natural features.\u201d BCZR \u00a7 1A08.6.C.1. In like fashion, the provisions pertaining to R.C. 8 (Environmental Enhancement) zones do not mention SWM facilities as \u201cuses\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>permitted in the zone, yet they provide that SWM facilities \u201cshall be integrated into the site design to utilize nonstructural practices unless it is demonstrated that this is not possible.\u201d BCZR 1 A09.7.C.1. Thus, regardless of whether an SWM facility properly may be characterized as a \u201cuse\u201d in its traditional sense, it is clear that SWM facilities are nevertheless clearly contemplated by, and embraced by, the BCZR\u2019s basic zoning scheme in conjunction with allowed, explicitly mentioned uses in the rural conservation zone scheme generally. Thus, SWM facilities, required by subdivision regulations in conjunction with permitted uses in the R.C. 2 and R.C. 5 zones, are not exempt from regulation under the BCZR merely because SWM facilities are not mentioned in the permitted use enumerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">Moreover, though we do not decide here whether a storm-water management facility is an \u201cuncontrolled excavation\u201d within the meaning of that term as permitted in the R.C. 5 and R.C. 2 zones as an ancillary use, primarily because Respondents did not file a cross-petition for certiorari raising that issue which they pursued in the Circuit Court, we observe that the construction of stormwater management ponds typically requires \u201cthe digging of ... earthen material from a land surface ... [f]or grading or other purposes incidental to improvement of the land; and [w]hen incidental to the development of land or to grading for a public improvement[ ] ...,\u201d BCZR \u00a7 101, such as here to serve to control run-off from a proposed residential subdivision. Thus, it seems not inconsistent with the development of expressly permitted uses, like single-family detached homes allowed in the R.C. 5 and R.C. 2 zones, to allow ancillary required infrastructure such as SWM facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">By the same token, there is no Maryland authority for Respondents\u2019 proposition that infrastructure improvements in the development approval process are immune from appropriate zoning requirements, where the zoning ordinance may be wholly silent on the subject, because the improvements are required as conditions of the subdivision regulations. The more reasonable construction is that when an infrastructure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>improvement ancillary to an otherwise permitted residential subdivision is required as a condition to county approval of the development plan, some flexibility is implied in the definition of the \u201cuses\u201d which are subject to the zoning regulations of the county, particularly when certain other provisions of the same zoning regulations, despite the absence from the enumeration of the permitted \u201cuses\u201d in the particular zone of the particular \u201cuse,\u201d contemplate specifically that utilization of the land. SWM management facilities are contemplated by the zoning scheme despite the lack of their express inclusion as \u201cuses\u201d in the permitted use enumerations in the BCZR.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">III. Under the Circumstances of the Present Case, the Decisions of the Commissioner and CBA That There are No Zoning Impediments to Placing the SWM Facility and a Portion of the Interior Access Road in the R.C. 2 Zone are Correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">\u201cWhenever a single tract is divided by a zone boundary so that portions of such a tract lie within R.C. Zones of different classifications, the total number of dwellings or density units permitted shall apply to each tract individually and, for the purpose of these regulations, shall be considered as separate parcels.\u201d BCZR \u00a7 1A00.5. With this in mind, Petitioners argue that, because \u201ceach zone is designed and structured with uniformity and to be self-contained with respect to principal and accessory uses,\u201d it is impermissible to locate in the R.C. 2 agricultural zone infrastructure, <em>ie., </em>the SWM facility and access road, designed to support lots located on the R.C. 5 rural residential land, especially where the zoning laws applicable to the agricultural zone would not permit the lot density the road and SWM facility were designed to support. Respondents, on the other hand, argue that no such zoning conflict exists between the commonly-owned, split-zoned Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">A. The Proposed Placement of the SWM Facility on the R.C. 2 Land Would Not Violate the BCZR.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">The record indicates that there was substantial disagreement between the parties at the CBA hearing regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>the consequences of placement of the SWM facility. Daniel O\u2019Leary, a principal civil engineer called by Petitioners as an expert in stormwater management, testified as to various aspects of the placement of the SWM facility. Mr. O\u2019Leary explained, <em>inter alia, </em>that, from a design standpoint, there would be more uncontrolled or un-managed flow from the development if the drainage pond were moved upgradient.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> As such, he testified that, if the SWM facility were placed entirely within the R.C. 5 zone, \u201cthere may be some areas along the R.C. 5/R.C. 2 border that may no longer drain to it because they [would not] physically drain there,\u201d although he acknowledged that moving the facility onto the R.C. 5 land would not be fatal to the general development scheme. Regarding the environmental impacts of increased runoff from both the development and the access road ancillary to the proposed construction, counsel for Respondents inquired whether \u201cthere would be more uncontrolled runoff if [the SWM facility] were constructed in the R.C. 5 versus R.C. 2 location.\u201d Mr. O\u2019Leary replied, \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">When asked whether the SWM facility would be smaller in size if designed to serve either the R.C. 2 lot by itself or, more abstractly, a single-lot development, O\u2019Leary testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-5\">Question: If ... you had none of this development in the R.C. 5, and you simply had one house where it\u2019s currently proposed on lot number seven, would you need a stormwater management facility?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-6\">Answer: I don\u2019t think so. You would still need to address stormwater management.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-7\">Q: But you would not need a facility such as the size and magnitude that\u2019s proposed on this [Respondent\u2019s [development plan]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>A: I said [it would] be very unusual to have a stormwater management device for a single lot. So, yes. You have to address it, so not knowing exactly what the impact is from just that lot would be, it [is] hard for me to say. But it [is] unlikely a pond, for instance, would be required for a single lot development.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-4\">Q: In follow up then, it [is] the density of the housing on the R.C. 5 along with the road system that requires the facility that [is] proposed on the [Respondent\u2019s [development plan].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-5\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">In a follow up question, Respondents\u2019 counsel asked O\u2019Leary whether the SWM facility, as proposed on the R.C. 2 zoned land, would be effective controlling the runoff from the R.C. 5 property. O\u2019Leary replied in the affirmative, indicating that at least three of the R.C. 5 lots and the roadway, which, in his opinion, was the most important factor because it would create the most runoff draining into the stormwater management pond, flowed to the facility.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Moreover, O\u2019Leary testified that, because the Property sits on a low ridge, the R.C. 2 lot on the east portion of the Property actually would drain to the east and not into the SWM facility. While the bulk of the runoff collecting in the SWM facility would originate from the R.C. 5 lots, however, runoff originating from the stretch of the interior access road in the R.C. 2 zone would flow into the SWM pond.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>In reaching its decision to affirm the Commissioner\u2019s approval of the development plan, the CBA placed significant emphasis on the testimony of O\u2019Leary regarding the efficacy of placing the stormwater management at the low point on the Property in an effort to minimize runoff, \u201cindicating th[at], if the stormwater management facility were moved from the R.C. 2 zone to the R.C. 5 zone, runoff would actually be increased.\u201d We conclude that a reading of the SWM development regulations, as well as the BCZR, supports the CBA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">The County\u2019s entire purpose in requiring adequate storm-water management is \u201cto protect, maintain, and enhance the public health, safety, and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse impacts associated with increased stormwater runoff.\u201d Baltimore County Code \u00a7 33-4-102; Baltimore County Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot. <em>&amp; </em>Res. Mgmt., Storm Water Management Engineering Regulations, Article 5 \u00a7 14-151(A) (2001). This coincides, to some degree, with one of the stated purposes of the BCZR resource conservation zones to \u201c[pjrotect both natural and man-made resources from the compromising effects of specific forms and densities of development.\u201d BCZR \u00a7 1A00.2.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Stephen Preston, a resident in the community located to the west of the Property, testified, before the CBA, as to his concerns regarding stormwater runoff. Mr. Preston testified that \u201c[t]he Lynch Property itself is a low ridge, basically, so that it runs off on every side onto adjacent property. It runs off to the east into Gunpowder State Park, and it runs off to the west through the adjoining properties [].\u201d Mr. Preston referred specifically to a map of the area surrounding Gunpowder State Park, and testified that the map \u201cshow[ed] the fact that [the Property sat on] a low ridge with drainage off of the east, north, and west occurring on [his (Mr. Preston\u2019s)] property immediately below where that runoff occurs.\u201d Mr. Preston testified further that his property, and the property of Mr. Elser, his neighbor to the south, sat lower than the Lynch Property, such that stormwater drained off the Property and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>onto their land. As the Commissioner concluded correctly, the entire purpose of having a SWM facility is to maintain stormwater runoff onto neighboring parcels at the level predating construction, and as if the Property were undeveloped.

Mgmt., Storm Water Management Engineering Regulations, Article 5, \u00a7 14-151(C) (2001) (\u201cProper management of stormwater management runoff will: (1) Minimize damage to public and private property; (2) Reduce the effects of development on land and stream channel erosion; (3) Assist in the attainment and maintenance of water quality standards; (4) Reduce local flooding; and <em>(5) Maintain after development, as nearly as possible, the predevelopment runoff characteristics\u201d) </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">The record reflects that the SWM facility design was based on the topography, the location of impervious surfaces on the Property, and achieving a pre-development rate of stormwater runoff. The CBA determined that \u201cif the SWM facility were located in the R.C. 5 zone, that change would result in more uncontrolled or unmanaged runoff.\u201d Although \u201cmost of the runoff directed to [the SWM facility] will originate in the R.C. 5 zone,\u201d the runoff originating from the R.C. 2 portion of the road will flow additionally into the SWM facility. In other words, the SWM facility is ancillary to the single-family dwellings in both the R.C. 5 and R.C. 2 lots, which are uses permitted as of right in both zones. Based on the evidence in this record, if the Commissioner and CBA, charged with interpreting the resource conservation provisions of BCZR, chose to place emphasis on the environment impacts associated with placement of the SWM facility, a conclusion based on those environmental impacts to approve the development plan was not unreasonable or irrational.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>The CBA\u2019s conclusion also is reasonable considering that BCZR provisions relating to the overall resource conservation scheme contemplate SWM facilities and that they should be sited according to topographical considerations. As stated <em>supra, </em>the BCZR provisions governing use of land in the R.C. 6 classification provide that \u201c[sjtormwater management facilities must be integrated with the <em>topography of the site </em>and consistent with the visual appearance of the surrounding natural features.\u201d BCZR \u00a7 1A07.8.C.1 (emphasis added); BCZR \u00a7 lA08.6.C.l.(providing that SWM facilities located in R.C. 7 (Resource Preservation) zone \u201cmust be integrated with the topography of the site and consistent with the visual appearance of the surrounding natural features.\u201d); <em>see also </em>BCZR 1A09.7.C.1 (stating that, in the R.C. 8 (Environmental Enhancement) zone, SWM facilities \u201cshall be integrated into the <em>site design </em>to utilize nonstructural practices unless it is demonstrated that this is not possible.\u201d).<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The Baltimore County Code provisions governing SWM management provide that a \u201csite\u201d may be comprised of one lot or even multiple lots if those lots are commonly owned and where those lots, when completed, will form a larger subdivision. Baltimore County Code \u00a7 33-4-101(dd) (defining a \u201csite\u201d as \u201cany tract, lot, or parcel of land, <em>or combination of tracts, lots, or parcels of land, that are in one ownership, </em>or are contiguous and in diverse ownership, <em>where development is to be done as part of a unit, subdivision, or </em>project----\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>B. Placement of the Access Road Did Not Violate the Resource Conservation Provisions of the BCZR Where There is Evidence in the Record that the Road was Designed to Provide Access to Both the R.C. 2 and R.C. 5 lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">Turning our focus to the access road, although we agree with Petitioners that \u201czoning ordinance[s][are] concerned with the use of property and not with ownership thereof nor with the purposes of the owners or occupants,\u201d <em>Anderson v. Associated Professors of Loyola College, </em>39 Md.App. 345, 349, 385 A.2d 1203, 1204-05 (1978); <em>Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore v. Poe, </em>224 Md. 428, 433, 168 A.2d 193, 195 (1961); <em>Boulevard Scrap Co. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>213 Md. 6, 10, 130 A.2d 743, 745 (1957), we conclude that the R.C. 2 and R.C. 5 zoning regulations do not conflict where the road is designed to service identical permitted uses in both zones.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">In the present situation, the proposed development, currently in common ownership, is split-zoned, but each zone allows single-family, detached residential dwellings as primary uses permitted as of right. Streets and ways are permitted as of right in both zones in order to provide access to major roads for the purposes of ingress and egress. The foundation of the controversy manufactured for this case is that other zoning regulations applicable to each zone differ in terms of permissible lot density.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">In <em>Leimbach Construction Co. v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>257 Md. 635, 264 A.2d 109 (1970), there were two adjacent parcels of land, under common ownership, one zoned for residential use and the other for commercial use. <em>Leimbach Construction Co., </em>257 Md. at 637, 264 A.2d at 109. Because the pre-existing access to the commercial lot was made impossible by the earlier collapse of a bridge leading to the property, the landowner applied for a permit to install a driveway across the otherwise vacant residential lot. <em>Leimbach Construction Co., </em>257 Md. at 637, 264 A.2d at 109-10. Because there were no structures on the residential lot to be served by the proposed road, it was manifest that the access <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>road located within the residentially-zoned lot was intended to serve only the commercially-zoned lot. <em>Leimbach Construction Co., </em>257 Md. at 637-38, 264 A.2d at 110. In concluding that the road impermissibly \u201cwould be a \u2018business\u2019 use of land in a residential use district,\u201d <em>Leimbach Construction Co., </em>257 Md. at 640, 264 A.2d at 111, our predecessors reasoned, somewhat naively, that \u201c[a]ceess can be accomplished on foot or on horseback; material can be fetched by pack-train. A bridge would be far more convenient, of course, and, in the long run, much less expensive. But this is none of our concern____\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">As the CBA correctly pointed out in this case, \u201c[i] f the roadway had been constructed only across the R.C. 2 land and its sole use was to access the lots in the R.C. 5 zone, then Petitioner\u2019s argument may have some merit.\u201d In <em>Leimbach, </em>the road had no apparent or immediate utility in terms of proposed uses on the residential lot on which it was located. In the present case, however, the proposed access road encroaches upon only a small portion of the R.C. 2 lot, and is ancillary to the proposed single-family, detached dwellings on both the R.C. 2 and R.C. 5 zoned lots. The access road is a use permitted as of right in both the R.C. 2 and R.C. 5 zones according to BCZR \u00a7\u00a7 1A01.2.B.5 and 1A04.2.A.7, respectively, and serves as a mode of ingress and egress for the homes located in both zones. While certainly <em>Leimbach </em>may be said to support the proposition that \u201ceach zone is designed and structured with uniformity and to be self-contained with respect to principal and accessory uses,\u201d we find nothing in the BCZR, the subdivision regulations, or our precedents which indicates that, when a split-zoned property, in which both portions are under common ownership when developed, is to contain infrastructure improvements ancillary to permitted uses consistently allowed in both zones, the relative infrastructure must be located entirely within the more densely-developed zone.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>We are not persuaded by Petitioner\u2019s direction of our attention to <em>Delbrook Homes, Inc. v. Mayers, </em>248 Md. 80, 234 A.2d 880 (1967), <em>Board of County Commissioners of Anne Arundel County v. Snyder, </em>186 Md. 342, 46 A.2d 689 (1946), or <em>Alviani v. Dixon, </em>365 Md. 95, 99, 775 A.2d 1234, 1236 (2001), as support for the sweeping proposition that accessory uses may not be located in zones in which the principal use they serve is prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">In <em>Delbrook Homes, </em>Chartwell, a private community located in Anne Arundel County, sought to operate a beach area for its residents in a nearby water-oriented community known as Lakeland. 248 Md. at 82, 234 A.2d at 882. Neighbors residing in Lakeland challenged the use of the beach area by Chartwell residents and their guests, claiming that it created traffic problems, excess noise, and other various encroachments, including individuals parking and otherwise trespassing on their property. <em>Delbrook Homes, </em>248 Md. at 83-84, 234 A.2d at 882-83. Our task was to determine \u201cwhether such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>private community beach must be located within the perimeter of, or contiguous to the community which it serves.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\"><em>Delbrook Homes, </em>248 Md. at 82, 234 A.2d at 881. We concluded that land owned in a separate water-oriented community could not be used as a \u201cprivate community beach,\u201d under the Anne Arundel County zoning ordinances, where the beach is located outside the boundaries of the community it was intended to serve. Our decision hinged on the fact that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Au8\">[t]he term \u201cprivate community beach\u201d in the context of the zoning ordinance means a beach for the use and benefit of the surrounding and neighboring property owners, <em>not one for the exclusive use of a community in another area. </em>Although the uses imposed on the property by either group might well be identical, the fact remains that the residents of Chartwell cannot be expected to assume attitudes of responsibility toward the surrounding neighborhood and community control over the beach facilities as would those who reside in close proximity to the beach, that is, the residents of the Lakeland area.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-5\"><em>Delbrook Homes, </em>248 Md. at 83, 234 A.2d at 882 (emphasis added). In other words, the violative land use was for the exclusive use of the Chartwell residents, to the exclusion of Lakeland residents. As indicated <em>supra, </em>we deal in the present case with a situation where the proposed use is ancillary to and serves permitted uses on both parcels of land.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\"><em>Snyder </em>is similarly distinguishable. Maurice Snyder applied for a permit to construct on Solomon\u2019s Island Road in Edgewater, Maryland, a showroom, office, lounge, and warehouse for the sale and display of factory-built motor boats. <em>Snyder, </em>186 Md. at 343, 46 A.2d at 690. The proposed development site was located in a residential zoning district. <em>Snyder, </em>186 Md. at 344-45, 46 A.2d at 690-91. Although we concluded there that \u201c[t]he whole purpose of the [zoning] regulations is to exclude mercantile, manufacturing and trade activities from the area, and to permit therein only residential and farming activities,\u201d <em>Snyder, </em>186 Md. at 345, 46 A.2d at 691, the case involved in no way a situation where the owner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>was building infrastructure in order to support two differently-zoned parcels of commonly-owned land. Rather, <em>Snyder </em>involved a traditional, straightforward case in which the owner was attempting to establish a purely commercial use in a residential zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">In <em>Alviani, </em>the property at issue was a 1.2 acre parcel located in Anne Arundel County, and split-zoned under the applicable ordinances as C 1-B (community retail) and RLD (residential low density). <em>Alviani, </em>365 Md. at 98, 99, 775 A.2d at 1236. The landowner sought to build an automotive service facility, a use permitted by special exception/variance in the Cl-B zone, but prohibited altogether in the RLD zone. <em>Alviani, </em>365 Md. at 99, 775 A.2d at 1236. As a result, the property owner sought to have the RLD portion re-zoned as either C 1-B or C4 (highway commercial), where the facility would be permitted as of right. <em>Id. </em>Aside from the fact that the holding in <em>Alviani </em>involved principally the appropriateness of granting the requested variances, rather than an issue implicating the special problem of split-zoning, the factual circumstances are entirely dissimilar from the present case. We deal in the present case with a utilization of land ancillary to permitted uses on two parcels within different residential districts with different density limitations. The proposed use in <em>Alviani </em>involved placement of a principal use spanning two zoning districts, in one of which the principal use was prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">C. The Testimony of Paul Solomon</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Moreover, Petitioners\u2019 argument regarding placement of both the SWM facility and interior access road is based principally upon the testimony of Paul Solomon, a former employee of the Baltimore County Office of Planning and Zoning. Mr. Solomon, according to his credentials, was involved intimately with the creation of the R.C. zones. Mr. Solomon testified before the CBA as an expert witness that, because the primary goal of the R.C. 2 zone was to preserve the land within that zoning district in order to maximize agricultural output, placement in the R.C. 2 zoning district of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>infrastructure improvements supporting land located in the R.C. 5 zone was inconsistent with that goal. When pressed on cross-examination, however, Mr. Solomon conceded that there was no specific reference in the BCZR to that effect. Rather, according to him, the conflict between the zoning regulations and the placement of the SWM facility in the R.C. 2 zone was \u201cimplicit\u201d in that infrastructure may be placed in compliance with the zoning laws only when it is ancillary to a use permitted within that particular zone. The CBA, in rendering its decision affirming the Commissioner, was unpersuaded by, and rejected the testimony of, Mr. Solomon due to his inability to offer legal support for his contention. Because the Commissioner and CBA chose to discount Mr. Solomon\u2019s testimony in interpreting the zoning regulations, we defer to their expertise and ability to assess more directly how the witnesses testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">IV. We decline to Reach the Issue of Whether the SWM Facility, Under the Circumstances of this Case, is a Governmental Use Exempt From the BCZR Pursuant to <em>Glascock v. Baltimore County.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The parties\u2019 quarrel moves next to whether, pursuant to <em>Glascock v. Baltimore County, </em>321 Md. 118, 581 A.2d 822 (1990), and its progeny, the SWM facility is a \u201cpublic improvement\u201d that qualifies as a \u201cpublic use\u201d exempt from regulation by the BCZR. The debated proposition is that the SWM facility, which is claimed to be an improvement to the Property required by the Baltimore County Code, will be constructed, and conveyed in-fee to the County for the purposes of public maintenance, and thus broadly serves the public by \u201creduc[ing] as nearly as possible the adverse effects of storm-water runoff and [] safeguard[ing] life, limb, property and public welfare.\u201d Maryland Code (1982, 2007 RepLVol.), Environment Article, \u00a7 4-201. Petitioners argue that the SWM facility, regardless of whether it constitutes a \u201cpublic\u201d or \u201cprivate\u201d improvement, nevertheless is not a \u201cpublic facility\u201d exempt from the BCZR because it is a local facility which serves only the run-off from the proposed subdivision, rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>than a regional facility broadly serving a greater public. The Commissioner, CBA and Court of Special Appeals accepted Respondents\u2019 argument, concluding that the SWM facility is a \u201cpublic improvement\u201d which serves the broad purpose of maintaining \u201cthe public health, safety, and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse impacts associated with increased stormwater runoff.\u201d Baltimore County Code \u00a7 33-4-102. Because we conclude that there are no zoning impediments to the SWM facility, we need not address whether the Commissioner, CBA, and Court of Special Appeals were correct in concluding that the rule annunciated in <em>Glascock, </em>under the present circumstances, relieves the SWM facility from the requirements of the BCZR. We are compelled, however, to nevertheless discuss briefly the <em>Glascock </em>doctrine and the problems associated with applying it to the facts of the present litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">A. The Rule of <em>Glascock: </em>A Local Government, When it Owns, Leases, or Otherwise Controls Property in that Locality and Puts the Property to Public Use, is Not Subject to its Own Zoning Laws, Absent an Explicit Legislative Provision Manifesting an Intent that the Local Government be Subject to those Laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The concept that a local subdivision of State government generally is not subject to its own zoning laws, unless there is an explicit legislative provision which provides otherwise, may be traced in Maryland to <em>Commissioners of Cambridge v. Henry, </em>263 Md. 370, 283 A.2d 415 (1971). In that case, the City of Cambridge sought to build, within city limits, a waterfront public park adjacent to a city-owned public marina. <em>Henry, </em>263 Md. at 371, 283 A.2d at 416. After the permit application was reviewed, approved, and granted by the proper local authorities, several neighboring residents filed, in the Circuit Court for Dorchester County, a complaint aimed at enjoining the proposed construction. <em>Henry, </em>263 Md. at 371-72, 283 A.2d at 416. The waterfront park, according to the neighbors, would violate applicable local zoning ordinances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>prohibiting commercial uses in the particular zoning district. <em>Henry, </em>263 Md. at 372, 283 A.2d at 416. Our resolution of the case hinged on the fact that the applicable zoning ordinance provided specifically that, before any statutory right to redress was available through the judicial process, certain issues presented in the case, namely that construction of the park would impose \u201cimmediate substantial and irreparable injury\u201d on the neighborhood, needed, in the first instance, to be addressed by the local Board of Appeals. <em>Henry, </em>263 Md. at 373-74, 283 A.2d at 417. Because the claimant failed to follow those statutory procedures, <em>ie., </em>bringing the complaint first before the Board of Appeals, we concluded that dismissal of the judicial action was appropriate. <em>Id. </em>In considered dicta, however, we explained for guidance that, when the appeal came before the Board, the Board would have to consider whether the City should be bound in the first place by its own zoning regulations. <em>Henry, </em>263 Md. at 374, 283 A.2d at 417 (\u201c[Generally a governmental body that has enacted a zoning law is not itself bound by that law.\u201d) (citing <em>Nehrbas v. Incorporated Village of Lloyd Harbor, </em>2 N.Y.2d 190, 159 N.Y.S.2d 145, 140 N.E.2d 241, 242 (1957)). The reasoning behind this principle was that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-4\">[i]n the very nature of things, a municipality must have the power to select the site of buildings or other structures for the performance of its governmental duties. Accordingly, it necessarily follows, a village is not subject to zoning restrictions in the performance of its governmental, as distinguished from its corporate or proprietary, activities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-5\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Nehrbas, </em>159 N.Y.S.2d 145, 140 N.E.2d at 242).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Six years after <em>Henry, </em>we were called upon, in <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. State, </em>281 Md. 217, 378 A.2d 1326 (1977), to determine whether Baltimore City could enforce against the State the City\u2019s zoning, building, and fire codes in order to prevent the construction by the State of a correctional facility on property, within city limits, leased by the State. According to the municipal zoning laws at the time, the owner of any land within the particular zoning district was required, before it could proceed with any plans to convert an existing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>structure into a correctional facility, to obtain a specific zoning approval, by ordinance, from the Mayor and Council. <em>City of Baltimore v. State, </em>281 Md. at 223, 378 A.2d at 1329. In holding that the State was not required to obtain such an approval before commencing with its proposed conversion activities, we stated that \u201cit is a basic and long-standing principle of statutory construction that the State is not deemed to be bound by an enactment of the General Assembly unless the enactment specifically names the State or manifests a clear and indisputable intention that the State is to be bound.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Relying our earlier conclusions in <em>State v. Milburn, </em>9 Gill 105, 118 (1850), which in turn quoted Justice Story, we reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-5\">\u201cGeneral Acts of the Legislature are meant to regulate and direct the acts and rights of citizens, and in most cases, the reasoning applicable to them applies with very different and often contrary force, to the government itself. It appears to me, therefore, to be a safe rule, founded in the principles of the common law, that the general words of a statute ought not to include the government, or affect its rights, unless that construction be clear and undisputable upon the text of the Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-6\"><em>City of Baltimore v. State, </em>281 Md. at 223-24, 378 A.2d at 1329. Because Maryland Code (1957, 1970 Repl.Vol.), Article 66B, \u00a7\u00a7 2.01 to 2.13, the enabling act which granted to the City the power to enact zoning laws, did not manifest an intent that the State be bound by those laws, we concluded that Baltimore City lacked the authority to enforce against the State its zoning ordinances when the land was to be used for the benefit of the general public. <em>City of Baltimore v. State, </em>281 Md. at 223, 224, 378 A.2d at 1329, 1330. In <em>Board of Child Care of the Baltimore Annual Conference of the Methodist Church, Inc. v. Harker, </em>we extended this rule to include in the exemption the \u201cState\u2019s agencies and instrumentalities.\u201d 316 Md. 683, 693, 561 A.2d 219, 224 (1989) (\u201cThat the exemption from county zoning regulations accorded to the State under our holding in <em>City of Baltimore v. State ... </em>extends to the State\u2019s agencies and instrumentalities is entirely manifest.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>Turning to <em>Glascock v. Baltimore County, </em>the basis of Respondents\u2019 claim that the SWM facility would not be, in any event, subject to the BCZR, we were confronted with a situation where the County, as lessee of land owned by a local volunteer fire company, sought to construct in a Baltimore County resource conservation zone a 620 foot wireless communication tower. 321 Md. 118, 120, 581 A.2d 822, 823 (1990). The communication tower, a use permitted only by special exception in the zone, was intended to be utilized by the County as part of a countrywide governmental communication system serving principally as an emergency response system for the police and fire departments. <em>Id. </em>When the County failed to seek the requisite special exception, an adjacent property owner challenged on that basis the County\u2019s right to construct the tower. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">We held that, as a \u201cterritorial division[] of the State, created and organized for public political purposes connected with the administration of state government, and specially charged with the administration and superintendence of the local affairs of the community,\u201d the County enjoyed exemption from its zoning regulations, absent evidence of a contrary intent expressed there, when the proposed use was in furtherance of its governmental, as opposed to corporate or proprietary, functions. <em>Glascock, </em>321 Md. at 122, 581 A.2d at 824 (citations omitted); <em>see also Pan Am. Health Org. v. Montgomery County, </em>338 Md. 214, 226, 657 A.2d 1163, 1169 (1995) (\u201c[T]he common law provides that [the State] is not bound by local zoning ordinances unless the General Assembly clearly indicates a contrary intent. Local governments, as instrumentalities of the State, enjoy this same common-law immunity.\u201d) (citations omitted). Thus, we extended the common-law rule from <em>City of Baltimore v. State, </em>that a State enjoys governmental immunity from its own, and its municipalities\u2019, zoning laws, to include in the exemption the counties as political subdivisions of the State. Based on our belief that \u201cnothing could be more important than the potential savings of life of a police officer or a fire fighter,\u201d <em>Glascock, </em>321 Md. at 121, 581 A.2d at 823, and in light of the fact that nothing in the BCZR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>or Maryland Code (1987 RepLVol.), Article 25A, \u00a7 5(X), the grant to Baltimore County of its power to enact zoning laws, evidenced an intent that the County be bound to its own regulations, we concluded that there was no obligation that the County pursue a special exception. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>35</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">B. The Assertion of Immunity Under <em>Glascock </em>in This Case is Problematic.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">The Circuit Court pointed out that the determination of whether an improvement to the development site required by the subdivision regulations constitutes a \u201cpublic use\u201d immune from the BCZR under the <em>Glascock </em>doctrine is governed not only by whether the facility is owned and operated by the government, but also whether its use is \u201cimportant in carrying out a government function.\u201d <em>See Glascock, </em>321 Md. at 120, 581 A.2d at 823 (indicating the importance of adequate emergency communication equipment to public safety). The intermediate appellate court agreed with the relevant principles of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>law identified by the Circuit Court, but disagreed with their application to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">There are two primary problems with applying <em>Glascock </em>to the present case. First is the problem with ownership of the SWM facility at the time the exemption determination was sought and made. We are unable to locate a Maryland case in which a private developer/landowner asserted successfully such an exemption from zoning laws. In the cases in which a the <em>Glascock-type </em>exemption was asserted successfully, the proponent, the \u201cdeveloper\u201d if you will, was a governmental entity seeking to develop land which it owned or otherwise controlled at the time it proposed the establishment of the provocative use, facility, or structure. <em>Compare Henry, </em>263 Md. at 371, 283 A.2d at 416 (proposed construction by the City of a waterfront public park on land adjacent to a city-owned public marina); <em>City of Baltimore, </em>281 Md. at 223, 378 A.2d at 1329 (proposed construction by the State of a correctional facility on property leased by the State); <em>Glascock, </em>321 Md. at 120, 581 A.2d at 823 (proposed construction by Baltimore County of a fire and police emergency communication tower on land leased by the County from the local volunteer fire department) <em>with Harker, </em>316 Md. at 688, 561 A.2d at 222 (\u201c[N]o exemption exist[s] \u2018from local zoning for privately owned land used by private organizations for functions governmental in nature\u2019 [when a non-profit corporation is providing child shelter services subject to governmental regulation]\u201d); <em>Pan Amer.

Accordingly, it necessarily follows, a village is not subject to zoning restrictions in the performance of its governmental, as distinguished from its corporate or proprietary, activities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-7\"><em>Henry, </em>263 Md. at 374, 283 A.2d at 417 (citing <em>Nehrbas, </em>159 N.Y.S.2d 145, 140 N.E.2d at 242). With this principle in mind, in order for the immunity to attach to the proposed SWM facility, the governmental body proposed to receive title to the completed use, facility, or structure must have agreed pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>spectively (expressly or by operation of law), at a minimum, to accept ownership or control in \u201cadvance\u201d or at the time of the determination of exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">The purpose of requiring proof of the prospective acceptance by the governmental entity qualifying for the exemption of the proposed use, facility, or structure should be obvious. First, approval of the location and intended purpose of the proposed use, facility, or structure on the land use proposal is manifested by acceptance. Further, demonstration of the prospective agreement or requirement that the proposed use, facility, or structure will be owned or controlled by the governmental entity is necessary to foreclose unilateral representations by a private applicant. As we stated in <em>Waterman, </em>357 Md. at 504, 745 A.2d at 1010, the purpose of requiring an acceptance by the local government is to prevent a situation where a developer imposes upon the municipality the responsibility for maintenance and repair for an otherwise private facility merely by designating unilaterally the improvement for public maintenance. <em>See also Waterman, </em>357 Md. at 504 n. 8, 745 A.2d at 1010 n. 8 (\u201cIn many instances, it is ultimately to a developer\u2019s sales advantage to offer to dedicate to the local government water and sewer facilities, streets, recreational areas or other sites because, if the offer is accepted, the local government, not the future residents of the subdivision, generally will be responsible for maintenance of the facilities.

Environmental Protection and Resource Management (DEPRM), the governmental unit charged with maintaining public SWM facilities, was present at the CBA hearing at which the development plan was considered. At that time, the DEPRM submitted evidence, based on Baltimore County Code \u00a7\u00a7 14-331 to 14-350 (Regulations for the Protection of Water Quality, Streams, Wetlands and Floodplains), \u00a7\u00a7 14-401 to 14-422 (Forest Conservation Regulations), and BCZR 1A01.1.A, indicating some technical discontent with the proposed development plan. At no time did the DEPRM express any sentiment that reasonably could be construed as a willingness to accept or a likelihood of acceptance of the conveyance in-fee to the County of the proposed SWM facility for the purposes of maintenance. In this situation, mere approval by the CBA of the development plan delineating a location and intended purpose of a SWM facility proposed by the private developer does not manifest, by itself, acceptance by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>appropriate governmental unit so as to satisfy the government ownership/control requirement for application of <em>Glascock</em></p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">V. Placement of the SWM Facility and Access Road in the R.C. 2 Zoned Lot Did Not Constitute a <em>De Facto </em>Rezoning of the R.C. 2 Land to the R.C. 5 zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Prior to submission of the development plan which ignited the present litigation, Respondents sought to change the zoning of the R.C. 2 portion of the Property to R.C. 5. The justification for this proposed reclassification was that, when the County Council established originally in 1976 the Baltimore County resource conservation zones for the purposes of agricultural resource preservation in the County, the wedge-shaped 3.9 acre tract in the northern parcel was zoned mistakenly as R.C. 2, instead of the intended R.C. 5. In other words, Respondents claimed that the zoning lines were drawn in error, and that the entire northern portion should have been placed in the R.C. 5 zone. The case was heard in public session before the Board of Appeals over two days. Citing the well-settled principle that there is a \u201cstrong presumption of correctness of original zoning in comprehensive rezoning and [that] to sustain a piecemeal change in circumstance such as present here, there must be strong evidence of mistake in the original zoning or comprehensive rezoning, or evidence of substantial change in the character of the neighborhood must be produced,\u201d <em>Mayor and Council of Rockville v. Henley, </em>268 Md. 469, 472, 302 A.2d 45, 46 (1973); <em>Heller v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>264 Md. 410, 412, 286 A.2d 772, 773 (1972), the Board rendered on 6 May 2002 its opinion that there was insufficient evidence to support Respondents\u2019 argument that a \u201cmistake\u201d occurred. It therefore rejected Respondents\u2019 request to rezone the entirety of the Property located north of Sweet Air Road as R.C. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Because we conclude that there are no zoning impediments as a matter of law to the placement on the R.C. 2 zoned land of the SWM facility and access road, and because we defer to the expertise of the Commissioner and CBA in interpreting, on this record, the County\u2019s resource conserva<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>tion zoning regulations, we conclude that no <em>de facto </em>rezoning occurred by approval of the development plan. There arises from the CBA\u2019s earlier denial of the \u201cmistake\u201d rezoning application prosecuted by Respondents on evidentiary insufficiency grounds no mandatory inference that reflects adversely upon the subsequent development plan approval.

In <em>Remes v. Montgomery County, </em>387 Md. 52, 874 A.2d 470 (2005), for example, we were called upon to determine whether two contiguous subdivided lots merged for zoning purposes as it related to Montgomery County\u2019s issuance of a permit for the construction of a single-family dwelling on one of the \u201ccombined\u201d lots which, if the lots were individually owned, would have violated a number of the County\u2019s spatial zoning requirements relative to setbacks, vehicular access, and accessory uses. 387 Md. at 59, 68, 874 A.2d at 473-74, 479. The two contiguous lots were under common ownership at the time Montgomery County\u2019s Division of Permitting Services (\"DPS\u201d) issued an earlier permit for the construction of the existing single-family dwelling on one of the lots. <em>Remes, </em>387 Md. at 58, 874 A.2d at 473. The lots were assessed by the County as one lot for tax purposes. <em>Id. </em>The newer permit was issued to the respondent, a developer, who was not, at the time of issuance, the owner of record of the lot where the second dwelling was proposed. <em>Remes, </em>387 Md. at 59, 874 A.2d at 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">When the common owner, one month after issuance of the new permit, attempted to convey to the respondent the lot, the petitioner, a neighboring land owner, filed in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County a Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, seeking to rescind the sale and enjoin any future sale of the lot. <em>Remes, </em>387 Md. at 59, 60, 874 A.2d at 474. The petitioner\u2019s challenge was based on his belief that the two lots had merged for zoning purposes, <em>Remes, </em>387 Md. at 60, 874 A.2d at 474, an issue that this Court raised, but did not decide in <em>Friends of the Ridge v. Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric Company, </em>352 Md. 645, 658 n. 11, 724 A.2d 34, 41 n. 11 (1999):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-8\">An owner of contiguous parcels who erects a structure in what would ordinarily be a setback of one of the individual parcels might, under this doctrine, although we do not now decide it, also cause a combination of lots thus restricting the future alienability of the unbuilt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>upon parcel because the conveyance of that parcel would cause the property upon which the structure is built to be in violation of the ordinance. Such an owner would also risk being forced to bring that parcel into conformity by removing the structure from the setback. We ultimately concluded that, because the two lots \"were under</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AoT\">common ownership, and at the time of that common ownership, they were used in service to one another,\u201d they merged for zoning purposes. <em>Remes, </em>387 Md. at 87, 874 A.2d at 490. Our decision was based, at least in part, on the concept that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-7\">zoning merger is not a resubdivision. When zoning merger occurs, the lots remain divided. Thus, zoning merger, in effect, is an adjustment of zoning requirements. It has no effect on subdivision. Title examiners regularly consider aspects of zoning when examining titles in order to be able to indicate to purchasers the uses that can be made of a property. Those uses have no effect on subdivision regulation. One must comply with <em>both </em>zoning and subdivision requirements. In the present case, the applicant cannot meet zoning requirements because of the doctrine of zoning merger and thus, while Lot 11 may be sold, it cannot be used, absent zoning variances or other zoning relief, if any.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-8\"><em>Remes, </em>387 Md. at 67, 874 A.2d at 478. Thus, we concluded that the lot could not be sold to another party, notwithstanding the previous subdivision, if construction on that lot would otherwise violate the zoning setbacks applicable to the lots if the common ownership were severed.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">A broad reading of our decision in <em>Remes </em>might support the conclusion that zoning laws and subdivision regulations are rigidly separate and distinct. No language in that case, however, supports the conclusion that an improvement not explicitly addressed in the zoning laws, but otherwise required by the subdivision regulations, is exempt from the zoning requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-10\"><em>Wesley Chapel Bluemount Association v. Baltimore County, </em>the principal case relied on by Respondents, was a case of statutory interpretation involving whether the review process of a subdivision development plan proposed in a resource conservation zone constituted a \"zoning matter\u201d requiring, pursuant to Maryland Code (1957, 1995 Repl.Vol.), State Government Article, \u00a7 10-503, open deliberations by the Baltimore County Board of Appeals. 347 Md. 125, 136, 699 A.2d 434, 439-40 (1997). Beyond the abstractly stated principle that zoning law and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>subdivision regulations are independent, but related, concepts, <em>Wesley Chapel Bluemount </em>does not support Respondents' argument as framed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b722-8\">. Reports and plats depicting the topography of the land apparently indicate that the area in the vicinity of the R.C. 5 / R.C. 2 zoning boundary is a low point such that the bulk of stormwater runoff originating from the proposed development would flow into the SWM facility as sited by Respondents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b723-7\">. Specifically, O'Leary testified that a small amount of run-off originating from the interior access road, which began on the R.C. 5 land and traversed the R.C. 2 portion, would drain into the SWM facility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b723-8\">. Although the Baltimore County Code provides that SWM facilities must be able to accommodate runoff from \"[t]he entire upstream area, if the area were fully developed in accordance with the Baltimore County Zoning Regulations in effect at the time of the design or construction,\u201d Baltimore County Code \u00a7 33^1-410(c)(ii), there is no evidence on the record before us that there are streams or areas upgrade from the Property that will produce additional or accelerated runoff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b725-6\">. We note that it appears that the location of the SWM facility on the R.C. 2 land, as proposed, is neutral in terms of the total density and yield of the proposed development. Before the CBA, it was undisputed that the R.C. 5 land could support a theoretical maximum of seven dwellings. The development plan proposed only six dwellings in the R.C. 5 zone. Naturally, the developer is not entitled automatically to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>the maximum number of lots that a property would yield mathematically; however, nothing on this record indicates that the developer\u2019s placement, in the R.C. 2 zone, of the SWM facility maximized the achievable density in the R.C. 5 zone.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b726-6\">. We do not construe the absence of similar provisions in the BCZR for the R.C. 2 or R.C. 5 zones as indicative of a legislative intent that stormwater management facilities are prohibited in those zones. Rather, a comprehensive overview of the resource conservation zoning scheme, subdivision requirements, and the stormwater management regulations compel the conclusion that such infrastructure improvements, where required by proposing the development of otherwise permitted primary uses in those zones, are allowed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b728-6\">. In this regard, the CBA appears to have parsed the problem in different ways under different circumstances, but not so inconsistently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>with regard to its determination here. The record reflects that, in <em>In re Beth Tfiloh Congregation of Baltimore City, Inc., </em>01-468-SPH, CBA-01-136 (24 July 2002), Beth Tfiloh Congregation, owned an existing synagogue in a D.R. 1 (Density Residential) zone. When the Congregation sought to construct in the D.R. 1 zone a private school, dining hall, and gymnasium, the property owner sought also to construct in the adjacent R.C. 4 (Watershed Protection) zone camp bunkhouses and athletic fields in order to serve as accessory uses to the private school and synagogue located in the D.R. 1 zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">The Congregation attempted to justify the location of the recreational facilities by arguing that they were accessory to the school, a use which was permitted explicitly in the D.R. 1 zone. Although the CBA acknowledged that \"the bunkhouses and athletic fields and facilities [did] qualify as 'accessory uses' to the principal uses in the D.R. 1 property,\" because the R.C. 4 zone, the location in which the accessory uses were to be placed, did not permit the principal school use, the CBA nevertheless determined that the accessory uses were prohibited in the R.C. 4 zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">In contrast, the proposed access road in the present case is ancillary to a single-family dwelling, a principal use permitted as of right in the R.C. 2 rural-agricultural district. Thus, we find that <em>Beth Tfiloh </em>is distinguishable, and conclude accordingly that the CBA did not commit legal error by refusing to consider it in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b737-7\">. This holding is not inconsistent with <em>Mayor &amp; Aldermen of Annapolis v. Anne Arundel County, </em>271 Md. 265, 316 A.2d 807 (1974). In that case, the Anne Arundel County government owned land located within the City of Annapolis' historic district. When the County filed an application to demolish the historically-designated building, the City and its Historic District Commission filed a complaint for injunctive relief in order to prevent the County from carrying out its plans. <em>Mayor &amp; Aldermen of Annapolis, </em>271 Md. at 273, 316 A.2d at 812. The County argued that it was subject neither to the Annapolis historic district zoning regulations nor the jurisdiction of the City\u2019s Historic District Commission. In the course of ruling in favor of the City, we placed emphasis on the distinction between traditional and historic district zoning. Despite the general rule, regarding traditional zoning, that the County would not be subject to the laws of the political subdivision, we observed that, in terms of historic district zoning, the General Assembly manifested explicitly an intent, by virtue of Chapter 274 of the Acts of 1963, that any political subdivision which owned land within a municipal historic district be subject to the jurisdiction of that municipality\u2019s historic district commission. <em>Mayor &amp; Aldermen of Annapolis, </em>271 Md. at 291, 316 A.2d at 820. Also persuasive was the fact that the City of Annapolis and Anne Arundel County had subjected themselves to their own respective zoning laws. <em>Mayor &amp; Aldermen of Annapolis, </em>271 Md. at 290, 316 A.2d at 820; <em>see also </em>Annapolis City Code \u00a7 22-5; Anne Arundel County Code \u00a7 13-334A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b740-6\">. Although <em>Waterman </em>involved the distinction between a \"dedication\u201d and a \"condition to approval of a private use,\u201d as opposed to perhaps a conveyance in fee simple, the reasoning behind requiring evidence of prospective governmental acceptance of a dedication is equally applicable to a situation where a particular improvement is intended to be conveyed in fee simple for the same purposes as it would be used otherwise in a dedication or a reservation. Moreover, the same implications arise in that, if evidence of acceptance were not required before a conveyance takes place, any developer may unilaterally place on the local government responsibility for maintenance regardless of the nature of the improvement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b741-5\">. Respondents assert that they were required by the County to convey the SWM facility as a public improvement at no cost to the County. Specifically, Respondents point to Baltimore County Code \u00a7\u00a7 33\u20144\u2014 110(1), 32^4-302(c)(2)(i) (\"The rights-of-way [determined to be necessary and appropriate for the county to accept and maintain the public improvements] shall be conveyed in ... [f]ee Simple\u201d), and 302(c)(3) (\"The nature of the conveyance shall be established by the county.\u201d), \"[o]nce the SWM facility has been completed and accepted, Baltimore County 'shall\u2019 take in-fee ownership for public maintenance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ae1\">Respondents' argument that all SWM facilities, regardless of the circumstances, are required to be conveyed in-fee to the county for maintenance is contradicted by our reading of Baltimore County Code \u00a7 33-4-110(1). Section 33-4-110 reads, in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-6\">Upon completion and acceptance of the stormwater management devices, practices, or both:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-7\">(1) The county shall take in-fee ownership of the stormwater management devices and practices <em>designated for public maintenance; </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-8\">(2) <em>For privately maintained stormwater management devices, practices, </em>or both:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-9\">(i) The property owner shall be responsible for maintenance; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-10\">(ii) The property owner\u2019s specific maintenance responsibilities shall be detailed in a recorded deed of declaration for maintenance and access.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-11\">(emphasis added). Section 33-4-110(1), read in context, indicates clearly that a SWM facility may be maintained either publicly or privately, and that only those SWM management devices and practices <em>actually designated by the County for public maintenance </em>are conveyed in-fee and therefore constitute \"public improvements.\u201d <em>Compare </em>Baltimore County Code \u00a7 33^1-101 (mm) (defining \"private improvements\u201d as those improvements which are \"required by the county as a condition of development that are not intended to be dedicated to the county.\u201d) <em>with </em>Baltimore County Code \u00a7 32-4-101(nn) (defining \u201cpublic improvements\u201d as those which are \"required by the county as a condition of development that are intended to be dedicated to the county in fee simple or by other interests in title.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-12\">Moreover, while the Court of Special Appeals lumped together streets, drains, sewers, waterlines, sidewalks, gutters, landscaping, streetlights and traffic-control devices, and stormwater management facilities as \"public improvements,\u201d the Baltimore County Code does not pigeon-hole specific types of improvements as either public or private. Baltimore County Code \u00a7 32-4-101(w) (\" \u2018Improvements' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>means improvements as determined necessary and appropriate by the county,\u201d and includes, <em>inter alia, </em>\"stormwater management facilities\"). In other words, the code neither delineates specifically that SWM facilities necessarily are all public improvements nor describes specifically when \"designation,\u201d thereby requiring conveyance in-fee by the developer/landowner to the County for public maintenance, must occur.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b742-7\">. It is worth noting that the Court of Special Appeals drew an analogy to Maryland Code (1957, 2003 Repl. Vol), Article 66B, \u00a7 14, which denominates in Washington County SWM facilities as \"public facilities,\u201d and also to the County Codes of Frederick and Anne Arundel counties, which define like facilities as public improvements. We find this analogy inapt, if for no other reason, than that the Baltimore County Code, which governs subdivision approval in the jurisdiction where the land is located, makes specific reference to the possibility of both private and public improvements. <em>See </em>Baltimore County Code \u00a7 33-4-110; Baltimore County Code \u00a7 32-4-101(mm), (nn).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
