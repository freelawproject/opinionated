The property at issue is an 11,300 square foot parcel of land located at 115 Park Avenue, at the intersection of Fleet Street and Park Avenue, and improved with a <em>llk </em>story bungalow (collectively the \u201cProperty\u201d) constructed approximately 80 years ago by one Henry Howes for J. Roger Spates and his wife, Annie E. Spates. The bungalow, now owned by the Betty Brown Casey Trust,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is commonly referred to in Rockville as the \u201cSpates Bungalow.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">Because the historic designation of the Property may hinder substantially Petitioner\u2019s ability to raze the bungalow in order to put the land to arguably a more economically rewarding use,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Trust filed a petition in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County seeking judicial review of the historic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>designation action. The Circuit Court, on 15 October 2004, opined that the decision to place the Property in the historic district was not arbitrary on the record before it, but nevertheless remanded the matter to the Mayor and Council in order to consider the economic feasibility of preserving the bungalow. According to the Circuit Court, the Mayor and Council erred in neglecting to consider this factor in the course of its deliberations on whether to designate the Property as historic. Upon appeal by the Mayor and Council, the Court of Special Appeals, although agreeing with the Circuit Court\u2019s conclusion as to the sufficiency of evidence supporting the Mayor and Council\u2019s decision concerning historical significance, reversed the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment remanding the matter. The intermediate appellate court reasoned that the Mayor and Council was not required to consider economic infeasibility of preservation when deciding whether to include the Property within the historic district. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Since the date it was platted, the land upon which the Spates Bungalow is located has been linked for most of the time to arguably significant figures in Rockville history. Prior to construction of the bungalow, the land was part of a larger tract (\u201cThe Park\u201d)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> owned by Judge William Veirs Bouic, Sr., a prominent political leader during a period of rapid growth in Rockville in the mid- to late-19th century. Considered instrumental in securing self-governance for Rockville in 1860, Judge Bouic served as a Town Commissioner until 1867. Previously the State\u2019s Attorney for Montgomery County and counsel to the B &amp; O Railroad, he was appointed to the Circuit Court for Montgomery County in 1867, and served in that capacity until 1882. By the end of Judge Bouic\u2019s judicial career, his only son, William Veirs Bouic, Jr., also a resident of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>\u201cThe Park,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> had himself become a prominent civic leader. Bouic, Jr., educated at the Rockville Academy and Columbian University in Washington, D.C., was admitted to the Bar of Maryland in 1870. During his illustrious career, Bouic, Jr., was Rockville\u2019s first Mayor under the Town Charter of 1888, elected to the State Senate in 1897, a presidential elector, and helped form the Maryland State Bar Association. Maryland State Archives, 110 Maryland Manual 178-79 (1898).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Despite the land\u2019s historical roots prior to construction of the bungalow, it is the bungalow itself that was the main focus of the current historic designation controversy. After the death of Bouic, Jr., his estate sold to Mr. and Mrs. J. Roger Spates two subdivided lots located within \u201cThe Park.\u201d Constructed for the Spates family approximately in 1928, the bungalow is believed to have been the Spates family\u2019s primary residence during Roger\u2019s term as Rockville\u2019s Mayor from 1926 to 1932.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Spates Bungalow is one of the last two original structures remaining in what had been \u201cThe Park\u201d subdivision. It is considered by some to be \u201can excellent and little-altered example of the Craftsman style of architecture\u201d popular in the 1890\u2019s to 1920\u2019s.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> J. Roger and Annie E. Spates sold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>the Property on 5 December 1949 to Bernard and Catherine J. Poss who, in turn, sold the Property in 1954 to Mary E. Clements Offutt. Mrs. Offutt was the widow of Lee Offutt, the Mayor of Rockville from 1906-1916 and again from 1918-1920. After Mrs. Offutt\u2019s death in 1963, the executors of her estate sold the Property to Eugene B. Casey who, in 1990, along with his wife, Betty Brown Casey, as trustees, transferred the Property to the Betty Brown Casey Trust (\u201cTrust\u201d). The Trust remains the current owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">From 1980 until 1999, the Property was leased to a Montgomery County surveyor who used the bungalow primarily for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>the purposes of storage and some office space.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> When the surveyor, due to the bungalow\u2019s deteriorating condition, declined to renew his lease and vacated the premises in 1999, a structural engineer was engaged to evaluate the Property. The engineer determined that rehabilitation of the bungalow would not be cost effective, and concluded that demolition of the building was appropriate. Specifically, the engineer\u2019s report indicated that the bungalow was unusable for commercial leasing due to its extensive disrepair. The record indicates that Petitioner\u2019s consultants estimated the costs of restoration of the house at approximately $293,086.20, that the assessed value of the restored Property would be $318,000, and that the amount expended to achieve such a result could not be recouped easily through rental income derived from lease of the Property. This evidence regarding the economic feasibility of restoration, based on our perusal of the record, has not been met yet with contrary evidence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>In light of this financial picture, the Trust began the building demolition process in June 2001 by obtaining a preliminary forestry sign-off regarding the preservation of trees on the Property. A formal demolition permit application was filed with the Rockville Planning Department on 7 September 2001. The application was accepted and entered into the permit computer system on 17 September 2001. At the time of filing of the application, the Property was not designated as being within a municipal historic district.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Sometime in September of 2001, Petitioner contends a representative of the City staff informed it that all requirements for issuance of a demolition permit had been satisfied and that a permit would be issued shortly.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>On 2 October 2001, however, Petitioner was informed by letter that the permit application remained pending, subject to review of the Property by the Rockville Historic District Commission (\u201cHDC\u201d)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> regarding the historical/architectural significance of the bungalow. According to that letter, Peerless Rockville Historic Preservation, Ltd. (\u201cPeerless Rock-ville\u201d), a third-party, non-profit historic preservation group, nominated the Property for historic designation due to its link to prominent historical figures in the local government, as well as its architectural appeal. The Mayor and Council of Rock-ville requested, as a result, that the HDC evaluate the Property and make a recommendation regarding its eligibility for historic designation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The letter continued that \u201cthe City of Rockville\u2019s Environmental Guidelines recommend that buildings over 50 years old be evaluated for historic significance to the City in the event of a demolition permit application.\u201d The HDC open meeting was scheduled for 16 October 2001, at which time the HDC would hear testimony from all interested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>parties.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In the event that the HDC made a recommendation in favor of designation, the matter would be transmitted to Respondent for further action.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">At the 16 October 2001 meeting, the parties, in addition to representatives of Peerless Rockville, were given the opportunity to present testimony and other evidence. The record indicates that, at this meeting, Counsel for Petitioner submitted evidence, premised on an assessment completed by the property manager of Casey Management, that renovating the Property to the point that it could again be leased for storage would require extensive repair. Counsel for Petitioner requested at the conclusion of the meeting that the record remain open for three weeks in order to allow for submission of additional information so that the HDC would be apprised fully of the situation before making its recommendation. Counsel\u2019s request was granted, and the parties were allowed to submit additional information, including various reports by their respective experts regarding the historical and architectural significance of the Property, as well cost estimates for its restoration. It was during this time that the Trust submitted further evidence suggesting that it would not be financially feasible to restore the bungalow on the Property if it were placed in the historic district zone. After further consideration, the HDC reached a unanimous decision that the Property be designated as a single-site historic district and forwarded its formal recommendation to that effect to Respondent on 18 December 2001. The HDC, in rendering its formal recommendation that the property be designated as historically/architecturally significant, acknowledged briefly evidence of the bungalow\u2019s disrepair. The HDC nevertheless found that \u201c[t]he Spates Bungalow at 115 Park Avenue me [t] seven of the twelve criteria for eligibility as a single site historic district or landmark site\u201d and forwarded the matter to the Mayor and Council. The HDC, in doing so, observed that Petitioner\u2019s takings and economic feasibility contentions were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>\u201cbeyond the scope of [the HDC\u2019s] evaluation [at this point in the proceedings].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">A meeting was held on 28 January 2002 during which Respondent considered the HDC\u2019s recommendation for historic designation. Respondent, at that time, authorized HDC staff to prepare, over the objection of Petitioner, an application for a proposed map amendment to include 115 Park Avenue within Rockville\u2019s historic district. A Historic District Sectional Map Amendment Application was filed on 12 February 2002.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The matter was referred to the Rockville Planning Commission.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> A hearing date before the Mayor and Council was set.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Planning Commission held its hearing on 8 May 2002 in order to consider the proposed map amendment and recommended against re-zoning the Property from O-l to O-l HD (Historic District).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>The Mayor and Council held its hearing on 17 June 2002 to determine whether the Property should be placed in the Historic District Zone. Petitioner again objected to the designation and presented additional testimony that the costs of restoring the Spates Bungalow outweighed the added value of the bungalow to such a degree that the difference could not be recouped through rental income derived from the revitalized Property.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Respondent held another public meeting on 12 May 2003 and voted to leave open the record through 30 May 2003 for the parties to submit additional information. Respondent directed HDC staff on 27 May 2003 to prepare a proposed Ordinance to Grant Map Amendment Application establishing the single-site historic district encompassing 115 Park Avenue. It was the Mayor and Council\u2019s announced intent that the ordinance be introduced at its General Session meeting to be held on 9 June 2003.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The ordinance in fact was introduced on 9 June 2003. It was adopted unanimously by the Mayor and Council on 14 July 2003. Pertinent prefatory parts of Ordinance No. 19-03, in addition to placing emphasis on the relative historic prominence of the previous owners of the land on which the bungalow is located, recited the following procedural and explanatory reasons for adoption:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>WHEREAS, the subject property was evaluated for historic, architectural and cultural significance to the City of Rockville, and the Historic District Commission found that the property met the criteria for local historic designation and recommended its placement in the Historic District; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-5\">WHEREAS, the Mayor and Council gave notice that a public hearing on said application would be held by the Mayor and Council of Rockville in the Council Chambers in Rockville on the 17th day of June, 2002, at 7:30 p.m., or as soon thereafter as it may be heard, at which parties in interest and citizens would have an opportunity to be heard, which notice was published in accordance with the requirements of Article 66B of the Annotated Code of Maryland; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-6\">WHEREAS, on the 17th day of June, 2002, the said application came on for hearing at the time and place provided for in said advertisement; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-7\">Hs sfc <em>* </em># <em>%</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-8\">WHEREAS, ... The house known as the \u201cSpates Bungalow\u201d was built in 1923 and is in near original condition. The house has the hallmarks of the vernacular craftsman-inspired style of architecture: wide eaves with knee brackets, clapboard siding, exposed rater tails on the porch and dormer roofs, multi-paned windows used singly, paired and in strings of three, smaller casement windows flanking the fireplace, and a rusticated concrete block foundation where exposed. The front porch, with a stepped lintel beam framing the porch opening, the short tapered square wooden columns on brick piers, and the flanged trim with suggestions of horizontal supports separating the beam from the clapboard, contains most elements of popular craftsman style. The house embodies a distinctive character of a different time and place, and serves as a historical reminder of an early subdivision that has all but disappeared. It is one of only two structures left of \u201cThe Park.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Hs Hs * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">The house is a representative bungalow built in the 1920\u2019s for a Mayor of Rockville. This house form became a national expression of craftsmanship, healthful and functional living and simple beauty that harmonized with suburban, urban or rural surroundings. Mr. Spates had his bungalow built by a local builder in the style of the day in his small town....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Absent from the ordinance establishing the historic district was any apparent consideration of the financial feasibility of preserving the bungalow. As a result of the designation, the Property became subject to the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-8.17 of Article 66B of the Maryland Code, which restricts substantially Petitioner\u2019s ability to alter, develop, or, as in the present case, demolish the bungalow.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Petitioner filed on 7 August 2003, pursuant to \u00a7 25-100 of the Rockville City Code,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> a Petition for Judicial Review in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. The Circuit Court issued on 15 October 2004 its memorandum opinion. The court ruled first that \u201c[t]he [re-zoning] or altering the zoning of property is a valid legislative exercise of the police power by the Mayor and City Council\u201d and determined, as a result, that the Mayor and City Council\u2019s decision would be upheld if based upon \u201csubstantial\u201d or \u201cfairly debatable\u201d evidence. The Circuit Court concluded summarily that the finding of historical significance was neither arbitrary nor capricious, and affirmed the findings of the Mayor and Council in that respect. In the second portion of its opinion, however, the court found legal error in \u201cthe failure of the Mayor and City Council to consider [in determining whether to designate the Property within the historic district zone] the unrefuted evidence submitted by Petitioner[ ] which established that it is not econom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>ically feasible to renovate the building____\u201d The court therefore remanded the matter to the Mayor and City Council for consideration of that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Petitioner noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Respondent noted a cross-appeal on 19 November 2004. Petitioner took issue with the Circuit Court\u2019s conclusion that the findings of architectural and historical significance were supported by substantial evidence. Respondent challenged the decision to remand to consider the economic infeasibility of renovation. The intermediate appellate court considered the following questions in the appeal and cross-appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-7\">1. When the Mayor and Council re-zoned the subject property to the 0-1HD ... zone was it exercising its \u201cquasi-judicial\u201d fact-finding function or a legislative function?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-8\">2. Was the Mayor and Council\u2019s decision to re-zone the Trust\u2019s property to the 0-1HD zone supported by substantial evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-9\">3. Did the circuit court err when it remanded the case so that the Mayor and Council could consider the economic feasibility, vel non, of renovation of the Spates Bungalow?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">The Court of Special Appeals filed its unreported opinion on 9 August 2006. The intermediate appellate court determined first that the Mayor and Council, when it designated the Property as within the historic district, did so as the result of a quasi-judicial process. The reasoning behind this conclusion was that, because the matter concerned the re-zoning of an individual lot, and because the Mayor and Council permitted all parties to introduce evidence in a judicial-like hearing, the action taken by Respondent fell within the \u201cpiecemeal\u201d category of zoning actions traditionally reached after a quasi-judicial process. The next step in the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s analysis, therefore, was to determine whether the Council\u2019s decision to re-zone the Property was supported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d The court determined that it was supported by such evidence, thus agreeing with the Circuit Court\u2019s conclusion in that regard. The court explained that, although the architectural and historical significance of the Property was at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>least debatable, a rational faet-finder in the Mayor and Council\u2019s position reasonably could conclude on the evidence before it that the Property was worthy of designation. The evidentiary sufficiency for this conclusion is not challenged before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The Court of Special Appeals\u2019s opinion as to the third issue, however, bears the brunt of a substantial portion of the challenges by Petitioner before us. The intermediate court concluded that \u201cthe only issues essential to the council\u2019s determination of whether a structure \u2018should\u2019 be preserved is the historic, archaeological, or architectural significance of the structure.\u201d \u201cFinancial hardship and economic feasibility,\u201d according to the court, \u201care reserved for the determination by the local historic district commission who is explicitly empowered to decide whether demolition or alteration of the structure should be allowed despite such significance.\u201d The intermediate court therefore reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court an d restored to its original force the action of the Mayor and City Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The Trust filed timely with us a Petition for Writ of Certiorari to review the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals. We granted the petition on 6 December 2006, 396 Md. 9, 912 A.2d 646 (2006), and shall consider the following questions:<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>1. Whether the Mayor and City Council of Rockville were required to consider, when determining whether to designate as historic a particular piece of property pursuant to Maryland Code (1957, 2003 Repl.Vol.), Article 66B, \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-8.17, the economic feasibility associated with preserving that property if so designated and, if required, whether the failure to do so constituted a regulatory taking of the Property without just compensation?<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-5\">2. Where the trigger for review of historical significance is a demolition permit application, and the subject property is not designated as historic prior to the filing of such an application, but has been on the municipality\u2019s list of historic resources since 1986, does the withholding of issuance or final action on the permit application, pending review of the Property by the Historic District Commission and the May- or and Council, deprive the applicant of a constitutionally protected property interest without due process of law?<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">We answer both questions in the negative and therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">A. Regulatory Takings and Consideration of the Economic Feasibility Associated With Identifying and Preserving Historically Designated Property</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">\n<em>1. The Mayor and Council are Not Required to Consider Economic Feasibility at the Time of Historical Designation.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">Petitioner argues first that \u201c[Article 66B, \u00a7\u00a7 8.05-8.10, (the statutory scheme governing historic district development permits)] do[es] not ... address situations such as the instant one, where a property owner, not located in an historical district and upon whose property no historic designation restrictions then apply, files a demolition permit application ... and is then informed that the permit will be then withheld until the property is evaluated for historical significance. In such cases, [according to Petitioner,] the issue of the underlying permit to demolish the structure must not be ignored in the designation process before the local legislature, and evidence relevant to the issue of demolition, such as economic feasibility and financial hardship, must not be precluded from consideration as was done in this case.\u201d Before approaching the merits of this argument, we pause to examine the procedures by which a property, under normal circumstances, may be designated as worthy of historic significance for land use purposes, as well as the consequences of historic designation as it relates to the procedures an applicant must follow in obtaining a permit for construction, alteration, or demolition of improvements or structures on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">It is well-settled that the adoption and administration of zoning procedures are an exercise of police power delegated to specific individual political subdivisions and municipalities of the State. <em>Maryland Overpak Corp. v.

This process, at a minimum, involves a review of the Historic Buildings Inventory maintained by the City, as well as any Maryland Historic Trust documentation that may exist regarding the property. <em>Id. </em>An evaluation meeting is scheduled for the next HDC meeting following completion of the review, which meetings occur every third Thursday of the month, with notice sent to the commissioners, the property owner, and all neighbors within a quarter-mile radius of the property. <em>Id. </em>If the nomination is uncontested, the HDC makes a recommendation pertaining to eligibility for historic designation. <em>Id. </em>This recommendation is transmitted for the Mayor and Council\u2019s review. If the nomination <em>is </em>contested, however, the HDC holds the record open <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>for submission of additional evidence and the evaluative decision carries over until another HDC meeting. After the subsequent meeting, the HDC provides a written report to the Mayor and Council. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">In the event the HDC evaluation favors designation, the process continues with an application to amend the existing zoning map. A proposed amendment to the City\u2019s zoning map may take one of three forms: (1) a local amendment pertaining to a single parcel of land; (2) a sectional amendment covering a certain portion of the City; or (3) a comprehensive amendment, which covers the entire City. Rockville City Code \u00a7 25-116. In the event of a local amendment, the application may be initiated by any municipal agency or any person with a financial or proprietary interest in the property. Rockville City Code \u00a7 25-117. If the proposed amendment is either sectional or comprehensive, the application may be filed only by the City Planning Commission or the Mayor and Council. <em>Id. </em>The City Clerk, upon acceptance of the application, transmits a copy to the Planning Commission. The Commission then completes an independent analysis of the property and submits to the Mayor and Council a recommendation as to whether it should be designated as historic. This document is included in the record and is considered by the Mayor and Council in reaching its final decision concerning the application. Rockville City Code \u00a7 25-124.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Approval by the Mayor and Council is required before any map amendment application may be granted. Action must be preceded by notice and a public hearing before the Mayor and Council, where all interested persons or entities have an opportunity to present their respective positions on the matter. Rockville City Code \u00a7 25-93.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> At the public hearing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>\u201c[tjhere shall be a complete stenographic report of the testimony at the hearing, and a typewritten transcript thereof with all exhibits admitted at the hearing, together with the application, all staff and Planning Commission memoranda and recommendations in relation thereto and a list of those persons registering their appearance, shall promptly be incorporated by the Clerk in the application file and shall be considered a part of the record on the application.\u201d Rockville City Code \u00a7 25\u201498(b)(3). Within 90 days of the date of the last hearing, unless the Mayor and Council adopts a resolution stating otherwise, Rockville City Code \u00a7 25-125, the Council \u201cshall provide written notice of its decision on any application by first class mail to the applicant, the Planning Commission, and to any other person who has registered an appearance in writing prior to decision by the Council.\u201d Rockville City Code \u00a7 25-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The only legislatively-declared criteria for designation of a property as historic is set forth in Article 66B, \u00a7 8.02, which states that \u201c[f]or the purposes of this subtitle, each local jurisdiction may designate boundaries for sites, structures, or districts which are deemed to be of <em>historic, archaeological, or architectural </em>significance.... \u201d What exactly constitutes \u201chistorical ... or architectural significance\u201d is not elucidated by the statute, but we glean from the record made before the HDC, Planning Commission, and the Mayor and Council in the present case that these governmental entities typically consider twelve characteristics of a property in reaching a decision concerning designation.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> As to historical and cultural significance, the City considers whether a property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>(1) Has character, interest, or value as part of the development, heritage or cultural characteristics of the City; (2) Has character, interest, or value as part of the development, heritage or cultural characteristics of the County; (3) Has character, interest, or value as part of the development, heritage or cultural characteristics of the State; (4) Has character, interest, or value as part of the development, heritage or cultural characteristics of the Nation; (5) Is the site of a significant historic event; (6) Is identified with a person or a group of persons who influenced society; or (7) Exemplifies the cultural, economic, social, political or historic heritage of the Country and its communities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">As to architectural and design significance, the City looks to whether a property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b310-6\">(1) Embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period or method of construction; (2) Represents the work of a master; (3) Possesses high artistic values; (4) Represents a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or (5) Represents an established or familiar visual feature of the neighborhood, community or county due to its singular physical characteristic or landscape.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">City of Rockville, <em>Histone District Designation Criteria Checklist </em>(1999), <em>at </em>http://www.rockvillemd.gov/historic/HDcriteria.pdf (last visited 11 May 2007); <em>see also </em>City of Rock-ville, <em>Historic District Eligibility Information, at </em>http://www. rockvillemd.gov/historic/hd-criteria.html. The economic feasibility of renovation is nowhere indicated as a required consideration for the threshold determination whether a site is worthy of historic designation. If the Mayor and Council <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>concludes that a property is historically significant, it passes an ordinance granting the zoning amendment application. The resultant historic designation acts as an overlay zoning of the property, and is placed on the top of the existing zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">A decision to place a parcel of property within a historic district impacts directly the degree of latitude the property owner possesses in deciding how best to utilize his, her, or its land and improvements. The property becomes subject to Maryland Code (1957, 2003 Repl.Vol.), Article 66B, \u00a7\u00a7 8.05-8.10. Pursuant to that regulatory scheme, \u201cfbjefore a person may construct, alter, reconstruct, move, or demolish a site or structure located within [the] designated district of [the] local jurisdiction, ... the person shall file an application with the historic district commission or historic preservation commission.\u201d Article 66B, \u00a7 8.05(a); <em>see also </em>Rockville City Code \u00a7 25-237 (\u201cApplications for Historic District permits shall be submitted to the Historic District Commission.

When the HDC receives an application for a demolition permit, for example, it will consider and either approve or reject the application, Article 66B, \u00a7 8.05(b), pursuant to a set of \u201cguidelines\u201d enumerated in \u00a7 8.06.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">The permissible considerations are aimed at the external features of the property,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Article 66B, \u00a7 8.07(a), and are governed by the following guidelines:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-8\">(a) Guidelines.\u2014(1) A local jurisdiction shall adopt guidelines for rehabilitation and new construction design for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>designated sites, structures, and districts that are consistent with those generally recognized by the Maryland Historical Trust. (2)(i) The guidelines adopted under this section may include: 1. Design characteristics intended to meet the needs of particular types of sites, structures, and districts; and 2. Identification of categories of changes that are so minimal in nature that they do not affect historic, archeological, or architectural significance and require no review by a historic district commission or historic preservation commission. (ii) A historic district commission or historic preservation commission shall use the guidelines in the commission\u2019s review of applications.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-4\">\n<em>(b) Review of application.\u2014In reviewing applications, a commission shall consider: (1) The historic, archeological, or architectural significance of the site or structure and its relationship to the historic, archeological, or architectural significance of the surrounding area; (2) The relationship of the exterior architectural features of the structure to the remainder of the structure and to the surrounding area; (3) The general compatibility of exterior design, scale, proportion, arrangement, texture, and materials proposed to be used; and (k) Any other factors, including aesthetics, which the historic district commission or historic preservation commission considers pertinent.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">Article 66B, \u00a7 8.06 (emphasis added). Unless the HDC is persuaded that the proposed action \u201cwill not materially impair the historic, archeological, or architectural significance of the site or structure,\u201d it must reject the permit application. Article 66B, \u00a7 8.09(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">In the case of a historic demolition permit application, the HDC, in conjunction with the applicant, is obligated expressly to attempt to formulate an economically feasible plan for preservation of the property. Article 66B, \u00a7 8.09(a)(1). If no economically feasible plan initially is agreed upon, the HDC has 90 days from that date to \u201cnegotiate with the owner and other parties to find a means of preserving the site or structure.\u201d Article 66B, \u00a7 8.09(b). In the event that no alternative can be negotiated by the parties, the HDC</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>may approve proposed construction, reconstruction, alteration, moving, or demolition, despite the fact that the changes [apply to a historically designated property], if: (1) The site or structure is a deterrent to a major improvement program which will be of substantial benefit to the local jurisdiction; or (2) The retention of the site or structure would: (i) <em>Cause undue financial hardship to the owner; </em>or (ii) Not be in the best interests of a majority of persons in the community.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALi\">Article 66B, \u00a7 8.10 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">If, on the other hand, a property not designated for protection as a historic property is the subject of a demolition permit, the procedure is different. Proposed activities with regard to improvements or structures on properties not subject to Article 66B, tit. 8 are governed by the basic building code, found at Chapter 5, Article V of the Rockville City Code.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> In terms of technical standards, the City adopted, with some modifications, the Building Officials and Code Administrators International, Inc., (BOCA) National Building Code, 1996 Edition. Rockville City Code \u00a7 5-86. Under this regulatory scheme, a permit application must be submitted to the Rockville Community Planning and Development Services Department, Inspection Services Division, by the owner or lessee of the structure, BOCA \u00a7 107.2, for any number of property development activities, including, but not limited to, construction, addition, alteration, or demolition of structures located in the property. BOCA \u00a7 107.1. No work may be completed without a permit. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Section 108.0 of the Building Code governs generally the issuance of permits. Upon application, the Inspection Services Division examines all applications for permits \u201cwithin a reasonable time after filing.\u201d BOCA \u00a7 108.1. \u201cIf the applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>tion or the <em>construction documents </em>do not conform to the requirements of all pertinent laws, the code official shall reject such application in <em>writing, </em>stating the reasons therefor. If the code official is satisfied <em>that the proposed work conforms to the requirements of this code and all laws and ordinances applicable thereto, </em>the code official shall issue a permit therefor as soon as practicable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). In other words, the technical and procedural requirements by which a demolition permit is issued are less restrictive and more straightforward than if the property is designated properly as historic.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Returning to consideration of whether the Mayor and Council of Rockville were required to consider economic feasibility when determining whether to designate as historic the Property, we look first to the plain language of the statutory scheme. Our goal in construing any regulatory scheme is to \u201cextract and effectuate the actual intent of the Legislature in enacting the statute.\u201d <em>Reier v. State Dep\u2019t of Assessments and Taxation, </em>397 Md. 2, 26, 915 A.2d 970, 984 (2007) (citing <em>Deville v. State, </em>383 Md. 217, 223, 858 A.2d 484, 487 (2004); <em>Price v. State, </em>378 Md. 378, 387, 835 A.2d 1221, 1226 (2003)). Our inquiry in this regard begins with a reading of the plain language of the statutory text. <em>Walker v. Dep\u2019t of Human Res., </em>379 Md. 407, 420, 842 A.2d 53, 62 (2004). If the legislative intent is clear from this plain language reading, there is normally no need to probe further, and our inquiry comes to an end. <em>Id. (citing Allstate v. Kim, </em>376 Md. 276, 290, 829 A.2d 611, 619 (2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Applying these principles to Article 66B, \u00a7 8.02, we observe that the statute is silent as to whether the local legislative body, in designating properties as historic areas, must consider the economic feasibility of preservation of a property and any financial hardship to the landowner. By the same token, the absence from the statute of such criteria may portend that the Mayor and Council is not precluded under the statutory scheme from considering economic feasibility and financial hardship at this juncture; however, the issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>here is whether the local legislature is <em>required </em>by the language of Article 66B to consider the economic impact of preservation at the time of determining whether a site is historically or architecturally significant to be protected. We conclude that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The singular consideration indicated expressly by the General Assembly in Article 66B, \u00a7 8.02, by which the local legislative body must consider amendments to the historic area zone is whether a subject property has \u201chistoric, archeological, or architectural significance.\u201d As indicated <em>supra, </em>this determination of significance appears to be guided, at least in Rockville, by twelve enumerated criteria deemed characteristic of a property suitable for designation. Noticeably absent from the checklist is the economic impact of preservation should the property be included in the historic district. It is only after the property is designated historic and a development permit application is maintained by the landowner that the statutory scheme contemplates economic feasibility and financial hardship as required factors in determining whether a permit should be issued and on what conditions. The plain language of the governing statutory scheme indicates that, rather than the local legislative body charged with deciding finally the question of historic designation, it is the HDC in the first instance that is delegated the task of reviewing, approving, or rejecting any requests to alter, add to, or demolish the exterior of buildings on historic properties, Article 66B, \u00a7 8.05(b), and that more appropriately considers, among the other factors, the economic feasibility and financial hardship of retention, restoration, or renovation. Article 66B, \u00a7\u00a7 8.06(b), 8.09, and 8.10. It is in those statutes governing the HDC\u2019s decision to grant or deny the underlying historic area development permit, and solely in those statutes, that the financial implications of preservation, notwithstanding the site\u2019s historic significance, are mandated by the legislative scheme for consideration. Article 66B, \u00a7\u00a7 8.09, 8.10. Petitioner\u2019s demand that the Mayor and Council\u2019s historic designation decision here should be vacated for failure to consider economic feasibility because the Property, at the time of the filing and substantial completion of the review of the permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>application for other than historic designation, is not compelling. The statutes make no distinction in terms of how and in what order, relative to the processing of a qualifying permit application, a property may be nominated for historic designation.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\u201c[W]hen the statutory language is plain and unambiguous, a court may neither add nor delete language so as to \u2018reflect an intent not evidenced in that language.\u2019 \u201d <em>Design Kitchen &amp; Baths v. Lagos, </em>388 Md. 718, 729, 882 A.2d 817, 823 (2005) (quoting <em>Condon v. State, </em>332 Md. 481, 491, 632 A.2d 753, 758 (1993)). Nor may a court \u201cconstrue the statute with \u2018forced or subtle interpretations\u2019 that limit or extend its application.\u201d <em>Lagos, </em>388 Md. at 729, 882 A.2d at 823-24 (quoting <em>Condon, </em>332 Md. at 491, 632 A.2d at 758; <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 73, 517 A.2d 730, 732 (1986)). Taking into consideration that economic feasibility is contemplated specifically as a consideration at a certain point in the statutory scheme, if the Legislature intended that the Mayor and Council consider, in deciding whether an historic designation was appropriate, the economic feasibility of preserving a property in a situation such as the one presented in this case, it is not unreasonable to assume that the Legislature would have provided explicitly for such a consideration in Article 66B. Although Article 66B neither contemplates the factual scenario presented here nor precludes specifically the Mayor and Council from considering economic feasibility, the statutory scheme does not place an affirmative obligation on the Mayor and Council to consider the factor in reaching a historic designation decision. Thus, failing to consider that factor in this case was not arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise contrary to law. It was not arbitrary or unreasonable for the Mayor and Council to defer, in the first instance, to an administrative governmental body theoretically qualified to consider such economic matters, i.e., the Historic District Commission,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> in the course of acting on the demolition permit application.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>By deferring in the first instance to the HDC\u2019s later consideration of economic feasibility and withholding until that body weighs-in final action on the demolition permit, pending evaluation of the historic significance of the Property, Respondent followed the City\u2019s established procedures pertaining to the review of proposed development-related activities. The May- or and Council, on 26 July 1999 adopted, in Resolution No. 11-99, certain \u201cEnvironmental Guidelines for the Protection and Enhancement of the City\u2019s Natural Resources.\u201d Resolution No. 11-99 (26 July 1999) reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-4\">WHEREAS, <em>the preservation of the City\u2019s natural resources is important to the health, well-being and quality of life for the residents and workers in, and visitors to, the City of Rockville; </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\">WHEREAS, <em>development activity with the City </em>has, and will continue to have, an <em>impact on the City\u2019s natural resources; </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-6\">WHEREAS, in September 1997 the Mayor and Council appointed an Environmental Guidelines Task Force to consider and develop a comprehensive and cohesive method for the protection and enhancement of the City\u2019s existing natural resources <em>during and after the development process; </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\">WHEREAS, the Task Force drafted and submitted to the Mayor and Council Draft Environmental Guidelines (\u201cEnvironmental Guidelines for the Protection and Enhancement of the City\u2019s Natural Resources, Final Draft Report to the Mayor and Council of Rockville, October 1998\u201d) <em>designed to insure that adequate consideration is given the impact of development activity on the City\u2019s natural resources in an effort to avoid, minimize, and/or mitigate the impact on those resources; </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>WHEREAS, the Draft Environmental Guidelines were thereafter referred to the Planning Commission for evaluation and recommendation after receiving public input; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARd\">WHEREAS, the Planning Commission held an open house on January 7, 1999 and a public hearing on the Draft Guidelines on January 20, 1999, and, following a worksession held on April 28, 1999, did unanimously recommend that the Mayor and Council adopt the Drafter Environmental Guidelines with certain changes; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AvV\">WHEREAS, <em>the Mayor and Council concurs in the recommendation of the Planning Commission and finds such Environmental Guidelines to be 'in the public interest and to further the City\u2019s goal of protecting its natural resources.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, BY MAYOR AND COUNCIL OF ROCKVILLE, MARYLAND that the attached document entitled \u201cEnvironmental Guidelines for the Protection and Enhancement of the City\u2019s Natural Resources, Final Draft Report to the Mayor and Council of Rockville, October 1998\u201d is hereby adopted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">The purposes of the environmental guidelines, as adopted by Resolution 11-99, are to \u201cestablish a comprehensive and cohesive method to protect the city\u2019s existing natural resources <em>during and after the development process,\u201d </em>as well as to \u201cprovid[e] for the identification of existing natural resources and presenting various environmental management strategies and criteria to govern development within the City of Rock-ville.\u201d City Of Rockville, Environmental Guidelines Task Force, Environmental Guidelines for the Protection and Enhancement of the City\u2019s Natural Resources 5 (1999) (emphasis added) (hereinafter \u201cEnvironmental Guidelines\u201d). To that end, the guidelines are intended to set forth the City\u2019s internal policies<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> to be executed by City Staff, the Planning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Commission, the HDC, and in some instances, the Mayor and Council, as early as possible in the formal review process of proposed land development. <em>Id. </em>at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Under the adopted guidelines, it is the responsibility of an applicant to submit, prior to City staff review or approval of a proposed development project, a Natural Resources Inventory (NRI). With the stated purpose of ensuring environmentally sensitive design during the earliest phases of the development, particularly those stages of development which occur prior to permit application or approval, the NRI constitutes \u201ca complete analysis of existing natural, cultural, historic, and archaeological resources and [which] contain[s] specific information covering the development site and the first 100 feet of adjoining land or the width of the adjacent lot....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9. In addition to the completion by the applicant of an NRI, a pre-submission meeting should occur between City Preservation staff and the applicant during which time the participants are supposed to determine the existence of resources on the site which possess cultural, historic, or archeological/architectural significance. <em>Id. </em>at 25. \u201cAs a general guide, [according to the guidelines,] any structure older than 50 years of age or possessing architectural significance, or a site associated with a person or even of importance to local, state, or national history or development, should be examined to determine significance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Included in the given examples are dwellings and outbuildings. If the pre-submission meeting results in the discovery of a potentially significant resource, the structure should be included in the NRI map, <em>id. </em>at 25, and \u201cshould be referred to the HDC and the MHT [Maryland Historic Trust] for a recommendation as to their cultural and historic significance to the area. The final determination of the site\u2019s legal designation as a historic district is made by the Mayor and Council through the Local Map Amendment process, which includes a public hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Examining the procedures employed by the HDC and May- or and Council in the present case, it was neither improper nor unauthorized for the City to follow the adopted guidelines when it withheld issuance of the demolition permit, pending review of the historical significance of the Property. Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that we were to accept Petitioner\u2019s argument that the guidelines merely are \u201cdiscretionary\u201d and lack binding force of law,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> we do not accept the conclusion that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise improper for the City to administer its own adopted guidelines by utilizing the pendency of the demolition permit application as a trigger to consider the historic or architectural significance of the Property. The stated purpose of the guidelines are to prevent the premature destruction of natural resources without considering first their significance to the surrounding community. That the guidelines may not be mandatory does not mean that it was \u201cunwarranted, unfair to the property owner, and contrary to the authority of the HDC\u201d for it to apply the guidelines. It is the HDC\u2019s stated policy, presumably in light of the aforementioned environmental guidelines, that \u201c[a] structure that is the subject of a demolition application and is at least 50 years of age is automatically reviewed by Historic Preservation Office staff and the Historic District Commission (HDC) for significance to the City under the Environmental Guidelines.\u201d City of Rockville, <em>Historic District Eligibility Information, at </em>http://www.rockvillemd.gov/historic/hdcriteria.html.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The historic designation proceedings employed by the City in the present case were not imposed arbitrarily on Petitioner. Rather, Respondent followed those procedures outlined in the Environmental Guidelines. It was not improper for the City to determine historical and architectural significance as a precursor to a final decision whether to grant or reject a permit application to demolish a structure over 50 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>years old, regardless of the means by which the City becomes aware of the building\u2019s age.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>That the Mayor and Council was not required to consider the economic feasibility of preservation of the Spates Bungalow at the stage of the process when it determined the Property worthy of historic designation is all the more reasonable when one considers the purposes underlying historic area zoning.

The Court of Special Appeals concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>in <em>Broadview </em>that Baltimore City erred in failing to consider economic feasibility before denying a demolition permit. Even though <em>Broadview </em>and the present case arose similarly from a demolition permit application process, we conclude that Petitioner\u2019s <em>Broadview </em>analogy is flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Under the City of Baltimore\u2019s historic zoning regulations at issue in <em>Broadview, </em>the Commission for Historical and Architectural Preservation (CHAP) was created for the purposes of administering the Baltimore City Code\u2019s historic zoning provisions. Those provisions, similar to the historic zoning regulations in Rockville, were aimed at preserving \u201carea[s] in Baltimore City wherein there are located structures which have historical, cultural, educational and/or architectural value, the preservation of which is deemed to be for the educational, cultural, economic and general welfare of the inhabitants of Baltimore City.\u201d Baltimore City Code, Article 1, \u00a7 40(a). One of the CHAP\u2019s primary duties under the Code was to compile a proposed \u201cLandmark List,\u201d subject to approval by the City Council, of structures both within and outside current historic zones, Baltimore City Code, Article 1, \u00a7 40(k), which had \u201chistorical, cultural, educational and/or architectural value ...\u201d as defined by Baltimore City Code, Article 1, \u00a7 40(a). <em>Broadview Apartments Co., </em>49 Md.App. at 540, 433 A.2d at 1215. Once a property was approved by the City Council for inclusion in the Landmark List, after notice and hearing before the Council, that property became subject to the City\u2019s historic zoning laws. Baltimore City Code, Article 1, \u00a7 40(q). Of particular consequence, the \u201cprincipal restriction [once the historic designation takes effect] [wa]s that a permit must be obtained from the Commissioner of Housing and Community Development [] before any person may alter the exterior appearance of any structure within a historic district or on the landmark list.\u201d <em>Broadview Apartments Co., </em>49 Md.App. at 540, 433 A.2d at 1215; Baltimore City Code, Article 1, \u00a7 40(q)(l). Even though the Housing and Community Development Commission (\u201cHCD\u201d) was the governmental body that actually granted or denied a demolition permit, it was the CHAP that had ultimate authority over the permit applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>tion\u2019s fate.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Specifically, the permit could be issued by the City, despite the historic, educational, cultural, or architectural significance of the property, if the CHAP determined that the proposed development activity was \u201cwithout substantial detriment to the public welfare and without substantial derogation from the intents and purposes of this ordinance, and denial of the application w[ould] result in substantial hardship to the applicant.\u201d Baltimore City Code, Article 1, \u00a7 40(q)(5)(ii). If the CHAP concluded that the alteration was inappropriate and declined to authorize issuance of the permit, then issuance was postponed for up to six months, during which time the CHAP would \u201cmeet with the applicant for the permit and ... consult with civic groups, public agencies and interested citizens to ascertain what the City may do to preserve such building.\u201d <em>Broadview Apartments Co., </em>49 Md.App. at 541, 433 A.2d at 1215-16 (quoting Baltimore City Code, Article 1, \u00a7 40(q)(9)).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">In <em>Broadview, </em>forty-two structures, including the particular apartments at issue there, tentatively were approved on 17 December 1976 for designation on the Landmark List. <em>Broadview Apartments Co., </em>49 Md.App. at 542, 433 A.2d at 1216. Broadview Apartments Co. applied on 10 February 1977 for a demolition permit in order to clear the land and erect a parking structure which would accommodate the adjacent commercial space the company owned and operated. <em>Id. </em>The CHAP notified Broadview by letter, dated 16 February 1977, that the property was going to be recommended for designa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>tion, and a formal recommendation followed two days later. <em>Id. </em>The Housing and Community Development Commission notified Broadview on 17 April 1977 that it was withholding the permit pending City Council review of the property. <em>Id. </em>The property was designated on the list officially by the City Council on 10 June 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">It was not until two years later, and after a petition for writ of mandamus was filed to compel issuance of the permit, that the City conducted a hearing on the demolition permit application. <em>Broadview Apartments Co., </em>49 Md.App. at 542, 542 n. 2, 433 A.2d at 1216, 1216 n. 2. Despite a multitude of reports from experts reflecting the deteriorated condition of the property, the need for extensive repair, and the inability of the owner to recoup the costs through any conceivable rent structure, the CHAP denied Broadview\u2019s demolition permit on the grounds that \u201cthey were not convinced from the evidence that Broadview was under any economic hardship.\u201d <em>Broadview Apartments Co., </em>49 Md.App. at 543, 544, 433 A.2d at 1216, 1217. With the exception of one report, which was significantly flawed according to the intermediate appellate court, all written accounts relied upon by the CHAP concerning economic feasibility stated, in a conclusory manner and without any supporting data, that renovation was feasible. <em>Broadview Apartments Co., </em>49 Md.App. at 544, 433 A.2d at 1217.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">After the Baltimore City Court upheld on 15 July 1980 the CHAP\u2019s decision to deny the permit to demolish the structure, <em>Broadview Apartments Co., </em>49 Md.App. at 544, 433 A.2d at 1217, Broadview noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. In that appeal, Broadview advanced the following arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">1. [The] CHAP\u2019s decision denying the permit was arbitrary, capricious, and not supported by substantial evidence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-8\">2.

According to the court, \u201cthe sole evidence in the record before [the] CHAP which supported its decision was the study [which] ... failed to include any debt service, any recovery of the purchase price, and failed to include the cost of replacing the roof, even though the City itself ... agreed that replacement of the roof was necessary.\u201d The Court of Special Appeals concluded, as a result, that the CHAP arbitrarily ignored, in derogation of its duties under Baltimore City Code, Article 1, \u00a7 40(q), substantial evidence in the record regarding substantial hardship. The Court declined expressly to reach the landowner\u2019s second and third arguments that the preservation laws were unconstitutionally vague and that the failure to consider economic feasibility constituted a regulatory taking. <em>Broadview Apartments Co., </em>49 Md.App. at 546, 433 A.2d at 1218.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Petitioner\u2019s argument in the present case, advanced in its reply brief, that \u201cthe Property herein was never listed in an Historic Resources Inventory and the Trust was never given notice that the Property was being surveyed for such designation, whereas the <em>Broadview </em>site had already been \u2018tentatively\u2019 approved for inclusion on the landmark list and the owner never pressed the issue of financial hardship until two years after formal designation^] <em>[Broadview Apartments Co., </em>49 Md.App. at 542, 433 A.2d at 1216][,]\u201d undermines its attempted analogy to <em>Broadview. </em>The Court of Special Appeals in <em>Broadview </em>addressed whether the Baltimore City Court was correct in affirming the Commission for Historical and Architectural Preservation\u2019s denial of a demolition permit. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>present case, Petitioner\u2019s application for a demolition permit neither has been denied nor granted.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The HDC has not acted finally on the application. As we stated <em>supra, </em>the designation process that Petitioner now challenges was a precursor needing resolution before confronting necessarily the required criteria actually and finally addressed in <em>Broad-view, i.e., </em>a final decision on the application for the demolition permit. <em>Broadview </em>does not stand for the proposition that the failure to consider economic hardship in the historic designation process is improper when, in that case, the feasibility of preservation was not brought to issue until some time after the historic designation process was resolved. At best, <em>Broad-view </em>requires, in the present case, that the HDC, when it considers economic feasibility or hardship, have an adequate factual basis for its findings and conclusions in rendering a final disposition on the demolition permit application.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">The procedural postures of <em>Broadview </em>and the present case are somewhat similar in a sense. The process by which the property in <em>Broadview </em>became designated for historic zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>protection began with its inclusion as a proposed historic and architectural preservation district on a \u201cLandmark list\u201d under Article 1, \u00a7\u00a7 40(j) and (k) of the Baltimore City Code. <em>Broadview Apartments Co., </em>49 Md.App. at 542, 433 A.2d at 1216. This is akin to formal nomination for historic designation under the Rockville City Code. A nuanced view of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s opinion in <em>Broadview </em>suggests a tacit judicial approval of the procedure there employed, i.e., withholding action on the permit application pending an evaluation of the historical significance of the structure. <em>See Broadview Apartments Co., </em>49 Md.App. at 542, 433 A.2d at 1216. While the property in <em>Broadview </em>may have been a bit further along in the designation evaluation process than the Spates Bungalow when the respective demolition permit applications were filed, neither property was designated formally as historic at the time of filing the applications. Thus, the <em>Broadview </em>property and the Spates Bungalow were subject to normal BOCA code requirements at the time of the initial pendency of their respective permit applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Although the Property here was not recommended formally for designation until after the permit application was filed, the record indicates that the Property was listed as a historical resource as early as 1986. Specifically, a \u201cMaryland Inventory of Historic Properties Form,\u201d created originally for the Maryland Historical Trust in 1985 by Peerless Rockville, suggests an architectural significance basis for possible designation of the Property. Although updated in 2001, after the present controversy arose, the substance of the original inventory form mirrors closely the more contemporaneous evaluations of the historic and architectural significance of the Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Also the record refers to a study completed in 1999 by an architectural historian employed by the State Highway Administration (SHA) addressing the impact on the area of the Property by a proposed intersection improvement at Maryland Routes 28 and 355. In that study, Kelly Steele, the SHA\u2019s architectural historian, completed a \u201cMaryland Historical Trust [National Registerj-Eligibility Review Form.\u201d Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>the box concerning eligibility for historic designation was checked \u201cNo,\u201d the textual analysis nonetheless revealed an arguable basis for eligibility. Specifically, despite Ms. Steele\u2019s assessment that the Property was not associated sufficiently with historically significant events, trends, or persons to render it eligible for designation, she submitted that it otherwise was eligible because \u201cit embodies distinctive characteristics of a type of architecture.\u201d According to Ms. Steele, the Spates Bungalow was \u201can excellent example of the Craftsman style,\u201d and stood \u201cas a rare and outstanding representative of Craftsman architecture in Rockville, Maryland.\u201d The import of these conflicting observations suggests at least that the Property\u2019s possible historical and/or architectural significance was considered long prior to its formal nomination for designation. In that respect, the \u201cprocedural trajectories\u201d of the facts in <em>Broadview </em>and the present case are similar enough that we conclude that the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s tacit approval of the historical designation procedure there is confirmatory of that employed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">\n<em>S. The Mayor and Council\u2019s Refusal to Consider Economic Infeasibility at This Juncture Did Not Work a Taking of the Property Without Just Compensation.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Petitioner contends next that, because \u201cconsideration of financial hardship [wa]s intricately tied to the decision of whether certain structures should be preserved[,]\u201d by placing the Property in Rockville\u2019s Historic District Zone without considering during the designation process the economic infeasibility and the resultant financial hardship to the Trust of rehabilitating the Property, the Mayor and Council\u2019s decision effected a regulatory taking of the Property without due process of law or just compensation. In other words, the Trust argues that \u201cthe placement of the Property within the City\u2019s Historic District Zone has rendered the Property economically inviable.\u201d We find that Petitioner misinterprets the procedures and the property interests at stake in this case in the posture in which it reaches us.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>It is well-settled that zoning regulations are a valid exercise of a government\u2019s police power so long as the limitations imposed are in the public interest and are related substantially to the health, safety, or general welfare of the community. <em>See, e.g., County Comm\u2019rs of Queen Anne\u2019s County v.

The petitioner, in support of this contention, relied on federal case law addressing situations in which a landowner possessed some cognizable proper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>ty right in a land-use permit, its approval, or the approval process itself. <em>Id. </em>Relying upon the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Williamson Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>we concluded that the corporation \u201cha[d] not shown that it ha[d] a constitutionally protected property interest which ha[d] been denied without due process of law.\u201d <em>Maryland Reclamation Assocs., Inc., </em>342 Md. at 499, 677 A.2d at 579. More specifically, we held that \u201c[u]ntil there is some governmental determination that [the landowner] cannot proceed to operate a rubble landfill [, its intended use of the property,] under its state permit, its [cause of] action is not ripe for judicial decision.\u201d <em>Maryland Reclamation Assocs., Inc., </em>342 Md. at 506, 677 A.2d at 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">In <em>Williamson Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>the case upon which we relied principally in <em>Maryland Reclamation, </em>a developer, the respondent\u2019s predecessor in interest, obtained approval of a preliminary plan to subdivide a large tract of land in Williamson County, Tennessee. <em>Williamson Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>473 U.S. at 177, 105 S.Ct. at 3111, 87 L.Ed.2d 126. At the time of the preliminary plan approval, the County\u2019s regulations required that developers seek approval of subdivisions in two steps. The first step was the submission for approval of a preliminary plan indicating, <em>inter alia, </em>the basic dimensions of the site, the number of intended dwelling units, and the intended infrastructure of the subdivision. Once approved, this \u201cinitial sketch plan\u201d served as the basis for a more detailed final plat which, once approved finally by the Williamson County Regional Planning Commission, was authenticated and recorded. <em>Id. </em>On 3 May 1973, the Commission approved the developer\u2019s preliminary plan. <em>Id. </em>In 1977, however, the County changed its zoning ordinance to reduce the permissible density of dwelling units for \u201ccluster\u201d development of residential properties. <em>Williamson Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>473 U.S. at 178, 105 S.Ct. at 3112, 87 L.Ed.2d 126. This ordinance, as applied to the subject property, would affect directly respondent\u2019s ability to develop the land as originally intended. For reasons not explained in the opinion, the Regional Planning Commission initially continued to apply the pre-1977 regulations to respondent\u2019s initial final plat submissions, allowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>respondent to develop sections of its tract of land under the former density standards. <em>Id. </em>In 1979, however, the Commission reversed its position and began disapproving proposed final plats for the undeveloped remainder of the tract based on the failure to comply with the density requirements adopted by the 1977 ordinance. <em>Williamson Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>473 U.S. at 178-79, 181-82, 105 S.Ct. at 3112, 3114, 87 L.Ed.2d 126. Respondent filed suit against the Commission and the County, alleging that, by refusing to approve the remaining plats, the governmental units effected a taking of its property without just compensation. <em>Williamson Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>473 U.S. at 182, 105 S.Ct. at 3114, 87 L.Ed.2d 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">In concluding that respondent\u2019s claim was not ripe for judicial review, the Court began its analysis by stating that \u201ca claim that the application of government regulations effects a taking of a property interest is not ripe until the government entity charged with implementing the regulations has reached a final decision regarding the application of the regulations to the property at issue.\u201d <em>Williamson Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>473 U.S. at 186, 105 S.Ct. at 3116, 87 L.Ed.2d 126. Important in shaping the Court\u2019s view was the fact that, when the Commission rejected respondent\u2019s plat as not conforming to the revised ordinance, \u201crespondent did not then seek variances that would have allowed it to develop the property according to its proposed plat, notwithstanding the Commission\u2019s finding that the plat did not comply with the zoning ordinance and subdivision regulations.\u201d <em>Williamson Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>473 U.S. at 187-89, 105 S.Ct. at 3117-18, 87 L.Ed.2d 126. Whether a governmental regulation effects a taking of property depends, according to the Court, in large measure on \u201cthe economic impact of the challenged action and the extent to which it interferes with [the landowner\u2019s] reasonable investment-backed expectations.\u201d <em>Williamson Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>473 U.S. at 191, 105 S.Ct. at 3119-20, 87 L.Ed.2d 126. \u201cThose factors simply cannot be evaluated until the administrative agency has arrived at a final, definitive position regarding how it will apply the regulations at issue to the particular land in question.\u201d <em>Williamson Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>473 U.S. at 191, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>105 S.Ct. at 3120, 87 L.Ed.2d 126. In other words, the party asserting that a taking has occurred must be able to demonstrate some actual, concrete injury occasioned by the imposition of a final application to the property of the challenged regulatory scheme or decision. <em>Williamson Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>473 U.S. at 192-93, 105 S.Ct. at 3119-20, 87 L.Ed.2d 126.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-5\">In light of those principles of law, the Court concluded that [rjesort to the procedure for obtaining variances would result in a conclusive determination by the Commission whether it would allow respondent to develop the subdivision in the manner respondent proposed. The Commission\u2019s refusal to approve the preliminary plat does not determine that issue; it prevents respondent from developing its subdivision without obtaining the necessary variances, but leaves open the possibility that respondent may develop the subdivision according to its plat after obtaining the variances. In short, the Commission\u2019s denial of approval does not conclusively determine whether respondent will be denied all reasonable beneficial use of its property, and therefore is not a final, renewable decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-6\"><em>Williamson Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>473 U.S. at 193-94, 105 S.Ct. at 3120, 87 L.Ed.2d 126; <em>see also Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &amp; Reclamation Ass\u2019n., Inc., </em>452 U.S. 264, 297, 101 S.Ct. 2352, 2371, 69 L.Ed.2d 1 (1981) (\u201cThere is no indication in the record that appellees have availed themselves of the opportunities provided by the [Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977] to obtain administrative relief by requesting either a variance ... or a waiver from the surface mining restriction.\u201d). The denial of a proposed plat, in other words, was not the equivalent of the denial of a variance and, \u201c[b]ecause respondent ha[d] not yet obtained a final decision regarding the application of the zoning ordinance and subdivision regulations to its property ...,\u201d the Court concluded that \u201crespondent\u2019s claim [wa]s not ripe [for judicial decision].\u201d <em>Williamson Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>473 U.S. at 186, 105 S.Ct. at 3116, 87 L.Ed.2d 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Just as the parties\u2019 claims were not ripe for judicial review in <em>Williamson Planning Comm\u2019n and Maryland Reclamation Associates, Inc., </em>we conclude that Petitioner\u2019s regulatory takings claim in the present case likewise is premature. Whether Petitioner may maintain a regulatory takings claim depends on final action on the demolition permit application, during which deliberation process the factor of undue financial hardship of preservation must be confronted squarely by the HDC and Respondent. Determining that the Property should be deemed historic does not terminate the proceedings between the parties to such a decree that all that remains to be done is to enforce by execution the disposition of the controversy. <em>See, e.g., Grimberg v. Martin, </em>338 Md. 546, 551-52, 659 A.2d 1287, 1289-90 (1995) (quoting <em>In re Buckler Trusts, </em>144 Md. 424, 427, 125 A. 177, 178 (1924); <em>Walbert v. Walbert, </em>310 Md. 657, 661, 531 A.2d 291, 293 (1987)). In the absence of such a final determination of the permitted use of the Property, and in particular the fate of the Spates Bungalow, there is no way of ascertaining whether Petitioner has been deprived of a concrete property interest sufficient to render any governmental action a taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">As the intermediate appellate court noted, Petitioner equates historic designation of the Property with denial of the demolition permit when, in actuality, the former does not lead necessarily to the latter. To the contrary, once the Property was designated as historic, the HDC still must review the permit application under the regulatory scheme set forth in Article 66B, \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-8.17, at which time there will be ample opportunity for all interested parties to have adjudicated fully the issues concerning the economic feasibility of preserving the Spates Bungalow. As we have stated <em>supra, </em>whether a regulation has such an economic impact on a property that it interferes with all reasonable investment-backed expectations depends in large part on whether that regulation works a regulatory taking of the property. <em>Williamson Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>473 U.S. at 191, 105 S.Ct. at 3119-20, 87 L.Ed.2d 126. The entire purpose of Article 66B, \u00a7 \u00a7 8.09 and 8. 10, two provisions which have yet to be applied by the HDC to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>now-designated Property, consider precisely those economic impacts. In short, the filing of the local map amendment to rezone the Property with a historic district overlay zone did not \u201cseal its fate,\u201d and the Mayor and Council\u2019s decision to designate the Property as historical still leaves open the real possibility that the Trust yet may be able to demolish the Spates Bungalow.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Until there is some governmental determination by the HDC, or otherwise,<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> that Petitioner may not proceed with its demolition plans or other financially fruitful uses of the Property, there is no way to determine with any particularity how historic designation ultimately will affect the use of the Property.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> As a result, the takings claim is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>ripe for judicial resolution. <em>Maryland Reclamation Assocs., Inc., </em>342 Md. at 506, 677 A.2d at 582. As this Court stated in <em>Mayor of Rockville v. Stone, </em>271 Md. 655, 664, 319 A.2d 536, 542 (1974), \u201c[i]t is not with a deaf or a totally unsympathetic ear that we listen to the details of the financial disaster which may result because of this rezoning. Nevertheless, [there has been no final denial of the demolition permit], and, accordingly we do not find that this property has been unconstitutionally confiscated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Petitioner nonetheless maintains that \u201c[t]his matter is ripe for judicial review because the City, by withholding the Trust\u2019s demolition permit for over five years or improperly terminating the demolition review permit process, may be viewed to have made a final decision with respect thereto and the Trust\u2019s proposed use of the Property.\u201d To the contrary, no dispositive action has been taken in terms of the demolition permit application. The permit review process was never resolved finally. Rather than press that process to a conclusion in parallel proceedings to the instant litigation or via a petition for writ of mandamus, Petitioner apparently opted to litigate the dispute piece-meal, crossing its metaphorical fingers that success in a one-front war would obviate the need to go before the HDC again. We do not assume that the five year delay in acting on the permit application equates to \u201ca final decision with respect thereto.\u201d <em>See supra, </em>note 39. As stated earlier, historical designation does not automatically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>equate to a denial of the demolition permit sought. The HDC, in the wake of Respondent\u2019s historic designation decision, still must determine the fate of the demolition permit by considering the various relevant factors enumerated above, which include the economic feasibility of restoration.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">If Petitioner was as convinced, as it so adamantly contended in the proceedings below, that it was entitled legally to the demolition permit,<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> it should have petitioned the Circuit Court in a separate action, as did the property owner in <em>Broadview, </em>49 Md.App. at 542 n. 2, 433 A.2d at 1216 n. 2,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> for a writ of mandamus immediately upon discovering that issuance of the permit was being withheld pending historic review. A writ of mandamus issues generally \u201cto compel inferior tribunals, public officials or administrative agencies to perform their function, or perform some particular duty imposed upon them which in its nature is imperative and to the performance of which duty the party applying for the writ has a clear legal right.\u201d <em>Goodwich v. Nolan, </em>343 Md. 130, 145, 680 A.2d 1040, 1047 (1996) (quoting <em>Criminal Injuries Comp. Bd. v. Gould, </em>273 Md. 486, 514, 331 A.2d 55, 72 (1975); <em>George\u2019s Creek Coal &amp; Iron Co. v. County Comm\u2019rs, </em>59 Md. 255, 259 (1883)). Although a mandamus petition may have been denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>by the Circuit Court, as did the Superior Court of Baltimore City in <em>Broadview, </em>which denied the petition in light of the fact that the time limitations imposed by Baltimore City\u2019s historic zoning permit process were not mandatory, <em>Broadview, </em>49 Md.App. at 542 n. 2, 433 A.2d at 1216 n. 2, the petition for writ of mandamus might have encouraged Respondent to address the demolition permit application issue.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">\n<em>Jp. Respondent\u2019s Failure to Consider Economic Feasibility At This Juncture Was Not A Deprivation of Property Without Due Process of Law.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Petitioner argues finally that the Mayor and City Council\u2019s failure to consider the economic impact was a denial of due process because the historic designation proceedings \u201ccontravened the rule requiring a pre-deprivation hearing, absent any exigent circumstances.\u201d Petitioner finds support in <em>Pitsenberger, </em>287 Md. at 30, 410 A.2d at 1058, where this Court held that, \u201c[a]t a minimum, due process requires that a deprivation of property be preceded by ... notice and opportunity for hearing <em>appropriate to the nature of the </em>case____\u201d (emphasis added). Because there has been no infringement of a constitutionally protected property right sufficient to maintain a claim based on denial of due process, through the final determination of Petitioner\u2019s legal rights to use the Property as originally intended, <em>Williamson Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>473 U.S. at 197-205, 105 S.Ct. at 3122-26, 87 L.Ed.2d 126 (rejecting a landowner\u2019s property-based procedural due process claim on the grounds that the zoning ordinances at issue did not determine finally the permitted uses of the targeted land); <em>Pitsenberger, </em>287 Md. at 27-28, 410 A.2d at 1057 (\u201c[TJhe state action [complained of] must result in a \u2018deprivation\u2019 of the complainant\u2019s interest, and such interest must be a \u2018property\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>interest within the meaning of the due process clause.\u201d) (citations omitted), we find no merit in the Trust\u2019s due process argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">\u201cBecause the power to regulate land use necessarily places the local government in the position of potentially circumscribing a citizen\u2019s rights or expectations as to the desired use for a given piece of real property, our appellate courts repeatedly have identified the source of those powers and set forth the minimum procedures necessary to insure that these powers are exercised in an appropriate manner.\u201d <em>Rylyns, </em>372 Md. at 533, 814 A.2d at 479-80. \u201c[0]nce it is determined that an interest is entitled to due process protection,\u201d therefore, \u201c[a]t a minimum, due process requires that a deprivation of property be preceded by \u2018 ... notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pitsenberger, </em>287 Md. at 30, 410 A.2d at 1058 (citing <em>Goss v.

It is equally clear that Petitioner, or its representative(s), was present at all of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>the pertinent hearings and participated, meaningfully in the decision-making process. At the initial HDC evaluation hearing conducted on 16 October 2001, Petitioner, along with other interested parties, was given an opportunity to present evidence in opposition to designation. Petitioner\u2019s counsel\u2019s request was granted to keep open the record for submission of additional evidence. Petitioner took advantage of this additional time to submit, in addition to cost estimates of renovation, a report by its expert, Daniel Koski-Karell, Ph.D., concerning what he perceived to be the Property\u2019s lack of historical significance. At the 28 January 2002 meeting of the Mayor and Council, convened for the purpose of considering the HDC\u2019s recommendation for historic designation, Petitioner was again present and participated in the meeting. Counsel for Petitioner spoke also at the Planning Commission\u2019s 8 May 2002 hearing regarding the proposed map amendment. She spoke in opposition to the designation, as did Dr. Koski-Karrell. At the 17 June 2002 Mayor and Council meeting, Petitioner again was present, through representatives, and had the opportunity to object and present evidence in opposition to the proposed designation. Thus, a series of full and fair hearings was given on the issue of the historical/architectural significance of the Property, which was the purpose of the proceedings. Respondent issued a written opinion in which it entirely apprised Petitioner of the facts relied upon in designating the Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">In order for the historic designation proceedings to bear the flaw of a violation of due process, it must be concluded that Petitioners were not given the opportunity to be heard \u201cat a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u201d <em>Pitsenberger, </em>287 Md. at 30, 410 A.2d at 1058. As we stated <em>supra, </em>the hearings given prior to reaching the designation decision were not inadequate. The Mayor and Council gave due consideration to the factors pertinent to the designation proceedings, i.e., the historic, cultural, and architectural significance of the Spates Bungalow, while reserving properly for the ultimate disposition on the demolition permit application the determination of economic feasibility and financial hardship of preserva<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>tion. Because there remains an appropriate opportunity for Petitioner to present its evidence (even additional evidence, if it wishes) before the HDC regarding economic feasibility, we conclude that the designation procedures followed by Respondent did not deprive Petitioner unconstitutionally of its right to due process. There was no \u201cbending\u201d of the public hearing process as Petitioner alleges and, while conflation of the economic issues likely would have shortened the period of time before final resolution of the demolition permit application, Petitioner has failed to show sufficiently how the procedure followed amounted to a denial of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">B. Petitioner\u2019s Additional Contentions That It Was Denied Procedural Due Process Are Not Properly Preserved For Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Petitioner posits an additional alternative contention that the City\u2019s withholding of the demolition permit, pending consideration for historic designation, denied the Trust\u2019s constitutionally protected rights to procedural due process guaranteed by Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Specifically, Petitioner argues that: (1) the City Code provides no safeguards in terms of how long a demolition permit application may be delayed pending review of historical/architectural significance of implicated structure; (2) the HDC review process provides no statutory guidance for timeliness for making a recommendation to the Mayor and Council; and (3) Section 25-123 of the City Code sets no time-frame for when the City Clerk must set a hearing before the Mayor and Council concerning the zoning map amendment application. Petitioner argues, in other words, that the lack of time limitations governing the review process creates a situation where City officials have unfettered discretion in reviewing the Property, which conceivably could delay indefinitely a final decision on the permit application.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">An appellate court, under normal circumstances, will not render an opinion on a question posed in a case unless it appears clearly in the record that the issue framed in the question was raised in or decided by the trial court. Md. Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>8-131(a). In the context of appellate review before this Court, furthermore, the Maryland Rules provide for additional limitations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\">Unless otherwise provided by the order granting the writ of certiorari, in reviewing a decision rendered by the Court of Special Appeals or by a circuit court acting in an appellate capacity, the Court of Appeals ordinarily will consider only an issue that has been raised in the petition for certiorari or any cross-petition <em>and that has been preserved for review by the Court of Appeals. </em>Whenever an issue raised in a petition for certiorari or a cross-petitioner involves, either expressly or implicitly, the assertion that the trial court committed error, the Court of Appeals may consider whether the error was harmless or non-prejudicial even though the matter of harm or prejudice was not raised in the petition or cross-petition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Maryland Rule 8\u2014131(b) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">It is well-settled that the term \u201cordinarily\u201d in Rule 8-131 implies that this Court has some discretion, although infrequently invoked, to address and decide questions notwithstanding a failure to raise the issues in the petition for writ of certiorari or in the proceedings below. <em>See, e.g., Purnell v. State, </em>375 Md. 678, 686 n. 5, 827 A.2d 68, 73 n. 5 (2003); <em>Crown Oil &amp; Wax Co. v. Glen, </em>320 Md. 546, 561, 578 A.2d 1184, 1191 (1990); <em>Yarema v.

In the present litigation, there is no reason that the general rule should not apply with equal force to arguments not made before either the municipal zoning authority or the intervening reviewing courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The only instances Petitioner points to where it purportedly referred to procedural due process violations, prior to the petition for wit of certiorari, briefing, and oral argument before this Court, occurred in a 24 January 2002 letter to the Mayor and Council regarding the authorization of the HDC staff to file the zoning map amendment application. There, Petitioner argued that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">by withholding the demolition permit, requiring an HDC review of the historic significance of the Property and proceeding to consider the filing of a zoning map amendment to place the Property in the Historic District Zone, the City had created \u201c... a presumption of historical value [of the Property] that has caused the property owner, whose property rights are in jeopardy, to bear the burden of proving that the site is not historic ... contrary to due process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Aside from the fact that this particular issue regarding the allocation of burdens of proof was not raised again or decided before the circuit court or intermediate appellate court, the original due process argument relied upon does not involve the same subject matter as the alternative argument raised here concerning the lack of statutory time limitations. While the lack of time limitations may be related loosely to the issues of procedural due process, we find too attenuated the link between the absence of time limitations and the theory that the failure to consider economic feasibility is a violation of due process. <em>See Crown Oil &amp; Wax Co., </em>320 Md. at 560-61, 578 A.2d at 1191 (determining that in some situations, a new argument may be presented on appeal when it does not present a new issue, but is instead an additional argument under the umbrella of an already preserved issue on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b290-10\">. The Petitioner in this case is Betty Brown Casey, acting in her capacity as Trustee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b290-11\">. Due to urban renewal of downtown Rockville occurring in the early 1970\u2019s and the Property\u2019s close proximity to major roads, government buildings, and other office buildings, 115 Park Avenue is well-positioned for redevelopment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b291-6\">. \u201cThe Park\u201d was platted originally in 1888, and consisted of a subdivision of 25 lots located immediately adjacent to the Agricultural Society Fair Grounds in Rockville.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b292-5\">. Bouic, Jr., constructed a home commonly referred to as \"Boucilla\u201d on a sizeable lot located west of Park Avenue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b292-6\">. This fact was disputed at the relevant administrative proceedings. Even though Petitioner argued that \"no evidence was presented ... that Mr. Spates actually even lived in\u201d the Spates Bungalow, as the intermediate appellate court noted, Petitioner\u2019s architectural history and preservation expert, Daniel Koski-Karell, Ph.D., posited that Spates resided at 115 Park Avenue during his term as Mayor. Dr. Koski-Karell, in his research regarding the Property, discovered that the electrical panel within the house bears a 1929 time-stamp. This lead him to believe that the house actually was constructed in 1929. Pinpointing the exact year of construction, however, is not material to the disposition of the issues before this Court because it was the architectural style of the house that was responsible principally for the bungalow being designated as historic. Moreover, at this juncture, the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the historic significance of the Property is not at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b292-7\">. This fact likewise was in dispute. While experts for Respondent posited that the residential structure\u2019s unique Craftsman style gave the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>house its historical significance, Dr. Koski-Karell was of the opinion that \"[t]he dwelling at 115 Park is a derivation from a Sears House Bungalow design, which is itself a derivation from the Craftsman Style. The stylistic linkage between 115 Park and the Craftsman architectural style is twice-removed and may be fairly characterized as attenuated and tenuous.\u201d According to the Maryland Historical Trust forms completed by the State Highway Administration (\"SHA\u201d) regarding 115 Park Avenue, the Craftsman style was the dominant style for many modestly-sized homes during the time period between 1905 and the mid-1920\u2019s. Originating in southern California in the early 20th century, Craftsman bungalows were \u201ccharacterized by low pitched, gabled roofs with wide overhangs; exposed roof rafters; decorative beams and braced under the gables; and porches supported by tapered square columns that extend to ground level.\u201d According to the record, experts that submitted testimony in favor of designating the Property as historic believed that the Spates Bungalow's \"wide eave overhangs, triangular knee braces at the gables, an inset porch with tapered square columns resting on solid square piers that extend to the ground, and a gabled dormer\u201d were indicative of various decorative features common to the Craftsman style.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">We reiterate, however, that this background information on the Property is included here merely to illustrate the character of the record before us. The Court of Special Appeals determined, as we will discuss <em>infra, </em>that Respondent's decision regarding the historical significance of the Spates Bungalow was reached in a quasi-judicial proceeding supported by substantial evidence. The sufficiency of the evidence supporting that conclusion is not at issue here. Rather, the challenge here is based on the theory that Respondents failed to consider an additional factor, the economic infeasibility of preserving the Property, in determining whether to place the Property within the historic district zone. Subjecting redevelopment of the Property (and particularly the bungalow) to a host of additional governmental protections and considerations not pertaining to property not so designated is a consequence of Respondent's action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b294-5\">. The Property, prior to its historic designation, was located in an \"O-l Office Building\u201d zone. \"The purpose of the O-l Zone is to provide office space for private, quasi-public and public uses and complementary service uses and to provide a transition between general commercial and residential uses.\u201d Rockville City Code \u00a7 25-272(i). Land located within an O-l Zone permissibly may be used for the purposes of multifamily residential units; certain institutional uses such as education, child care, churches and other places of worship; commercial office space; industrial uses; medical and dental services; and retail and commercial services. For a complete list of the permissible uses of land within the various zones established in Rockville, see the \"Table of Uses\u201d codified in Rockville City Code \u00a7 25-296. Multi-family dwellings units may be constructed subject to a maximum density of sixty units per acre, \"except that the Planning Commission may approve the development of up to one hundred (100) units per acre in accordance with the optional method procedures ...\u201d as set forth in Rockville City Code \u00a7 25-326(b)-(d). Rockville City Code \u00a7 25-326(a). Other special development standards for residential uses exist throughout the code. <em>See, e.g., </em>Rockville City Code \u00a7 25-328 (providing for reduction of the minimum lot area per dwelling unit pursuant to the Moderately Priced Housing Ordinance). While retail and commercial services uses are permitted in the O-l zone, the services may not occupy more than 25% of the gross square footage of the structure, and \"shall not be visible from any public right-of-way except a major highway.\u201d Rockville City Code \u00a7 25-318.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b294-6\">. As we will describe <em>infra, </em>however, it does not appear that Respondent had any meaningful reasons for adducing contrary evidence, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>such existed, at this point. The City, from the onset of the historic designation process, was of the opinion that economic feasibility would not play a role in the present controversy until, if at all, the Property was designated as historic and consideration of the permit application to raze the bungalow pursued to a conclusion. Subsequent indications to this Court, as well as the courts below, suggest that Respondent would take issue with the methodology used in arriving at Petitioner\u2019s cost estimates, namely the failure of those estimates to take into consideration the application of Rockville\u2019s \"smart codes\u201d that might reduce appreciably the cost of restoration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b295-6\">. The record indicates that the Property was identified as a \"historical resource\u201d as early as 1986. Nonetheless, it had not been designated formally as a historic site.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b295-7\">. The record is unclear exactly who informed Petitioner that the permit was ready to be issued. Wanda Shiers, a representative of the Trust who was responsible for filing the demolition permit application and pursuing the permit's issuance, posited at the 17 June 2002 hearing before Respondent that she began meeting with City staff in July 2001 regarding the Trust\u2019s desire to raze the bungalow, and was given a checklist of agencies and public utilities that had to sign off on the project before the demolition permit application could be filed formally. Petitioner\u2019s counsel declaimed at the 16 October 2001 Historic District Commission meeting that, after the proper utilities signed off on the project and the permit application was filed, an unnamed individual from the City Planning Department informed Ms. Shiers and Casey Management, another representative of the Trust, that no plans were necessary because it was only a demolition permit application and that the permit would issue after the Forestry Department reviewed the Property. Ms. Shiers's recollection of the correspondence between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>representatives of the Trust and the City is consistent with Counsel for Petitioner\u2019s statements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b296-5\">.

Whether Article 66B \u00a7 8.01 et seq., of the Maryland Annotated Code precludes the Rockville Mayor and Council from considering economic feasibility and financial hardship when reviewing properties for historic designation and whether such an analysis is appropriate where the trigger for the review is a demolition permit application?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-9\">2. Whether the process followed by the City of Rockville in withholding Petitioners\u2019 demolition permit, pending historic review of the Property by the [HDC] and consideration of the map amendment to place the property in the historic district by the Mayor and Council, violated Petitioners\u2019 procedural due process rights?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b304-8\">. Petitioner\u2019s brief, to our reading, is somewhat unclear in this regard. Petitioner\u2019s brief is divided into two portions. The first addresses whether the initial withholding of the permit, pending review by the HDC and Respondent of historical significance, violated Petitioner\u2019s right to procedural due process. The second major heading addresses whether the Mayor and Council was required to consider financial hardship and economic feasibility when reviewing the Properties for historic designation. Although the portions of the brief pertaining primarily to economic feasibility do not refer in so many words to a regulatory takings thesis (Petitioner tackles that issue in the former section of its brief), Petitioner makes specific allusion to impairment of the economic viability of the Property as a result of historic designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b304-9\">. As already indicated, the somewhat circular nature of the reasoning in Petitioner\u2019s brief sheds little light on the substance of its argument beyond the \"obvious shortcomings\u201d alleged by Petitioner with regard to the action of the Mayor and Council and the analyses of the Circuit Court and Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b306-6\">.

Petitioner argues that it was legal error for the Mayor and Council and the HDC to apply the guidelines to the demolition permit application because the \"Environmental Guidelines\u201d are goal-oriented \"discretionary\u201d guidelines, rather than binding law. Because the environmental guidelines were adopted by resolution, rather than ordinance, something more informal in terms of its binding nature is implied. <em>See Inlet Assoc. v. Assateague House Condo. Assoc., </em>313 Md. 413, 427-28, 545 A.2d 1296, 1301-04 (1988). We note additionally the difference between goal-oriented standards for environmental quality and mandatory regulations. <em>See Rochow v. Maryland Nat'l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>151 Md.App. 558, 603-04, 827 A.2d 927, 954-55 (2003) (describing the differences between goal-oriented \"standards for environmental noise\u201d and mandatory noise exposure m\u00e1ximums) (citing <em>Anne Arundel County Fish &amp; Game Conservation Ass\u2019n, Inc. v.

The guidelines speak in terms of the \"goals\u201d to be attained in protecting the City\u2019s natural, cultural, historic, and architectural resources, and contain some discretionary language, <em>see, e.g., </em>Environmental Guidelines, <em>supra, </em>at 25 (\"The existence of significant cultural, historic, or archeological resources on a site <em>should </em>be determined at a pre-submission meeting with City Preservation staff.

At the same time, however, the guidelines also contain more directory language. <em>See, e.g., </em>Environmental Guidelines, <em>supra, </em>at 7-8 (\"Deviations from these Guidelines may be allowed when it can be satisfactorily demonstrated that strict compliance would unreasonably impact development of the site or undermine other environmental or planning considerations, provided that it can be demonstrated that safety, City road standards, storm drainage, SWM, erosion and sediment control, forest conservation, stream protection, park buffers, engineering, design, and planning issues can be satisfactorily addressed.

Even were we to view the HDC's policy as self-serving and published on its website solely as a consequence of the present litigation, the Environmental Guidelines, created and adopted by the City of Rockville years prior to the filing of the permit application to demolish the Spates Bungalow, provide specifically for a review of historic significance prior to permit approval for development activities.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b322-5\">. We reject Petitioner\u2019s argument that the Environmental Guidelines were intended to apply only to larger development projects, and not to relatively small sites such as 115 Park Avenue. Petitioner relies on the following language from the guidelines: \"[These environmental guidelines] are intended ... to be administered in concert with other planning goals. Examples of other factors that shall be taken into consideration are: infrastructure requirements; open space objectives for public parks and forest conservation; and prior commitments to landowners, neighborhoods and individual citizens, among others. <em>Particular flexibility may be necessary where the Guidelines are applied to small lots and/or re-development proposals.\" </em>Environmental Guidelines, <em>supra, </em>at 7 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Indeed, \"[tjhese Guidelines allow for flexibility to best achieve environmental and other planning objectives on a site-by-site basis.\u201d <em>Id. \u201cWhen flexibility in a particular application of the Environmental Guidelines is requested, \u00a1however,] the developer will be expected to include a mitigating or offsetting component within the overall development proposal.

The guidelines do not indicate, as Petitioner argues, that the \"Environmental Guidelines requirements were not applicable to this property as they are intended to apply to sites with larger planned development.\u201d Nowhere in the guidelines is it stated that they were not intended to apply to small development sites. The guidelines merely indicate that they should be applied in a <em>flexible manner </em>when a smaller site is involved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b322-7\">. Nor did the City\u2019s referral to the HDC and Mayor and Council constitute a failure to follow its own ordinances and regulations. <em>See United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, </em>347 U.S. 260, 268, 74 S.Ct. 499, 504, 98 L.Ed. 681 (1954). A plain reading of the BOCA code, which governs the issuance of development permits for property not declared historically significant at the time a demolition permit application is filed, indicates that permits may not be issued until it is determined that the permit would otherwise comport with other rules, regulations, ordinances, or statutes. Section 101.2 of the BOCA provides, for example, that \"[tjhese [BOCA] regulations shall control all matters concerning the construction, ..., demolition, ..., and shall apply to existing or proposed buildings and structures, <em>except as such matters are otherwise provided for in other ordinances or statutes, or in the rules and regulations authorized for promulgation under the provisions of this code.\" </em>(emphasis added). BOCA \u00a7 108.1, furthermore, requires \"[tjhe code official [to] examine or cause to be examined all applications for permits and amendment thereto within a reasonable time after filing.\u201d Only <em>\"[when] the code official is satisfied that the proposed work conforms to the requirements of this code and all laws and ordinances applicable thereto, </em>[that] the code official shall issue a permit therefor as soon as practicable.\u201d BOCA \u00a7 108.1. Thus, the BOCA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>provides that the permit authority must issue the permit as soon as possible only upon a finding that the permit comports otherwise with all applicable laws, regulations, and ordinances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b323-6\">.

Petitioners also argued before the Historic District Commission (by letter dated 16 October 2001) and again before the Mayor and Council (by letter dated 24 January 2002) that, in light of <em>Broadview Apartments Co. v. Commission for Historical and Architectural Preservation, </em>49 Md.App. 538, 433 A.2d 1214 (1981), \"even if the [HDC] were inclined to favor designation despite the facts disproving the [Property's architectural and historical significance, consideration must be given to the impracticability of renovating and maintaining the [P]roperty. The Maryland Court of Appeals has held that the designation of a property as historic <em>may result in a taking where renovation of the property is not economically feasible.\" </em>Aside from the fact that <em>Broadview </em>was a Court of Special Appeals\u2019s opinion from which this Court denied a petition for writ of certiorari, 291 Md. 773, 433 A.2d 1214 (1981), the intermediate appellate court in that case declined expressly to address a takings claim asserted by the land owner. <em>Broadview Apartments Co. v.

Under the statutory scheme, the HCD could issue a permit only upon the CHAP approval, which came in the form of either a Certificate of Appropriateness or a Notice to Proceed. <em>Broadview Apartments Co., </em>49 Md.App. at 540, 433 A.2d at 1215; Baltimore City Code, Article 1, \u00a7 40(q)(3). The CHAP would issue a Certificate of Appropriateness when it determined that alteration was \"appropriate to the preservation of\" the structure. <em>Broadview Apartments Co., </em>49 Md.App. at 540, 433 A.2d at 1215; Baltimore City Code, Article 1, \u00a7 40(q)(5)(i). A Notice to Proceed, on the other hand, came into play when the proposed alteration was not appropriate for preservation, but nevertheless was necessary because of some other factor, such as the financial hardship of preservation upon the property owner. <em>Broadview Apartments Co., </em>49 Md.App. at 540-41, 433 A.2d at 1215; Baltimore City Code, Article 1, \u00a7 40(q)(5)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b329-6\">. Although consideration of the demolition permit application by the HDC was not stayed formally by the Mayor and Council or the Circuit Court while Petitioner pursued judicial review of the historical designation decision, the procedural progression of the case produced a like result through implied acquiescence. The 2 October 2001 letter sent from Respondent to Petitioner stated expressly that the permit review process was going to be paused pending an evaluation of the historic/architectural significance of the Property by the HDC and Respondent. The Property was placed in the historic zone on 14 July 2003, and Petitioner sought promptly thereafter, on 7 August 2003, judicial review of the designation. The series of appeals leading up to the present case before this Court ensued in close succession. Specifically, the Circuit Court rendered its memorandum opinion on 15 October 2004. Cross-appeals were noted on 19 November 2004 with the Court of Special Appeals. The intermediate appellate court filed its opinion on 9 August 2006, and Petitioner sought a writ of certiorari from this Court shortly thereafter. By virtue of filing a petition for judicial review immediately following the designation of the Property as within the historic district, Petitioner, in effect, elected to defer pursuing a final decision on the permit application, where economic feasibility and hardship clearly would be in play, in favor of litigating the historic designation decision-making process fully, i.e., approaching the dispute <em>in seriatim, </em>rather than proceeding concurrently, before having possibly to proceed before the HDC.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b335-6\">. Maryland Reclamation Associates, Inc., consummated the sale under the assumption that the property would be able to be used as a rubble landfill based on its inclusion in the waste management plan. Also important at closing was the approval of the first phase of a three phase permit process necessary to operate a landfill. <em>Maryland Reclamation Assocs., Inc. v. Harford County, </em>342 Md. 476, 481, 677 A.2d 567, 569-70 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b335-7\">.

When asked at oral argument whether it was mounting a takings argument, Maryland Reclamation insisted that it was not. Despite this, however, \"[b]oth in the circuit court and in its brief in this Court, [the petitioner] relied upon principles and cases relating to the question of whether particular governmental regulation of a landowner\u2019s use of his property had gone so far as to constitute a 'taking' of the properly without just compensation in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Just Compensation Clause of the Fifth Amendment and/or Article III, \u00a7 40, of the Constitution of Maryland.\u201d <em>Maryland Reclamation Assocs., Inc., </em>342 Md. at 488, 677 A.2d at 573.

Maryland Code (1957, 2003 Repl.Vol.), Article 66B, \u00a7 8.15, provides that \"[a]ny person aggrieved by a decision of a historic district commission or historic preservation commission may appeal the decision in the manner provided for an appeal from the decision of the zoning board or commission of the local jurisdiction.\u201d Rockville City Code provides furthermore that \"[a]ny person aggrieved by an decision of the [Historic District] Commission may appeal the same to the Circuit Court for [Montgomery County]. Such appeal shall be taken according to the Maryland Rules as set forth in Chapter 1100, Subtitle B.\u201d Rockville City Code \u00a7 25-75. This includes any decision related to the issuance or denial of a permit application for the demolition of the structure located within the municipal boundaries of the City of Rockville.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b341-7\">. Paul T. Glasgow, Rockville City Attorney, was of the opinion that the bifurcated procedure employed by the City in this case was proper. In response to Petitioner\u2019s argument made at one of the initial hearings regarding historical designation of 115 Park Avenue that, under Maryland law, the City was required to consider economic feasibility of restoring the property at that point in time, he replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\">Well, at this point, ..., the issue is really not joined, so to speak. The case that was referred to here was the situation where there was a pending permit before the agency. Here we\u2019re not at that step.... We\u2019re at the point now of de signati[ng] this as a historic designation. After that, then depending upon what the property owner wants to do, they will have to come in for a permit. At that time, depending upon what they\u2019re asking for and what the commission determines, then the question would be appropriate, you know, is there an issue of economic unfeasibility or is there no economic possibility of saving the structure? Then that would be the time when that is right\u2014when they actually come in for a permit seeking demolition. At this stage, though, that issue does not come up.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AhF\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>He continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmL\">At this point in time, it\u2019s just a question of whether or not this particular property has such a historic significance that it should be considered and placed in\u2014or architectural significance or archeological significance that it should be in the historic district. If, as the Mayor said, you determine that it is of such significance, then it is put in the district.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVH\">At that point, on a case-by-case basis, then they would address the question of feasibility of renovation and whether or not an economically feasible plan could be developed to preserve the structure or what have you. So that right now that is not an issue under Maryland law where you are right now. That could become an issue before the Historic District Commission when a permit is presented for some sort of demolition or for altering the structure in some way.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"46\">\n<p id=\"b343-6\">. While Petitioner in its brief attempted to argue that it was not insisting on a property right in the permit itself, it made reference repeatedly that \u201cthe designation process in this case was triggered only after the Trust (1) filed an application for a demolition permit; (2) had been notified by the City that all requirements for the demolition permit had been satisfied; (3) was advised that the City would sign the permit; and (4) was told it could pick up the permit.\u201d Petitioner also argued in its brief to this Court that \"[s]ubsection 108.1 [of the BOCA], \u2018Action on Application,\u2019 requires that permits be examined 'within a reasonable time after filing\u2019 and that if the reviewer \u2018is satisfied\u2019 that the \u2018proposed work conforms\u2019 to code requirements and \u2018applicable\u2019 laws and ordinances, the Development Services Department 'shall issue\u2019 the permit \u2018as soon as practicable.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"47\">\n<p id=\"b343-7\">. There, Broadview sought in a separate cause of action a writ of mandamus on the grounds that, because of the two year delay between the date of application for a demolition permit and the eventual hearing on the permit application, the Commissioner of Housing and Community Development was \u201cwithout authority to withhold the requested permit.\u201d <em>Broadview, </em>49 Md.App. at 542 n. 2, 433 A.2d at 1216 n. 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"48\">\n<p id=\"b344-9\">. It should also be noted that, even if the Court of Special Appeals's opinion in <em>Broadview </em>may be read to stand for the proposition that failure to consider economic feasibility may amount to a taking, we note that the takings claim in <em>Broadview </em>was ripe because there was a final disposition by the CHAP and the HCD on the merits of the demolition permit application.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
