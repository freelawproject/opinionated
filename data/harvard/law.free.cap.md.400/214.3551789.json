Wingerter, the respondent,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was convicted, following the tender of a guilty plea in the United States District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>for the Eastern District of Virginia, of misprision of a felony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In consideration of the plea of guilty, the United States Government dismissed the remaining counts of a multi-count Indictment that earlier had been filed against him. The respondent was thereafter sentenced to a period of imprisonment, a year of supervised release, community service and a fine. Subsequently, Bar Counsel, acting on behalf, and with the approval, of the petitioner, the Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland, filed in this Court, pursuant to Maryland Rules 16-751<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 16-771,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a Petition for Disciplinary or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Remedial Action. In that petition, referencing the respondent\u2019s conviction and, indeed relying on it, the respondent was charged with violating Rule 8.4, Misconduct,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, as adopted by Maryland Rule 16-812.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">We referred the case, pursuant to Rule 16-752(a),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to the Honorable Richard H. Sothoron, Jr., of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, for hearing pursuant to Rule 16-757(c).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Following that hearing, Judge Sothoron found facts, by clear and convincing evidence, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>\u201c1. Respondent Rex B. Wingerter, a member of the Maryland Bar since 1986, entered a plea of guilty in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia (Judge Ellis) on August 26, 2005, by way of a criminal information, to \u2018misprision of a felony,\u2019 in violation of 18 U.S.C., Section 4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-4\">\u201c2. The charge of \u2018misprision of a felony\u2019 is a felony under Federal law and carries a penalty of not more than three years, in addition to being fined.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-5\">\u201c3. That the transcript of the August 26, 2005, plea proceedings clearly reflected the voluntariness of the Respondent\u2019s plea and the fact that he was represented by competent and experienced counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-6\">\u201c4. That the written plea agreement and related statements of facts entered into the record on August 26, 2005, clearly and concisely described the nature and extent of Respondent\u2019s criminal culpability in committing a misprision of a felony, the time frame of which covered a period from 2000-2004.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-7\">\u201c5. That the statement of facts is unambiguous in describing dishonest, fraudulent and deceitful conduct by the Respondent over a time frame from 2000 to 2004 while Respondent was employed as in-house counsel for Global Recruitment and Immigration Services, Inc. (GRIS) based in Falls Church, Virginia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-8\">\u201c6. That the conduct referenced in paragraph 5 included but was not limited to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-9\">\u201ca. Respondent\u2019s awareness that his signature on various immigration documents was being forged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-10\">\u201cb. Respondent\u2019s awareness that the signatures of immigrant clients of GRIS were being forged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-11\">\u201cc. Respondent\u2019s awareness that a light box was being utilized to forge signatures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-12\">\u201cd. Respondent\u2019s awareness that hundreds of ETA 750 applications were submitted on behalf of Cleaners of America (a potential employer of immigrant clients of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>GRIS) even though Cleaners of America did not have the capacity to hire such large numbers of immigrants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-4\">\u201ce. Respondent\u2019s awareness that he was not, in his capacity as GRIS\u2019 in house legal counsel, the attorney of record for the applicants referenced in paragraph d. \u201cf. Respondent\u2019s awareness that GRIS was under investigation by the Federal government regarding the submission of hundreds of ETA 750 forms on behalf of immigrant clients.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-5\">\u201cg. Respondent\u2019s awareness [that] GRIS was misinforming its immigrant clients regarding the status of their ETA 750 applications.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-6\">\u201ch. Respondent\u2019s awareness of GRIS charging its immigrant clients fees to prepare ETA 750 forms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-7\">\u201c7. That the conduct referred to in paragraph 6 and its subparts was never reported in any manner to law enforcement authorities by the Respondent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-8\">\u201c8. That Respondent was sentenced by [Judge Ellis, consistent with the plea agreement and as the hearing court had earlier reported III, and that] this sentence was within the Federal guideline range and much more lenient than sentences imposed as to other GRIS principals.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-9\">\u201c9. That as of the date of the November 8, 2006, Attorney Grievance hearing before this Court, Respondent had successfully completed serving his six months of incarceration in Cumberland, Maryland, and was currently serving his six months of community confinement in Rockville, Maryland.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">The hearing court concluded that the charge of misprision of a felony, while not a crime in Maryland \u201cqualifies as a serious crime in accord with Maryland [Rule] 16.701(k)(3).\u201d It concluded further that it was supported by \u201cthe unequivocal and unambiguous statement of facts\u201d offered as the factual basis for the plea and that the conduct establishing that charge \u201cconstituted misconduct as defined by Rule 8.4(b) and (c), Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct.\u201d Indeed, the hearing court expressly determined, by clear and convincing evidence, that \u201cRespondent committed a criminal act involving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>dishonesty, fraud and misrepresentation, which reflected adversely on his honesty, trustworthiness and fitness as a lawyer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">Rule 8.4 (b) and (c) proscribe, respectively, criminal acts which call into question a lawyer\u2019s honesty or trustworthiness and conduct \u201cinvolving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\u201d In determining that misprision of a felony was a proper predicate for those misconduct charges, to which the respondent was called to answer, the hearing court relied on the factual basis for the respondent\u2019s plea, as indicated. It also relied on the plea agreement itself, noting that, in that agreement, the respondent indicated that he was pleading guilty \u201cbecause [he was] in fact guilty of the charged offense,\u201d that he \u201cadmitted] the facts set forth in the statement of facts filed with this plea agreement and agree[d] that those facts establish guilt of the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d With regard to the factual basis for the plea, significantly, the respondent, having acknowledged the existence, timing and details of, and the participants engaged in, the conspiracy to commit immigration fraud, making false statements and encouraging aliens to enter the United States unlawfully, identified by the government, confessed that he not only</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-5\">\u201cdid not notify federal judicial or law enforcement authorities of the fraud [or] take steps to stop the fraud[, he] took at least two steps to conceal the crime. First, [he] instructed employees at Global to start writing their initials next to his signature whenever they forged it, but further instructed the same employees to refrain from marking their initials whenever they forged an immigrant\u2019s or an employer\u2019s signature on an ETA 750 application[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] (or related documents). [He] instructed the employees so because he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>concerned that if the employees began to initial the forged signatures of the immigrants and employers on the ETA 750 applications, the initials would expose the fact that the signatures were in fact forgeries. Second, [he] repeatedly informed the Department of Labor and certain immigrant clients that certain of the employer sponsors had decided to abandon certain ETA 750 applications for economic reasons when in fact he knew or should have known that it was because the government was investigating Global.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Statement of Facts, Paragraph 8. As significantly, the respondent acknowledged, in paragraph 9 of the statement of facts, that he \u201cabused a position of public trust in the commission of his offense,\u201d and, in paragraph 11, that the actions in which he engaged and which were recounted in. the statement of facts \u201cwere in all respects knowing and deliberate, and were not committed by mistake, accident, or other innocent reason.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ar5\">In addition, the hearing court determined that the plea and sentencing proceedings are confirmatory. The respondent admitted during the plea proceedings that he was aware of the conspiracy, that \u201che saw acts that should have led [him] to understand and realize that the ... there was a conspiracy to fraudulently bring in non-citizens into the United States.\u201d That conspiracy consisted of forging signatures of the aliens and reporting false job offers and job descriptions. Moreover, having heard the recitation of the statement of facts by the Assistant United States Attorney, who, in addition to reiterating the facts surrounding the fraud conspiracy, repeated, detailing the specifics, the respondent\u2019s admission that he took \u201cactive steps to ... conceal the fraud, and not to report it to competent authorities,\u201d the respondent responded, \u201cYes, your Honor,\u201d to the trial judge\u2019s inquiry as to its truth and accuraey.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Consistently, the respondent, at the sentencing proceeding, in allocution, advised the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-7\">\u201c... I am before this Court to be sentenced for misprision of a felony, for failing to report what I believed to be fraudulent contact\u2014to be fraudulent conduct at my former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>place of employment, Global Recruitment and Immigration Services.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-4\">\u201cI make no excuses for my conduct. I made a series of bad choices during my tenure at Global and I and my family have suffered tremendously from my actions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The hearing court also made findings with regard to the respondent\u2019s testimony in mitigation. They are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-6\">\u201c13. That the Respondent, by way of his testimony presented at the November 8, 2006, attorney grievance hearing, contradicted the unambiguous statement of facts that served as the factual basis of his plea. Specifically, the Respondent:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-7\">\u201ca. disputed the time frame as to when he became aware of any wrongdoing by. GRIS principals;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\">\u201cb. disputed committing any fraudulent conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-9\">\u201cc. disputed possessing any criminal intent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-10\">\u201cd. attributed his actions to bureaucratic sloppiness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-11\">\u201c14. That the Respondent\u2019s testimony on November 8, 2006, focused upon minimizing his criminal culpability as outlined in the unambiguous statement of facts referenced herein. Further, this position contradicted Respondent\u2019s admission, without excuse, of guilt before Judge Ellis at both the plea and sentencing proceedings of August 26 and November 18, 2005, respectively.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-12\">\u201c15. That Respondent\u2019s testimony on November 8, 2006, reflected little, if any, remorse regarding his conduct as in house counsel for GRIS and the resulting plea and sentencing for misprision of a felony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-13\">\u201c16. That the character evidence presented at the November 8, 2006, hearing, in addition to prior character references provided at the sentencing hearing on November 18, 2005, all confirmed, as did the pre sentence investigation, that the Respondent enjoyed a well earned reputation as a respected member of the bar (prior to his employment with GRIS), specializing in immigration law, a community activist, a provider of pro bono services, and devoted husband and father of two teenage children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>\u201c17. That other than the findings set forth in paragraph 16, the Respondent has failed to prove by preponderance of evidence, any additional mitigating factors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The same factors\u2014the plea agreement, the statement of facts in support, the respondent\u2019s responses during the plea and sentencing proceedings\u2014that supported the Rule 8.4 findings and conclusion, the hearing court found undermined and, indeed, all but negated, the respondent\u2019s mitigation testimony. Accordingly, it rejected that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">The respondent, unlike the petitioner, that took no exceptions to either the hearing court\u2019s findings of fact or conclusions of law, filed <em>Exceptions of Rex B. Wingerter, Respondent, To The Findings And Conclusions Of The Hearing Judge And Opposition To The Recommendation Of Petitioner. </em>In that pleading, he took three exceptions to the findings of facts made by the hearing court and the conclusions it drew and offered his reasons for urging this Court to reject the recommendation of disbarment made by the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">The thrust of the first exception, to Paragraph 4, was to dispute the clarity and conciseness with which his criminal conduct was described. Thus, noting that he was not alleged to have been \u201ca direct co-conspirator,\u201d only \u201cthat he was present at Global Recruitment and Immigration Service, Inc. ... at the time in question as in-house counsel, and that during that time, and based on his activities, he came to have an awareness that the conspirators were committing the immigration crimes in question,\u201d and that there was no specific allegation, either in the plea agreement or the statement of facts in support of that agreement, of a definite time frame when the respondent became aware of those crimes, the respondent argues that \u201cParagraph 4 of the Hearing Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law is erroneous when it concludes that the Statement of Facts and Plea Agreement clearly and concisely \u2018described the nature and extent of the Respondent\u2019s criminal culpability in committing a misprision of a felony.\u201d Necessarily, he submits, therefore, that \u201chis testimony at the November 8, 2006 hearing is very relevant as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>to what he knew and when he knew it in judging his culpability\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">The respondent\u2019s second exception is to paragraphs 5 and 6 of the Findings of fact and Conclusions. Like the first, he decries the manner in which the respondent\u2019s conduct is described and characterized, and the time frame during which that conduct occurred, arguing that the factual basis for the plea \u201cdoes not unambiguously describe dishonest, fraudulent or deceitful conduct by Respondent over a time frame from 2000-2004.\u201d To make the point, the respondent directs our attention to the Statement of Facts, Paragraph 7, which, he maintains, \u201cfails to specifically state when, during the course of the conspiracy perpetuated by others, ... Respondent became aware of their actions.\u201d That, he submits, contradicts Paragraph 5 and, in fact, renders it clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">With regard to the Sixth Paragraph, the respondent maintains that his subjective understanding of the facts enumerated in Paragraph 7 of the Statement of Facts is relevant and critical to the determination of his culpability. In that regard, he refers us to the evidence addressing each of the statements made in the Statement of Facts, which, he asserts, is both significant and relevant. That evidence, he explained, illuminated his subjective understanding of the facts, which was in each instance, contrary to that acquired by the hearing court from the plea agreement and the statement of facts in support of the plea. For example, conceding that he knew, and, indeed, permitted his signature to be signed on \u201cpro forma\u201d documents, the respondent argues that his signature was not a forgery and that he \u201chad no fraudulent intent when he authorized employees of Global to sign his name to the routine appearance of counsel on immigration forms.\u201d Similarly, he denied knowing that his signature had been signed to hundreds more documents than he authorized until \u201cafter the indictment.\u201d To like effect, the respondent explained that, although he was aware that the signatures of aliens and corporate sponsors were being signed to documents by persons other than the alien and subject corporate sponsor, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>trusted the representation of Global\u2019s management that it had permission to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">The respondent complains that, rather than accept his subjective understanding of the facts, \u201c[t]he Hearing Judge focused solely on the broad record of conviction and concluded that the Respondent\u2019s behavior at Global was \u2018unambiguous ... dishonest, fraudulent and deceitful\u2019 ... [and] inferred that the Respondent\u2019s explanations almost to be an extension of his offense by construing that Respondent \u2018repeatedly attempted to excuse or minimize his criminal culpability.\u2019 \u201d Further, he argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">\u201cIt is certain that particular facts within the broad plea agreement did not comport with the Respondent\u2019s specific, subjective understanding of his understanding of events. But the Respondent certainly did not endorse, and there is nothing in the record to support, the embellished dialogue between the Assistant U.S. Attorney and Judge Ellis where they assume the Respondent \u2018knew he was complicit in fraud, and he knew it for a long time, and even offered a suggestion on how it could be concealed, is that right?\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Thus, the respondent submits that the hearing court\u2019s reliance on the plea and sentencing proceedings contradicting his contentions, and disregarding his subjective understanding of the facts \u201cis totally wrong.\u201d By so relying, he says, the hearing court \u201cmistakenly interpreted] the Respondent\u2019s admission that he knew of Global\u2019s wrongdoing, which was the basis of the plea to misprision of a felony, to mean that the Respondent took part and was complicit in the substantive offenses of the co-defendants.\u201d To the respondent, considered in light of his testimony at the disciplinary hearing and the subjective understanding of the facts it conveyed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">\u201c[t]here was no evidence presented by the Assistant U.S. Attorney that the Respondent engaged in the dishonest, fraudulent and deceitful conduct embodied in the underlying, substantive offenses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">With respect to the allegations in Paragraph 8 of the Statement of Facts, the respondent explained his failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>inform the proper authorities of the fraudulent immigration activities by stating that he became aware of the information only after \u201cthe indictments had been issued\u201d and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ase\">\u201cConcerning the two steps \u2018to conceal the crime,\u2019 first, Respondent understood Global employees had authorization to sign the names of immigrant\u2019s or employer\u2019s signatures on the forms. Second, Respondent insisted in plea negotiations that the phrase <em>\u2018knew or should have known </em>\u2019 be inserted because the government insisted on declaring that certain applications were withdrawn solely on account of their investigation, which Respondent firmly believed was not true.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">The respondent\u2019s third exception relates to the nature of the offense of misprision of a felony. He maintains that that offense \u201cis not a criminal act involving dishonesty, fraud and misrepresentation\u201d and his conduct constituting the offense \u201cdoes not evidence dishonesty, fraud or misrepresentation.\u201d The factor critically important to the respondent\u2019s position is that \u201c[t]he Respondent\u2019s testimony and the Statement of Facts supporting the conviction of misprision of a felony do not establish conduct that embodied dishonesty, fraud or deceit under Maryland disciplinary law.\u201d Thus, stressing that he was not charged as a co-conspirator and that his admissions of acquiring knowledge of fraud being committed by Global and the named individuals and not reporting it supported his conviction of the offense of misprision of a felony\u2014he argues on the theory of willful blindness, citing <em>United States v. Messer, </em>139 F.3d 895, 1998 WL 112532 (4th Cir.1998)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\u2014the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>respondent maintains that he \u201cnever possessed or ever admitted to having the <em>mens rea </em>to commit those [substantive] crimes.\u201d He argues further that, because \u201c[h]e never participated in the offenses of his co-defendants[, h]e can not be, and he was not, held responsible as a co-conspirator for the crime he failed to report.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Acknowledging and conceding, as he must, that paragraph 8 of the statement of facts in support of the plea agreement states that, in addition to having knowledge of the crimes, the immigration fraud and false statements, he took at least two steps to conceal the crimes, the respondent proffers, nevertheless, that his admission in that paragraph \u201creasonably satisfied\u201d the concealment element and, in any event, any steps aimed at concealment did not rise to the level of deceit, intentional dishonesty or misrepresentation. More particularly, he argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-5\">\u201cIn the Respondent\u2019s circumstances, he agreed that he \u2018concealed\u2019 purported forged names for individuals who he subjectively believed had authorized their signing. Similarly, he consented to \u2018concealing\u2019 the truth about abandoned applications because the paragraph specifically included a negligent, \u2018should have known\u2019 standard.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Aware that concealment may have a more sinister motivation, the respondent denies, that his conduct in this case could be equated with \u201cthe more egregious offenses of making false statements or purposefully deceiving a government authority\u201d or involved moral turpitude. Rather; he argues that \u201c[t]here simply was no proof by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent committed a criminal act involving dishonesty, fraud or misrepresentation or that he had any intent whatsoever to engage in such acts.\u201d That is confirmed, the respondent submits, by the fact that he \u201cdid not make any financial gain as a result of his conduct or from the underlying conduct of the co-defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b255-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>It is well settled that we review the conclusions of law drawn by the hearing court <em>de novo. </em>Rule 16\u2014759(b)(1).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

The respondent does not, indeed, he can not, dispute the facts\u2014they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>set forth in detail in the plea agreement and the Statement of Facts in support of that agreement. What he disputes is what should be made of those facts, and, in particular, whether they should, indeed must, be moderated or explained, by the respondent\u2019s subsequent testimony concerning his subjective understanding and intent. His position is that, because the facts, as they are reflected in the plea agreement and the Statement of Facts, do not specifically charge him with being a co-conspirator and are ambiguous as to the when he learned of the crimes, what criminal conduct the facts do establish is unclear and must be elucidated by extrinsic evidence, i.e., his testimony at the disciplinary hearing. More specifically, the respondent believes that his testimony not only was relevant to the issue of when and what he knew, but was required to be believed in determining his culpability and hence sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">The hearing court was not required to accept the respondent\u2019s explanation for his conduct. It was free to disbelieve, as it undoubtedly did, his explanation. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Nothstein, </em>300 Md. 667, 684, 480 A.2d 807, 816 (1984), we stated that \u201c[i]t is elementary that a trier of fact may elect to pick and choose which evidence [or story] to rely upon\u201d). Moreover, a final judgment of conviction is conclusive evidence of the guilt of the crime charged. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 16-771(g).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The respondent pled guilty to misprision of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>felony and the statement of facts in support detailed the circumstances in which the crime occurred. The respondent admitted being aware of facts indicating that the named co-defendants were engaging in immigration fraud, making false statements and encouraging aliens to enter this country illegally and not reporting those crimes to the proper authorities. But the respondent also admitted taking steps to conceal the conspiracy. This was evidence of not simply a passive involvement; it demonstrated an active involvement. With this active concealment as a predicate,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the hearing court can hardly be faulted for concluding that the respondent engaged in conduct in violation of Rule 8.4(b) and (c)\u2014helping and counseling violators as to how to conceal their violations is a criminal act that reflects adversely on a lawyer\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness in other regards\u2014and, in so doing, also engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation. It was \u201cthe charge of misprision of a felony, as supported by the unequivocal and unambiguous statement of facts entered into the record on August 26, 2005\u201d that the hearing court concluded constituted the misconduct in violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct. The concealment steps were clearly alleged and stated in the statement of facts and they were not disputed. That is certainly a substantial basis for the hearing court\u2019s conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">This leaves for resolution the issue of the appropriate sanction. The petitioner recommends disbarment. It relies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>on the nature of the respondent\u2019s conduct involved in the respondent\u2019s conviction, conduct that the hearing court determined to be infected with dishonesty, fraud, deceit and misrepresentation. Noting this Court\u2019s growing intolerance for attorneys who engage in such conduct, stressing the respondent\u2019s testimony at the disciplinary hearing, which the hearing court characterized as \u201creflect[ing] little, if any, remorse regarding his conduct as in-house counsel for GRIS and the resulting plea and sentencing for misprision of a felony,\u201d and contending that the respondent has failed to present extenuating circumstances warranting a lesser sanction, the petitioner argues that the only appropriate sanction is disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">The respondent opposes the petitioner\u2019s recommendation of disbarment. He maintains initially, citing the cases,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>\u201cthere are no reported eases in the United States finding that the crime of misprision of a felony requires automatic disbarment. A review of the reported cases from other jurisdictions shows that the general punishment is suspension from the practice of law for a period of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">He next embraces the hearing court\u2019s finding of mitigation, adding that, in addition to having been convicted of misprision of a felony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-5\">\u201cThe Respondent also stands as an attorney whose nearly twenty (20) years of practice were devoted to providing legal services and defenses to individuals without means or rank. He was a local leader in the practice of immigration law and an expert on the immigration consequences of criminal convictions, providing numerous presentations at judicial conferences, bar associations seminars, and offering mentoring to less experienced attorneys. He did this all without financial compensation. He taught asylum and refugee law at the Washington College of Law at the American University, published widely in the field and had a book contract with West Law prior to his conviction. He offered countless hours of pro bono advice. The Hearing Judge acknowledged the Respondent\u2019s legal services were \u2018stellar in nature.\u2019 That the Respondent\u2019s yearly income rarely topped $ 60,000 underscored the fact that his commitment to the practice of law was not pecuniary but to lend a helping hand to those who needed it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">In arguing for a sanction less than disbarment, the respondent poses the question as \u201cwhen did he come to know about the fraud ... and ... was his behavior so egregious, when juxtaposed against the Respondent\u2019s prior twenty (20) years of legal services, that the public need be protected from him, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>perhaps equally important, ought the public be deprived of his future services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">This Court has made clear that the well settled purpose and goal of attorney discipline proceedings is to protect the public, not to punish the erring attorney. <em>Mba-Jonas, </em>397 Md. at 702-703, 919 A.2d at 677; <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

This is so, because \u2018[u]nlike matters relating to competency, diligence and the like, intentional dishonest conduct is closely entwined with the most important matters of basic character to such a degree as to make intentional dishonest conduct by a lawyer almost beyond excuse.\u2019 <em>Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. at 418, 773 A.2d at 488. Thus, like in the case of a misappropriation of entrusted funds, <em>see Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Bakas, </em>323 Md. 395, 403, 593 A.2d 1087, 1091 (1991), in the absence of compelling extenuating circumstances justifying a lesser sanction, intentional dishonest conduct by a lawyer will result in disbarment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">In <em>Vanderlinde, </em>we addressed what would suffice as extenuating circumstance justifying a lesser sanction, where intentional dishonest conduct by an attorney has been established. We said that the compelling extenuating circumstances must be \u201cpresent and associated with the illegal or improper acts at the time committed.\u201d <em>Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. at 397, 773 A.2d at 475. We elucidated this point in the holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\">\u201cin cases of intentional dishonesty, misappropriation cases, fraud, stealing, serious criminal conduct and the like, we will not accept, as \u2018compelling extenuating circumstances,\u2019 anything less than the most serious and utterly debilitating mental or physical health conditions, arising from any source that is the \u2018root cause\u2019 of the misconduct and that also result in an attorney\u2019s utter inability to conform his or her conduct in accordance with the law and with the MRPC. Only if the circumstances are that compelling, will we even consider imposing less than the most severe sanction of disbarment in cases of stealing, dishonesty, fraudulent conduct, the intentional misappropriation of funds or other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>serious criminal conduct, whether occurring in the practice of law, or otherwise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 413-414, 773 A.2d at 485 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">There have been no compelling extenuating circumstances shown in this case. The respondent\u2019s past \u201cstellar\u201d practice, his pro bono commitment, his lack of pecuniary over-reaching or motivation and his mentoring, while all are commendable and are not disregarded, do not meet the standard we have set for compelling extenuating circumstances that would justify a lesser sanction than disbarment. Accordingly, we adopt the petitioner\u2019s recommendation. Disbarment is the appropriate sanction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-761, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST REX B. WINGERTER.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b242-11\">. The respondent stands suspended from the practice of law, this Court having entered an order to that effect on May 4, 2006, pursuant to Maryland Rule 16-771 (c). Rule 16-771 provides that an order of temporary suspension is available when the respondent has committed a serious crime. Rule 16-701(k)(3) defines \"serious crime\u201d as \"a crime that is in at least one of the following categories: (1) a felony under Maryland law, (2) a crime in another state or under federal law that would have been a felony under Maryland law had the crime been committed in Maryland, and (3) a crime under federal law or the law of any state that is punishable by imprisonment for three years or more.\u201d The hearing court, having reviewed that definition in light of the definition of \u201cProfessional misconduct\u201d and the proscriptions of Rule 8.4(a), (b) and (c), opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIO\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>\u201cNoting the acknowledged plea of guilty entered by the Respondent on August 26, 2005, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia ... to 18 U.S.C.

Misprision of a felony, codified at 18 U.S.C. Section 4, a federal, but not a Maryland, crime, is committed when someone, \u201chaving knowledge of the actual commission of a felony cognizable by a court of the United States, conceals and does not as soon as possible make known to some judge or other person in civil or military authority under the United States.\u201d It is punishable by fine and imprisonment for not more than three years, or both.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b243-7\">.

He was an immigration expert and, therefore, setting aside any requirement to be bound by the respondent\u2019s subjective understanding, it may be inferred that the respondent\u2019s acquisition of knowledge of fraudulent conduct was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>acquisition of the knowledge that a crime was being committed, which under federal law, he had a duty to report.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b255-5\">.

As in that case, there is more in this case than simply a conviction for failing to report a crime; the respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>participated in the crime, by taking steps to conceal it. In any event, we do not agree that a sanction less than disbarment, imposed in those cases where the respondent actually and positively assisted the perpetrator, <em>see, e.g., Shorall; In re Russell, </em>was appropriate. Those cases simply are not persuasive.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
