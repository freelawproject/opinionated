Konits and Dr. Efem E. Imoke, appellees. Carroll, in accordance with applicable law, initially filed her complaint with the Health Care Alternative Dispute Resolution Office (the \u201cHCADRO\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thereafter, the claim was transferred to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The Circuit Court dismissed the case on various grounds, including, but not limited to, Carroll\u2019s failure to submit a proper certificate of qualified expert (\u201cCertificate\u201d) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as required by the Health Care Malpractice Claims Statute (the \u201cStatute\u201d), Maryland Code (1974, 2002 RepLVol., 2006 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 3-2A-04(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Carroll filed a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. On January 2, 2007, while the appeal was pending in the intermediate appellate court, this Court issued a writ of certiorari on its own motion to review the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>\u201cDid the Circuit Court err in finding that Mary Carroll\u2019s expert witness report and certification was legally insufficient, thereby dismissing the case?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-5\"><em>Carroll v. Konits, </em>396 Md. 524, 914 A.2d 768 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">We hold that a Certificate is a condition precedent and, at a minimum, must identify with specificity, the defendant(s) (licensed professional(s)) against whom the claims are brought, include a statement that the defendant(s) breached the applicable standard of care, and that such a departure from the standard of care was the proximate cause of the plaintiffs injuries. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the certificate was incomplete because it failed to specifically identify the licensed professionals who allegedly breached the standard of care and failed to state that the alleged departure from the standard of care, by whichever doctor the expert failed to identify, was the proximate cause of Carroll\u2019s injuries. Therefore, because the Certificate is a condition precedent, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City correctly granted the appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss the case and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">On September 19, 2001, Dr. Imoke performed a unilateral mastectomy of Carroll\u2019s left breast. As a part of the procedure, Dr. Imoke left a catheter<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> inside Carroll\u2019s chest so that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>chemotherapy could be administered. Carroll claims that she was not aware that the catheter was inserted at the time that it occurred. The catheter was supposed to be removed within two months after Carroll completed chemotherapy. Dr. Invoke, however, did not make a follow-up appointment to remove the catheter. Instead, he relied on Dr. Konits, Carroll\u2019s oncologist, to inform him that Carroll had completed chemotherapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">She completed chemotherapy on April 11, 2002. The catheter was not removed, however, until March 25, 2003\u2014two and one-half years after it was initially inserted. Carroll asserts that she suffered pain and discomfort, a deep vein thrombosis, and chronic venous stasis of the right arm with chronic lymph edema due to the catheter being left inside her chest for a prolonged period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">On March 25, 2005, Carroll filed a complaint with the HCADRO. She alleged that Drs. Konits and Imoke were negligent in failing to communicate the need to have the catheter removed in a timely manner. Approximately four months later, on August 4, 2005, Carroll filed a letter signed by Dr. Wanda J. Simmons-Clemmons, which purported to be a Certificate. Dr. Simmons-Clemmons summarized a timeline of Carroll\u2019s medical treatments and then wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-7\">\u201cIn my professional opinion, there was no clear communication to the patient that indicated she should seek medical attention in the removal of the catheter from her chest after chemotherapy was completed. If this was done, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>was not documented. Secondly, there was mention made of an approximate time chemo should be completed by Dr. Konits in his consult dated January 31, 2002. The note was signed off by Dr. Ohio; however, there was mention of completion of chemo in multiple subsequent office visits. Also, the patient was to follow-up with Dr. Imoke in September 2002. Again, no mention was made that the patient should call sooner if and when chemo ended. Neither was the patient recalled for her September 2002 follow-up. If this was done I do not have a copy of the documentation of it. Thirdly, it does appear that Mrs. Mary Carroll suffered complications arising from having a catheter in place for too long[,] i.e. A DVT and chronic venous stasis of the right arm with chronic lymphedema.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">On October 3, 2005, after more than 180 days had elapsed from the time that Carroll initially filed her complaint,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Drs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Konits and Imoke filed a motion to dismiss the claim with the HCADRO on the basis that Dr. Simmons-Clemmons\u2019s documentation was deficient under the requirements set forth in \u00a7 3-2A-04(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Drs. Konits and Imoke claimed that Carroll failed to file a Certificate and that she merely tendered an informal, unsworn letter. On October 5, 2005, Carroll requested that, \u201cin the interest of justiee[,]\u201d the Director grant her an additional 60 days to correct the deficiencies in the document filed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Director acting, \u201cin the interest of justice,\u201d granted Carroll\u2019s request for additional time, giving her until December 1, 2005, to correct the deficiencies. On October 28, 2005, Carroll submitted an amended certification in an attempt to cure the defects in the original submission. The certificate again contained a summary of Carroll\u2019s medical visits and treatments and included the same language quoted <em>supra, </em>except that Dr. Simmons-Clemmons altered the language from \u201cit does appear that Mrs. Mary Carroll suffered complications arising from having a catheter in place for <em>too long\u201d </em>to \u201chaving a catheter in place for <em>longer than what is standard treatment^] </em>\u2019\u2019(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">Additionally, a new paragraph was added to the second letter that stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-5\">\u201cIt is my professional opinion that Mrs. Carroll sustained injury secondary to below standard of care received in regards to removal of the Hickman catheter after chemotherapy. Please be advised that I do not devote more than 20 percent of my annual time to activities that directly involve personal injury claims.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">On December 2, 2005, Dr. Konits renewed his motion to dismiss on the grounds that the updated certificate still failed to meet the specific requirements of \u00a7 3-2A-04(b). On or about the same date, Carroll waived arbitration and the matter was transferred to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>On December 30, 2005, Dr. Konits filed a motion to dismiss in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on the same grounds as the previous two\u2014that the certificate and report did not comply with the relevant provisions of the Statute. On March 22, 2006, the Circuit Court dismissed the case against Dr. Konits.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">When an appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss a complaint: \u201c[T]he truth of all well-pleaded relevant and material facts is assumed, as well as all inferences which can be reasonably drawn from the pleadings.\u201d <em>Odyniec v. Schneider, </em>322 Md. 520, 525, 588 A.2d 786, 788 (1991). Generally, dismissal at the trial court level will only be ordered if, after assuming the allegations and permissible inferences flowing therefrom are true, the plaintiff would not be afforded relief. <em>McNack v. State, </em>398 Md. 378, 920 A.2d 1097, 1102 (2007) (citing <em>Lloyd v. General Motors Corp., </em>397 Md. 108, 121, 916 A.2d 257, 264 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">The Health Care Malpractice Claims Statute has consistently been interpreted by this Court as an attempt by the General Assembly, in substantial part, to limit the filing of frivolous malpractice claims. <em>See Witte v. Azarian, </em>369 Md. 518, 526, 801 A.2d 160, 165 (2002) (recognizing that the General Assembly passed the Statute as part of a \u201cmulti-phase response to the malpractice insurance \u2018crisis\u2019 that arose in 1974....\u201d); <em>McCready Memorial Hosp. v. Hauser, </em>330 Md. 497, 500, 624 A.2d 1249, 1251 (1993) (\u201c[T]he General Assembly enacted the [Statute] in response to explosive growth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>medical malpractice claims and the resulting effect on health care providers\u2019 ability to obtain malpractice insurance.\u201d); <em>Attorney General v. Johnson, </em>282 Md. 274, 278-79, 385 A.2d 57, 60 (1978) (recognizing that: \u201c[T]he general thrust of the Act is that medical malpractice claims be submitted to arbitration as a precondition to court action ....\u201d) <em>overruled on other grounds by Newell v. Richards, </em>323 Md. 717, 734, 594 A.2d 1152, 1161 (1991).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> What little legislative history remains from the passage of the original Statute supports this interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">On July 23, 1975, the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House created the Medical Malpractice Insurance Study Committee (the \u201cCommittee\u201d) to craft and propose solutions to the medical malpractice problems confronting the State. State of Md. Medical Malpractice Ins. Study Comm., Report to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House, p. 1, (January 6, 1976). The Committee consisted of six Senators, six Delegates, medical experts, legal experts, hospital and insurance experts, and a representative from the Governor\u2019s office. It \u201cwas charged with the task of seeking a permanent solution to the myriad problems of medical malpractice insurance facing the physicians and patients of the State of Maryland.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Committee\u2019s report to the General Assembly was to be \u201cintroduced for consideration by the General Assembly in its 1976 Session.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. After reviewing position papers and conducting public hearings on the matter, the majority of the Committee reached a consensus that it was interested in \u201csome form of legislation mandating arbitration.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. This consensus was due, in part, to the fact that almost all of the testimony heard by the Committee \u201cincluded recommendations for some type of mechanism to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number><em>screen malpractice claims prior to the filing of the </em>suit.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 3 (emphasis added). Essentially, two types of screening mechanisms were suggested: \u201c(1) a medical review panel and (2) an arbitration panel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. The end result of these recommendations was the adoption of the Health Care Malpractice Claims Statute in 1976, for \u201cthe purpose of providing for a mandatory arbitration system for all medical malpractice claims in excess of a certain amount[.]\u201d 1976 Laws of Maryland, Chapter 235. It is clear from a plain reading of the original Statute and the existing legislative history that the General Assembly intended the original Health Care Malpractice Claims Statute to screen\u2014and to first substitute the arbitration process as to malpractice claims\u2014prior to the filing of lawsuits.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">\n<em>The Relevant Version of the Health Care Malpractice Claims Statute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The Health Care Malpractice Claims Statute, establishes exclusive procedures for filing a civil action, in excess of a certain amount, against a health care provider. Maryland Code (1974, 2002 Repl. Vol., 2006 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 3-2A-02(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. This was true in 1976 and is still true today. Since 1976, however, other aspects of the Statute have been amended. Relevantly, the 1986 amendment required the filing of a Certificate and an attesting expert\u2019s report.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See </em>1986 Laws of Maryland, Chap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>ter 640. By enacting the 1986 amendment, the General Assembly determined that, in the context of a medical malpractice claim, in order to maintain an action against a health care provider, a plaintiff is required to file a Certificate and an attesting expert\u2019s report <em>in addition to </em>filing a complaint. A plaintiff must file a \u201ccertificate of qualified expert\u201d that attests to the departure from the standard of care.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u00a7 3-2A-04(b)(l)(i)(l). The statute also requires that the certificate be filed with a \u201creport of the attesting expert attached.\u201d \u00a7 3-2A-04(b)(3)(i). The penalty for failing to file the required certificate and report within 90 days (subject to a 90 day extension and the possibility of an additional good cause extension) of the filing of the complaint is dismissal without prejudice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-5\">\u201cExcept as provided in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, a claim or action filed after July 1, 1986, shall be dismissed, without prejudice, if the claimant or plaintiff fails to file a certificate of a qualified expert with the Director attesting to departure from standards of care, and that the departure from standards of care is the proximate cause of the alleged injury, within 90 days from the date of the complaint....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>\u00a7 3-2A-04(b)(l)(i)(l). Although the statutory scheme is slightly more complex, it is clear that unless the Certif\u00edcate and the attached attesting expert\u2019s report are filed within a maximum of 180 days (absent the grant of a good cause extension), dismissal is mandatory. Thus, just as a plaintiff in a medical malpractice claim must file a satisfactory complaint, he or she must also file a satisfactory Certificate and report or risk dismissal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">An underlying issue herein is whether the requirement to file a proper Certificate operates as a condition precedent to the maintenance of a malpractice claim. Many of our cases have recognized that the <em>arbitration process, </em>as a whole, was designed to be a condition precedent to the filing of a claim in a circuit court. <em>Witte, </em>369 Md. at 527, 801 A.2d at 166 (recognizing that a claimant must file with the HCADRO and comply with all statutory provisions before proceeding to a circuit court); <em>McCready, </em>330 Md. at 512, 624 A.2d at 1257 (finding that: \u201cThe Maryland Health Care Malpractice Claims Statute mandates that claimants arbitrate their claims before the [HCADRO] as a condition precedent to maintaining suit in circuit court.\u201d); <em>Crawford v. Leahy, </em>326 Md. 160, 165, 604 A.2d 73, 75 (1992) (stating that: \u201cThe mandatory arbitration requirement does not divest courts of subject matter jurisdiction over health claims, but rather creates a condition precedent to the institution of a court action. Upon fulfillment of the condition precedent, malpractice claims may be heard in court.\u201d (citations omitted) (quotations omitted)); <em>Su v. Weaver, </em>313 Md. 370, 377, 545 A.2d 692, 695 (1988) (recognizing that: \u201cThe [Statute] substantially altered the procedure in which a medical malpractice claim is brought against a health care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>provider by requiring a malpractice claim to be submitted to a mandatory arbitration proceeding as a condition precedent to maintaining such an action in the circuit court.\u201d); <em>Ott v. Kaiser-Georgetown Community Health Plan, Inc., </em>309 Md. 641, 645, 526 A.2d 46, 48-49 (1987) (stating that: \u201cIf a claimant wishes to reject an award and proceed with the cause of action, the special procedures prescribed by the Act must be followed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Although it is clear that the arbitration process is a condition precedent to the filing of a claim in the Circuit Court, the question still remains whether \u00a7 3-2A-04 establishes that the filing of a proper Certificate is a condition precedent to maintaining a claim for malpractice. In <em>McCready, </em>we stated that the Statute requires arbitration prior to pursuing a claim in the circuit court and then said: \u201cA claimant\u2019s filing of an expert\u2019s certificate is an <em>indispensable step </em>in the ... arbitration process.\u201d 330 Md. at 512, 624 A.2d at 1257 (emphasis added). In other words, the arbitration process cannot occur without the filing of a Certificate. Thus, we conclude that the filing of a proper Certificate operates as a condition precedent to filing a claim in Circuit Court because arbitration is a condition precedent to filing a claim in a Circuit Court and because the filing of a Certificate is an <em>indispensable step </em>in the arbitration process, i.e., it must occur or the condition precedent is not satisfied. Therefore, if a proper Certificate has not been filed, the condition precedent to maintain the action has not been met and dismissal is required by the Statute once the allotted time period has elapsed. <em>See Walzer, </em>395 Md. at 578, 911 A.2d at 435 (concluding that the Statute mandates dismissal when the claimant fails to file the Certificate within the time period allotted by the Statute); <em>Witte, </em>369 Md. at 533, 801 A.2d at 169 (stating that: \u201cIn the absence of a certificate signed by a qualified expert on behalf of the claimant, the case cannot proceed beyond the point at which the certificate is required.... \u201d); <em>Goicochea v. Langworthy, </em>345 Md. 719, 729, 694 A.2d 474, 480 (1997) (recognizing that: \u201cLangworthy\u2019s malpractice claim ... was dismissed by the [HCADRO] because he did not file the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>certif\u00edcate of a qualified medical expert attesting to the merit of his claim, <em>as required by \u00a7 </em>3-2A-0Jp(b).... (Emphasis added)).\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">\n<em>Preservation for Appellate Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">As a threshold issue, Dr. Imoke contends that Carroll failed to preserve her arguments for appellate review and that this Court should not address the merits of her arguments. He explains that Carroll conceded that she had not complied with the statutory requirements and told the trial court that her expert was in the process of providing a certified statement. Dr. Imoke contends that Carroll did not submit a properly amended certified statement before the Circuit Court dismissed the case, and is now arguing, for the first time on appeal, that the amended letter complied with the statutory requirements. As such, according to Dr. Imoke, she failed to preserve these arguments for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>We note that Carroll argued, before the Circuit Court, that her initial Certificate complied -with the statutory requirements and told the trial court that her expert was in the process of providing an amended Certificate. Despite the fact that Carroll\u2019s arguments at the trial level pertained to the initial Certificate, we conclude that the substance of her arguments was sufficient to preserve for appellate review the issue of whether her Certificate complied with the requirements set forth in the Health Care Malpractice Claims Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\"><em>The Director\u2019s Authority to Grant an </em>Extension<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Dr. Konits argues that the Director did not have the discretion to grant Carroll an extension of time because it was not filed within the 180-day period and good cause was not established. He argues, therefore, that this Court should not address the propriety of Dr. Simmons-Clemmons\u2019s purported Certificates of Merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Section 3-2A-04(b)(5) states that \u201c[a]n extension of the time allowed for filing a certificate of a qualified expert under this subsection shall be granted for good cause shown.\u201d Similarly, \u00a7 3-2A-05(j), states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-7\">\u201cExcept for time limitations pertaining to the filing of a claim or response, the Director or the panel chairman, for good cause shown, may lengthen or shorten the time limita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>tions prescribed in subsections (b) and (g) of this section and \u00a7 3-2A-04 of this article.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Dr. Konits contends that no extension could be granted for good cause because Carroll did not request the good cause extension within the 180-day period. We rejected that exact argument in <em>Navarro-Monzo v. Washington Adventist Hosp., </em>380 Md. 195, 844 A.2d 406 (2004). There we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-5\">\u201cAppellees present the same argument to us that they raised in the Circuit Court, namely, that \u00a7 3-2A-04(b)(l)(ii) permits but one 90-day extension and that, if any further extension is to be sought under either \u00a7 3-2A-04(b)(5) or \u00a7 3-2A-05(j), the extension must be sought before the expiration of the 90-day extension granted under \u00a7 3 -2A-04(b)(l)(ii).\u201d Relying on <em>McCready, </em>they aver that, once [the initial 90-day] extension period expires, the claim must be dismissed. Their reliance, and the Circuit Court\u2019s reliance, on <em>McCready </em>is misplaced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">\u201cWe expressly recognized ... in <em>McCready, [] </em>that \u2018there could conceivably be instances where there might be \u201cgood cause\u201d to grant a request for an extension that was made after the initial ninety-day period in lieu of dismissing the claim.\u2019 <em>McCready, </em>330 Md. at 506 n. 5, 624 A.2d at 1254 n. 5. Indeed, \u00a7\u00a7 3-2A-04(b)(5) and 3-2A-05Q) would have little or no meaning unless read to permit good cause extensions over and above the mandatory extension called for in \u00a7 3-2A-04(b)(l)(ii).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-7\"><em>Navarro-Monzo, </em>380 Md. at 200-04, 844 A.2d at 409-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">In light of our resolution of this case, we will not resolve Dr. Konits\u2019s contention that the Director lacked good cause to grant Carroll\u2019s extension. We did state in <em>Navarro-Monzo, </em>380 Md. at 205, 844 A.2d at 412, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-9\">\u201cAlthough the arbitration process itself is not in the nature of an administrative remedy, [the HCADRO] is an administrative agency within the Executive Branch of the State Government <em>(see </em>CJP \u00a7 3-2A-03), and therefore its Di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>rector, in administering that office, acts as an administrative official. In reviewing the administrative decisions of the Director, we must afford at least the same deference that we afford to other administrative agencies in making discretionary decisions, including, in the absence of some clear indication in the record to the contrary, an assumption that the Director is aware of the law controlling his/her conduct and acts in conformance with it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">Additionally, we explained in <em>McCready, </em>that the good cause extensions are \u201cmalleable[,]\u201d again, generally, leaving room for the Director\u2019s discretion. 330 Md. at 509, 624 A.2d at 1255.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">While Carroll never mentioned the phrase \u201cgood cause,\u201d in her request for an extension, she explained that she had filed her Certificate in a timely manner, and that its contents complied with the statutory provisions set forth in the Health Care Malpractice Claims Statute. She explained further that her attesting expert was already in the process of amending the Certification to provide additional information that was already available to her.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Lastly, Carroll asked the Director to grant an extension based on the interests of justice. In response, the Director utilized his discretionary powers to grant the extension \u201cupon review and consideration of Claimant\u2019s Answer To Motion To Dismiss and in the interest of justice!.]\u201d In accordance with the statutory language and consistent with our prior case law, we believe that the General Assembly made it clear that the good cause extensions are discretionary and without time limitations, so long as the Claimant demonstrates good cause. As indicated earlier, we need not and do not resolve the nature of the \u201cgood cause\u201d asserted in this case.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>\n<em>The Certificate and the Report</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">We now turn to the parties\u2019 arguments regarding the Certificate and the attesting expert\u2019s report. Carroll does not challenge the existence of the condition precedent requirement discussed, <em>supra. </em>Instead, she presents arguments of definition, i.e., that nothing in the statutory scheme defines the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>words \u201ccertificate\u201d or \u201cattesting,\u201d that the statute does not require a specific format, and that the words \u201ccertify\u201d and \u201cattest\u201d do not actually have to appear in the certification or report. She also contends that the plain meaning of the word \u201cattest,\u201d is \u201cto affirm to be true or genuine,\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and that Dr. Simmons-Clemmons submitted a document in which she \u201cattested\u201d to her professional opinions in accordance with this definition. In addition, Carroll asserts that the plain meaning of the word \u201ccertify\u201d only requires an affirmation in writing.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Therefore, according to Carroll, the court erred when it dismissed the case based on a lack of formal attestation or certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">Furthermore, according to Carroll, there is no stated requirement in \u00a7 3-2A-04 that the initial certification and report actually set forth that the expert is a \u201cqualified expert\u201d or that those qualifications have to be explained in the certificate. She also argues that there is no requirement in \u00a7 3-2A-04 that the expert use the words \u201cproximate cause,\u201d or \u201creasonable degree of certainty.\u201d She contends that even though Dr. Simmons-Clemmons did not use either of those terms, the certification makes clear that \u201cthe lack of communication by appellees to Carroll concerning the removal of the catheter was the cause of her injuries.\u201d Lastly, Carroll contends that all of Drs. Konits and Imoke\u2019s assertions fail because they are not supported by the plain language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Appellees argue that Dr. Simmons-Clemmons\u2019s documentation was deficient under the pertinent provisions the Health Care Malpractice Claims Statute for a multitude of reasons, any one of which justified the Circuit Court\u2019s dismissal of Carroll\u2019s claim. They contend that neither of the submissions from Dr. Simmons-Clemmons certified that she had clinical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>experience in the field practiced by Drs. Konits and Imoke within five years from the date of the alleged negligence, as is required by \u00a7 3-2A-02(c)(2)(ii)(A), and that both letters failed to certify that Dr. Simmons-Clemmons is Board Certified in the same or related specialty as Drs. Konits and Imoke, as required by \u00a7 3-2A-02(c)(2)(ii)(B).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Drs. Konits and Imoke also argue that Dr. Simmons-Clemmons failed to provide any reference to her training, education, professional experience, practice area, field of specialty, and Board Certifications; her letters merely contained the initials \u201cM.D.\u201d after her signature. Dr. Konits avers that \u201c[t]he facial deficiencies of [Dr. Simmons-Clemmons\u2019s] letter/certificate are only exacerbated by the failure of [Carroll] to file an expert report from the certifying doctor as mandated by [\u00a7 ] 3-2A-04(b)(3)____\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">Dr. Konits also argues that neither of Carroll\u2019s letters identified the health care professional(s) against whom her claims applied. Dr. Konits notes that the letters reference five physicians\u2014Dr. Konits, Dr. Imoke, Dr. Ohio, an unidentified cardiologist, and an unidentified primary care physician. Furthermore, according to Dr. Konits, both letters failed to articulate opinions to a reasonable degree of medical probability, as is required by Maryland law. Dr. Konits contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>Dr. Simmons-Clemmons\u2019s letter is not an appropriate \u201cCertification\u201d or \u201cAttestation\u201d of expert opinions but, instead, was an informal letter addressed to Carroll\u2019s attorney from Dr. Simmons-Clemmons. Dr. Konits further contends that Carroll\u2019s initial letter from Dr. Simmons-Clemmons was deficient because the physician failed to state the amount of professional time spent in testimonial activities for personal injury claims and Dr. Imoke also asserts that the initial letter was deficient because Dr. Simmons-Clemmons failed to attest to the departures from the standards of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">\n<em>Statutory Construction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">This case requires us to construe several provisions of the Health Care Malpractice Claims Statute and is primarily a matter of statutory interpretation. The first provision relevant to the case <em>sub judice </em>is \u00a7 3-2A-04(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.

The ordinary meaning of the word \u201cattest\u201d is \u201c[t]o bear witness; testify\u201d or \u201c[t]o affirm to be true or genuine[.]\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 138 (8th ed.1999). Reading \u00a7 3-2A-04(b)(l)(i)(l) in conjunction with this definition, we conclude that the language of this provision is clear and unambiguous and we need not resort to statutory interpretation. According to the plain language, a Certificate, under \u00a7 3-2A-04(b), must contain the qualified expert\u2019s affirmation as to two separate conditions\u2014(1) that the defendant-physician departed from the standards of care, and (2) that such a departure was the proximate cause of plaintiffs alleged injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">In examining Dr. Simmons-Clemmons\u2019s purported replacement Certificate, we conclude that even if she had satisfied the first stated requirement, she failed to satisfy the second requirement. The pertinent language of Dr. Simmons-Clemmons\u2019s second certificate, in which she discussed her professional medical opinion in reference to Carroll\u2019s medical care, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-6\">\u201c[I]t does appear that Mrs. Mary Carroll suffered complications arising from having the catheter in place for longer than what is standard treatment^] (i.e. a DVT and chronic venous stasis of the right arm with chronic lymph edema.[) ]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Dr. Simmons-Clemmons explained in the Certificate that the catheter was in place for \u201clonger than what is standard treatment\u201d and that the treatment that Carroll received was \u201cbelow standard of care[.]\u201d The first condition under \u00a7 3-2A-04(b), arguably, may have been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">As to the second and unsatisfied requirement, Dr. Simmons-Clemmons stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-9\">\u201cIt is my professional opinion that Mrs. Carroll suffered injury secondary to below standard of care received in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>regards to removal of the Hickman catheter after chemotherapy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">We assume that when Dr. Simmons-Clemmons stated that Carroll\u2019s <em>injury </em>was \u201csecondary to below standard of caret,]\u201d that she meant the <em>treatment </em>given to Carroll fell below the standard of care. Notwithstanding this assumption, Dr. Simmons-Clemmons failed to state, with clarity, that the treatment Carroll received or failed to receive, fell below the standard of care <em>and was the proximate cause of her injuries. </em>In fact, at no point, did she state that the alleged departure from the standard of care was the proximate cause of Carroll\u2019s injuries.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Drs. Konits and Imoke also interpret the language of \u00a7 3-2A-04(b) as requiring that the Certificate identify the specific individual or individuals who breached the standard of care. According to Drs. Konits and Imoke, the purported Certificate is incomplete because it fails to identify specifically the li<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>censed professionals against whom Dr. Simmons-Clemmons\u2019s claims applied. Again, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Maryland law requires that the Certificate mention explicitly the name of the licensed professional who allegedly breached the standard of care. <em>See Witte, </em>369 Md. at 521, 801 A.2d at 162 (explaining that \u201cunless ... the claimant files with the [Health Care Alternative Dispute Resolution Office] a certificate of a qualified expert attesting that <em>the defendant\u2019s </em>conduct constituted a departure from the standard of care and that the departure was the proximate cause of the alleged injury, the claim must be dismissed ...\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>McCready, </em>330 Md. at 500, 624 A.2d at 1251 (articulating that \u201cthe plaintiff must file a Certificate of Qualified Expert (expert\u2019s certificate) attesting to <em>a defendant\u2019s </em>departure from the relevant standards of care which proximately caused the plaintiffs injury\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Watts v. King, </em>143 Md. App. 293, 306, 794 A.2d 723, 731 (2002) (stating that claimants are \u201crequired to file a certificate of a qualified expert <em>attesting that the licensed professional </em>against whom the claim was filed breached the standard of care.\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>D\u2019Angelo, </em>157 Md.App. at 646, 853 A.2d at 822 (concluding that the expert\u2019s certificate must include the name of the licensed professional against whom the claims were brought because, without that information, \u201cthe certificate requirement would amount to a useless formality that would in no way help weed out non[-]meritorious claims.\u201d). We believe that this requirement is consistent with the General Assembly\u2019s intent to avoid non-meritorious claims. Moreover, it is reasonable because the Certificate would be rendered useless without an identification of the allegedly negligent parties. When a Certificate does not identify, with some specificity, the person whose actions should be evaluated, it would be impossible for the opposing party, the HCADRO, and the courts to evaluate whether a physician, or a particular physician out of several, breached the standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">In the instant case, Dr. Simmons-Clemmons filed a certificate that included the names of five different physicians, two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>of whom are the named defendants in this case. The report mentioned Dr. Imoke and Dr. Konits, but also mentioned a Dr. Ohio, an unnamed cardiologist, and an unnamed primary care physician. Dr. Simmons-Clemmons then stated very generally that \u201cthere was no clear communication to the patient----\u201d In so doing, Dr. Simmons-Clemmons failed to state with sufficient specificity which physician or physicians breached the standard of care and which physician or physicians were allegedly responsible for Carroll\u2019s injuries. Equally egregious, however, is that the Certificates failed to state what the standard of care was or <em>how </em>Dr. Imoke or Dr. Konits departed from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">What was the standard of care expected of them? What duty did either have in regard to removing the catheter? Was Dr. Konits, the oncologist, supposed to remove the catheter, inserted surgically by Dr. Imoke, upon the termination of chemotherapy? Was he supposed to call Dr. Imoke to inform him that the chemotherapy had been completed? Was he supposed to tell Carroll to call Dr. Imoke? Was Dr. Imoke supposed to call Dr. Konits from time to time to check on the progress of the chemotherapy? Was he supposed to call Carroll from time to time for that purpose? Was he supposed to tell Carroll to call him when she completed chemotherapy?</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">The Certificate stated that \u201cthe patient was to follow-up with Dr. Imoke in September, 2002[]\u201d\u2014a year after the mastectomy\u2014but it does not indicate where that information came from or whether Dr. Konits was, or should have been, aware of that fact. The Certificate stated that there was \u201cmention made of an approximate time chemotherapy] should be completed by Dr. Konits in his consult dated January 31, 2002,\u201d but it does not say when that time was, or how it related to the anticipated followup with Dr. Imoke in September, 2002. Interestingly, the complaint indicates that chemotherapy was completed in April, 2002, but the Certificate does not note that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">The Certificate adds that Carroll was not \u201crecalled for her September 2002 follow-up.\u201d Was Dr. Konits responsible for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>that? Was Dr. Imoke responsible for that? Did Carroll know she was supposed to follow up with Dr. Imoke? There is no indication that either defendant acted as Carroll\u2019s primary care physician. Was that unidentified doctor supposed to keep track of the chemotherapy and alert Carroll to the need to have the catheter removed? Was either defendant supposed to communicate with Carroll\u2019s primary care physician in this regard?</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">A general assertion, such as the one made by Dr. SimmonsClemmons, that there was \u201cno clear communication to the patient\u201d by unspecified doctors regarding the timing of the removal of the catheter is deficient in two respects. Dr. Simmons-Clemmons did not explain in the Certificate the requisite standard of care owed to Carroll. Simmons-Clemmons also failed to state which doctor, or doctors, owed Carroll a specific duty under that standard. Without such statements by Dr. Simmons-Clemmons, the deficiencies in both the first and second Certificate go well beyond the issue of identity and proximate cause. The Certificates are wholly lacking in any assertion that either defendant departed from an applicable standard of care. They do not even come close to complying with the statutory requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">We therefore conclude that the alleged Certificate was also deficient in this respect and that the Circuit Court was correct in dismissing the case on the grounds that Carroll failed to file a proper Certificate. This conclusion is in accordance with this Court\u2019s interpretation of the application of the statutory requirements for the filing of medical malpractice claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Our cases are consistent with this conclusion. In <em>McCready, </em>we stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-8\">\u201cThe basic procedures for initiating and maintaining a claim under the Statute are clear and simple. The Statute requires that a person with a medical malpractice claim first file that claim with the Director of the Health [Care Alternative Dispute Resolution] Office[]. \u00a7 3-2A-04(a). Thereafter, the plaintiff must file a certificate of qualified expert (expert\u2019s certificate) attesting to a defendant\u2019s departure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>from the relevant standards of care which proximately caused the plaintiffs injury. \u00a7 3-2A-04(b)(l)(i).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">330 Md. at 500-01, 624 A.2d at 1251; <em>Odyniec, </em>322 Md. at 533, 588 A.2d at 792 (in the context of explaining the operation of the statute, we opined that: \u201cThe Act requires a claimant at the commencement of the action to file a certificate prepared by a qualified expert stating that the practitioner departed from the standard of care and that such departure was the proximate cause of the injury ....\u201d); <em>see also D\u2019Angelo, </em>157 Md.App. at 634, 649, 853 A.2d at 824 (outlining the steps for bringing a medical malpractice claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Even if we were to have found an ambiguity in the Statute, which we do not, the legislative history surrounding the enactment of the 1986 legislation supports our holding. That year, the General Assembly was again confronted with a medical malpractice crisis. In response, the Assembly enacted changes to almost every section in the Health Care Malpractice Claims Statute, including the one relevant to the present case\u2014 \u00a7 3A-02-04. As relevant to this case, the General Assembly inserted the following language into \u00a7 3A-02-04:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">\u201c(1) A CLAIM FILED AFTER JULY 1, 1986, SHALL BE DISMISSED, <em>WITHOUT PREJUDICE, </em>IF THE CLAIMANT FAILS TO FILE A CERTIFICATE OF A QUALIFIED EXPERT <em>WITH THE DIRECTOR </em>ATTESTING TO DEPARTURE FROM STANDARDS OF CARE ..., <em>AND THAT THE DEPARTURE FROM STANDARDS OF CARE ...IS THE PROXIMATE CAUSE OF THE ALLEGED INJURY, </em>WITHIN 90 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF THE COMPLAINT.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">\u201c(3) THE ATTORNEY REPRESENTING EACH PARTY, OR THE PARTY PROCEEDING PRO SE, SHALL FILE THE APPROPRIATE CERTIFICATE WITH A REPORT OF THE ATTESTING EXPERT ATTACHED. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>DISCOVERY IS AVAILABLE AS TO THE BASIS OF THE CERTIFICATE.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">1986 Laws of Maryland, Chapter 640.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Referring to the 1985 \u201cJoint Report of the Executive/Legislative Task Force on Medical Malpractice Insurance,\u201d the <em>,Summary of Committee Report </em>stated that the:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">\u201cTask Force voted to adopt the concept of a certificate of merit by a vote of 17 to 0, and the concept of a certificate of a meritorious defense by a vote of 11 to 8. <em>This provision is designed to reduce the number of frivolous claims and defenses.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-7\"><em>Summary of Committee Report, </em>S.B. 559, p. 4 (emphasis added). That the Certificate requirement was intended to curtail frivolous malpractice claims could only be more clearly demonstrated if the General Assembly had placed the above emphasized language in \u00a7 3-2A-04 itself. Although this statement alone is enough to persuade us that the General Assembly intended the new provision of \u00a7 3-2A-04 to limit frivolous lawsuits, the evolution of certain language in S.B. 559 is additional evidence of such intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">The above underlined portions of subparagraph one indicate amendments to the original version of S.B. 559. According to the <em>Summary of Committee Report, </em>the Judicial Proceedings Committee added language to the original bill that required the certifying expert to state: <em>\u201cTHAT THE DEPARTURE FROM STANDARDS OF CARE ...IS THE PROXIMATE CAUSE OF THE ALLEGED INJURY].]\u201d </em>This language, requiring a specific statement of causal connection, was clearly intended to be another way (the first being the Certificate itself) to substantiate the merit of the claim being filed. Because this language remained in the final version of S.B. 559, the one that was enacted into law, the requirement is further evidence of the General Assembly\u2019s desire to make sure claims being filed were not frivolous. The thrust of the two 1986 amendments is to substantiate the claim being filed. Moreover, the 1986 amendments are consistent with the intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>of the original enactment in 1976, i.e., <em>to screen malpractice claims prior to the filing of suit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">In light of our conclusion that the plain language of \u00a7 3-2A-04 requires the filing of a proper Certificate and proper attesting expert\u2019s report, we need not address the other issues raised by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that a Certificate is a condition precedent and at a minimum, must identify with specificity, the defendant(s) (licensed professional(s)) against whom the claims are brought, include a statement that the named defendant(s) breached the applicable standard of care, and that such a departure from the standard of care was the proximate cause of the plaintiffs injuries. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the certificate was incomplete because it failed to specifically identify the licensed professionals who allegedly breached the standard of care and failed to state that the alleged departure from the standard of care, by whichever doctor, or doctors, the expert failed to identify, was the proximate cause of Carroll\u2019s injuries. Therefore, because the Certificate is a condition precedent, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City correctly granted the appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss the case and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Judge Harrell joins in the judgment only.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AFFIRMED.

Section 3-2A-04(b)(l)(ii) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-7\">\"In lieu of dismissing the claim or action, the panel chairman or the court shall grant an extension of no more than 90 days for filing the certificate required by this paragraph, if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-8\">1.

It therefore follows that the attesting expert report must explain how or why the physician failed ... to meet the standard of care and include some details supporting the certificate of qualified expert.... [T]he expert report should contain at least some additional information and should supplement the Certificate.

The determination of whether a Certificate and report are satisfactory, like the determination of whether a complaint sufficiently states a legally cognizable claim, is a determination to be made as a matter of law.

Her Answer To Motion To Dismiss before the HCADRO, in which she requested, \u201cin the interest of justice,\u201d an extension of time to file ultimately what was to become the October 27 version, offered absolutely nothing in the way of good cause for an extension.

In the important concluding lines of the August 3 report, the doctor states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-6\">Thirdly, it does appear that Mrs. Mary Carroll suffered complications arising from having a catheter in place for <em>too long, </em>i.e. A DVT and chronic venous stasis of the right arm with chronic lymph edema.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">In the concluding lines of the October 27 report, Dr. Simmons-Clemmons revised somewhat and supplemented this language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-9\">Thirdly, it does appear that Mrs. Mary Carroll suffered complications arising from having a catheter in place for <em>longer than what is standard treatment, </em>i.e. a DVT and chronic venous stasis of the right arm with chronic lymph edema. <em>It is my professional opinion that Mrs. Carroll sustained injury secondary to below standard of care received in regards to removal of the Hickman catheter </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number><em>after chemotherapy. Please he advised that I do not devote more than 20 percent of my annual time to activities that directly involve personal injury claims.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"APh\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">Without the modified and added language in the October 27 report, the Dissent\u2019s reasoning does not hold up:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-5\">In examining Dr. Simmons-Clemmons\u2019s amended Certificate, it is clear that she satisfied the two stated requirements [departure from standard of care and proximate cause]. The pertinent language of Dr. SimmonsClemmons\u2019s second certificate, in which she discusses her professional medical opinion in reference to Mrs. Carroll\u2019s medical care, is as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">[I]t does appear that Mrs. Mary Carroll suffered complications arising from having the catheter in place for longer than what is standard treatment^] (i.e. a DVT and chronic venous stasis of the right arm with chronic lymph edema.[) ]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">It is my professional opinion that Mrs. Carroll suffered injury secondary to below standard of care received in regards to removal of the Hickman catheter after chemotherapy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">Dr. Simmons explained in the Certificate that the catheter was in place for \u201clonger than what is standard treatment\u201d and that the treatment that Mrs. Carroll received was \u201cbelow standard of care.\u201d She therefore satisfied the first condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-9\">As to the second requirement, Dr. Simmons-Clemmons stated that \u201cthere was no clear communication to the patient that indicated she should seek medical attention in the removal of the catheter from her chest after chemotherapy was completed,\u201d and further that Mrs. Carroll \u201csuffered injury secondary to below standard of care received in regards to removal of the Hickman catheter after chemotherapy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">Dissent, op. at 204-05, 929 A.2d at 41-42.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">Accordingly, I am compelled to join the judgment reached by the Majority in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Dissenting Opinion by GREENE, J., which BELL, C.J., Joins.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">I agree with the majority that Mrs. Carroll preserved for appellate review her arguments concerning the propriety of Dr. Simmons-Clemmons\u2019s Certificate and also that the Director had the authority and discretion to grant Mrs. Carroll\u2019s extension. I also agree that a Certificate must identify the health care provider against whom the claim is brought, and the certifying expert must attest to facts that support the allegation that the health care provider\u2019s conduct breached the applicable standard of care and that such a departure from the standard of care proximately caused the plaintiffs injuries. In this case, however, I believe that Mrs. Carroll submitted a Certificate that satisfied those minimum requirements. Therefore, the Circuit Court was incorrect to grant the appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss the case and, accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">As stated <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 8-2A-04(b)(l)(i) of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">a claim or action filed after July 1, 1986, shall be dismissed, without prejudice, if the claimant or plaintiff fails to file a certificate of a qualified expert with the Director <em>attesting to departure from, standards of care, and that the departure from standards of care is the proximate cause of the alleged injury....</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">(Emphasis added.) The majority interprets this language as requiring that the Certificate contain the qualified expert\u2019s affirmation that the defendant-physician departed from the standards of care and that such a departure was the proximate cause of the plaintiffs alleged injury. I agree with that interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">In examining Dr. Simmons-Clemmons\u2019s amended Certificate, it is clear that she satisfied the two stated requirements. The pertinent language of Dr. Simmons-Clemmons\u2019s second certificate, in which she discusses her professional medical opinion in reference to Mrs. Carroll\u2019s medical care, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>[I]t does appear that Mrs. Mary Carroll suffered complications arising from having the catheter in place for longer than what is standard treatment[,] (i.e. a DVT and chronic venous stasis of the right arm with chronic lymph edema.[) ]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-5\">It is my professional opinion that Mrs. Carroll suffered injury secondary to below standard of care received in regards to removal of the Hickman catheter after chemotherapy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">Dr. Simmons-Clemmons explained in the Certificate that the catheter was in place for \u201clonger than what is standard treatment\u201d and that the treatment that Mrs. Carroll received was \u201cbelow standard of care.\u201d She therefore satisfied the first condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">As to the second requirement, Dr. Simmons-Clemmons stated that \u201cthere was no clear communication to the patient that indicated she should seek medical attention in the removal of the catheter from her chest after chemotherapy was completed,\u201d and further that Mrs. Carroll \u201csuffered injury secondary to below standard of care received in regards to removal of the Hickman catheter after chemotherapy.\u201d While Dr. Simmons-Clemmons never used the term \u201cproximate cause\u201d to explain the cause of Mrs. Carroll\u2019s injuries, she stated specific facts which causally linked the health care providers\u2019 breach of the standard of care to Mrs. Carroll\u2019s injuries. The substance of what Dr. Simmons-Clemmons said is obvious and is evidence of the cause of Mrs. Carroll\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">It is well settled that several negligent acts may work together to cause an injury, and that each person whose negligent act is a cause of an injury may be legally responsible. <em>See Atlantic Mut. Ins. Co. v. Kenney, </em>323 Md. 116, 127, 591 A.2d 507, 512 (1991) (\u201cNegligence which constitutes a proximate cause of an injury need not necessarily be the sole cause.... In order to be a proximate cause, the negligence must be 1) a cause in fact, and 2) a legally cognizable cause.\u201d); <em>see also Peterson v. Underwood, </em>258 Md. 9, 17, 264 A.2d 851, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>855 (1970). Moreover, proximate cause is a legal term and not a medical term. Dr. Simmons-Clemmons\u2019s certification of facts, with regard to causation, was consistent with the statutory requirements of \u00a7 3-2A-04(b) that the person making the certification must be a health care provider and attest to the facts that support the allegation that a health care provider\u2019s conduct breached the standard of care and the departure from the standard of care proximately caused the alleged injury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">As stated <em>supra, </em>the purpose of the Certificate is to reduce the number of non-meritorious claims being submitted to the Health Care Alternative Dispute Resolution Office. Dr. Simmons-Clemmons, through her attestation, demonstrated that Drs. Konits and Imoke failed to communicate with each other and that such a failure caused Mrs. Carroll\u2019s catheter to remain in place for more than two years longer than what is standard medical procedure. Dr. Simmons-Clemmons also makes clear that because the catheter was left in place for so long, Mrs. Carroll suffered injuries. I would therefore hold that Mrs. Carroll also satisfied the second stated requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The majority also interprets the language of \u00a7 3-2A-04(b) as requiring that the Certificate identify the specific individual or individuals who breached the standard of care. I agree. I disagree with the majority, however, that Mrs. Carroll\u2019s Certificate is incomplete because it fails to comply -with this requirement. I acknowledge that Dr. Simmons-Clemmons filed a statement that included the names of five different physicians, only two of whom are the named health care providers/appellees in this case. The Certificate, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>specifically mentioned Dr. Imoke and Dr. Konits and made clear that the physicians failed to communicate to Mrs. Carroll that her catheter needed to be removed after she completed chemotherapy. Mrs. Carroll made clear that Dr. Imoke was the health care provider who placed the catheter inside her chest and that Dr. Konits\u2019s failure to contact Dr. Imoke and make him aware that the catheter could be taken out, resulted in it being left inside her chest for two and one-half years.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I would therefore conclude that the Certificate satisfied the requirements in this regard and the Circuit Court was therefore incorrect to dismiss the case on the grounds that Mrs. Carroll failed to file a proper Certificate. The purpose of the statute is to weed out non-meritorious claims, not to dismiss meritorious claims for frivolous reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">The majority does not address the other contentions made by Drs. Konits and Imoke. I believe it is important for the Court to address these contentions. Drs. Konits and Imoke contend that the Certificate must state that Dr. SimmonsClemmons spends no more than 20 percent of her professional time on personal injury-related litigation, that she is board certified in the same fields as Drs. Konits and Imoke and that she has a similar medical background to Drs. Konits and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Imoke. I would reject these contentions. The 20 percent declaration is not at issue in this case because Dr. SimmonsClemmons explicitly stated in her amended Certificate that she spends no more than 20 percent of her time on personal injury claims. Notwithstanding, I do not read the Health Care Malpractice Claims Statute to require that the Certificate include any of this information. Section 3-2A-04(b)(4) identifies a precise limitation on the qualifications of an attesting health care provider:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-5\">A health care provider who attests in a certificate of a qualified expert or who testifies in relation to a proceeding before an arbitration panel or a court concerning compliance with or departure from standards of care may not devote annually more than 20 percent of the expert\u2019s professional activities to activities that directly involve testimony in personal injury claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">The other applicable provision as to Drs. Konits and Imoke\u2019s contentions is \u00a7 3-2A-02(c), entitled <em>\u201cEstablishing liability of health care provider; qualifications of persons testifying,\u201d </em>part (2)(ii)(l.), which states that any health care provider who attests in a Certificate to a defendant-health care provider\u2019s departure from the standards of care:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-7\">A. Shall have had clinical experience, provided consultation relating to clinical practice, or taught medicine in the defendant\u2019s specialty or a related field of health care, or in the field of health care in which the defendant provided care or treatment to the plaintiff, within 5 years of the date of the alleged act or omission giving rise to the cause of action; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-8\">B. Except as provided in item 2 of this subparagraph, if the defendant is board certified in a specialty, shall be board certified in the same or a related specialty as the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">The above-quoted language from \u00a7 3-2A-04(b)(4) and \u00a7 3-2A-02(c)(2)(ii)(l.) demonstrates the General Assembly\u2019s intent to place limitations on the qualifications of experts who attest to a defendant\u2019s breach of the standard of care and that such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>breach proximately caused the plaintiffs injuries. By requiring that experts have similar training and are board certified in the same field(s) as the defendant-health care providers about whose behavior the expert is attesting, clearly, the Legislature sought to ensure that the attesting experts are qualified to render an opinion about the defendant-health care providers\u2019 alleged departure from the standards of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The General Assembly stated that attesting health care providers \u201cmay not devote annually more than 20 percent,\u201d \u201cshall have had clinical experience,\u201d and \u201cshall be board certified in the same or a related specialty\u201d not that they must <em>attest </em>to the fact that they do not devote annually more than 20 percent, have the same clinical experience and are board certified in the same field as the defendant. I would therefore decline to hold that the General Assembly intended for such statements to be included in the Certificate and that without such statements, the claim must be dismissed on the ground that the Certificate is deficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">We explained in <em>Debbas v. Nelson, </em>389 Md. 364, 383, 885 A.2d 802, 814 (2005) that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-7\">[t]he strictly limited time period provided for securing a valid Certificate ... demonstrates the General Assembly\u2019s intention that the findings and opinions contained therein would be preliminary. To interpret the statute otherwise might effectively preclude many malpractice suits from ever proceeding on the merits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Parties can instead obtain this information through discovery. As stated by the Maryland Trial Lawyers Association, which filed an Amicus Curiae brief, \u201ca simple interrogatory would discover the information that [Dr.] Konits asks to be amended into \u00a7 3-2A-04(b), and ..., under \u00a7 3-2A-04(b)(3)(ii), such discovery always was contemplated by the Legislature.\u201d <em>See </em>Md.Code (1974, 2002 RepLVol., 2006 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7 3\u20142A.\u201404(b)(3)(ii) of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article (stating that \u201c[discovery is available as to the basis of the [Certificate\u201d). As we stated in <em>Koons Ford v. Lobach, </em>398 Md. 38, 62-63, 919 A.2d 722, 737 (2007):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>If [the Legislature] intended otherwise, then it certainly had, and still has, the ability to say so. As we have previously explained, however, \u201c[i]t is not the task of the Judiciary to rewrite the Statute____The court\u2019s charge in interpreting a statute is to determine the intent of the Legislature, not to insert language to change the meaning of a statute.\u201d <em>Walzer, </em>395 Md. at 584-85, 911 A.2d at 439-40 (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">I would conclude that the information regarding the attesting expert\u2019s professional attributes is not required to be contained in the Certificate. That is, a claimant can get into court without it; however, I stress that it would be the better practice to include such information in the Certificate so that claimants can avoid unnecessary challenges to the qualifications of the person who submitted the document. Moreover, if the attesting health care provider fails to meet these statutory professional requirements, it would appear that the claimant is not arbitrating in good faith,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as is required. <em>Karl v. </em>Davis, 100 Md.App. 42, 50, 639 A.2d 214, 218 (1994). The issue before us in this case, however, is what must be included within the four corners of the Certificate for it to be valid, not who is qualified to attest to a Certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Furthermore, Drs. Konits and Imoke argue that Mrs. Carroll\u2019s amended Certificate is incomplete because Dr. Simmons-Clemmons did not state that her opinions are based upon a reasonable degree of medical probability. Essentially, the doctors, by this contention, raise issues of admissibility and reliability with regard to the Certificate. Nothing in the language of the Health Care Malpractice Claims Statute, however, requires that such an assertion be made in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>Certificate. There exists a test for admitting into evidence an expert medical opinion. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 5-702 (addressing the testimony by experts at trial); <em>Trimble v. State, </em>300 Md. 387, 404, 478 A.2d 1143, 1151 (1984) (stating that the party seeking to elicit an opinion must establish that the witness is qualified to express it and that the trial judge must decide that issue as a preliminary matter of law). There also exists a requirement that the expert\u2019s opinion be held to a \u201creasonable degree of medical probability\u201d to ensure that the expert\u2019s opinion is more than speculation or conjecture. <em>See Karl, </em>100 Md.App. at 51-52, 639 A.2d at 219 (stating that \u201c[wjhile [an] expert opinion must be based upon more than mere speculation, it need not be expressed with absolute certainty----We have required expert opinions to be established within a reasonable degree of probability.\u201d) <em>See also Fink v. Steele, </em>166 Md. 354, 363, 171 A. 49, 53 (1934); <em>Charlton Bros. Transp. Co. v. Garrettson, </em>188 Md. 85, 94, 51 A.2d 642, 646 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Drs. Konits and Imoke also construe this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Walzer v. Osborne, </em>395 Md. 563, 911 A.2d 427 (2006), to mean that, in all circumstances, two separate documents must be filed\u2014a Certificate and an attesting expert report\u2014and that, because Dr. Simmons-Clemmons filed only one document, it is deficient. The Court said in <em>Walzer </em>that the expert\u2019s report must be attached to the Certificate. We based that conclusion on our reading of the statutory language of \u00a7 3-2A-04(b)(3)(i) that \u201c[t]he attorney representing each party, or the party proceeding pro se, shall file the appropriate certificate with a report of the attesting expert <em>attached\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">In this case, Mrs. Carroll failed to attach a separate document, an attesting expert report, to the Certificate that she submitted to the Health Care Alternative Dispute Resolution Office. Notwithstanding, as clarification of our decision in <em>Walzer, </em>and in response to the appellees\u2019 contention in this case, while it is clear that the Legislature intended for the attesting expert report to be attached to the Certificate, consistent with that statutory mandate, I see no reason why both documents may not comprise separate parts of a single document and thereby become incorporated into one docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>ment, just as a report attached to the Certificate, at the time of the initial filing, would be a complete certification.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting the Health Care Malpractice Claims Statute was to weed out non-meritorious claims by requiring claimants to submit certain information to the Health Care Alternative Dispute Resolution Office. There is no reason why an attesting expert report, or Certificate, if filed with the intent to incorporate a previously filed report or Certificate, or a Certificate containing a section that includes the attesting expert\u2019s report, is not a complete certification of merit, just as a report attached to the Certificate would be a complete certification. The essence of the statutory requirement is that the Certificate is not complete unless there is a timely certification and report filed in the Health Claims case.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">As the majority points out, we explained in <em>Walzer, </em>395 Md. at 583, 911 A.2d at 438-39, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-6\">the attesting expert report must explain how or why the physician failed or did not fail to meet the standard of care and include some details supporting the certificate of qualified expert____ Accordingly, the expert report should contain at least some additional information and should supplement the Certificate. Requiring an attesting expert to provide details, explaining how or why the defendant doctor allegedly departed from the standards of care, will help weed out non-meritorious claims and assist the plaintiff or defendant in evaluating the merit of the health claim____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">In <em>Walzer, </em>395 Md. at 568, 911 A.2d at 430, the attesting physician stated simply that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-10\">Based on my training, expertise and review of the records, it is my opinion that there were deviations from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>standards of care and said deviations were the proximate result of Claimant Keith Osborne\u2019s injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">In that case, the attesting physician failed to include any information about how the physician deviated from the standard of care and how the said deviations from the standard of care caused Mr. Osborne\u2019s injury; we therefore held that the Certificate was deficient because it lacked the information that would have constituted an attesting expert report. In this case, Dr. Simmons-Clemmons included enough information, in accordance with <em>Walzer, </em>within the four corners of her amended Certificate, thereby supplementing the certification consistent with the statutory requirements of \u00a7 3-2A-04(b) and \u00a7 3-2A-04(b)(3)(I). Although, for purposes of clarity, she could have titled the document, \u201cCertificate of Qualified Expert and Report,\u201d it amounts to our exalting form over substance to invalidate the Certificate because of that omission. In addition to stating that Drs. Konits and Imoke breached the applicable standard of care and that their breach caused Mrs. Carroll\u2019s injuries, Dr. Simmons-Clemmons stated that the physicians failed to communicate effectively with Mrs. Carroll, regarding the timely removal of the catheter, and that the physicians failed to remove the catheter in a timely manner. She explained that Mrs. Carroll received treatment that fell below the standard of care \u201cin regards to removal of the Hickman catheter after chemotherapy.\u201d I would therefore conclude that Dr. Simmons-Clemmons successfully satisfied, within one document, the statutory requirements of the Certificate and attesting expert report, as explicated by this Court in <em>Walzer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">I would also reject Drs. Konits and Imoke\u2019s contention that the Certificate must be a \u201cformal\u201d document, and not in letter form, as was the case here. Nowhere in the Health Care Malpractice Claims Statute does it require that the attesting expert\u2019s affirmations be contained in a \u201cformal\u201d document; the statute simply requires that the attesting health care provider specifically identify the health care provider about whom he or she is speaking, and that the certifying health care provider attest to the other health care provider\u2019s departure from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>standard of care and that such a departure proximately caused the plaintiffs injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">Therefore, I respectfully dissent. Chief Judge Bell authorizes me to state that he joins the views expressed in this dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b232-7\">. The majority recognizes that \"proximate cause\u201d is a legal term but states that \"[w]e do not think, however, that its meaning, in this context, is so obtuse that a person would need to spend a great deal of time studying the definition to understand its meaning.\u201d I agree with this statement. I disagree, however, that an affirmation from an attesting physician that a defendant-health care provider acted in such a way that makes clear that his or her conduct was the proximate cause of a plaintiff\u2019s alleged injury, fails to satisfy the statutory requirements simply because it fails to include the magic words, proximate cause. I believe that the substance of the statement is more important than the inclusion of the specific legal terminology or conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b233-5\">. Recently, in <em>Barber v. Catholic Health Initiatives, Inc., </em>174 Md.App. 314, 921 A.2d 811 (2007), the intermediate appellate court examined previous health care claims cases of this State, including this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Walzer, </em>and determined that the identity of the physicians who allegedly breached the standard of care must be discernable from the Certificate, and that a failure to do so will result in dismissal. In that case, the claimant named all twelve defendants in the original claim and defined them collectively as the \"Health Care Providers.\u201d The court determined that it was clear from the Certificate, about whom the physician was speaking, when the attesting physician explained that the \"Health Care Providers\u201d breached the standard of care. The court stated that \"[t]he Certificate cannot be analyzed in a vacuum; it must be considered in the context of the Statement of Claim that it supported, which had already been filed with the HCAO.\u201d The court noted, however, that \"[t]o be sure, if appellants had re-named in the Certificate each person or entity listed in the Statement of Claim, this appeal would have been avoided.\u201d <em>Barber, </em>174 Md.App. at 351, 921 A.2d at 833. I agree that the inclusion of the specific names is the better practice, as Dr. Simmons-Clemmons indicated in her amended Certificate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b236-9\">.
