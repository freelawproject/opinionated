The individual petitioners are officers and directors of Intracel Corporation. Two corporate entities affiliated with Intracel are also petitioners.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The petitioners argue that the Court of Special Appeals erred when it held that a cause of action for trespass may lie against them. The respondent is ARE Acquisitions, LLC, the owner of the leased premises. ARE argues that the officers and directors of Intracel, by \u201cleaving chattels on the premises after [their] right to be on the premises has expired,\u201d committed a trespass. We shall hold that no cause of action for trespass lies against the petitioners. The petitioners\u2019 actions do not amount to a trespass under Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">ARE\u2019s predecessor, as landlord, and Intracel, as tenant, were parties to a ten year lease entered into on January 15, 1997, of a building in Rockville, Maryland. In June 1997, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>ARE purchased the property and thus became the landlord under the lease. Intracel, as tenant, was a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the business of developing vaccines and other products for the treatment of various diseases. Intracel used the property for its office and laboratory. The equipment and materials utilized by Intracel were typical in the biopharmaceutical industry and included biological agents, radioactive material, various chemicals including acids, lacquer thinner, oxygen, argon, cagewashing detergent and sodium hydroxide. In addition, Intracel used incinerators, irradiators, syringes, and other equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">In 1998, Intracel was suffering financial difficulties. By September 2000, Intracel stopped paying rent in a timely manner and defaulted under the lease. ARE agreed to give Intracel additional time to cure its default under the lease and to refrain from evicting Intracel during the additional time period. Intracel, however, failed to cure its default and by early 2001 owed ARE a rental arrearage in excess of $400,000. On April 4, 2001, ARE notified Intracel that the lease was terminated effective April 19, 2001, and that Intracel was required to vacate the premises by that date. Intracel requested and was granted additional time to complete its move and ultimately vacated the premises by April 30, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">ARE contended that Intracel\u2019s officers and directors committed a trespass because, when they vacated the property, Intracel\u2019s officers and directors \u201cleft the Premises in disarray, abandoning large quantities of unwanted hazardous waste and contaminated materials, including but not limited to biological agents, radioactive materials and dangerous chemicals at the Premises.\u201d ARE alleged that, because it \u201cdid not know what all the materials were, and because some were obviously chemically hazardous, biohazardous, or radioactive, the condition of the building posed a risk to ARE\u2019s employees, other tenants, any new tenant, and the general public.\u201d In July 2001, ARE hired a contractor to clean up the materials left behind by Intracel. Intracel filed a bankruptcy petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>on September 12, 2001, and ARE was one of the largest unsecured creditors in the bankruptcy action.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">In September 2002, ARE instituted this action in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, seeking both compensatory and punitive damages. The operative pleading is ARE\u2019s second amended complaint, filed on March 18, 2004. In that complaint, ARE named seven of Intracel\u2019s officers and directors as defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Intracel itself was not a defendant. ARE also included as defendants Intracel Acquisition Holding Company, LLC (IAHC) and Dublind Partners, Inc. According to the second amended complaint, IAHC was a company set up and controlled by the individual defendants \u201cto acquire Intracel, control its operations, and protect IAHC\u2019s investment in Intracel.\u201d ARE alleged that Dublind Partners, Inc. was \u201cset up and controlled by Defendants Lindsay and Dubroff, [and] controlled IAHC and Intracel\u2019s operations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The second amended complaint included several alleged causes of action, including, <em>inter alia, </em>trespass, tortious interference with contract, \u201caiding and abetting trespass,\u201d waste, negligence, and \u201caiding and abetting waste.\u201d The only asserted cause of action which remains in the case is trespass. In its second amended complaint, ARE claimed that the defendants \u201cdirected, were aware of, and participated in the conduct of Intracel which caused waste and contaminated materials to be deposited, abandoned and strewn about the Premises, which ... constituted an unauthorized entry to the Premises.\u201d In addition, ARE asserted in the trespass count that \u201cDefendants Dublind, IAHC, Nardin, Durbroff, Lindsay, Fox, Hanna and Swindle controlled the cash flow of Intracel and refused to authorize the payment of the funds necessary to remove the hazardous waste and materials and restore the Premises to its proper condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The Circuit Court for Montgomery County granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss all the counts in the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>amended complaint except those relating to trespass and waste, and to dismiss the request for punitive damages. Thereafter, ARE filed a motion for summary judgment on the trespass count, and the Circuit Court denied the motion. The defendants then filed a motion for summary judgment on the remaining counts, submitting transcripts of depositions, interrogatories and answers to the interrogatories. After reviewing the material and holding a hearing on the motion, the Circuit Court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the remaining counts which related to trespass and waste.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">ARE appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, arguing that the Circuit Court erred in dismissing the negligence count and the request for punitive damages. ARE also contended that the grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the trespass and waste counts was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the Circuit Court\u2019s rulings on all counts except the trespass count. In holding that the Circuit Court erred in granting summary judgment as to trespass, the intermediate appellate court chiefly relied on the Restatement (Second) of Torts. The pertinent sections of the Restatement provide as follows (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-7\">\u201c \u00a7 158. Liability for Intentional Intrusions on Land</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-8\">One is subject to liability to another for trespass, irrespective of whether he thereby causes harm to any legally protected interest of the other, if he intentionally</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-9\">(a) enters the land in the possession of the other, or causes a thing or a third person to do so, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-10\">(b) remains on the land, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-11\">(c) <em>fails to remove from the land a thing which he is under a duty to remove.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b680-12\"><em>\u201c </em>\u00a7 161. Failure to Remove Thing Tortiously Placed on Land</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>(1) A trespass may be committed by the continued presence on the land of a structure, chattel, or other thing which the actor has tortiously placed there, whether or not the actor has the ability to remove it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-4\">(2) A trespass may be committed by the continued presence on the land of a structure, chattel, or other thing which the actor\u2019s predecessor in legal interest therein has tortiously placed there, if the actor, having acquired his legal interest in the thing with knowledge of such tortious conduct or having thereafter learned of it, fails to remove the thing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The Court of Special Appeals concluded that \u00a7 158(c) was the section which covers the present case. In reaching this conclusion, the intermediate appellate court distinguished this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rosenblatt v. Exxon, </em>335 Md. 58, 642 A.2d 180 (1994). <em>Rosenblatt </em>involved circumstances somewhat similar to those in the present ease. In <em>Rosenblatt, </em>a tenant of commercial property, upon termination of the lease, vacated the property but allegedly left behind \u201ctoxic chemicals\u201d which \u201ccontaminated\u201d the property. This Court in <em>Rosenblatt </em>emphasized that \u201cwe have never recognized a trespass where the thing which intrudes actually entered the land during the \u2018trespasser\u2019s\u2019 possession and the plaintiff took possession of the land subsequent to the \u2018intrusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rosenblatt, </em>335 Md. at 78, 642 A.2d at 189. The <em>Rosenblatt </em>opinion next discussed the Restatement and held that \u00a7 161 did not apply in that case because it \u201cexplicitly provides that a trespass involves the <em>tortious placing </em>of something on the land and implicitly provides that the affected land is the land <em>of </em>another 335 Md. at 78, 642 A.2d at 190. The Court then quoted language from \u00a7 158 of the Restatement to \u201cfurther support[ ] this interpretation.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Specifically, this Court quoted the language stating that \u201c \u2018[o]ne is subject to liability to another for trespass ... if he intentionally ... (c) fails to remove from the land a thing which he is under a duty to remove.\u2019 \u201d 335 Md. at 78-79, 642 A.2d at 190. The <em>Rosenblatt </em>opinion then held that a tenant \u201cowed ... no duty to remove the contamination.\u201d 335 Md. at 79, 642 A.2d at 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>In distinguishing <em>Rosenblatt, </em>the Court of Special Appeals in the case at bar acknowledged that this Court\u2019s statement, that \u201cwe have never recognized a trespass where the thing which intrudes actually entered the land during the \u2018trespasser\u2019s\u2019 possession and the plaintiff took possession of the land subsequent to the intrusion,\u201d appeared to support the grant of summary judgment. According to the Court of Special Appeals, however, those words should be read only to \u201cexplain[ ] why Section 161 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts was inapplicable\u201d in <em>Rosenblatt. </em>The intermediate appellate court in the present case, turning to \u00a7 158 of the Restatement, went on to hold that the \u201cno duty\u201d language in <em>Rosenblatt </em>should be limited to the situation where the plaintiff was a successor lessee as in <em>Rosenblatt, </em>but that in the present case \u201cno \u2018successor lessee\u2019 is involved.\u201d Consequently, the Court of Special Appeals could \u201csee no reason why Section 158(c) would not be applicable to Intraeel.\u201d The appellate court reversed the judgment \u201cas to the trespass count\u201d and affirmed with respect to all other counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">The defendants filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari, challenging the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 reversal on the trespass count. ARE filed a conditional cross-petition for a writ of certiorari, contending that the Court of Special Appeals erred in affirming the dismissal of the negligence count and the dismissal of the claim for punitive damages. ARE also raised a procedural issue in the event that the case was remanded to the Circuit Court for further proceedings. This Court granted the defendants\u2019 petition and denied ARE\u2019s conditional cross-petition. <em>Hanna v. ARE, </em>396 Md. 9, 912 A.2d 646 (2006). Consequently, as previously indicated, the only issue remaining in the case is whether there exists a cause of action for trespass under the circumstances here.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The petitioners\u2019 argument is that <em>Rosenblatt v. Exxon, supra, </em>335 Md. 58, 642 A.2d 180, is dispositive and mandates a reversal of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decision on the trespass count. According to the petitioners, <em>Rosenblatt </em>held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>that \u201ca possessor of land under a lease (Intracel) cannot be ... [held liable for] trespass by a subsequent possessor (ARE) for having left materials behind; the \u2018intrusion\u2019 occurred during the lawful possession of the property by the tenant.\u201d (Petitioners\u2019 brief in this Court at 12). The respondent, agreeing with the Court of Special Appeals, argues that <em>\u201cRosenblatt </em>does not apply because it deals with a tenant\u2019s liability to a subsequent tenant, not its landlord.\u201d (Respondent\u2019s brief in this Court at 11). The respondent also contends that <em>Rosenblatt </em>is distinguishable because it involved materials left in the property\u2019s \u201csubsurface\u201d and \u201csubsurface contamination,\u201d whereas the present case involved \u201chazardous materials inside ARE\u2019s building.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 13-14).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">We agree with the petitioners that <em>Rosenblatt v. Exxon, supra, </em>335 Md. at 78-79, 642 A.2d at 189-190, is dispositive. An examination of this Court\u2019s unanimous <em>Rosenblatt </em>opinion, authored by former Chief Judge Robert C. Murphy, demonstrates that there is no meaningful distinction between <em>Rosenblatt </em>and the case at bar with regard to the trespass claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">The facts of the <em>Rosenblatt </em>case were as follows. Exxon Company, U.S.A., had leased a parcel of property from its owner from 1951 to 1985. Exxon then subleased the property to successive independent operators to use as a gasoline station during that period. Exxon installed gasoline storage tanks on the property, and the tanks remained on the property until the termination of Exxon\u2019s lease in 1985. In 1986, the owner leased the same parcel of property to Mr. Rosenblatt who intended to construct and operate a \u201cGrease-N-Go\u201d automotive quick lubrication business. After leasing the property, Rosenblatt requested an environmental assessment of the property which revealed extensive amounts of petroleum remaining on the property. The petroleum had contaminated the property\u2019s soil and groundwater. As a result of the contamination, the Maryland Department of the Environment informed Rosenblatt that he could continue with the construction of his \u201cGrease-N-Go\u201d facility but that those efforts would have to be coordinated with Exxon\u2019s remediation efforts. Rosenblatt subsequently filed suit against Exxon and the prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>sublessees, seeking economic loss damages including expenses incurred as a result of the contamination. Rosenblatt\u2019s complaint included causes of action based on strict liability, negligence, trespass, and nuisance. After some preliminary skirmishes in both the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County and the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, the defendants filed in the Circuit Court motions for summary judgment. The Circuit Court granted the motions; Rosenblatt appealed, and this Court issued a writ of certiorari prior to any proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">In affirming the judgment in <em>Rosenblatt, </em>this Court dealt separately with each of the four asserted causes of action. Chief Judge Murphy for the Court began the discussion of the trespass count as follows <em>(Rosenblatt, </em>385 Md. at 78, 642 A.2d at 189):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-5\">\n<em>\u201cThe Trespass Claim</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\">\u201cWhen a defendant interferes with a plaintiffs interest in the exclusive possession of the land by entering or causing something to enter the land, a trespass occurs.\u201d <em>See Rockland Bleach &amp; Dye Works Co. v. H.J. Williams Corp., Inc., </em>242 Md. 375, 385, 219 A.2d 48 (1966).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-7\">\u201cWe have recognized that a trespass occurs when there is interference in the exclusive possession of the land of another, <em>see Rockland supra, </em>but we have never recognized a trespass where the thing which intrudes actually entered the land during the \u2018trespasser\u2019s\u2019 possession and the plaintiff took possession of the land subsequent to the \u2018intrusion.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">Contrary to the view of the Court of Special Appeals, this controlling principle, that Maryland law does not recognize a trespass cause of action when the \u201cthing which intrudes\u201d enters the land during the alleged \u201ctrespasser\u2019s\u201d possession, was not set forth as part of a discussion of the Restatement (Second) of Torts. After setting forth the controlling principle, the Court\u2019s opinion then turned to the plaintiff Rosenblatt\u2019s reliance upon \u00a7 161 of the Restatement. The <em>Rosen</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number><em>blatt </em>opinion considered \u00a7 161 together with \u00a7 158, saying (335 Md. at 78-79, 642 A.2d at 190, emphasis in original):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeI\">\u201cSection 161 does not support Rosenblatt\u2019s position. It explicitly provides that a trespass involves the <em>tortious placing </em>of something on the land and implicitly provides that the affected land is the land <em>of another. </em>Section 158 further supports this interpretation. It states that \u2018one is subject to liability to another for trespass ... if he intentionally enters land <em>in the possession of the other, </em>or causes a thing or a third person to do so, or remains on the land, or fails to remove from the land a thing which he is under a duty to remove.\u2019 (emphasis added). Exxon did not cause the contamination to occur during Rosenblatt\u2019s occupancy; the introduction of the contamination could only have occurred prior to its relinquishing possession of the land. Additionally, Exxon owed Rosenblatt no duty to remove the contamination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">The trespass holding in <em>Rosenblatt </em>is directly on point. It cannot be validly distinguished on the grounds relied upon by the Court of Special Appeals and the respondent ARE. The governing principle, that there is no trespass \u201cwhere the thing which intrudes actually entered the land during\u201d the alleged trespasser\u2019s lawful possession, was not set forth as an answer to the plaintiffs reliance on \u00a7 161 of the Restatement. The Court thereafter answered the argument based on \u00a7 161 by pointing out that, for liability under the section, there must be a <em>\u201ctortious placing </em>of something on the land\u201d and the \u201caffected land\u201d must be \u201cthe land <em>of another.\u201d Rosenblatt, </em>335 Md. at 78, 642 A.2d at 190. Moreover, the <em>Rosenblatt </em>opinion simply used \u00a7 158 of the Restatement to \u201cfurther support[ ] this interpretation\u201d of \u00a7 161. It treated the sections as somewhat interrelated, rather than wholly separate and distinct as suggested by the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">The <em>Rosenblatt </em>holding, that Exxon did not commit a trespass by failing to remove the contaminating petroleum, was not in any manner limited to an action by a successor lessee against the former tenant. The entire portion of the <em>Rosenblatt </em>opinion dealing with the trespass count does not even use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>the terms \u201clessee,\u201d \u201csuccessor lessee,\u201d or \u201clessor.\u201d Instead, it refers to a party\u2019s \u201coccupancy of the land\u201d or \u201cpossession\u201d of the land or \u201csubsequent occupier.\u201d One of the two cases from other jurisdictions which <em>Rosenblatt </em>relied on, <em>Wellesley Hills Realty v. Mobil Oil Corp., </em>747 F.Supp. 93, 99 (D.Mass.1990), was an action by the current owner of the land. It was not an action by a successor lessee.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For other cases where the plaintiff was not a successor lessee, <em>see, e.g., 55 Motor Avenue Company v. Liberty Industrial Finishing Corp., </em>885 F.Supp. 410, 423-424 (E.D.N.Y.1994) (Trespass action by the landowner against the former occupier of the land which, upon termination of the occupation, left behind materials contaminating the property, and the court, relying upon <em>Rosenblatt v. Exxon, supra, </em>held that there is no trespass when the contaminating materials were placed on the property \u201cwhile the defendants were lawful occupants of the premises\u201d); <em>Graham Oil Company v. BP Oil Company, 885 </em>F.Supp. 716, 725-727 (W.D.Pa.1994) (The landlord brought a trespass action against its former tenant for leaving behind contaminating material at the termination of the lease, and the court held that, because the alleged trespass \u201coccurred during the lease term,\u201d the owner \u201cshould not be permitted to recover in its action for trespass\u201d); <em>Hanlin Group, Inc. v. International Minerals &amp; Chemical Corporation, </em>759 F.Supp. 925, 937 (D.Maine 1990) (Trespass action by the subsequent owner against the prior owner of the property, and the court held that trespass would not lie because the intruding chemicals were placed on the property during the defendant\u2019s lawful occupation); <em>Taco Cabana, Inc. v. Exxon Corp., 5 </em>S.W.3d 773, 780 (Tex.App.1999) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>(Trespass action by the property owner against the former tenant of the prior owner, and the court took the position that a trespass action could not be maintained because the former tenant had no duty under state law to remove the intrusive material at the termination of the lease); <em>U.P. C., Inc. v. R.O.A General, Inc., </em>990 P.2d 945, 953-955 (Utah App.1999) (The owner of land brought a trespass action against the former tenant, arguing that, upon termination of the lease, the former tenant should have removed the foundation for a sign, but the court held that there was no trespass because the former tenant had no duty to remove the sign).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Finally, there is no merit in the respondent\u2019s attempt to distinguish, for purposes of trespass actions, between chemical materials left in containers on the surface of the property and chemical materials which permeate the soil and groundwater of the property. Neither <em>Rosenblatt </em>nor any of the other cases cited above make such a distinction. The language of <em>Rosenblatt, </em>335 Md. at 78, 642 A.2d at 189-190, referring to the \u201cthing which intrudes\u201d and the \u201cplacing of something on the land,\u201d negates such a distinction. Furthermore, we are aware of no public policy which would support trespass liability when contaminating chemicals are left in containers on the property\u2019s surface but would not support trespass liability when contaminating chemicals are left in the soil and contaminate the underground water supply. If a distinction were warranted on public policy grounds, it would be opposite to the one urged by the respondent.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>This Court\u2019s decision in <em>Rosenblatt v. Exxon </em>makes it clear that, when materials are left on real property at the conclusion of the defendant\u2019s lawful possession of the property, there is no cause of action in trespass if the materials entered the land before or during the defendant\u2019s lawful possession. The Circuit Court correctly applied this principle when it granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the trespass count.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS ON THE TRESPASS COUNT REVERSED.

It is noteworthy that, in the portion of the <em>Rosenblatt </em>opinion dealing with the negligence count, 335 Md. at 76-78, 642 A.2d at 188-189, the Court does refer to \"lessees\u201d and \"successor lessees.\u201d While the opinion does not specifically draw a distinction between the possible negligence liability of the defendant to the owner, in contrast to the defendant\u2019s non-liability to a successor lessee, there is language in the negligence section of <em>Rosenblatt </em>which arguably might support such a distinction. We express no opinion as to the merits of such an argument. In the trespass section of the <em>Rosenblatt </em>opinion, however, which immediately follows the negligence section, the Court used no language which might support such a distinction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b687-6\">. Both the Court of Special Appeals and the respondent cited this Court's decision in <em>Metromedia v. WCBM Maryland, </em>327 Md. 514, 610 A.2d 791 (1992), in support of their position that the petitioners\u2019 action in leaving materials on the premises constituted a trespass. This reliance on <em>Metromedia </em>is misplaced. <em>Metromedia </em>was not a trespass action, and it did not involve a tenant\u2019s leaving materials on the premises when the tenant vacated the premises. <em>Metromedia </em>was an ejectment action by an out-of-possession sub-sublessor against the corporate sub-sublessee and its chief executive officer, both of whom had refused to vacate the premises after the termination of the sub-sublease. The plaintiff sought possession of the property and damages. The parties to the appellate proceedings in this Court were the sub-s\u00fcblessor and the chief executive officer; the sub-sublessee was not a party in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Court. The contested issue in this Court was whether the chief executive officer could be held personally liable for the actions of the corporation. There was no issue concerning the scope or nature of an action of trespass <em>quare clausum fregit. </em>For a discussion of the differences between trespass <em>quare clausum fregit </em>and ejectment, <em>see </em>I John Prentiss Poe, <em>Pleading and Practice in Courts of Common Law, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 242-250, 256-275 (3d ed. 1897).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
